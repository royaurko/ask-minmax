In this work we study an existence and multiplicity result for the following
prescribed mean-curvature problem with critical growth $$
\left\{\begin{array}{rl}
  -\mbox{div}\biggl(\frac{\nabla u}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla u|^{2}}}\biggl) = \lambda
|u|^{q-2}u+ |u|^{2^*-2}u & \mbox{in $\Omega$} u = 0 & \mbox{on $\partial
\Omega$}, \end{array} \right. $$ where $\Omega$ is a bounded smooth domain of
$\mathbb{R}^{N}$, $N\geq 3$ and $1 < q<2$. In order to employ variational
arguments, we consider an auxiliary problem which is proved to have infinitely
many solutions by genus theory. A clever estimate in the gradient of the
solutions of the modified problem is necessary to recover solutions of the
original one.
