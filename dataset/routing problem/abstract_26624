Image sequences filtering have recently become a very important technical
problem especially with the advent of new technology in multimedia and video
systems applications. Often image sequences are corrupted by some amount of
noise introduced by the image sensor and therefore inherently present in the
imaging process. The main problem in the image sequences is how to deal with
spatio-temporal and non stationary signals. In this paper, we propose a robust
method for noise removal of image sequence based on coupled spatial and
temporal anisotropic diffusion. The idea is to achieve an adaptive smoothing in
both spatial and temporal directions, by solving a nonlinear diffusion
equation. This allows removing noise while preserving all spatial and temporal
discontinuities
