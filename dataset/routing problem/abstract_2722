Developing graphene-based nanoelectronics hinges on opening a band gap in the
electronic structure of graphene, which is commonly achieved by breaking the
inversion symmetry of the graphene lattice via an electric field (gate bias) or
asymmetric doping of graphene layers. Here we introduce a new design strategy
that places a bilayer graphene sheet sandwiched between two cladding layers of
materials that possess strong spin-orbit coupling (e.g., Bi2Te3). Our ab initio
and tight-binding calculations show that proximity enhanced spin-orbit coupling
effect opens a large (44 meV) band gap in bilayer graphene without breaking its
lattice symmetry, and the band gap can be effectively tuned by interlayer
stacking pattern and significantly enhanced by interlayer compression. The
feasibility of this quantum-well structure is demonstrated by recent
experimental realization of high-quality heterojunctions between graphene and
Bi2Te3, and this design also conforms to existing fabrication techniques in the
semiconductor industry. The proposed quantum-well structure is expected to be
especially robust since it does not require an external power supply to open
and maintain a band gap, and the cladding layers provide protection against
environmental degradation of the graphene layer in its device applications.
