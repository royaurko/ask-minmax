In the Proper Interval Completion problem we are given a graph G and an
integer k, and the task is to turn G using at most k edge additions into a
proper interval graph, i.e., a graph admitting an intersection model of
equal-length intervals on a line. The study of Proper Interval Completion from
the viewpoint of parameterized complexity has been initiated by Kaplan, Shamir
and Tarjan [FOCS 1994; SIAM J. Comput. 1999], who showed an algorithm for the
problem working in $O(16^k (n + m))$ time. In this paper we present an
algorithm with running time $k^{O(k^{2/3})} + O(nm(kn + m))$, which is the
first subexponential parameterized algorithm for Proper Interval Completion.
