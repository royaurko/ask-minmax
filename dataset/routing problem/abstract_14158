We propose a renormalizable supersymmetric SO(10) model where the
doublet-triplet splitting problem is solved using the Dimopoulos-Wilczek
mechanism. An unwanted coupling is forbidden through a filter sector. To
suppress proton decay without spoiling gauge coupling unification, there is a
problem in the weak doublets which requires further improvements.
