The problem of backward dynamics over the ring of p-adic integers is studied.
It is shown that Inverse Limit Theory provides the right framework. Backward
iterations of a polynomial with p-adic integer coefficients are constructed by
solving congruences modulo powers of p, which inturn are solved by Hensel's
lifting lemma.
