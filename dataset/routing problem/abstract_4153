In this paper, we show that under certain conditions on the coefficients and
initial values, solutions of two different Bernoulli initial-value problems are
symmetric to each other either with respect to the t-axis, or the y-axis, or
the origin. This knowledge of symmetry is very useful since solving one
Bernoulli problem solves automatically the other. To the best of our knowledge,
this interesting property has not been described in any other papers.
