We present an integer programming model for the ferry scheduling problem,
improving existing models in various ways. In particular, our model has reduced
size in terms of the number of variables and constraints compared to existing
models by a factor of approximately O(n), where n being the number of ports.
The model also handles efficiently load/unload time constraints, crew
scheduling and passenger transfers. Experiments using real world data produced
high quality solutions in 12 hours using CPLEX 12.4 with a performance
guarantee of within 15% of optimality, on average. This establishes that using
a general purpose integer programming solver is a viable alternative in solving
the ferry scheduling problem of moderate size.
