Galaxies exhibit a variety of non-axisymmetric structure (bars, spiral
structure, lopsided structure, etc.). These suggest the following general
problem: what are the possible stationary configurations of a two-dimensional
self-gravitating fluid other than an axisymmetric razor-thin disc? We address a
modest component of this problem: we seek non-axisymmetric razor-thin discs of
two-dimensional barotropic fluid that are stationary in an inertial frame. We
distinguish between `razor-thin' and `two-dimensional,' applying the latter
term to the equation of state. Furthermore we assume that our systems are
scale-free, which reduces the partial differential equations describing the
system to ordinary differential equations. We also allow for the presence of an
axisymmetric background potential. This simple and highly idealized problem
already exhibits a rich variety of solutions, the richest being for m=1
symmetry.
