We point out the connection between mathematical knot theory and spin
glass/search problem. In particular, we present a statistical mechanical
formulation of the problem of computing a knot invariant; p-colorability
problem, which provides an algorithm to find the solution. The method also
allows one to get some deeper insight into the structural complexity of knots,
which is expected to be related with the landscape structure of constraint
satisfaction problem.
