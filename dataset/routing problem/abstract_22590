One of the remaining issues in the problems of dwarf novae is whether or not
enhanced mass transfer due to irradiation of the secondary stars could occur
during outbursts. In a previous paper (Osaki and Meyer 2003), we presented a
theoretical analysis that shows no appreciable enhancement of the mass outflow
rate. This conclusion is challenged by Smak (2004) who claims that equations
used in our analysis were incorrect and that in systems with short orbital
periods substantial enhancement could occur. In this letter, we examine the
origin of such divergent conclusions. We show that Smak's solutions are
unacceptable from the standpoint of the equation of continuity and that our
analysis is an appropriate one to treat this problem.
