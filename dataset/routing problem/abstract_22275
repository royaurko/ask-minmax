The problem of a particle localized in a ultra-short potential in one
dimension is considered. By proposing a general solution to Schrodinger;s
equation we show that the energy spectra and the probability of the particle
have definite bounds for an arbitrary ultra-short potential. These results are
relevant for the confinement of particles in nanodevices.
