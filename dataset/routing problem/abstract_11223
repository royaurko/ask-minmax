We analyze the problem of parameter estimation for compact binary systems
that could be detected by ground-based gravitational wave detectors.
  So far this problem has only been dealt with for the inspiral and the
ringdown phases separately. In this paper, we combine the information from both
signals, and we study the improvement in parameter estimation, at a fixed
signal-to-noise ratio, by including the ringdown signal without making any
assumption on the merger phase. The study is performed for both initial and
advanced LIGO and VIRGO detectors.
