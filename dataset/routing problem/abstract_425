In estimating frequencies given that the signal waveforms are undersampled
multiple times, Xia and his collaborators proposed to use a generalized version
of Chinese remainder Theorem (CRT), where the moduli are $dm_1, dm_2, \cdots,
dm_k$ with $m_1, m_2, \cdots, m_k$ being pairwise coprime. If the errors of the
corrupted remainders are within $\frac{d}4$, their schemes are able to
construct an approximation of the solution to the generalized CRT with an error
smaller than $\frac{d}4$. One of the critical ingredients in their approach is
the clever idea of accurately finding the quotients. In this paper, we present
two treatments of this problem. The first treatment follows the route of Wang
and Xia to find the quotients, but with a simplified process. The second
treatment takes a different approach by working on the corrupted remainders
directly. This approach also reveals some useful information about the
remainders by inspecting extreme values of the erroneous remainders modulo $d$.
Both of our treatments produce efficient algorithms with essentially optimal
performance. This paper also provides a proof of the sharpness of the error
bound $\frac{d}4$.
