We extend the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) framework to the analysis of
first-order hyperbolic and advection-dominated problems posed on implicitly
defined surfaces. The focus will be on the hyperbolic part, which is
discretised using a "discrete surface" generalisation of the jump-stabilised
upwind flux. A key issue arising in the analysis (which does not appear in the
planar setting) is the treatment of the discrete velocity field, choices of
which play an important role in the stability of the scheme. We then prove
optimal error estimates in an appropriate norm given a number of assumptions on
the discrete velocity field, which are then investigated and discussed in more
detail. The theoretical results are verified numerically for a number of test
problems exhibiting advection-dominated behaviour.
