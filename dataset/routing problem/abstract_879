We introduce BruNet, a general P2P software framework which we use to produce
the first implementation of Symphony, a 1-D Kleinberg small-world architecture.
Our framework is designed to easily implement and measure different P2P
protocols over different transport layers such as TCP or UDP. This paper
discusses our implementation of the Symphony network, which allows each node to
keep $k \le \log N$ shortcut connections and to route to any other node with a
short average delay of $O(\frac{1}{k}\log^2 N)$. %This provides a continuous
trade-off between node degree and routing latency. We present experimental
results taken from several PlanetLab deployments of size up to 1060 nodes.
These succes sful deployments represent some of the largest PlanetLab
deployments of P2P overlays found in the literature, and show our
implementation's robustness to massive node dynamics in a WAN environment.
