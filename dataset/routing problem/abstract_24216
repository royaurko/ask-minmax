This paper proposes consistent estimators for transformation parameters in
semiparametric models. The problem is to find the optimal transformation into
the space of models with a predetermined regression structure like additive or
multiplicative separability. We give results for the estimation of the
transformation when the rest of the model is estimated non- or
semi-parametrically and fulfills some consistency conditions. We propose two
methods for the estimation of the transformation parameter: maximizing a
profile likelihood function or minimizing the mean squared distance from
independence. First the problem of identification of such models is discussed.
We then state asymptotic results for a general class of nonparametric
estimators. Finally, we give some particular examples of nonparametric
estimators of transformed separable models. The small sample performance is
studied in several simulations.
