We study the average case complexity of multivariate integration and $L_2$
function approximation for the class $F=C([0,1]^d)$ of continuous functions of
$d$ variables. The class $F$ is endowed with the isotropic Wiener measure
(Brownian motion in Levy's sense). Furthermore, for both problems, only
function values are used as data.
