A review of the present state of investigations of the pseudospin-electron
model (PEM), which is used in the theory of strongly correlated electron
systems, is given. The model is used to describe the systems with the locally
anharmonic elements of structure represented in the model by pseudospins. The
consideration is based on the dynamical mean field theory approach and the
generalized random phase approximation. Electron spectrum and thermodynamics of
the model are investigated; the cases of the simplified model, the model with
strong interaction and the two-sublattice model are studied more in detail. The
phase transitions into other uniform or modulated states as well as
superconducting phases are described; the criteria of their realization are
established. Based on this, the description of structural and dielectric
(ferroelectric type) instabilities, phase separation and bistability phenomena
is given. A comparison is made with the thermodynamics of the Falicov-Kimball
model (which can be considered as a particular case of PEM). The possibility of
applying the PEM to the analysis of thermodynamics of the real HTSC systems is
discussed. Attention is paid to the unsolved problems in the study of PEM.
