We study minimal surfaces which arise in wetting and capillarity phenomena.
Using conformal coordinates, we reduce the problem to a set of coupled boundary
equations for the contact line of the fluid surface, and then derive simple
diagrammatic rules to calculate the non-linear corrections to the Joanny-de
Gennes energy. We argue that perturbation theory is quasi-local, i.e. that all
geometric length scales of the fluid container decouple from the
short-wavelength deformations of the contact line. This is illustrated by a
calculation of the linearized interaction between contact lines on two opposite
parallel walls. We present a simple algorithm to compute the minimal surface
and its energy based on these ideas. We also point out the intriguing
singularities that arise in the Legendre transformation from the pure Dirichlet
to the mixed Dirichlet-Neumann problem.
