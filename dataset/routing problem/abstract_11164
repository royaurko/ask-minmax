This is an elementary introduction to exterior differential systems motivated
by two examples: minimal submanifolds and the isometric embedding problem. The
two main goals of the lectures are: 1. To explain how to find an appropriate
geometric setting for studying a given system of pde. 2. To explain the Cartan
algorithm to determine the moduli space of local solutions to any given
exterior differential system and an appropriate initial value problem for the
system.
