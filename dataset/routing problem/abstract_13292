In this work we look for central configurations of the planar 1 + n body
problem such that, after the addition of one or two satellites, we have a new
planar central configuration. We determine all such configurations in two
cases: the first, the addition of two satellites considering that all
satellites have equal infinitesimal masses and the second case where one
satellite is added but the infinitesimal masses are not necessarily equal.
