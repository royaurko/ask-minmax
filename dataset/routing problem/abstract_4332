We consider conditions for uniqueness of the solution of the Dirichlet or the
Neumann problem for 2-dimensional wave equation inside of bi-quadratic
algebraic curve. We show that the solution is non-trivial if and only if
corresponding Poncelet problem for two conics associated with the curve has
periodic trajectory and if and only if corresponding Pell-Abel equation has a
solution.
