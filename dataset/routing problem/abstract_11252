In the gauge-invariant construction of abelian chiral gauge theories on the
lattice based on the Ginsparg-Wilson relation, the gauge anomaly is topological
and its cohomologically trivial part plays the role of the local counter term.
We give a prescription to solve the local cohomology problem within a finite
lattice by reformulating the Poincar\'e lemma so that it holds true on the
finite lattice up to exponentially small corrections. We then argue that the
path-integral measure of Weyl fermions can be constructed directly from the
quantities defined on the finite lattice.
