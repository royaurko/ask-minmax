In this paper, we study the problem of finding the largest possible set of s
points and s blocks in a Steiner triple system of order v, such that that none
of the s points lie on any of the s blocks. We prove that s \leq (2v+5 -
\sqrt{24v+25})/2. We also show that equality can be attained in this bound for
infinitely many values of v.
