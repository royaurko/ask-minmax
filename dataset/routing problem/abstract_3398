We combine the well known Shortest Paths (SP) problem and the Bottleneck
Paths (BP) problem to introduce a new problem called the Shortest Paths for All
Flows (SP-AF) problem that has relevance in real life applications. We first
solve the Single Source Shortest Paths for All Flows (SSSP-AF) problem on
directed graphs with unit edge costs in $O(mn)$ worst case time bound. We then
present two algorithms to solve SSSP-AF on directed graphs with integer edge
costs bounded by $c$ in $O(m^2 + nc)$ and $O(m^2 + mn\log{(\frac{c}{m})})$ time
bounds. Finally we extend our algorithms for the SSSP-AF problem to solve the
All Pairs Shortest Paths for All Flows (APSP-AF) problem in $O(m^{2}n + nc)$
and $O(m^{2}n + mn^{2}\log{(\frac{c}{mn})})$ time bounds. All algorithms
presented in this paper are practical for implementation.
