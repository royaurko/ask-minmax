The computational complexity of a problem arising in the context of sparse
optimization is considered, namely, the projection onto the set of $k$-cosparse
vectors w.r.t. some given matrix $\Omeg$. It is shown that this projection
problem is (strongly) \NP-hard, even in the special cases in which the matrix
$\Omeg$ contains only ternary or bipolar coefficients. Interestingly, this is
in contrast to the projection onto the set of $k$-sparse vectors, which is
trivially solved by keeping only the $k$ largest coefficients.
