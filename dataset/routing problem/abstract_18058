In this paper we present the solver DuQuad specialized for solving general
convex quadratic problems arising in many engineering applications. When it is
difficult to project on the primal feasible set, we use the (augmented)
Lagrangian relaxation to handle the complicated constraints and then, we apply
dual first order algorithms based on inexact dual gradient information for
solving the corresponding dual problem. The iteration complexity analysis is
based on two types of approximate primal solutions: the primal last iterate and
an average of primal iterates. We provide computational complexity estimates on
the primal suboptimality and feasibility violation of the generated approximate
primal solutions. Then, these algorithms are implemented in the programming
language C in DuQuad, and optimized for low iteration complexity and low memory
footprint. DuQuad has a dynamic Matlab interface which make the process of
testing, comparing, and analyzing the algorithms simple. The algorithms are
implemented using only basic arithmetic and logical operations and are suitable
to run on low cost hardware. It is shown that if an approximate solution is
sufficient for a given application, there exists problems where some of the
implemented algorithms obtain the solution faster than state-of-the-art
commercial solvers.
