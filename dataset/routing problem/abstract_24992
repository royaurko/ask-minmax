We develop a new principal components analysis (PCA) type dimension reduction
method for binary data. Different from the standard PCA which is defined on the
observed data, the proposed PCA is defined on the logit transform of the
success probabilities of the binary observations. Sparsity is introduced to the
principal component (PC) loading vectors for enhanced interpretability and more
stable extraction of the principal components. Our sparse PCA is formulated as
solving an optimization problem with a criterion function motivated from a
penalized Bernoulli likelihood. A Majorization--Minimization algorithm is
developed to efficiently solve the optimization problem. The effectiveness of
the proposed sparse logistic PCA method is illustrated by application to a
single nucleotide polymorphism data set and a simulation study.
