Thermal modeling of complex systems faces the problems of an effective
digitalization of the detailed geometry and properties of the system,
calculation of the thermal flows and temperature maps, treatment of the thermal
radiation including possible multiple reflections, inclusion of additional
external influences, extraction of the radiation pressure from calculated
surface data, and computational effectiveness. In previous publications the
solution to these problems have been outlined and a first application to the
Pioneer spacecraft have been shown. Here we like to present the application of
our thermal modeling to the Rosetta flyby anomaly as well as to the Pioneer
anomaly. The analysis outlines that thermal recoil pressure is not the cause of
the Rosetta flyby anomaly but likely resolves the anomalous acceleration
observed for Pioneer 10.
