This article is an expanded version of talks given by the contributors in
Oberwolfach, Bochum, and at the Fano Conference in Torino. Some new results (e.
g. the material concerning flag varieties, Quot spaces over $\P^1$, and the
generalized quiver representations) were included. The main goal is the
construction of gauge theoretical Gromov-Witten type invariants of arbitrary
genus associated with certain symplectic factorization problems with additional
symmetry, and the computation of these invariants in terms of complex geometric
objects.
  The main tool for describing moduli spaces associated with symplectic
factorization problems is the "universal Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence",
which gives canonical isomorphisms ${\cal M}^*\to{\cal M}^{\rm st}$ between
gauge theoretic moduli spaces of irreducible solutions of certain PDE's and
complex geometric moduli spaces of stable framed holomorphic objects. We state
a conjecture for the general situation: When the gauge theoretic problem is of
Fredholm type, and the data for ${\cal M}^{\rm st}$ are algebraic, then ${\cal
M}^{\rm st}$ admits a canonical perfect obstruction theory in the sense of
Behrend-Fantechi, and the Kobayashi-Hitchin isomorphism ${\cal M}^*\to{\cal
M}^{\rm st}$ identifies the gauge theoretic and the algebraic virtual
fundamental classes. The conjecture was checked for the symplectic
factorization problems which yield the toric varieties.
