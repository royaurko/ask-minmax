Motivated by complex multi-fluid geometries currently being explored in
fibre-device manufacturing, we study capillary instabilities in concentric
cylindrical flows of $N$ fluids with arbitrary viscosities, thicknesses,
densities, and surface tensions in both the Stokes regime and for the full
Navier--Stokes problem. Generalizing previous work by Tomotika (N=2), Stone &
Brenner (N=3, equal viscosities) and others, we present a full linear stability
analysis of the growth modes and rates, reducing the system to a linear
generalized eigenproblem in the Stokes case. Furthermore, we demonstrate by
Plateau-style geometrical arguments that only axisymmetric instabilities need
be considered. We show that the N=3 case is already sufficient to obtain
several interesting phenomena: limiting cases of thin shells or low shell
viscosity that reduce to N=2 problems, and a system with competing breakup
processes at very different length scales. The latter is demonstrated with full
3-dimensional Stokes-flow simulations. Many $N > 3$ cases remain to be
explored, and as a first step we discuss two illustrative $N \to \infty$ cases,
an alternating-layer structure and a geometry with a continuously varying
viscosity.
