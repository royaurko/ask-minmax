Resorting to classical techniques of Riemannian geometry we develop a
geometrical method suitable to investigate the nonintegrability of geodesic
flows and of natural Hamiltonian systems. Then we apply such method to the
Anisotropic Kepler Problem (AKP) and we prove that it is not analytically
integrable.
