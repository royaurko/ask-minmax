A 2.75-approximation algorithm is proposed for the unconstrained traveling
tournament problem, which is a variant of the traveling tournament problem. For
the unconstrained traveling tournament problem, this is the first proposal of
an approximation algorithm with a constant approximation ratio. In addition,
the proposed algorithm yields a solution that meets both the no-repeater and
mirrored constraints. Computational experiments show that the algorithm
generates solutions of good quality.
