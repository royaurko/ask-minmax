Predicting the occurrence of links is a fundamental problem in networks. In
the link prediction problem we are given a snapshot of a network and would like
to infer which interactions among existing members are likely to occur in the
near future or which existing interactions are we missing. Although this
problem has been extensively studied, the challenge of how to effectively
combine the information from the network structure with rich node and edge
attribute data remains largely open.
  We develop an algorithm based on Supervised Random Walks that naturally
combines the information from the network structure with node and edge level
attributes. We achieve this by using these attributes to guide a random walk on
the graph. We formulate a supervised learning task where the goal is to learn a
function that assigns strengths to edges in the network such that a random
walker is more likely to visit the nodes to which new links will be created in
the future. We develop an efficient training algorithm to directly learn the
edge strength estimation function.
  Our experiments on the Facebook social graph and large collaboration networks
show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches as
well as approaches that are based on feature extraction.
