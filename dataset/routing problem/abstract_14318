The dimensionally split reconstruction method as described by Kurganov et
al.\cite{kurganov-2000} is revisited for better understanding and a simple
fourth order scheme is introduced to solve 3D hyperbolic conservation laws
following dimension by dimension approach. Fourth order central weighted
essentially non-oscillatory (CWENO) reconstruction methods have already been
proposed to study multidimensional problems \cite{lpr4,cs12}. In this paper, it
is demonstrated that a simple 1D fourth order CWENO reconstruction method by
Levy et al.\cite{lpr7} provides fourth order accuracy for 3D hyperbolic
nonlinear problems when combined with the semi-discrete scheme by Kurganov et
al.\cite{kurganov-2000} and fourth order Runge-Kutta method for time
integration.
