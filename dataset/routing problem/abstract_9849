A fundamental control problem for autonomous vehicle formations is formation
shape control, in which the agents must maintain a prescribed formation shape
using only information measured or communicated from neighboring agents. While
a large and growing literature has recently emerged on distance-based formation
shape control, global stability properties remain a significant open problem.
Even in four-agent formations, the basic question of whether or not there can
exist locally stable incorrect equilibrium shapes remains open. This paper
shows how this question can be answered for any size formation in principle
using semidefinite programming techniques for semialgebraic problems, involving
solutions sets of polynomial equations, inequations, and inequalities.
