We consider the problem of reconstructing compositions of an integer from
their subcompositions, which was raised by Raykova (albeit disguised as a
question about layered permutations). We show that every composition w of n\ge
3k+1 can be reconstructed from its set of k-deletions, i.e., the set of all
compositions of n-k contained in w. As there are compositions of 3k with the
same set of k-deletions, this result is best possible.
