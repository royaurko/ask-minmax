The Reverse Greedy algorithm (RGreedy) for the k-median problem works as
follows. It starts by placing facilities on all nodes. At each step, it removes
a facility to minimize the resulting total distance from the customers to the
remaining facilities. It stops when k facilities remain. We prove that, if the
distance function is metric, then the approximation ratio of RGreedy is between
?(log n/ log log n) and O(log n).
