This paper presents a new method, referred to here as the sparsity invariant
transformation based $\ell_1$ minimization, to solve the $\ell_0$ minimization
problem for an over-determined linear system corrupted by additive sparse
errors with arbitrary intensity. Many previous works have shown that $\ell_1$
minimization can be applied to realize sparse error detection in many
over-determined linear systems. However, performance of this approach is
strongly dependent on the structure of the measurement matrix, which limits
application possibility in practical problems. Here, we present a new approach
based on transforming the $\ell_0$ minimization problem by a linear
transformation that keeps sparsest solutions invariant. We call such a property
a sparsity invariant property (SIP), and a linear transformation with SIP is
referred to as a sparsity invariant transformation (SIT). We propose the
SIT-based $\ell_1$ minimization method by using an SIT in conjunction with
$\ell_1$ relaxation on the $\ell_0$ minimization problem. We prove that for any
over-determined linear system, there always exists a specific class of SIT's
that guarantees a solution to the SIT-based $\ell_1$ minimization is a
sparsest-errors solution. Besides, a randomized algorithm based on Monte Carlo
simulation is proposed to search for a feasible SIT.
