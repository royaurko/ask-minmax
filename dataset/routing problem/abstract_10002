The orbital boundary value problem, also known as Lambert Problem, is
revisited. Building upon Lancaster and Blanchard approach, new relations are
revealed and a new variable representing all problem classes, under
L-similarity, is used to express the time of flight equation. In the new
variable, the time of flight curves have two oblique asymptotes and they mostly
appear to be conveniently approximated by piecewise continuous lines. We use
and invert such a simple approximation to provide an efficient initial guess to
an Householder iterative method that is then able to converge, for the single
revoltuion case, in only two iterations. The resulting algorithm is compared to
Gooding's procedure revealing to be numerically as accurate, while having a
smaller computational complexity.
