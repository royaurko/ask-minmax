We prove that the model checking and the satisfiability problem of both
Dynamic Logic of Propositional Assignments DL-PA and Coalition Logic of
Propositional Control and Delegation DCL-PC are in PSPACE. We explain why the
proof of EXPTIME-hardness of the model checking problem of DL-PA presented in
(Balbiani, Herzig, Troquard, 2013) is false. We also explain why the proof of
membership in PSPACE of the model checking problem of DCL-PC given in (van der
Hoek, Walther, Wooldridge, 2010) is wrong.
