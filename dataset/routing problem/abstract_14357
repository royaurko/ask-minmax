In the Internet of Things (IoT), devices and gateways may be equipped with
multiple, heterogeneous network interfaces which should be utilized by a large
number of services. In this work, we model the problem of assigning services'
resource demands to a device's heterogeneous interfaces and give a Mixed
Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation for it. For meaningful instance sizes
the MILP model gives optimal solutions to the presented computationally-hard
problem. We provide insightful results discussing the properties of the derived
solutions with respect to the splitting of services to different interfaces.
