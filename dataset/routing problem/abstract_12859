A key problem in statistical modeling is model selection, how to choose a
model at an appropriate level of complexity. This problem appears in many
settings, most prominently in choosing the number ofclusters in mixture models
or the number of factors in factor analysis. In this tutorial we describe
Bayesian nonparametric methods, a class of methods that side-steps this issue
by allowing the data to determine the complexity of the model. This tutorial is
a high-level introduction to Bayesian nonparametric methods and contains
several examples of their application.
