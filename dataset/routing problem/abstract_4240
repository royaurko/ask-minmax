We give a description of the structure of finite Morse index solutions to two
free boundary problems in $\R^2$. These free boundary problems are models of
phase transition and they are closely related to minimal hypersurfaces. We show
that these finite Morse index solutions have finite ends. Moreover, they
converge exponentially to these ends at infinity.
