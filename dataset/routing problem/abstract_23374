The fact that several important effects in multiparticle dynamics, on which
QCD has not yet satisfactory predictions, have been interpreted in terms of the
validity of negative binomial (Pascal) regularity and related clan properties
at the level of simpler substructures, raises intriguing questions on clan
properties in all classes of collisions, the main one being whether clans are
observable objects or merely a mathematical concept. We approach this problem
by studying clan masses and rapidity distributions in each substructure for
e+e- annihilation and hh collisions, and find that such properties can indeed
characterise the different components. These results support the idea that
clans could be observable, a challenging problem for future experiments.
