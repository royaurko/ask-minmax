It is now known that for any prime p and any finite semiabelian p-group G,
there exists a (tame) realization of G as a Galois group over the rationals Q
with exactly d = d(G) ramified primes, where d(G) is the minimal number of
generators of G, which solves the minimal ramification problem for finite
semiabelian p-groups. We generalize this result to obtain a theorem on finite
semiabelian groups and derive the solution to the minimal ramification problem
for a certain family of semiabelian groups that includes all finite nilpotent
semiabelian groups G. Finally, we give some indication of the depth of the
minimal ramification problem for semiabelian groups not covered by our theorem.
