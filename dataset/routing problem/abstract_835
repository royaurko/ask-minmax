This work is devoted to communication approaches, which spread information in
robot swarms. These mechanisms are useful for large-scale systems and also for
such cases when a limited communication equipment does not allow routing of
information packages. We focus on two approaches such as virtual fields and
epidemic algorithms, discuss several aspects of hardware implementation and
demonstrate experiments performed with microrobots "Jasmine".
