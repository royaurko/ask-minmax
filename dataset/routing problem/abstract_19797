A lattice derivative is defined as a discrete Fourier transform of momentum
on a finite lattice. Species doublers are removed with anti-periodic boundary
conditions. U(1) chiral transformation is modified to reproduce chiral anomaly.
Chiral gauge theories can be constructed on the lattice using a single Weyl
fermion as a building block.
