Since Stein's 1956 seminal paper, shrinkage has played a fundamental role in
both parametric and nonparametric inference. This article discusses minimaxity
and adaptive minimaxity in nonparametric function estimation. Three
interrelated problems, function estimation under global integrated squared
error, estimation under pointwise squared error, and nonparametric confidence
intervals, are considered. Shrinkage is pivotal in the development of both the
minimax theory and the adaptation theory. While the three problems are closely
connected and the minimax theories bear some similarities, the adaptation
theories are strikingly different. For example, in a sharp contrast to adaptive
point estimation, in many common settings there do not exist nonparametric
confidence intervals that adapt to the unknown smoothness of the underlying
function. A concise account of these theories is given. The connections as well
as differences among these problems are discussed and illustrated through
examples.
