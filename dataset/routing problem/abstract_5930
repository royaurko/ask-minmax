In the k-SUM problem, we are given a set of numbers and asked if there are k
of them which sum to 0. The case of k = 3 has been extensively studied in
computational geometry, and known to be intimately related to many
low-dimensional problems. The case of arbitrary k is the natural
parameterization of Subset Sum and is well-known in parameterized algorithms
and complexity.
  We present new FPT reductions between the k-SUM problem and the k-Clique
problem, yielding several complexity-theoretic and algorithmic consequences.
Our reductions show that k-SUM on "small" numbers (in the range
$[-n^{f(k)},n^{f(k)}]$ for any computable function f) is W[1]-complete, and
that k-SUM (in general) is W[1]-complete under a common derandomization
assumption. These results effectively resolve the parameterized complexity of
k-SUM, initially posed in 1992 by Downey and Fellows in their seminal paper on
parameterized intractability. Our method is quite general and applies to other
weighted problems as well.
