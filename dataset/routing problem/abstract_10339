In an illiquid market as a result of a lack of counterparties and uncertainty
about asset values, trading of assets is not being secured by the actual value.
In this research, we develop an algorithmic trading strategy to deal with the
discrete optimal liquidation problem of large order trading with different
market microstructures in an illiquid market. In this market, order flow can be
viewed as a Point process with stochastic arrival intensity. Interaction
between price impact and price dynamics can be modeled as a dynamic
optimization problem with price impact as a linear function of the
self-exciting dynamic process. We formulate the liquidation problem as a
discrete-time Markov Decision Processes where the state process is a Piecewise
Deterministic Markov Process (PDMP), which is a member of right continuous
Markov Process family. We study the dynamics of a limit order book and its
influence on the price dynamics and develop a stochastic model to retain the
main statistical characteristics of limit order books in illiquid markets.
