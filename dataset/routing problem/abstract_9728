A quasistatic unilateral frictionless contact problem for a rigid
axisymmetric indenter pressed into a homogeneous, linearly elastic and
transversely isotropic elastic layer bonded to a homogeneous, linearly elastic
and transversely isotropic half-space is considered. Using the general solution
to the governing integral equation of the axisymmetric contact problem for an
isotropic elastic half-space, we derive exact equations for the contact force
and the contact radius, which are then approximated under the assumption that
the contact radius is sufficiently small compared to the thickness of the
elastic layer. An asymptotic analysis of the resulting non-linear algebraic
problem corresponding to the fourth-order asymptotic model is performed. A
special case of the indentation problem for a blunt punch of power-law profile
is studied in detail. Approximate force-displacement relations are obtained in
explicit form, which is most suited for development of indentation tests.
