We address the problem of multiuser scheduling with partial channel
information in a multi-cell environment. The scheduling problem is formulated
jointly with the ARQ based channel learning process and the intercell
interference mitigating cell breathing protocol. The optimal joint scheduling
policy under various system constraints is established. The general problem is
posed as a generalized Restless Multiarmed Bandit process and the notion of
indexability is studied. We conjecture, with numerical support, that the
multicell multiuser scheduling problem is indexable and obtain a partial
structure of the index policy.
