Performance characterization is a fundamental issue in wireless networks for
real time routing, wireless network simulation, and etc. There are four basic
wireless operations that are required to be modeled, i.e., unicast, anycast,
broadcast, and multicast. As observed in many recent works, the temporal and
spatial distribution of packet receptions can have significant impact on
wireless performance involving multiple links (anycast/broadcast/multicast).
However, existing performance models and simulations overlook these two
wireless behaviors, leading to biased performance estimation and simulation
results. In this paper, we first explicitly identify the necessary
"3-Dimension" information for wireless performance modeling, i.e., packet
reception rate (PRR), PRR spatial distribution, and temporal distribution. We
then propose a comprehensive modeling approach considering 3-Dimension Wireless
information (called 3DW model). Further, we demonstrate the generality and wide
applications of 3DW model by two case studies: 3DWbased network simulation and
3DW-based real time routing protocol. Extensive simulation and testbed
experiments have been conducted. The results show that 3DW model achieves much
more accurate performance estimation for both anycast and broadcast/multicast.
3DW-based simulation can effectively reserve the end-to-end performance metric
of the input empirical traces. 3DW-based routing can select more efficient
senders, achieving better transmission efficiency.
