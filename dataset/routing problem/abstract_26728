In many complex systems, the dynamical evolution of the different components
can result in adaptation of the connections between them. We consider the
problem of how a fully connected network of discrete-state dynamical elements
which can interact via positive or negative links, approaches structural
balance by evolving its links to be consistent with the states of its
components. The adaptation process, inspired by Hebb's principle, involves the
interaction strengths evolving in accordance with the dynamical states of the
elements. We observe that in the presence of stochastic fluctuations in the
dynamics of the components, the system can exhibit large dispersion in the time
required for converging to the balanced state. This variability is
characterized by a bimodal distribution, which points to an intriguing
non-trivial problem in the study of evolving energy landscapes.
