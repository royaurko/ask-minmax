In this paper, we study the consensus problem of multiple agents on a kind of
famous graph, Peterson graph. It is an undirected graph with 10 vertices and 15
edges. Each agent randomly walks on this graph and communicates with each other
if and only if they coincide on a node at the same time. We conduct numerical
study on the consensus problem in this framework and show that global consensus
can be achieved.
