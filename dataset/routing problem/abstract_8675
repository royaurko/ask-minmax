In this paper, we consider the indefinite fractional elliptic problem. A
corresponding Liouville-type theorem for the indefinite fractional elliptic
equations is established. Furthermore, we obtain a priori bound for solutions
in a bounded domain by blowing-up and re-scaling. We also classify the
solutions of some degenerate elliptic equation originated from fractional
Laplacian.
