The standard cosmological model, LCDM, provides an excellent fit to Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) data. However, the model has well known problems.
For example, the cosmological constant, is fine-tuned to 1 part in 10^100 and
the cold dark matter (CDM) particle is not yet detected in the laboratory.
Shanks previously investigated a model which assumed neither exotic particles
nor a cosmological constant but instead postulated a low Hubble constant (H_0)
to allow a baryon density compatible with inflation and zero spatial curvature.
However, recent Planck results make it more difficult to reconcile such a model
with CMB power spectra. Here we relax the previous assumptions to assess the
effects of assuming three active neutrinos of mass ~5eV. If we assume a low
H_0~45kms^-1Mpc^-1 then, compared to the previous purely baryonic model, we
find a significantly improved fit to the first 3 peaks of the Planck power
spectrum. Nevertheless, the goodness-of-fit is still significantly worse than
for LCDM and would require appeal to unknown systematic effects for the fit
ever to be considered acceptable. A further serious problem is that the
amplitude of fluctuations is low (sigma_8~0.2) making it difficult to form
galaxies by the present day. This might then require seeds, perhaps from a
primordial magnetic field, to be invoked for galaxy formation. These and other
problems demonstrate the difficulties faced by models other than LCDM in
fitting ever more precise cosmological data.
