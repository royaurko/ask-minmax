The calculation of accurate collision strengths for atomic transitions has
been a long standing problem in quantitative spectroscopy. Most modern
calculations are based on the R-matrix method and problems pertaining to the
use of this method have led to a discussion of the accuracy of these results.
More in particular, based on an analysis of the spectra of NGC 3918 and NGC
6302, Clegg et al. (1987) and Oliva et al. (1996) have questioned R-matrix
calculations for the infrared [Ne V] fine-structure transitions. Using improved
flux measurements for the [Ne V] lines, we show that the conclusion that these
collision strengths would be too high, is not correct. The discrepancies found
by Clegg et al. (1987) can be explained by the inaccuracy of the [Ne V] 342.6
nm flux they adopted. The discrepancies found by Oliva et al. (1996) can be
explained by the inaccuracy of the LRS flux for the [Ne V] 14.32 micron line.
Based on the data presented in this paper there is no reason to assume that
there are any problems with the R-matrix calculations for Ne^4+ of Lennon &
Burke (1994). We show that the data are accurate at the 30 % level or better.
This confirms the validity of the close coupling method.
