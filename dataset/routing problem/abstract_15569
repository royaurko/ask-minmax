We consider a porous solid covered with a water film (or with a drop) in
situations where the liquid is pumped in, either spontaneously (if the porous
medium is hydrophilic) or mechanically (by an external pump). The dynamics of
dewetting is then strongly modified. We analyse a few major examples: a)
horizontal films, which break at a certain critical thickness, b) the "modified
Landau-Levich problem" where a porous plate moves up from a bath and carries a
film: aspiration towards the plate limits the height H reached by the film, c)
certain situation where the hysteresis of contact angles is important.
