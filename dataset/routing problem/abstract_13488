We study the Dirac-Kepler problem plus a Coulomb-type scalar potential by
generalizing the Lippmann-Johnson operator to D spatial dimensions. From this
operator, we construct the supersymmetric generators to obtain the energy
spectrum for discrete excited eigenstates and the radial spinor for the SUSY
ground state
