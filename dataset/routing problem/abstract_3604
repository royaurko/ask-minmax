A multilevel correction scheme is proposed to solve nonsymmetric eigenvalue
problems by the finite element method. The method includes multi correction
steps in a sequence of finite element spaces. In each correction step, we only
need to solve two source problems on a finer finite element space and two
eigenvalue problems on the coarsest finite element space. The accuracy of the
eigenpair approximation is improved after each correction step. This correction
scheme improves overall efficiency of the finite element method in solving
nonsymmetric eigenvalue problems.
