Thanks to a change of unknown we compare two elliptic quasilinear problems
with Dirichlet data in a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^{N}.$ The first one, of
the form $-\Delta_{p}u=\beta(u)| \nabla u| ^{p}+\lambda f(x),$ where $\beta$ is
nonnegative, involves a gradient term with natural growth. The second one, of
the form $-\Delta_{p}v=\lambda f(x)(1+g(v))^{p-1}$ where $g$ is nondecreasing,
presents a source term of order 0. The correlation gives new results of
existence, nonexistence and multiplicity for the two problems.
