In this report, we first describe the problem that we are dealing with i.e.
data dissemination in multi-hop cognitive radio networks. To address this
problem, we propose a channel selection strategy named 'SURF'. We evaluate the
proposed channel selection strategy in both single-hop and multi-hop scenarios
and compared it with relevant approaches. So far, one technical report and a
poster is published as part of this work, while two publications are under
review; one is in IEEE Communications Letters and the second one is in IEEE
WoWMoM conference. In on-going works sections, we first mention some possible
directions in the context of SURF. In addition to that, we mention different
research problems that we are planning to deal during the course of this PhD
dissertation.
