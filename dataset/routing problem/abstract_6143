It is shown that the comment by Costa and Meneses [1] did not point any
technical or conceptual flaw in our paper titled ``Conservative Force Fields in
Nonextensive Kinetic Theory" (Physica A 316, 289 (2002)). In particular, the
application of the nonextensive distribution to the historical problem of the
unbounded isothermal atmosphere under constant gravity is theoretically
correct. It should be stressed that our solution is somewhat connected with a
similar solution to a problem appearing in the astrophysical domain, namely,
the so-called singular isothermal sphere. Actually, both problems are solved by
a stationary Tsallis q-distribution with a "thermal cut-off" in the allowed
values of the energy.
