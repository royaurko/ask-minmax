In this work we prove that the unique 1-convex solution of the Monge problem
contructed from the solution of the Monge-Kantorovitch problem between the
Wiener measure and a target measure which has a log-concave density w.r.to the
Wiener measure is also the strong solution of the Monge-Ampere equation in the
frame of infinite dimensional Frechet spaces. We enhance also the polar
factorization results of the mappings which transform a spread measure to
another one of finite Wasserstein distance. Finally we calculate the
semimartingale decomposition of the transport process with respect to its
natural filtration and make the connection between the curved Brownian motion
and the polar decomposition of the corresponding shifts.
