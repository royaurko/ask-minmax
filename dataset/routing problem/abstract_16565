We study the spectral theory and inverse problem on asymptotically hyperbolic
manifolds. The main subjects are as follows: (1)Location of the essential
spectrum. (2)Absence of eigenvalues embedded in the continuous spectrum.
(3)Limiting absorption principle for the resolvent and the absolute continuity
of the continuous spectrum. (4)Construction of the generalized Fourier
transform. (5)symptotic completeness of time-dependent wave operators.
(6)Characterization of the space of scattering solutions to the Helmhotz
equation in terms of the generalized Fourier transform. (7)Asymptotic expansion
of scattering solutions to the Helmholtz equation and the S-matrix.
(8)Representation of the fundamental solution to the wave equation in the
upper-half space model. (9)Radon transform and the propagation of singularities
for the wave equation. Finally, we shall discuss the inverse problem. Namely
(10)Identification of the Riemannian metric from the scattering matrix.
