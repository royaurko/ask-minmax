If a neutral inclusion is inserted in a matrix containing a uniform applied
electric field, it does not disturb the field outside the inclusion. The well
known Hashin coated sphere is an example of a neutral coated inclusion. In this
paper, we consider the problem of constructing neutral inclusions from
nonlinear materials. In particular, we discuss assemblages of coated spheres
and the two-dimensional analogous problem of assemblages of coated disks.
