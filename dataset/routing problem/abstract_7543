We propose a solution to the mu/Bmu problem in gauge-mediated SUSY breaking,
which does not suffer from the SUSY CP problem and is consistent with the
solution to the strong CP problem. The model is based on Z_3-invariant NMSSM
with additional vector-like matter charged under a hidden gauge group as well
as the standard model gauge groups. The dynamical scale of the hidden gauge
symmetry is set to be around 10 GeV. We show that this simple extension of the
NMSSM resolves the domain wall problem and the mu/Bmu problem without a
dangerous CP angle. The relative sign among gaugino masses and the mu parameter
can be preferable in terms of the muon anomalous magnetic moment. We also
discuss cosmological issues of this model, especially the effects of long-lived
particles in the hidden gauge sector. The hidden glueball may cause a late-time
entropy production, which opens up a possibility that the light gravitino can
be a dominant component of dark matter while leptogenesis scenarios work
successfully. There is a region where the electroweak symmetry is successfully
broken with ~10 TeV stops, and the Higgs mass of ~125 GeV can be explained.
