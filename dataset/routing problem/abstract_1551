Exclusive measurements of the p p -> p p pi+ pi- reaction have been carried
out at Tp = 775 MeV at CELSIUS using the PROMICE/WASA setup. Together with data
obtained at lower energy they point to a dominance of the Roper excitation in
this process. From the observed interference of its decay routes N* -> N sigma
and N* -> Delta pi -> N sigma their energy-dependent relative branching ratio
is determined.
