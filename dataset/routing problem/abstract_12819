We prove that in conformal classes of metrics near the class of an Einstein
metric (other than the standard round metric on a sphere) the Yamabe problem
has a unique solution up to scaling. This is a local extension, in the space of
conformal classes, of a well-known uniqueness criterion due to Obata.
