A discretization scheme for variable coefficient elliptic PDEs in the plane
is presented. The scheme is based on high-order Gaussian quadratures and is
designed for problems with smooth solutions, such as scattering problems
involving soft scatterers. The resulting system of linear equations is very
well suited to efficient direct solvers such as nested dissection and the more
recently proposed accelerated nested dissection schemes with O(N) complexity.
