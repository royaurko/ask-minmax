It is known that the famous, intractible 1959 Kadison-Singer problem in
$C^{*}$-algebras is equivalent to fundamental unsolved problems in a dozen
areas of research in pure mathematics, applied mathematics and Engineering. The
recent surprising solution to this problem by Marcus, Spielman and Srivastava
was a significant achievement and a significant advance for all these areas of
research.
  We will look at many of the known equivalent forms of the Kadison-Singer
Problem and see what are the best new theorems available in each area of
research as a consequence of the work of Marcus, Spielman and Srivastave. In
the cases where {\it constants} are important for the theorem, we will give the
best constants available in terms of a {\it generic constant} taken from
\cite{MSS}. Thus, if better constants eventually become available, it will be
simple to adapt these new constants to the theorems.
