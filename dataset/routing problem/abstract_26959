Stationary, D-dimensional test branes, interacting with N-dimensional
Myers-Perry bulk black holes, are investigated in arbitrary brane and bulk
dimensions. The branes are asymptotically flat and axisymmetric around the
rotation axis of the black hole with a single angular momentum. They are also
spherically symmetric in all other dimensions allowing a total of O(1)xO(D-2)
group of symmetry. It is shown that even though this setup is the most natural
extension of the spherical symmetric problem to the simplest rotating case in
higher dimensions, the obtained solutions are not compatible with the spherical
solutions in the sense that the latter ones are not recovered in the
non-rotating limit. The brane configurations are qualitatively different from
the spherical problem, except in the special case of a 3-dimensional brane.
Furthermore, a quasi-static phase transition between the topologically
different solutions cannot be studied here, due to the lack of a general,
stationary, equatorial solution.
