We study a nonlinear Neumann boundary value problem associated to a
nonhomogeneous differential operator. Taking into account the competition
between the nonlinearity and the bifurcation parameter, we establish sufficient
conditions for the existence of nontrivial solutions in a related
Orlicz--Sobolev space.
