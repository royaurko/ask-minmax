We present the first numerical approach to D-bar problems having spectral
convergence for real analytic rapidly decreasing potentials. The proposed
method starts from a formulation of the problem in terms of an integral
equation which is solved with Fourier techniques. The singular integrand is
regularized analytically. The resulting integral equation is approximated via a
discrete system which is solved with Krylov methods. As an example, the D-bar
problem for the Davey-Stewartson II equations is solved. The result is used to
test direct numerical solutions of the PDE.
