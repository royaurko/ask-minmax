Given a set of functions F={f_1,...,f_m} of L2(Rd), we study the problem of
finding the shift-invariant space V with n generators {phi_1,...,phi_n} that is
``closest'' to the functions of F in the sense that V minimize the least square
distance from the data F to V over the set of all shift-invariant spaces that
can be generated by n or less generators.
  The Eckart-Young Theorem uses the singular value decomposition to provide a
solution to a related problem in finite dimension. We transform the problem
under study into an uncountable set of finite dimensional problems each of
which can be solved using an extension of the Eckart-Young Theorem. We prove
that the finite dimensional solutions can be patched together and transformed
to obtain the optimal shift-invariant space solution to the original problem,
and we produce a Parseval frame for the optimal space.
  A typical application is the problem of finding a shift-invariant space model
that describes a given class of signals or images (e.g., the class of chest
X-Rays), from the observation of a set of m signals or images f_1,...f_m, which
may be theoretical samples, or experimental data.
