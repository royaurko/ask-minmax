Most of the existing classification methods are aimed at minimization of
empirical risk (through some simple point-based error measured with loss
function) with added regularization. We propose to approach this problem in a
more information theoretic way by investigating applicability of entropy
measures as a classification model objective function. We focus on quadratic
Renyi's entropy and connected Cauchy-Schwarz Divergence which leads to the
construction of Extreme Entropy Machines (EEM).
  The main contribution of this paper is proposing a model based on the
information theoretic concepts which on the one hand shows new, entropic
perspective on known linear classifiers and on the other leads to a
construction of very robust method competetitive with the state of the art
non-information theoretic ones (including Support Vector Machines and Extreme
Learning Machines).
  Evaluation on numerous problems spanning from small, simple ones from UCI
repository to the large (hundreads of thousands of samples) extremely
unbalanced (up to 100:1 classes' ratios) datasets shows wide applicability of
the EEM in real life problems and that it scales well.
