We consider the problem of finding a local optimum for Max-Cut with
FLIP-neighborhood, in which exactly one node changes the partition. Schaeffer
and Yannakakis (SICOMP, 1991) showed PLS-completeness of this problem on graphs
with unbounded degree. On the other side, Poljak (SICOMP, 1995) showed that in
cubic graphs every FLIP local search takes O(n^2) steps, where n is the number
of nodes. Due to the huge gap between degree three and unbounded degree,
Ackermann, Roeglin, and Voecking (JACM, 2008) asked for the smallest d for
which the local Max-Cut problem with FLIP-neighborhood on graphs with maximum
degree d is PLS-complete. In this paper, we prove that the computation of a
local optimum on graphs with maximum degree five is PLS-complete. Thus, we
solve the problem posed by Ackermann et al. almost completely by showing that d
is either four or five (unless PLS is in P). On the other side, we also prove
that on graphs with degree O(log n) every FLIP local search has probably
polynomial smoothed complexity. Roughly speaking, for any instance, in which
the edge weights are perturbated by a (Gaussian) random noise with variance
\sigma^2, every FLIP local search terminates in time polynomial in n and
\sigma^{-1}, with probability 1-n^{-\Omega(1)}. Putting both results together,
we may conclude that although local Max-Cut is likely to be hard on graphs with
bounded degree, it can be solved in polynomial time for slightly perturbated
instances with high probability.
