In this paper we present a sufficient condition for the existence of a
solution for an equilibrium problem on an Hadamard manifold and under suitable
assumptions on the sectional curvature, we propose a framework for the
convergence analysis of a proximal point algorithm to solve this equilibrium
problem in finite time. Finally we offer an application to personal equilibrum
problems as behavioral traps problems, using a recent "variational rationality"
approach of human behavior.
