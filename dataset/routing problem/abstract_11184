After a review of the canonical reduction to the rest-frame Wigner-covariant
instant form of standard theories in Minkowski spacetime, a new formulation of
tetrad gravity is introduced. Its canonical reduction, also in presence of N
scalar particles, is done. The modification of the ADM formulation to solve the
deparametrization problem of general relativity (how to recover the rest-frame
instant form for G=0), is presented.
