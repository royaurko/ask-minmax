Equation-free approaches have been proposed in recent years for the
computational study of multiscale phenomena in engineering problems where
evolution equations for the coarse-grained, system-level behavior are not
explicitly available.
  In this paper we study the dynamics of a diffusive particle system in a
laminar shear flow, described by a two-dimensional Brownian motion; in
particular, we perform coarse projective integration and demonstrate the
particle-based computation of coarse self-similar and asymptotically
self-similar solutions for this problem.
  We use marginal and conditional Inverse Cumulative Distribution Functions
(ICDFs) as the macroscopic observables of the evolving particle distribution.
