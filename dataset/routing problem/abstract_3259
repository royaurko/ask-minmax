In this paper we study the two-dimensional moment problem in a strip $\Pi(R)
= \{ (x_1,x_2)\in \mathbb{R}^2:\ |x_2| \leq R \}$, $R>0$. We obtained a
solvability criterion for this moment problem. We derived a parameterization of
all solutions of the moment problem. An abstract operator approach and results
of Godi\v{c}, Lucenko and Shtraus are used.
