The focal sets of isoparametric hypersurfaces in spheres with g = 4 are all
Willmore submanifolds, being minimal but mostly non-Einstein ([TY1], [QTY]).
Inspired by A.Gray's view, the present paper shows that, these focal sets are
all A- manifolds but rarely Ricci parallel, except possibly for the only
unclassi?ed case. As a byproduct, it gives in?nitely many simply-connected
examples to the problem 16.56 (i) of Besse concerning generalizations of the
Einstein condition.
