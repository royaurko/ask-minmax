We wish to draw attention to an interesting and promising interaction of two
theories.
  On the one hand, it is the theory of \textbf{pseudo-triangulations} which was
useful for implicit solution of thecarpenter's rule problem and proved later to
give a nice tool for graph embeddings.
  On the other hand, it is the theory of hyperbolic virtual polytopes which
arose from an old uniqueness conjecture for convex bodies (A. D. Alexandrov's
problem): suppose that a constant $C$ separates (non-strictly) everywhere the
principal curvature radii of a smooth 3-dimensional convex body $K$. Then $K$
is necessarily a ball of radius $C$.
  The two key ideas are:
  Passing from planar pseudo-triangulations to spherical pseudo-tilings, we
avoid non-poited vertices. Instead, we use pseudo-di-gons. A theorem on
spherically embedded Laman-plus-one graphs is announced.
  The difficult problem of hyperbolic polytopes constructing can be reduced to
finding spherically embedded graphs.
