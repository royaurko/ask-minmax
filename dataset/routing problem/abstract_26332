The Odd Cycle Transversal problem (OCT) asks whether a given graph can be
made bipartite (i.e., 2-colorable) by deleting at most l vertices. We study
structural parameterizations of OCT with respect to their polynomial
kernelizability, i.e., whether instances can be efficiently reduced to a size
polynomial in the chosen parameter. It is a major open problem in parameterized
complexity whether Odd Cycle Transversal admits a polynomial kernel when
parameterized by l. On the positive side, we show a polynomial kernel for OCT
when parameterized by the vertex deletion distance to the class of bipartite
graphs of treewidth at most w (for any constant w); this generalizes the
parameter feedback vertex set number (i.e., the distance to a forest).
Complementing this, we exclude polynomial kernels for OCT parameterized by the
distance to outerplanar graphs, conditioned on the assumption that NP \not
\subseteq coNP/poly. Thus the bipartiteness requirement for the treewidth w
graphs is necessary. Further lower bounds are given for parameterization by
distance from cluster and co-cluster graphs respectively, as well as for
Weighted OCT parameterized by the vertex cover number (i.e., the distance from
an independent set).
