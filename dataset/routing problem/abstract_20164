We solve the isomorphism problem for the whole class of Lins-Mandel gems
(graphs encoded manifolds). We also present certain homeomorphisms of branched
cyclic coverings of two-bridge hyperbolic links. As a consequence, we prove
that, in in a wide subset of interesting cases, the isomorphism conditions for
Lins-Mandel gems are equivalent to the homeomorphism conditions for the encoded
3-manifolds.
