We discuss initial-boundary value problems of arbitrary spatial order subject
to arbitrary boundary conditions. We formalise the concept of the conditioning
of such a problem and show that it represents a necessary criterion for
well-posedness. The other requirement for well-posedness, the convergence of
certain series, is also analysed. We illustrate these results with a full
classification of 3rd order problems having non-Robin boundary conditions.
  Part of this work is devoted to correcting an oversight in the contributor's
earlier work Well-posed two-point initial-boundary value problems with
arbitrary boundary conditions in volume 152 of Math. Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc.
