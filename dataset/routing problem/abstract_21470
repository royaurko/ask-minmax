For a scattering problem of tight-binding Bloch electrons by a weak random
surface potential, a generalized Levinson theorem is put forward showing the
equality of the total density of surface states and the density of the total
time delay. The proof uses explicit formulas for the wave operators in the new
rescaled energy and interaction (REI) representation, as well as an index
theorem for adequate associated operator algebras.
