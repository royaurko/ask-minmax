This report covers the studies of energetic particle propagation and
acceleration presented during the 27th ICRC in sessions OG 1.3 and 1.4, plus a
few selected papers from neighbouring OG sections. We list problems discussed
within these sections and we shortly describe selected interesting achievements
and/or novel approaches.
