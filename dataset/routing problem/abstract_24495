We present a simple technique for the computation of coarse-scale steady
states of dynamical systems with time scale separation in the form of a
"wrapper" around a fine-scale simulator. We discuss how this approach
alleviates certain problems encountered by comparable existing approaches, and
illustrate its use by computing coarse-scale steady states of a lattice
Boltzmann fine scale code. Interestingly, in the same context of multiple time
scale problems, the approach can be slightly modified to provide initial
conditions (on the slow manifold) with prescribed coarse-scale observables. The
approach is based on appropriately designed short bursts of the fine-scale
simulator whose results are used to track changes in the coarse variables of
interest, a core component of the equation-free framework.
