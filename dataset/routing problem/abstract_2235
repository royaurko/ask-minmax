The recently advancement in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology has
brought new distributed sensing applications such as water quality monitoring.
With sensing capabilities and using parameters like pH, conductivity and
temperature, the quality of water can be known. This paper proposes a novel
design based on IEEE 802.15.4 (Zig-Bee protocol) and solar energy called
Autonomous Water Quality Monitoring Prototype (AWQMP). The prototype is
designed to use ECHERP routing protocol and Adruino Mega 2560, an open-source
electronic prototyping platform for data acquisition. AWQMP is expected to give
real time data acquirement and to reduce the cost of manual water quality
monitoring due to its autonomous characteristic. Moreover, the proposed
prototype will help to study the behavior of aquatic animals in deployed water
bodies.
