We reminisce and discuss applications of algorithmic probability to a wide
range of problems in artificial intelligence, philosophy and technological
society. We propose that Solomonoff has effectively axiomatized the field of
artificial intelligence, therefore establishing it as a rigorous scientific
discipline. We also relate to our own work in incremental machine learning and
philosophy of complexity.
