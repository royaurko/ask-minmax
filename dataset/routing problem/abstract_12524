We study the integration and approximation problems for monotone and convex
bounded functions that depend on $d$ variables, where $d$ can be arbitrarily
large. We consider the worst case error for algorithms that use finitely many
function values. We prove that these problems suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. That is, one needs exponentially many (in $d$) function values
to achieve an error $\epsilon$.
