In this paper we study the modification of the properties of the nucleon in
the nucleus within the quark-soliton model. This is a covariant, dynamical
model, which provides a non-linear representation of the spontaneously broken
SU(2)_L X SU(2)_R symmetry of QCD. The effects of the nuclear medium are
accounted for by using the Wigner-Seitz approximation and therefore reducing
the complex many-body problem to a simpler single-particle problem. We find a
minimum in the binding energy at finite density, a change in the isoscalar
nucleon radius and a reduction of the in-medium pion decay constant. The latter
is consistent with a partial restoration of chiral symmetry at finite density,
which is predicted by other models.
