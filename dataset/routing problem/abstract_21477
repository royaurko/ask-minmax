We construct holomorphic loop groups and their associated affine Kac-Moody
groups and prove that they are tame Fr\'echet manifolds. These results form the
functional analytic basis for the theory of affine Kac-Moody symmetric spaces,
presented first in the contributors thesis. Our approach also solves completely the
problem of complexification of loop groups; it allows a complete description of
complex Kac-Moody groups and their non-compact real forms.
