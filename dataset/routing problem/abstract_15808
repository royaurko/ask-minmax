We prove that for any fixed d the generating function of the projection of
the set of integer points in a rational d-dimensional polytope can be computed
in polynomial time. As a corollary, we deduce that various interesting sets of
lattice points, notably integer semigroups and (minimal) Hilbert bases of
rational cones, have short rational generating functions provided certain
parameters (the dimension and the number of generators) are fixed. It follows
then that many computational problems for such sets (for example, finding the
number of positive integers not representable as a non-negative integer
combination of given coprime positive integers a_1 ... a_d admit polynomial
time algorithms. We also discuss a related problem of computing the Hilbert
series of a ring generated by monomials.
