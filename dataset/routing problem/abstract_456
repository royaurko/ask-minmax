Energy efficient routing protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is one
of the most challenging task for researcher. Hierarchical routing protocols
have been proved more energy efficient routing protocols, as compare to flat
and location based routing protocols. Heterogeneity of nodes with respect to
their energy level, has also added extra lifespan for sensor network. In this
paper, we propose a Centralized Energy Efficient Clustering (CEEC) routing
protocol. We design the CEEC for three level heterogeneous network. CEEC can
also be implemented in multi-level heterogeneity of networks. For initial
practical, we design and analyze CEEC for three level advance heterogeneous
network. In CEEC, whole network area is divided into three equal regions, in
which nodes with same energy are spread in same region.
