We consider wireless mesh networks and the problem of scheduling the links of
a given set of routes under the assumption of a heavy-traffic pattern. We
assume some TDMA protocol provides a background of synchronized time slots and
seek to schedule the routes' links to maximize the number of packets that get
delivered to their destinations per time slot. Our approach is to construct an
undirected graph G and to heuristically obtain node multicolorings for G that
can be turned into efficient link schedules. In G each node represents a link
to be scheduled and the edges are set up to represent every possible
interference for any given set of interference assumptions. We present two
multicoloring-based heuristics and study their performance through extensive
simulations. One of the two heuristics is based on relaxing the notion of a
node multicoloring by dynamically exploiting the availability of communication
opportunities that would otherwise be wasted. We have found that, as a
consequence, its performance is significantly superior to the other's.
