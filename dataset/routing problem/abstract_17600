How do the models (Fritiof 1.6, Fritiof 7.0, UrQMD 3.3 and Hijing 1.383)
describe experimental data of NA61/SHINE and NA49 Collaborations on $pp$ and
$p{\rm C}$ interactions at high energies? An answer on this question is given
in the paper. It is shown that the UrQMD model does not reproduce the energy
dependence of $\pi^-$ meson production in $pp$-interactions; the Fritiof 1.6
and the Fritiof 7.0 models underestimate the meson production on $\sim$ 10 %;
the Hijing model overestimates the data on $\sim$ 10 %. A change of a LUND
fragmentation function parameter in the Fritiof models 1.6/7.0 allows to
describe the data. A decreasing of probabilities of binary processes in the
UrQMD model like $p+p\rightarrow N+N'$ and so on, allows one to describe the
data, thus a problem of a correct accounting of the processes arises. An
increasing of a probability of the single diffraction dissociation in the
Hijing model from 35 % to 50 % allows to describe the data, though a spectrum
of masses produced in the diffraction is not satisfactory. A description of the
diffraction is a problem in all the models.
