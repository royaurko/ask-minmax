We consider the problem of uniqueness of positive solutions to boundary value
problems containing the equation: -\Delta_p u =K(|x|)f(u), p>1. f is positive,
is locally Lipschitz and satisfies some superlinear growth condition after u_0,
a zero of f before which it is non positive and not identically 0. We show that
the Sturmnian theory arguments used by Coffman and Kwong are valid for the
equation containing the p-Laplacian operator, even though they were thought to
be unextendable beyond the semilinear equation. We obtain a monotone separation
result which finally yields the desired uniqueness results.
