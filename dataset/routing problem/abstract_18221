Set membership of points in the plane can be visualized by connecting
corresponding points via graphical features, like paths, trees, polygons,
ellipses. In this paper we study the \emph{bus embeddability problem} (BEP):
given a set of colored points we ask whether there exists a planar realization
with one horizontal straight-line segment per color, called bus, such that all
points with the same color are connected with vertical line segments to their
bus. We present an ILP and an FPT algorithm for the general problem. For
restricted versions of this problem, such as when the relative order of buses
is predefined, or when a bus must be placed above all its points, we provide
efficient algorithms. We show that another restricted version of the problem
can be solved using 2-stack pushall sorting. On the negative side we prove the
NP-completeness of a special case of BEP.
