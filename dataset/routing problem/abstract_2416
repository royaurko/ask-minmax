Supermassive disks are thought to be precursors of supermassive black holes
that are believed to power quasars and exist at centers of galaxies. Formation
scenarios of such disks are reviewed and it is argued that gas dynamical
schemes are favourable compared to stellar dynamical schemes which could
however be important feeding mechanisms for the growth of the black hole. A new
self-similar model of a collapse of a self-gravitating disk due to radiation
induced stresses applicable to two different situations of radiative viscosity
and Compton drag is presented. The collapse timescale purely due to radiative
viscosity is found to be a fraction of Hubble time, $\tau_\gamma \sim{\sigma_T
c/ (m_p G)} ({L_{edd}/ L}) \simeq 6 \times 10^9$yrs is slow and probably
magnetic fields play an important role before general relativistic effects take
over. A model of self-gravitating disk collapsing due to Compton drag by the
Cosmic Microwave Background is also presented which is found to be effective at
redshifts $1400>z\gsim 300$. It is proposed that the small $\lsim 10^5 \Msun$
objects that form by this mechanism by $z \sim 20$ can merge and coalesce by
dynamical friction to form the high redshift quasars seen. Supermassive stars
which are systems (and could be end products of a supermassive disk phase) en
route to the final collapse are also briefly reviewed.
