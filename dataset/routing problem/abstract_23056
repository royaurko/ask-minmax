We analyze a class of linear wave equations for odd half spin that have a
well posed initial value problem. We demonstrate consistency of the equations
in curved space-times. They generalize the Weyl neutrino equation. We show that
there exists an associated invariant exact set of spinor fields indicating that
the characteristic initial value problem on a null cone is formally solvable,
even for the system coupled to general relativity. We derive the general
analytic solution in flat space by means of Fourier transforms. Finally, we
present a twistor contour integral description for the general analytic
solution and assemble a representation of the group $O(4,4)$ on the solution
space.
