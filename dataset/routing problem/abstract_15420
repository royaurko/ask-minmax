Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown great performance as a global
representation for object recognition. However, for multi-label images that
contain multiple objects from different categories, scales and locations,
single CNN features might not be be optimal. To enhance the robustness and
discriminative power of CNN features for multi-label object recognition
problem, we propose a multi-view multi-instance framework. This framework
transforms the multi-label classification problem into a multi-class
multi-instance learning problem by extracting object proposals from images. A
multi-view pipeline is then applied to generate a two-view representation of
each proposal by exploiting two levels of labels in multi-label recognition
problem. The proposed framework not only has the flexibility of utilizing both
weak and strong labels or just weak labels, but also holds the generalization
ability to boost the performance of unseen categories by available strong
labels. Our framework is extensively compared with state-of-the-art
hand-crafted feature based and CNN based methods on two multi-label benchmark
datasets. The experimental results validate the discriminative power and
generalization ability of the proposed framework. When combined with a
very-deep network, we can achieve state-of-the-art results in both datasets.
