Simulations of dense stellar systems currently face two major hurdles, one
astrophysical and one computational. The astrophysical problem lies in the fact
that several major stages in binary evolution, such as common envelope
evolution, are still poorly understood. The best we can do in these cases is to
parametrize our ignorance, in a way that is reminiscent of the introduction of
a mixing length to describe convection in a single star, or an alpha parameter
in modeling an accretion disk. The hope is that by modeling a whole star
cluster in great detail, and comparing the results to the wealth of
observational data currently available, we will be able to constrain the
parameters that capture the unknown physics. The computational problem is one
of composition: while we have accurate computer codes for modeling stellar
dynamics, stellar hydrodynamics, and stellar evolution, we currently have no
good way to put all this knowledge together in a single software environment. A
year ago, a loosely-knit organization was founded to address these problems,
MODEST for MOdeling DEnse STellar systems, with nine working groups and a
series of meetings that are held every half year. This report reviews the first
year of this initiative. Much more detail can be found on the MODEST web site
