The present paper is devoted to the {\it local moment problem}, which
consists in finding of non-decreasing functions on the real axis having given
first $2n+1, \; n\geq 0,$ power moments on the whole axis and also $2m+1$ first
power moments on a certain finite axis interval. Considering the local moment
problem as a combination of the Hausdorff and Hamburger truncated moment
problems we obtain the conditions of its solvability and describe the class of
its solutions with minimal number of growth points if the problem is solvable.
