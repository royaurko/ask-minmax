We perform geometrization of genetics by representing genetic information by
points of the 4-adic {\it information space.} By well known theorem of number
theory this space can also be represented as the 2-adic space. The process of
DNA-reproduction is described by the action of a 4-adic (or equivalently
2-adic) dynamical system. As we know, the genes contain information for
production of proteins. The genetic code is a degenerate map of codons to
proteins. We model this map as functioning of a polynomial dynamical system.
The purely mathematical problem under consideration is to find a dynamical
system reproducing the degenerate structure of the genetic code. We present one
of possible solutions of this problem.
