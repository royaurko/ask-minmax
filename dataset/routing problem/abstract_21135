Recently the problem of constructing a perfect Euler cuboid was related with
three conjectures asserting the irreducibility of some certain three
polynomials depending on integer parameters. In this paper a partial result
toward proving the first cuboid conjecture is obtained. The polynomial which,
according to this conjecture, should be irreducible over integers is proved to
have no integer roots.
