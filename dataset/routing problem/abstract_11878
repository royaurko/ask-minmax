We show that two-dimensional convection-diffusion problems with a radial sink
or source at the origin may be recast as a pure diffusion problem in a
fictitious space in which the spatial dimension is continuously-tunable with
the Peclet number. This formulation allows us to probe various
diffusion-controlled processes in non-integer dimensions.
