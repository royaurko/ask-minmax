We analyze the generation and mobility of discrete solitons in Bose-Einstein
condensates confined in an optical lattice under realistic experimental
conditions. We discuss first the creation of 1D discrete solitons, for both
attractive and repulsive interatomic interactions. We then address the issue of
their mobility, focusing our attention on the conditions for the experimental
observability of the Peierls-Nabarro barrier. Finally we report on the
generation of self-trapped structures in two and three dimensions. Discrete
solitons may open alternative routes for the manipulation and transport of
Bose-Einstein condensates.
