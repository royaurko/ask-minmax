We study an online model of fair division designed to capture features of a
real world charity problem. We consider two simple mechanisms for this model in
which agents simply declare what items they like. We analyse several axiomatic
properties of these mechanisms like strategy-proofness and envy-freeness.
Finally, we perform a competitive analysis and compute the price of anarchy.
