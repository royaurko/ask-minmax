Multi-valued networks provide a simple yet expressive qualitative state based
modelling approach for biological systems. In this paper we develop an
abstraction theory for asynchronous multi-valued network models that allows the
state space of a model to be reduced while preserving key properties of the
model. The abstraction theory therefore provides a mechanism for coping with
the state space explosion problem and supports the analysis and comparison of
multi-valued networks. We take as our starting point the abstraction theory for
synchronous multi-valued networks which is based on the finite set of traces
that represent the behaviour of such a model. The problem with extending this
approach to the asynchronous case is that we can now have an infinite set of
traces associated with a model making a simple trace inclusion test infeasible.
To address this we develop a decision procedure for checking asynchronous
abstractions based on using the finite state graph of an asynchronous
multi-valued network to reason about its trace semantics. We illustrate the
abstraction techniques developed by considering a detailed case study based on
a multi-valued network model of the regulation of tryptophan biosynthesis in
Escherichia coli.
