This is a review of the problem of Mutually Unbiased Bases in finite
dimensional Hilbert spaces, real and complex. Also a geometric measure of
"mubness" is introduced, and applied to some recent calculations in six
dimensions (partly done by Bjorck and by Grassl). Although this does not yet
solve any problem, some appealing structures emerge.
