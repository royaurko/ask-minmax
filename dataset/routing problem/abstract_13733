Under analysis is travel of P-waves in an elastic pipe partly embedded in
soil with dry friction. The mathematical formulation of the problem on impact
pipe driving in soil is based on the model of axial vibration of an elastic
bar, considering lateral resistance described using the law of solid dry
friction. The contributor solves problems on axial load on pipe in interaction with
external elastic medium, and compares the analytical and numerical results
obtained with and without accounting for the external medium deformability.
