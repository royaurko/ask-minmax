In this paper, we consider the problem of building a conformal boundary,
embedding a pseudo-Riamnnian manifold as an open subset of a bigger one. We get
first results about conformal maximality. We also show that in dimension $\geq
3$, there are rigidity properties for the topological boundary of such a
conformal embedding. We get results of the same kind about general Cartan
geometries.
