Resource constrained shortest path problems are usually solved by label
algorithms, which consist in a smart enumeration of the non-dominated paths.
Recent improvements of these algorithms rely on the use of bounds on path
resources to discard partial solutions. The quality of the bounds determines
the performance of the algorithm. The main contribution of this paper is to
introduce a standard procedure to generate bounds on paths resources in a
general setting which covers most resource constrained shortest path problems,
among which stochastic versions.
  In that purpose, we introduce a generalization of the resource constrained
shortest path problem where the resources are taken in a monoid. The resource
of a path is the monoid sum of the resources of its arcs. The problem consists
in finding a path whose resource minimizes a non-decreasing cost function of
the path resource among the paths that respect a given constraint. Label
algorithms are generalized to this framework. We use lattice theory to provide
a polynomial procedure to find good quality bounds. The efficiency of the
approach is proved through an extensive numerical study in the case of the
Stochastic Resource Constrained Shortest Path problem.
