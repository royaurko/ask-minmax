We study multi-parameter regularization (multiple penalties) for solving
linear inverse problems to promote simultaneously distinct features of the
sought-for objects. We revisit a balancing principle for choosing
regularization parameters from the viewpoint of augmented Tikhonov
regularization, and derive a new parameter choice strategy called the
\textit{balanced discrepancy principle}. A priori and a posteriori error
estimates are provided to theoretically justify the principles, and numerical
algorithms for efficiently implementing the principles are also provided.
Numerical results on denoising are presented to illustrate the feasibility of
the balanced discrepancy principle.
