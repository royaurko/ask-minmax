Nurse rostering is a complex scheduling problem that affects hospital
personnel on a daily basis all over the world. This paper presents a new
component-based approach with evolutionary eliminations, for a nurse scheduling
problem arising at a major UK hospital. The main idea behind this technique is
to decompose a schedule into its components (i.e. the allocated shift pattern
of each nurse), and then to implement two evolutionary elimination strategies
mimicking natural selection and natural mutation process on these components
respectively to iteratively deliver better schedules. The worthiness of all
components in the schedule has to be continuously demonstrated in order for
them to remain there. This demonstration employs an evaluation function which
evaluates how well each component contributes towards the final objective. Two
elimination steps are then applied: the first elimination eliminates a number
of components that are deemed not worthy to stay in the current schedule; the
second elimination may also throw out, with a low level of probability, some
worthy components. The eliminated components are replenished with new ones
using a set of constructive heuristics using local optimality criteria.
Computational results using 52 data instances demonstrate the applicability of
the proposed approach in solving real-world problems.
