This article presents counter examples for three articles claiming that P=NP.
Articles for which it applies are: Moustapha Diaby "P = NP: Linear programming
formulation of the traveling salesman problem" and "Equality of complexity
classes P and NP: Linear programming formulation of the quadratic assignment
problem", and also Sergey Gubin "A Polynomial Time Algorithm for The Traveling
Salesman Problem"
