We study a finite SU(5) grand unified model based on the non-Abelian discrete
symmetry A_4. This model leads to the democratic structure of the mass matrices
for the quarks and leptons. In the soft supersymmetry breaking sector, the
scalar trilinear couplings are aligned and the soft scalar masses are
degenerate, thus solving the SUSY flavor problem.
