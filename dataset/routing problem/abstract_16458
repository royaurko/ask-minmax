Structure occurs over a vast range of scales in the universe. Our large-scale
cosmological models are coarse-grained representations of what exists, which
have much less structure than there really is. An important problem for
cosmology is determining the influence the small-scale structure in the
universe has on its large-scale dynamics and observations. Is there a
significant, general relativistic, backreaction effect from averaging over
structure? One issue is whether the process of smoothing over structure can
contribute to an acceleration term and so alter the apparent value of the
cosmological constant. If this is not the case, are there other aspects of
concordance cosmology that are affected by backreaction effects? Despite much
progress, this 'averaging problem' is still unanswered, but it cannot be
ignored in an era of precision cosmology.
