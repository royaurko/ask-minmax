We study the parameterized complexity of the classical Edge Hamiltonian Path
problem and give several fixed-parameter tractability results. First, we settle
an open question of Demaine et al. by showing that Edge Hamiltonian Path is FPT
parameterized by vertex cover, and that it also admits a cubic kernel. We then
show fixed-parameter tractability even for a generalization of the problem to
arbitrary hypergraphs, parameterized by the size of a (supplied) hitting set.
We also consider the problem parameterized by treewidth or clique-width.
Surprisingly, we show that the problem is FPT for both of these standard
parameters, in contrast to its vertex version, which is W-hard for
clique-width. Our technique, which may be of independent interest, relies on a
structural characterization of clique-width in terms of treewidth and complete
bipartite subgraphs due to Gurski and Wanke.
