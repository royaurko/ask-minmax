In this paper we study lifted inference for the Weighted First-Order Model
Counting problem (WFOMC), which counts the assignments that satisfy a given
sentence in first-order logic (FOL); it has applications in Statistical
Relational Learning (SRL) and Probabilistic Databases (PDB). We present several
results. First, we describe a lifted inference algorithm that generalizes prior
approaches in SRL and PDB. Second, we provide a novel dichotomy result for a
non-trivial fragment of FO CNF sentences, showing that for each sentence the
WFOMC problem is either in PTIME or #P-hard in the size of the input domain; we
prove that, in the first case our algorithm solves the WFOMC problem in PTIME,
and in the second case it fails. Third, we present several properties of the
algorithm. Finally, we discuss limitations of lifted inference for symmetric
probabilistic databases (where the weights of ground literals depend only on
the relation name, and not on the constants of the domain), and prove the
impossibility of a dichotomy result for the complexity of probabilistic
inference for the entire language FOL.
