Understanding animal movements and modelling the routes they travel can be
essential in studies of pathogen transmission dynamics. Pathogen biology is
also of crucial importance, defining the manner in which infectious agents are
transmitted. In this article we investigate animal movement with relevance to
pathogen transmission by physical rather than airborne contact, using the
domestic chicken and its protozoan parasite Eimeria as an example. We have
obtained a configuration for the maximum possible distance that a chicken can
walk through straight and non-overlapping paths (defined in this paper) on
square grid graphs. We have obtained preliminary results for such walks which
can be practically adopted and tested as a foundation to improve understanding
of non-airborne pathogen transmission. Linking individual non-overlapping walks
within a grid-delineated area can be used to support modeling of the frequently
repetitive, overlapping walks characteristic of the domestic chicken, providing
a framework to model faecal deposition and subsequent parasite dissemination by
faecal/host contact.We also pose an open problem on multiple walks on finite
grid graphs. These results grew from biological insights and have potential
applications. Keywords: Spread of bird diseases, Eimeria, Maximum walks,
