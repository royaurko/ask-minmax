Some inverse problems for semi-infinite periodic generalized Jacobi matrices
are considered. In particular, a generalization of the Abel criterion is
presented. The approach is based on the fact that the solvability of the
Pell-Abel equation is equivalent to the existence of a certainly normalized
$J$-unitary $2\times 2$-matrix polynomial (the monodromy matrix).
