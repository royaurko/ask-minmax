We consider the problem of existential quantifier elimination for Boolean
formulas in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). We present a new method for solving
this problem called Derivation of Dependency-Sequents (DDS). A
Dependency-sequent (D-sequent) is used to record that a set of quantified
variables is redundant under a partial assignment. We introduce a
resolution-like operation called join that produces a new D-sequent from two
existing D-sequents. We also show that DDS is compositional, i.e. if our input
formula is a conjunction of independent formulas, DDS automatically recognizes
and exploits this information. We introduce an algorithm based on DDS and
present experimental results demonstrating its potential.
