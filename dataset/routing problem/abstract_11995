Lovasz and Schrijver, and later Lasserre, proposed hierarchies of
semidefinite programming relaxations for general 0/1 linear programming
problems. In this paper these two constructions are revisited and two new,
block-diagonal hierarchies are proposed. They have the advantage of being
computationally less costly while being at least as strong as the
Lovasz-Schrijver hierarchy. Our construction is applied to the stable set
problem and experimental results for Paley graphs are reported.
