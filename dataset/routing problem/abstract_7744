We study the boundary value problem for the stationary rotating black hole
solutions to the five-dimensional vacuum Einstein equation. Assuming the two
commuting rotational symmetry and the sphericity of the horizon topology, we
show that the black hole is uniquely characterized by the mass, and a pair of
the angular momenta.
