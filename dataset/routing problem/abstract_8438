We prove existence and nonexistence results for certain differential forms in
positive characteristic, called {\em good deformation data}. Some of these
results are obtained by reduction modulo $p$ of Belyi maps. As an application,
we solve the local lifting problem for groups with Sylow $p$-subgroup of order
$p$.
