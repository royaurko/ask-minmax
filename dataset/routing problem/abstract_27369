In the context of sensor networks, gossip algorithms are a popular, well
esthablished technique for achieving consensus when sensor data is encoded in
linear spaces. Gossip algorithms also have several extensions to non linear
data spaces. Most of these extensions deal with Riemannian manifolds and use
Riemannian gradient descent. This paper, instead, exhibits a very simple metric
property that do not rely on any differential structure. This property strongly
suggests that gossip algorithms could be studied on a broader family than
Riemannian manifolds. And it turns out that, indeed, (local) convergence is
guaranteed as soon as the data space is a mere $CAT(\kappa)$ metric space. We
also study convergence speed in this setting and establish linear rates for
$CAT(0)$ spaces, and local linear rates for $CAT(\kappa)$ spaces with $\kappa >
0$. Numerical simulations on several scenarii, with corresponding state spaces
that are either Riemannian manifolds -- as in the problem of positive definite
matrices consensus -- or bare metric spaces -- as in the problem of arms
consensus -- validate the results. This shows that not only does our metric
approach allows for a simpler and more general mathematical analysis but also
paves the way for new kinds of applications that go beyond the Riemannian
setting.
