Building on a variant of the Jarzynski equation we propose a new method to
numerically determine the prior-predictive value in a Bayesian inference
problem. The method generalizes thermodynamic integration and is not hampered
by equilibration problems. We demonstrate its operation by applying it to two
simple examples and elucidate its performance. In the case of multi-modal
posterior distributions the performance is superior to thermodynamic
integration.
