This paper is concerned with the numerical solution of a class of variational
inequalities of the second kind, involving the $p$-Laplacian operator. This
kind of problems arise, for instance, in the mathematical modelling of
non-Newtonian fluids. We study these problems by using a regularization
approach, based on a Huber smoothing process. Well posedness of the regularized
problems is proved, and convergence of the regularized solutions to the
solution of the original problem is verified. We propose a preconditioned
descent method for the numerical solution of these problems and analyze the
convergence of this method in function spaces. The existence of admissible
descent directions is established by variational methods and admissible steps
are obtained by a line search algorithm, which combines the classical Armijo's
rule with an interpolation technique. Finally, several numerical experiments
are carried out to show the efficiency of the methodology here introduced.
