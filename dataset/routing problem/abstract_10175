The maximum clique problem is a well known NP-Hard problem with applications
in data mining, network analysis, information retrieval and many other areas
related to the World Wide Web. There exist several algorithms for the problem
with acceptable runtimes for certain classes of graphs, but many of them are
infeasible for massive graphs. We present a new exact algorithm that employs
novel pruning techniques and is able to find maximum cliques in very large,
sparse graphs quickly. Extensive experiments on different kinds of synthetic
and real-world graphs show that our new algorithm can be orders of magnitude
faster than existing algorithms. We also present a heuristic that runs orders
of magnitude faster than the exact algorithm while providing optimal or
near-optimal solutions. We illustrate a simple application of the algorithms in
developing methods for detection of overlapping communities in networks.
