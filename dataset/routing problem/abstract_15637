The Klein-Gordon equation in the Rindler space-time is studied carefully. It
is shown that the stable properties depend on using what time coordinate to
define the initial time. If we use the Rindler time, the scalar field is
stable. Alternatively, if we use the Minkowski time, the scalar field may be
regarded unstable to some extent. Furthermore, the complete extension of the
Rindler space time is the Minkowski space time, we could also study the stable
problem of the Rindler space time by the Klein-Gordon equation completely in
the Minkowski coordinates system. The results support that the Rindler space
time is really unstable. This in turn might cast some lights on the stable
problem of the Schwarzschild black-hole, which not only in many aspects shares
the similar geometrical properties with the Rindler space time but also has the
very same situation in stable study as that in Rindler space time. So, it is
not unreasonable to infer that the Schwarzschild black hole might really be
unstable in comparison with the case in Rindler space time. Of course, one must
go further to get the conclusion definitely.
