On a fixed smooth compact Riemann surface with boundary $(M_0,g)$, we show
that the Cauchy data space (or Dirichlet-to-Neumann map $\mc{N}$) of the
Schr\"odinger operator $\Delta +V$ with $V\in C^2(M_0)$ determines uniquely the
potential $V$. We also discuss briefly the corresponding consequences for
potential scattering at 0 frequency on Riemann surfaces with asymptotically
Euclidean or asymptotically hyperbolic ends.
