Let $L/K$ be a Galois extension of number fields. The problem of counting the
number of prime ideals $\mathfrak p$ of $K$ with fixed Frobenius class in
$\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$ and norm satisfying a congruence condition is considered.
We show that the square of the error term arising from the Chebotar\"ev Density
Theorem for this problem is small "on average." The result may be viewed as a
variation on the classical Barban-Davenport-Halberstam Theorem.
