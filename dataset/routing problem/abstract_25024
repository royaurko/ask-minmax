Solutions to the classic problems of dealing with heterogeneous data and
making entire collections interoperable while ensuring that any annotation,
which includes the recognition-and-reward system of scientific publishing, need
to fit into a seamless beginning to end to attract large numbers of end users.
The latest trend in Web applications encourages highly interactive Web sites
with rich user interfaces featuring content integrated from various sources
around the Web. The obvious potential of RDF, SPARQL, and OWL to provide
flexible data modeling, easier data integration, and networked data access may
be the answer to the classic problems. Using Semantic Web technologies we have
created a Web application, the ConceptWiki, as an end-to-end solution for
creating browserbased readwrite triples using RDF, which focus on data
integration and ease of use for the end user. Here we will demonstrate the
integration of a biological data source, the ENZYME database, into the
ConceptWiki and it's representation in RDF.
