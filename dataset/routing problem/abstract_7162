This paper is concerned with a multi-dimensional free boundary problem
modeling the growth of a tumor with two species of cells: proliferating cells
and quiescent cells. This free boundary problem has a unique radial stationary
solution. By using the Fourier expansion of functions on unit sphere via
spherical harmonics, we establish some decay estimates for the solution of the
linearized system of this tumor model at the radial stationary solution, so
that proving that the radial stationary solution is linearly asymptotically
stable when neglecting translations.
