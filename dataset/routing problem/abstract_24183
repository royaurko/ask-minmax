A unified theory of orthogonal polynomials of a discrete variable is
presented through the eigenvalue problem of hermitian matrices of finite or
infinite dimensions. It can be considered as a matrix version of exactly
solvable Schr\"odinger equations. The hermitian matrices (factorisable
Hamiltonians) are real symmetric tri-diagonal (Jacobi) matrices corresponding
to second order difference equations. By solving the eigenvalue problem in two
different ways, the duality relation of the eigenpolynomials and their dual
polynomials is explicitly established. Through the techniques of exact
Heisenberg operator solution and shape invariance, various quantities, the two
types of eigenvalues (the eigenvalues and the sinusoidal coordinates), the
coefficients of the three term recurrence, the normalisation measures and the
normalisation constants etc. are determined explicitly.
