The aim of this note is to discuss the following quite queer Problem:
\noindent GIVEN \noindent i) the free non-commutative polynomial ring, ${\Cal
P} := {\Bbb F}\langle X_1,\ldots,X_n\rangle$ {\em (public)}, \noindent ii) a
bilateral ideal ${\sf I}\subset {\Bbb F}\langle X_1,\ldots,X_n\rangle$ {\em
(private)}, \noindent iii) a finite set $G := \{g_1,\ldots,g_l\}\subset{\sf I}$
of elements of the ideal ${\sf I}$ {\em (public)}, \noindent a noetherian
semigroup term-ordering $\prec,$ {\rm (private)}, on the word semigroup ${\Cal
T} := < X_1,\ldots,X_n>$, \noindent COMPUTE \noindent --a finite subset
$H\subset\Gamma({\sf I})$ of the Gr\"obner basis $\Gamma({\sf I})$ of ${\sf I}$
w.r.t. $\prec$ s.t., for each $g_i\in G$ its {\em normal form} $NF(g_i,H)$
w.r.t. $H$ is zero, \noindent "by means of a finite number of queries to an
oracle", which, \noindent given a term $\tau\in{\Cal T}$ returns its {\em
canonical form} $\Can(\tau,{\sf I},\prec)$ w.r.t. the ideal ${\sf I}$ and the
term-ordering $\prec$. \qed This queer problem has been suggested to us by
Bulygin (2005) where a similar problem, but with stronger assumptions, is faced
in order to set up a chosen-cyphertext attack against the cryptographic system
proposed in Rai (2004).
