We consider graphene in a strong perpendicular magnetic field at zero
temperature with an integral number of filled Landau levels and study the
dispersion of single particle-hole excitations. We first analyze the two-body
problem of a single Dirac electron and hole in a magnetic field interacting via
Coulomb forces. We then turn to the many-body problem, where particle-hole
symmetry and the existence of two valleys lead to a number of effects peculiar
to graphene. We find that the coupling together of a large number of low-lying
excitations leads to strong many-body corrections, which could be observed in
inelastic light scattering or optical absorption. We also discuss in detail how
the appearance of different branches in the exciton dispersion is sensitive to
the number of filled spin and valley sublevels.
