Mobile Adhoc Network is a kind of wireless ad hoc network where nodes are
connected wirelessly and the network is self configuring. MANET may work in a
standalone manner or may be a part of another network. In this paper we have
compared Random Walk Mobility Model and Random Waypoint Mobility Model over two
reactive routing protocols Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Adhoc On-Demand
Distance Vector Routing (AODV) protocol and one Proactive routing protocol
Distance Sequenced Distance Vector Routing (DSDV) Our analysis showed that DSR,
AODV & DSDV under Random Walk and Random Way Point Mobility models have similar
results for similar inputs however as the pause time increases so does the
difference in performance rises. They show that their motion, direction, angle
of direction, speed is same under both mobility models. We have made their
analysis on packet delivery ratio, throughput and routing overhead. We have
tested them with different criteria like different number of nodes, speed and
different maximum number of connections.
