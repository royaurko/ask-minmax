Diffractive dissociation processes are analysed in the framework of covariant
reggeization. We have considered the general form of hadronic tensor and its
asymptotic behaviour for $t\rightarrow 0$ in the case of conserved tensor
currents before reggeization. Resulting expressions for differential
cross-section of single dissociation (SD) process ($pp \rightarrow p M$),
double dissociation (DD) ($pp\rightarrow M_1 M_2$) and for the proton-Pomeron
cross-section are given in detail, and corresponding problems of the approach
are discussed.
