Toy cosmological models based on non-minimal coupling between gravity and
scalar dilaton-like field are presented in the framework of Palatini formalism.
They have the following property: preceding to a given cosmological epoch is a
dark energy epoch with an accelerated expansion. The next (future) epoch
becomes dominated by some kind of dark matter.
