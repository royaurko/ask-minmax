The mapping of steady-state nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory from
the lattice to the impurity is described in detail. Our focus is on the case
with current flow under a constant dc electric field of arbitrary magnitude. In
addition to formulating the problem via path integrals and functional
derivatives, we also describe the distribution function dependence of the
retarded and advanced Green's functions. Our formal developments are exact for
the Falicov-Kimball model. We also show how these formal developments are
modified for more complicated models (like the Hubbard model).
