A classical result from graph theory is that every graph with chromatic
number \chi > t contains a subgraph with all degrees at least t, and therefore
contains a copy of every t-edge tree. Bohman, Frieze, and Mubayi recently posed
this problem for r-uniform hypergraphs. An r-tree is an r-uniform hypergraph
with no pair of edges intersecting in more than one vertex, and no sequence of
distinct vertices and edges (v_1, e_1, ..., v_k, e_k) with all e_i \ni {v_i,
v_{i+1}}, where we take v_{k+1} to be v_1. Bohman, Frieze, and Mubayi proved
that \chi > 2rt is sufficient to embed every r-tree with t edges, and asked
whether the dependence on r was necessary. In this note, we completely solve
their problem, proving the tight result that \chi > t is sufficient to embed
any r-tree with t edges.
