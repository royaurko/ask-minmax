We address the problem of computing the fundamental group of a symplectic
$S^1$-manifold for non-Hamiltonian actions on compact manifolds, and for
Hamiltonian actions on non-compact manifolds with a proper moment map. We
generalize known results for compact manifolds equipped with a Hamiltonian
$S^1$-action. Several examples are presented to illustrate our main results.
