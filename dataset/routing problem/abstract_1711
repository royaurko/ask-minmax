The method of coordinate transformation offers a way to realize perfect
cloaks, but provides less ability to characterize the performance of a
multilayered cloak in practice. Here, we propose an analytical model to predict
the performance of a multilayered cylindrical cloak, based on which, the cloak
in practice can be optimized to diminish the intrinsic scatterings caused by
discretization and simplification. Extremely low scattering or "quasi-perfect
invisibility" can be achieved with only a few layers of anisotropic
metamaterials without following the transformation method. Meanwhile, the
permittivity and permeability parameters of the layers are relatively small,
which is a remarkable advantage of our approach.
