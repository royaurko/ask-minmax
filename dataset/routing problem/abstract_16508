We examine a proof by Craig Alan Feinstein that P is not equal to NP. We
present counterexamples to claims made in his paper and expose a flaw in the
methodology he uses to make his assertions. The fault in his argument is the
incorrect use of reduction. Feinstein makes incorrect assumptions about the
complexity of a problem based on the fact that there is a more complex problem
that can be used to solve it. His paper introduces the terminology "imaginary
processor" to describe how it is possible to beat the brute force reduction he
offers to solve the Subset-Sum problem. The claims made in the paper would not
be validly established even were imaginary processors to exist.
