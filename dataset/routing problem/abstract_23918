We prove the existence and uniqueness of solution to a classical creep damage
problem. We formulate a sufficient condition for the problem to have a unique
smooth solution, locally in time. This condition is stated in terms of
smoothness of given data, such as solid geometry, boundary conditions, applied
loads, and initial conditions. Counterexamples with an arbitrary small lifetime
of a structure are also given, showing the mechanical interpretation of imposed
smoothness conditions. The proposed theory gives a rigorous framework for a
strain localization analysis. The influence of the damage gradient on the
strain localization process is characterized within this framework and a
measure of the damage localization is proposed.
