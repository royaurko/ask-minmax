Here is suggested a solution to the accommodation-vergence mismatch problem
in 3D stereoscopic displays. It can be achieved by compensating the mismatched
focal length with refractive power of adjustable-focus 3D glasses. The
compensation would make vergence of human eyes match with position of virtual
stereoscopic motion pictures, reducing visual fatigue.
