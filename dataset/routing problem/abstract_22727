We present a novel RG approach to 2D random XY models using direct and
replicated Coulomb gas methods. By including fusion of environments (charge
fusion in the replicated CG) it follows the distribution of local disorder,
found to obey a Kolmogorov non linear equation (KPP) with traveling wave
solutions. At low T and weak disorder it yields a glassy XY phase with broad
distributions and precise connections to Derrida's GREM. Finding marginal
operators at the disorder-induced transition is related to the front velocity
selection problem in KPP equations yielding new critical behaviour. The method
is applied to critical random Dirac problems.
