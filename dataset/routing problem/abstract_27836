We consider a dynamic matching model with random arrivals. In prior work,
contributors have proposed policies that are stabilizing, and also policies that are
approximately finite-horizon optimal. This paper considers the infinite-horizon
average-cost optimal control problem.
  A relaxation of the stochastic control problem is proposed, which is found to
be a special case of an inventory model, as treated in the classical theory of
Clark and Scarf. The optimal policy for the relaxation admits a closed-form
expression. Based on the policy for this relaxation, a new matching policy is
proposed. For a parameterized family of models in which the network load
approaches capacity, this policy is shown to be approximately optimal, with
bounded regret, even though the average cost grows without bound.
