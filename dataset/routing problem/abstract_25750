Let $\xi$ be a real random variable with mean zero and variance one and
$A={a_1,...,a_n}$ be a multi-set in $\R^d$. The random sum
  $$S_A := a_1 \xi_1 + ... + a_n \xi_n $$ where $\xi_i$ are iid copies of $\xi$
is of fundamental importance in probability and its applications.
  We discuss the small ball problem, the aim of which is to estimate the
maximum probability that $S_A$ belongs to a ball with given small radius,
following the discovery made by Littlewood-Offord and Erdos almost 70 years
ago. We will mainly focus on recent developments that characterize the
structure of those sets $A$ where the small ball probability is relatively
large. Applications of these results include full solutions or significant
progresses of many open problems in different areas.
