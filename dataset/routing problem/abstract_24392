We demonstrate the application of our 3D radiative transfer framework in the
model atmosphere code PHOENIX/3D for a number of spectrum synthesis
calculations for very different conditions. The 3DRT framework discussed in the
previous papers of this series was added to our general-purpose model
atmosphere code PHOENIX/1D and an extended 3D version PHOENIX/3D was created.
The \phxT code is parallelized via the MPI library using a hierarchical domain
decomposition and displays very good strong scaling. We present the results of
several test cases for widely different atmosphere conditions and compare the
3D calculations with equivalent 1D models to assess the internal accuracy of
the 3D modeling. In addition, we show the results for a number of parameterized
3D structures. With presently available computational resources it is possible
to solve the full 3D radiative transfer (including scattering) problem with the
same micro-physics as included in 1D modeling.
