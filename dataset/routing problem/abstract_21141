In this paper we interpret the solutions to a particular Galois embedding
problem over an extension K/F whose Galois group is a finite, cyclic p group in
terms of certain Galois submodules within the parameterizing space of
elementary p-abelian extensions of K; here p is a prime. Combined with some
basic facts about the module structure of this parameterizing space, this
allows us to exhibit a class of p-groups whose realization multiplicity is
unbounded.
