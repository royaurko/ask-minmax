We consider the problem of inference on a regression function at a point when
the entire function satisfies a sign or shape restriction under the null. We
propose a test that achieves the optimal minimax rate adaptively over a range
of Holder classes, up to a log log n term, which we show to be necessary for
adaptation. We apply the results to adaptive one-sided tests for the regression
discontinuity parameter under a monotonicity restriction, the value of a
monotone regression function at the boundary, and the proportion of true null
hypotheses in a multiple testing problem.
