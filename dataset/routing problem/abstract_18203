Consider a set of clients in a broadcast network, each of which holds a
subset of packets in the ground set $X$. In the (coded) cooperative data
exchange problem, the clients need to recover all packets in $X$ by exchanging
coded packets over a lossless broadcast channel. Several previous works
analyzed this problem under the assumption that each client initially holds a
random subset of packets in $X$. In this paper we consider a generalization of
this problem for settings in which an unknown (but of a certain size) subset of
clients are unreliable and their packet transmissions are subject to arbitrary
erasures. For the special case of one unreliable client, we derive a
closed-form expression for the minimum number of transmissions required for
each reliable client to obtain all packets held by other reliable clients (with
probability approaching $1$ as the number of packets ($K$) tends to infinity).
Furthermore, for the cases with more than one unreliable client, we provide an
approximation solution in which the number of transmissions per packet
(normalized by $K$) is within an arbitrarily small additive factor from the the
value of the optimal solution.
