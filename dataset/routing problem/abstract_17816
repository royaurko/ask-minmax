In order to integrate numerically a well-posed multiscale evolutionary
problem such as a Cauchy problem for an ODE system or a PDE system, using
time-subcycling techniques con- sists in splitting the vector field in a fast
part and a slow part and take advantage of this decomposition, for example by
integrating the fast equation on a much smaller time step than the slow
equation (instead of having to integrate the whole system with a very small
time step to ensure stability for example). These techniques are designed to
improve the computational efficiency and have been been very widely used for
schemes, that may have (at least) one com- ponent that has to be computed
through an explicit scheme thus constrained by a limitation of the time step
(CFL). In this paper, we study the long time behavior of such schemes, that are
primarily designed to be convergent in short-time to the solution of the
original problem. We develop our analysis on ODE toy-models and illustrate our
results numerically on more complex PDE systems.
