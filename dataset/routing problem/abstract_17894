An ill-posed problem of synthesis of the Pierce electrodes for a cylindrical
beam with a polygonal cross-section is considered. It is assumed that a beam of
charged particles is extracted from a space-charge-limited planar diode and the
Pierce electrodes outside of the beam ensure its zero angular divergence. A
mathematical statement of the problem presumes a computation of the
electrostatic potential outside of the beam that should match the
Child-Langmuir 1D potential inside of the beam. An exact solution is first
obtained for the potential outside of the beam near its right angle. The
solution involves double analytic continuation and a numerical integration of
the hypergeometric function and can be used as a benchmark for testing
numerical codes. It is shown that equipotential surfaces have fractures that
can be pushed away from the corner of the beam by means of smoothing the beam
corners. This solution is then generalized to an angle of arbitrary magnitude.
