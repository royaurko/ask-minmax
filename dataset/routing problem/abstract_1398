We investigate the observed depletion of red giants in the cores of
post-core-collapse globular clusters. In particular, the evolutionary scenario
we consider is a binary consisting of two low-mass stars which undergoes two
common envelope phases. The first common envelope phase occurs when the primary
is a red giant resulting in a helium white dwarf and main sequence star in a
detached binary. The second common envelope phase occurs shortly after the
secondary becomes a red giant. During the second common envelope phase the
degenerate helium cores merge resulting in a core mass greater than the helium
burning limit and the formation of a horizontal branch star. We show that this
evolutionary route is enhanced in post-core-collapse clusters by stellar
encounters. These encounters increase the population of binary secondaries
which would have evolved onto the red giant branch in the recent past.
