Some properties of a Local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) algorithm are
demonstrated for the problem of evaluting a second derivative $g = f_{xx}$ for
a given $f$. (This is a somewhat unusual problem, but it is useful for
understanding the initial transient response of an algorithm for diffusion
equations.) LDG uses an auxiliary variable to break this up into two first
order equations and then applies techniques by analogy to DG algorithms for
advection algorithms. This introduces an asymmetry into the solution that
depends on the choice of upwind directions for these two first order equations.
When using piecewise linear basis functions, this LDG solution $g_h$ is shown
not to converge in an $L_2$ norm because the slopes in each cell diverge.
However, when LDG is used in a time-dependent diffusion problem, this error in
the second derivative term is transient and rapidly decays away, so that the
overall error is bounded. I.e., the LDG approximation $f_h(x,t)$ for a
diffusion equation $\partial f / \partial t = f_{xx}$ converges to the proper
solution (as has been shown before), even though the initial rate of change
$\partial f_h / \partial t$ does not converge. We also show results from the
Recovery discontinuous Galerkin (RDG) approach, which gives symmetric solutions
that can have higher rates of convergence for a stencil that couples the same
number of cells.
