Let Y={f(i), Af(i),..., A^{li} f(i): i in Omega}, where A is a bounded
operator on l^2(I). The problem under consideration is to find necessary and
sufficient conditions on A, Omega, {l_i:i in Omega} in order to recover any f
\in l^2(I) from the measurements Y. This is the so called dynamical sampling
problem in which we seek to recover a function f by combining coarse samples of
f and its futures states A^l f. We completely solve this problem in finite
dimensional spaces, and for a large class of self adjoint operators in infinite
dimensional spaces. In the latter case, the M\"untz-Sz\'asz Theorem combined
with the Kadison-Singer/Feichtinger Theorem allows us to show that Y can never
be a Riesz basis when Omega is finite. We can also show that, when Omega is
finite, Y={f(i), Af(i),..., A^{li}f(i): i in Omega} is not a frame except for
some very special cases. The existence of these special cases is derived from
Carleson's Theorem for interpolating sequences in the Hardy space H^2(D).
