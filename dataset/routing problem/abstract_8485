We study a nonlinear equation with an elliptic operator having degenerate
coercivity. We prove the existence of a unique W^{1,1}_0 distributional
solution under suitable summability assumptions on the source in Lebesgue
spaces. Moreover, we prove that our problem has no solution if the source is a
Radon measure concentrated on a set of zero harmonic capacity.
