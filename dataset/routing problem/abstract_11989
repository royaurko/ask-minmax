The study of fractional variational problems with derivatives in the sense of
Caputo is a recent subject, the main results being Agrawal's necessary
optimality conditions of Euler-Lagrange and respective transversality
conditions. Using Agrawal's Euler-Lagrange equation and the Lagrange multiplier
technique, we obtain here a Noether-like theorem for fractional optimal control
problems in the sense of Caputo.
