An open problem in graphical Gaussian models is to determine the smallest
number of observations needed to guarantee the existence of the maximum
likelihood estimator of the covariance matrix with probability one. In this
paper we formalize a closely related problem in which the existence of the
maximum likelihood estimator is guaranteed for all generic observations. We
call the number determined by this problem the Gaussian rank of the graph
representing the model. We prove that the Gaussian rank is strictly between the
subgraph connectivity number and the graph degeneracy number. These bounds are
in general much sharper than the best bounds known in the literature and
furthermore computable in polynomial time.
