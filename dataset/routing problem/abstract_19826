A new more rigorous and accurate method for treating neutrino oscillations in
the context of the MSW effect in a medium is proposed. This leads to a new type
of resonance condition which for small mixing angles puts rather stringent
conditions on $E_{\nu}/\delta {m^2}$. The implications on the solar neutrino
problem are discussed.
