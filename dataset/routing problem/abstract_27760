In paper [S.I. Senashov, A. Yakhno. 2012. SIGMA. Vol.8. 071] the variant of
the hodograph method based on the conservation laws for two hyperbolic
quasilinear equations of the first order is described. Using these results we
propose a method which allows to reduce the Cauchy problem for the two
quasilinear PDE's to the Cauchy problem for ODE's. The proposed method is
actually some similar method of characteristics for a system of two hyperbolic
quasilinear equations. The method can be used effectively in all cases, when
the linear hyperbolic equation in partial derivatives of the second order with
variable coefficients, resulting from the application of the hodograph method,
has an explicit expression for the Riemann-Green function. One of the method's
features is the possibility to construct a multi-valued solutions. In this
paper we present examples of method application for solving the classical
shallow water equations.
