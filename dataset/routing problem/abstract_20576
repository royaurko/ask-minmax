A string field theory(SFT) nonlocal model of the cosmological dark energy
providing w<-1 is briefly surveyed. We summarize recent developments and open
problems, as well as point out some theoretical issues related with others
applications of the SFT nonlocal models in cosmology, in particular, in
inflation and cosmological singularity.
