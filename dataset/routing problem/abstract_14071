This is a sketch of a 321D approximation for stellar convection which is
nonlocal, and thus has nonzero fluxes of KE (to be published in more detail
elsewhere). Boundary conditions are discussed in a fluid dynamics context
(i.e., predictions for overshoot, semiconvection and entrainment are analyzed).
We plan to add this as an option to MESA. Inclusion of KE fluxes seems to help
resolve the solar abundance problem (Asplund 2009). Smaller cores may ease the
explosion problems with core collapse supernova simulations.
