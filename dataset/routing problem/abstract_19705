We further deconstruct Heraclitean Quantum Systems giving a model for a
universe using pregeometric notions in which the end-game problem is overcome
by means of self-referential noise. The model displays self-organisation with
the emergence of 3-space and time. The time phenomenon is richer than the
present geometric modelling.
