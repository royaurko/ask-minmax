We give the homotopy classification and compute the index of boundary value
problems for elliptic equations. The classical case of operators that satisfy
the Atiyah-Bott condition is studied first. We also consider the general case
of boundary value problems for operators that do not necessarily satisfy the
Atiyah-Bott condition.
