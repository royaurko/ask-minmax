Using a focused laser beam we stir a $^{87}$Rb Bose-Einstein condensate
confined in a magnetic trap. We observe that the steady states of the
condensate correspond to an elliptic cloud, stationary in the rotating frame.
These steady states depend nonlinearly on the stirring parameters (amplitude
and frequency), and various solutions can be reached experimentally depending
on the path followed in this parameter space. These states can be dynamically
unstable and we observe that such instabilities lead to vortex nucleation in
the condensate.
