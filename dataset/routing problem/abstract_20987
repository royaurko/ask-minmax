By resorting to sequential constructions of exchangeable random partitions
(Pitman, 2006), and exploiting some known facts about generalized Stirling
numbers, we derive a generalized Chinese restaurant process construction of
exchangeable Gibbs partitions of type $\alpha$ (Gnedin and Pitman, 2006). Our
construction represents the natural theoretical probabilistic framework in
which to embed some recent results about a Bayesian nonparametric treatment of
estimation problems arising in genetic experiment under Gibbs, species
sampling, models priors.
