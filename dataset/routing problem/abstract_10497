We consider the initial-value problem for a system of coupled Boussinesq
equations on the infinite line for localised or sufficiently rapidly decaying
initial data, generating sufficiently rapidly decaying right- and
left-propagating waves. We study the dynamics of weakly nonlinear waves, and
using asymptotic multiple-scales expansions and averaging with respect to the
fast time, we obtain a hierarchy of asymptotically exact coupled and uncoupled
Ostrovsky equations for unidirectional waves. We then construct a weakly
nonlinear solution of the initial-value problem in terms of solutions of the
derived Ostrovsky equations within the accuracy of the governing equations, and
show that there are no secular terms. When coupling parameters are equal to
zero, our results yield a weakly nonlinear solution of the initial-value
problem for the Boussinesq equation in terms of solutions of the initial-value
problems for two Korteweg-de Vries equations, integrable by the Inverse
Scattering Transform. We also perform relevant numerical simulations of the
original unapproximated system of Boussinesq equations to illustrate the
difference in the behaviour of its solutions for different asymptotic regimes.
