In spite of all the attempts conducted to improve the accuracy of the gravity
wave detectors in recent years, no method has been successful to measure these
waves up to now. Most of these detectors and laser interferometers work based
on the position measurement, because the use of such kind of measurement leads
to decreasing the accuracy of measurement, since it contributes to main
problems such as requiring strong interaction among different components of the
system. Maybe the main cause of failing is applying this kind of measurement. A
method in improving the accuracy of these detectors and decreasing such
problems is applying the momentum measurement. At present, no practical way to
measure momentum, in this paper, a theoretical scheme is presented to measure
momentum.
