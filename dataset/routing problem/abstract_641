A Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) is a collection of wireless mobile nodes
forming a temporary network without using any centralized access point,
infrastructure, or centralized administration. In this paper we introduce an
Energy Efficient Location Aided Routing (EELAR) Protocol for MANETs that is
based on the Location Aided Routing (LAR). EELAR makes significant reduction in
the energy consumption of the mobile nodes batteries by limiting the area of
discovering a new route to a smaller zone. Thus, control packets overhead is
significantly reduced. In EELAR a reference wireless base station is used and
the network's circular area centered at the base station is divided into six
equal sub-areas. At route discovery instead of flooding control packets to the
whole network area, they are flooded to only the sub-area of the destination
mobile node. The base station stores locations of the mobile nodes in a
position table. To show the efficiency of the proposed protocol we present
simulations using NS-2. Simulation results show that EELAR protocol makes an
improvement in control packet overhead and delivery ratio compared to AODV,
LAR, and DSR protocols.
