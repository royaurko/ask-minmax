Nonlinear systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) may permit several
distinct solutions. The typical current approach to finding distinct solutions
is to start Newton's method with many different initial guesses, hoping to find
starting points that lie in different basins of attraction. In this paper, we
present an infinite-dimensional deflation algorithm for systematically
modifying the residual of a nonlinear PDE problem to eliminate known solutions
from consideration. This enables the Newton--Kantorovitch iteration to converge
to several different solutions, even starting from the same initial guess. The
deflated Jacobian is dense, but an efficient preconditioning strategy is
devised, and the number of Krylov iterations is observed not to grow as
solutions are deflated. The power of the approach is demonstrated on several
problems from special functions, phase separation, differential geometry and
fluid mechanics that permit distinct solutions.
