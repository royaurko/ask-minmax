A group of n individuals who do not trust each other and are located far away
from each other, want to select a leader. This is the leader election problem,
a natural extension of the coin flipping problem to n players. We want a
protocol which will guarantee that an honest player will have almost 1/n chance
of winning, regardless of what the other players do (whether they are honest,
cheating alone or in groups). It is known to be impossible classically. This
work gives a simple algorithm that does it, based on the weak coin flipping
protocol with arbitrarily small bias recently derived by Mochon [2007]. The
protocol is quite simple to achieve if the number of rounds is linear; We
provide an improvement to logarithmic number of rounds.
