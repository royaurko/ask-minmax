Plagne recently determined the asymptotic behavior of the function E(h),
which counts the maximum possible number of essential elements in an additive
basis for N of order h. Here we extend his investigations by studying
asymptotic behavior of the function E(h,k), which counts the maximum possible
number of essential subsets of size k, in a basis of order h. For a fixed k and
with h going to infinity, we show that E(h,k) = \Theta_{k} ([h^{k}/\log
h]^{1/(k+1)}). The determination of a more precise asymptotic formula is shown
to depend on the solution of the well-known "postage stamp problem" in finite
cyclic groups. On the other hand, with h fixed and k going to infinity, we show
that E(h,k) \sim (h-1) {\log k \over \log \log k}.
