We prove that fundamental groups of non-orientable 3-manifolds have a
solvable conjugacy problem, and construct an algorithm. Together with our
earlier work on the conjugacy problem in groups on orientable geometrizable
3-manifolds, all $\pi_1$ of (geometrizable) 3-manifolds have a solvable
conjugacy problem. In corollaries, both the twisted conjugacy problem in closed
surface groups and the conjugacy problem in closed surface-by-cyclic groups,
are solvable.
