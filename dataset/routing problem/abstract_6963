A non-classical Weyl theory is developed for Dirac systems with rectangular
matrix potentials. The notion of the Weyl function is introduced and the
corresponding direct problem is treated. Furthermore, explicit solutions of the
direct and inverse problems are obtained for the case of rational Weyl matrix
functions.
