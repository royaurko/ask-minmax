The Cauchy-problem for the generalized Kadomtsev-Petviashvili-II equation
$$u_t + u_{xxx} + \partial_x^{-1}u_{yy}= (u^l)_x, \quad l \ge 3,$$ is shown to
be locally well-posed in almost critical anisotropic Sobolev spaces. The proof
combines local smoothing and maximal function estimates as well as bilinear
refinements of Strichartz type inequalities via multilinear interpolation in
$X_{s,b}$-spaces.
