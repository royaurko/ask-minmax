The ordering of block copolymers into lamellar microstructures is an
attractive route for creating nanopatterns on scales too small to be
constructed by current photolithography techniques. This utilises a technique
known as graphoepitaxy where topography is used to define the alignment of the
pattern for precise placement of pattern features. One problem with this
approach is the failure of lamellae to maintain continuity around corners, due
to geometrical frustration. We report simulation results using the extended
Cahn-Hilliard equation which suggest that this problem could be solved by using
rounded corners.
