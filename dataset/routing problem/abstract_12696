We study a large deviation functional of density fluctuation by analyzing
stochastic non-linear diffusion equations driven by the difference between the
densities fixed at the boundaries. By using a fundamental equality that yields
the fluctuation theorem, we first relate the large deviation functional with a
minimization problem. We then develop a perturbation method for solving the
problem. In particular, by performing an expansion with respect to the average
current, we derive the lowest order expression for the deviation from the local
equilibrium part. This expression implies that the deviation is written as the
space-time integration of the excess entropy production rate during the most
probable process of generating the fluctuation that corresponds to the argument
of the large deviation functional.
