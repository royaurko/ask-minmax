Prior to computing the Cholesky factorization of a sparse, symmetric positive
definite matrix, a reordering of the rows and columns is computed so as to
reduce both the number of fill elements in Cholesky factor and the number of
arithmetic operations (FLOPs) in the numerical factorization. These two metrics
are clearly somehow related and yet it is suspected that these two problems are
different. However, no rigorous theoretical treatment of the relation of these
two problems seems to have been given yet. In this paper we show by means of an
explicit, scalable construction that the two problems are different in a very
strict sense. In our construction no ordering, that is optimal for the fill, is
optimal with respect to the number of FLOPs, and vice versa.
  Further, it is commonly believed that minimizing the number of FLOPs is no
easier than minimizing the fill (in the complexity sense), but so far no proof
appears to be known. We give a reduction chain that shows the NP hardness of
minimizing the number of arithmetic operations in the Cholesky factorization.
