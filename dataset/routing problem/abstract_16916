We demonstrate complete integrability of the Nambu-Goto equations for a
stationary string in the general Kerr-NUT-(A)dS spacetime describing the
higher-dimensional rotating black hole. The stationary string in D dimensions
is generated by a 1-parameter family of Killing trajectories and the problem of
finding a string configuration reduces to a problem of finding a geodesic line
in an effective (D-1)-dimensional space. Resulting integrability of this
geodesic problem is connected with the existence of hidden symmetries which are
inherited from the black hole background. In a spacetime with p mutually
commuting Killing vectors it is possible to introduce a concept of a
$\xi$-brane, that is a p-brane with the worldvolume generated by these fields
and a 1-dimensional curve. We discuss integrability of such $\xi$-branes in the
Kerr-NUT-(A)dS spacetime.
