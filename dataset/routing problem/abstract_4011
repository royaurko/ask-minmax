This is a thesis on some applications of regularly varying functions. Three
problems are considered. The first problem is about the randomly weighted sums,
the second is on the behavior of the product under conditional extreme value
model and the final problem studies heavy tailed measures under free
convolution. The first chapter gives a brief overview of the heavy tailed
distributions.
