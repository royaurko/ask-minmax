In this work we study how nonminimally coupled theories of gravity modify the
usual Friedmann equation, and develop two methods to treat these. The ambiguity
in the form of the Lagrangian density of a perfect fluid is emphasized, and the
impact of different dominant matter species is assessed. The Cosmological
Constant problem is also discussed.
