We solve, by separation of variables, the problem of three anyons with a
harmonic oscillator potential. The anyonic symmetry conditions from cyclic
permutations are separable in our coordinates. The conditions from two-particle
transpositions are not separable, but can be expressed as reflection symmetry
conditions on the wave function and its normal derivative on the boundary of a
circle. Thus the problem becomes one-dimensional. We solve this problem
numerically by discretization. $N$-point discretization with very small $N$ is
often a good first approximation, on the other hand convergence as $N\to\infty$
is sometimes very slow.
