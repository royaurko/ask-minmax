We give a new characterization of maximal repetitions (or runs) in strings
based on Lyndon words. The characterization leads to a proof of what was known
as the "runs" conjecture (Kolpakov \& Kucherov (FOCS '99)), which states that
the maximum number of runs $\rho(n)$ in a string of length $n$ is less than
$n$. The proof is remarkably simple, considering the numerous endeavors to
tackle this problem in the last 15 years, and significantly improves our
understanding of how runs can occur in strings. In addition, we obtain an upper
bound of $3n$ for the maximum sum of exponents $\sigma(n)$ of runs in a string
of length $n$, improving on the best known bound of $4.1n$ by Crochemore et al.
(JDA 2012), as well as other improved bounds on related problems. The
characterization also gives rise to a new, conceptually simple linear-time
algorithm for computing all the runs in a string. A notable characteristic of
our algorithm is that, unlike all existing linear-time algorithms, it does not
utilize the Lempel-Ziv factorization of the string. We also establish a
relationship between runs and nodes of the Lyndon tree, which gives a simple
optimal solution to the 2-Period Query problem that was recently solved by
Kociumaka et al. (SODA 2015).
