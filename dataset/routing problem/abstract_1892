The quasiparticle (QP) band structures of both strainless and strained
monolayer MoS$_{2}$ are investigated using more accurate many body perturbation
\emph{GW} theory and maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) approach. By
solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) including excitonic effects on top of
the partially self-consistent \emph{GW$_{0}$} (sc\emph{GW$_{0}$}) calculation,
the predicted optical gap magnitude is in a good agreement with available
experimental data. With increasing strain, the exciton binding energy is nearly
unchanged, while optical gap is reduced significantly. The sc\emph{GW$_{0}$}
and BSE calculations are also performed on monolayer WS$_{2}$, similar
characteristics are predicted and WS$_{2}$ possesses the lightest effective
mass at the same strain among monolayers Mo(S,Se) and W(S,Se). Our results also
show that the electron effective mass decreases as the tensile strain
increases, resulting in an enhanced carrier mobility. The present calculation
results suggest a viable route to tune the electronic properties of monolayer
transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) using strain engineering for potential
applications in high performance electronic devices.
