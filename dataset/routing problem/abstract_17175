We present multi-agent A* (MAA*), the first complete and optimal heuristic
search algorithm for solving decentralized partially-observable Markov decision
problems (DEC-POMDPs) with finite horizon. The algorithm is suitable for
computing optimal plans for a cooperative group of agents that operate in a
stochastic environment such as multirobot coordination, network traffic
control, `or distributed resource allocation. Solving such problems efiectively
is a major challenge in the area of planning under uncertainty. Our solution is
based on a synthesis of classical heuristic search and decentralized control
theory. Experimental results show that MAA* has significant advantages. We
introduce an anytime variant of MAA* and conclude with a discussion of
promising extensions such as an approach to solving infinite horizon problems.
