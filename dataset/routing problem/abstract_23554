A systematic construction is given for N=1 open string boundary coupling to
Abelian and non-Abelian Dp-brane worldvolume fields, in general curved
backgrounds. The basic ingredient is a set of four ``boundary vectors'' that
provide a unified description of boundary conditions and boundary couplings. We
then turn to the problem of apparent inconsistency of non-Abelian worldvolume
scalar couplings (obtained by T-duality), with general covariance. It means
that the couplings cannot be obtained from a covariant action by gauge fixing
ordinary general coordinate transformations (GCT). It is shown that the
corresponding worldsheet theory has the same problem, but is also invariant
under certain matrix-valued coordinate transformations (MCT) that can be used
to restore its covariance. The same transformations act on the worldvolume,
leading to a covariant action. Then the non-Abelian Dp-brane action obtained by
T-duality corresponds to gauge fixing the MCT and not GCT, hence the apparent
incompatibility with general covariance.
