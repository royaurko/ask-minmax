A graph is Hamiltonian if it contains a cycle which goes through all vertices
exactly once. Determining if a graph is Hamiltonian is known as a NP-complete
problem and no satisfactory characterization for these graphs has been found.
  In 1976 Bondy and Chvatal introduced a way to get round the Hamiltonicity
problem complexity by using a closure of the graph. This closure is a
supergraph of G which preserves Hamiltonicity, that is, which is Hamiltonian if
and only if G is. Since this seminal work, several closure concepts preserving
Hamiltonicity were introduced. In particular Ryjacek defined in 1997 a closure
concept for claw-free graphs based on local completion. The completion is
performed for every eligible vertex of the graph.
  Extending these works, Vallee and Bretto recently introduced a new closure
concept preserving Hamiltonicity and based on local completion. The local
completion is performed for each neighborhood-equivalence eligible vertex of
the graph.
  In this article, we generalize the main results of Vallee and Bretto by
introducing a broader notion of neighborhood equivalence eligibility, allowing
the definition of a denser graph closure which still preserves Hamiltonicity.
