Cluster based Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been widely used for
better performance in terms of energy efficiency. Efficient use of energy is
challenging task of designing these protocols. Energy holedare created due to
quickly drain the energy of a few nodes due to non-uniform distribution in the
network. Normally, energy holes make the data routing failure when nodes
transmit data back to the base station. We proposedEnergy-efficient
HOleRemoving Mechanism (E-HORM) technique to remove energy holes. In this
technique, we use sleep and awake mechanism for sensor nodes to save energy.
This approach finds the maximum distance node to calculate the maximum energy
for data transmission. We considered it as a threshold energy Eth. Every node
first checks its energy level for data transmission. If the energy level is
less than Eth, it cannot transmit data. We also explain mathematically the
energy consumption and average energy saving of sensor nodes in each round.
Extensive simulations showed that when use this approach for WSNs significantly
helps to extend the network lifetime and stability period.
