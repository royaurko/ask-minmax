We reformulate the problem of hydrodynamic turbulence as a heat flow problem.
We obtain thus a prediction $$
\zeta_p={p\over3}-{1\over\ln\kappa}\ln\Gamma({p\over3}+1) $$ for the exponents
of the structure functions ($<|\Delta_rv|^p>=r^{\zeta_p}$). The meaning of the
adjustable parameter $\kappa$ is that when an eddy of size $r$ has decayed to
eddies of size $r/\kappa$ their energies have a thermal distribution. The above
formula, with $(\ln\kappa)^{-1}=.32\pm.01$ is compatible with experimental
data. This agreement lends supports to our physically motivated picture of
turbulence.
