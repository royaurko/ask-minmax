The t-J model in the spinless-fermion representation is studied. An
effective Hamiltonian for the quasiparticles is derived using canonical
transformation approach. It is shown that the rather simple form of the
transformation generator allows to take into account effect of hole interaction
with the short-range spin waves and to describe the single-hole groundstate.
Obtained results are very close to ones of the self-consistent Born
approximation. Further accounting for the long-range spin-wave interaction is
possible on the perturbative basis. Both spin-wave exchange and an effective
interaction due to minimization of the number of broken antiferromagnetic bonds
are included in the effective quasiparticle interaction. Two-hole bound state
problem is solved using Bethe-Salpeter equation. The only d-wave bound state
is found to exist in the region of 1< (t/J) <5. Combined effect of the pairing
interactions of both types is important to its formation. Discussion of the
possible relation of the obtained results to the problem of superconductivity
in real systems is presented.
