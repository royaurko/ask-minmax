The choice of the kernel is critical to the success of many learning
algorithms but it is typically left to the user. Instead, the training data can
be used to learn the kernel by selecting it out of a given family, such as that
of non-negative linear combinations of p base kernels, constrained by a trace
or L1 regularization. This paper studies the problem of learning kernels with
the same family of kernels but with an L2 regularization instead, and for
regression problems. We analyze the problem of learning kernels with ridge
regression. We derive the form of the solution of the optimization problem and
give an efficient iterative algorithm for computing that solution. We present a
novel theoretical analysis of the problem based on stability and give learning
bounds for orthogonal kernels that contain only an additive term O(pp/m) when
compared to the standard kernel ridge regression stability bound. We also
report the results of experiments indicating that L1 regularization can lead to
modest improvements for a small number of kernels, but to performance
degradations in larger-scale cases. In contrast, L2 regularization never
degrades performance and in fact achieves significant improvements with a large
number of kernels.
