We consider the initial-boundary value problem for systems of quasilinear
wave equations on domains of the form $[0,T] \times \Sigma$, where $\Sigma$ is
a compact manifold with smooth boundaries $\partial\Sigma$. By using an
appropriate reduction to a first order symmetric hyperbolic system with maximal
dissipative boundary conditions, well posedness of such problems is established
for a large class of boundary conditions on $\partial\Sigma$. We show that our
class of boundary conditions is sufficiently general to allow for a well posed
formulation for different wave problems in the presence of constraints and
artificial, nonreflecting boundaries, including Maxwell's equations in the
Lorentz gauge and Einstein's gravitational equations in harmonic coordinates.
Our results should also be useful for obtaining stable finite-difference
discretizations for such problems.
