We prove compactness of solutions of a fully nonlinear Yamabe problem
satisfying a lower Ricci curvature bound, when the manifold is not conformally
diffeomorphic to the standard sphere. This allows us to prove the existence of
solutions when the associated cone $\Gamma$ satisfies $\mu^+_\Gamma\le 1$,
which includes the $\sigma_k-$Yamabe problem for $k$ not smaller than half of
the dimension of the manifold.
