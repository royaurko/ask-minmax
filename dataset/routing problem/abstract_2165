We describe in detail how attosecond delays in laser-assisted photoionization
can be computed using perturbation theory based on two-photon matrix elements.
Special emphasis is laid on above-threshold ionization, where the electron
interacts with an infrared field after photoionization by an extreme
ultraviolet field. Correlation effects are introduced using diagrammatic
many-body theory to the level of the random-phase approximation with exchange
(RPAE). Our aim is to provide an ab initio route to correlated multi-photon
processes that are required for an accurate description of experiments on the
attosecond time scale. Here, our results are focused on photoionization of the
M -shell of argon atoms, where experiments have been carried out using the
so-called RABITT technique. An influence of autoionizing resonances in
attosecond delay measurements is observed. Further, it is shown that the delay
depends on both detection angle of the photoelectron and energy of the probe
photon.
