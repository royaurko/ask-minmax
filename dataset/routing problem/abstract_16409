The complex Langevin method is a leading candidate for solving the so-called
sign problem occurring in various physical situations. Its most vexing problem
is that in some cases it produces `convergence to the wrong limit'. In the
first part of the paper we go through the formal justification of the method,
identify points at which it may fail and identify a necessary and sufficient
criterion for correctness. This criterion would, however, require checking
infinitely many identities, and therefore is somewhat academic. We propose
instead a truncation to the check of a few identities; this still gives a
necessary criterion, but a priori it is not clear whether it remains
sufficient. In the second part we carry out a detailed study of two toy models:
first we identify the reasons why in some cases the method fails, second we
test the efficiency of the truncated criterion and find that it works perfectly
at least in the toy models studied.
