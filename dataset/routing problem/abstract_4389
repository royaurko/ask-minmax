Solutions of the Cauchy problem for the wave equation on a non-globally
hyperbolic spacetime, which contains closed timelike curves (time machines) are
considered. It is proved, that there exists a solution of the Cauchy problem,
it is discontinuous and in some sense unique for arbitrary initial conditions,
which are given on a hypersurface at time, that precedes the formation of
closed timelike curves (CTC). If the hypersurface of initial conditions
intersects the region containing CTC, then the solution of the Cauchy problem
exists only for such initial conditions, that satisfy a certain requirement of
self-consistency.
