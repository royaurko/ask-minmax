We investigate the structure of solutions of boundary value problems for a
one-dimensional nonlinear system of pseudodifferential equations describing the
dynamics (rolling) of p-adic open, closed, and open-closed strings for a scalar
tachyon field using the method of successive approximations. For an open-closed
string, we prove that the method converges for odd values of p of the form
p=4n+1 under the condition that the solution for the closed string is known.
For p=2, we discuss the questions of the existence and the nonexistence of
solutions of boundary value problems and indicate the possibility of
discontinuous solutions appearing.
