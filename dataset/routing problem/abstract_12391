Quantum annealing is analogous to simulated annealing with a tunneling
mechanism substituting for thermal activation. Its performance has been tested
in numerical simulation with mixed conclusions. There is a class of
optimization problems for which the efficiency can be studied analytically
using techniques based on the statistical mechanics of spin glasses.
