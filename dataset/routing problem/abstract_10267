In this paper, we consider a gradient estimate for a conductivity problem
whose inclusions are two neighboring insulators in three dimensions. When
inclusions with extreme conductivity (insulator or perfect conductor) are
closely located, the gradient of a solution is concentrated in the narrow
region in between inclusions and becomes arbitrarily large as the distance
between inclusions approaches zero. The estimate for gradients between
insulators in three dimensions has been regarded as a challenging problem,
while the optimal estimates in terms of the distance have been known for the
other problems of perfectly conducting inclusions in any dimensions, and of
insulators in two dimensions. In this paper, we establish upper and lower
bounds of gradients on the shortest line segment between two insulating unit
spheres in three dimensions. They present an optimal dependency of gradient on
the distance which is substantially different from the blow-up rates in the
other extreme conductivity problems.
