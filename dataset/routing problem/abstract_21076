In the present paper we study the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for
second order divergence form elliptic operators with bounded measurable
coefficients which are small perturbations of given operators in rough domains
beyond the Lipschitz category. In our approach, the development of the theory
of tent spaces on these domains is essential.
