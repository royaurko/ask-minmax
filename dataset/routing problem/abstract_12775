For the $\mathfrak{so}(4)$ free rigid body the stability problem for the
isolated equilibria has been completely solved using Lie-theoretical and
topological arguments. For each case of nonlinear stability previously found we
construct a Lyapunov function. These Lyapunov functions are linear combinations
of Mishchenko's constants of motion.
