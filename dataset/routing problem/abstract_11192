We discuss the circumstances under which gravity might be repulsive rather
than attractive. In particular we show why our standard solar system distance
scale gravitational intuition need not be a reliable guide to the behavior of
gravitational phenomena on altogether larger distance scales such as
cosmological, and argue that in fact gravity actually gets to act repulsively
on such distance scales. With such repulsion a variety of current cosmological
problems (the flatness, horizon, dark matter, universe age, cosmic acceleration
and cosmological constant problems) are then all naturally resolved.
