In this paper we develop the method of finding sharp estimates by using a
Bellman function. In such a form the method appears in the proofs of the
classical John--Nirenberg inequality and $L^p$ estimations of BMO functions. In
the present paper we elaborate a method of solving the boundary value problem
for the homogeneous Monge--Amp\`ere equation in a parabolic strip for
sufficiently smooth boundary conditions. In such a way we have obtained an
algorithm of constructing an exact Bellman function for a large class of
integral functionals in the BMO space.
