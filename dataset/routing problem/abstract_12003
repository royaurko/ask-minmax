It has long been known that the multivariate integration problem for the unit
ball in $C^r([0,1]^d)$ is intractable for fixed finite $r$. H. Wo\'zniakowski
has recently conjectured that this is true even if $r=\infty$. This paper
establishes a partial result in this direction. We prove that the multivariate
integration problem, for infinitely differential functions all of whose
variables are bounded by one, is not strongly tractable.
