We present a hybrid technique of N-body simulation to deal with collisionless
stellar systems having an inhomogeneous global structure. We combine a treecode
and a self-consistent field code such that each of the codes model a different
component of the system being investigated. The treecode is suited to treatment
of dynamically cold or clumpy systems which may undergo significant evolution
within a dynamically hot system. The hot system is appropriately evolved by the
self-consistent field code. This combined code is particularly suited to a
number of problems in galactic dynamics. Applications of the code to these
problems are briefly discussed.
