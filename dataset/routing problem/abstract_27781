This paper studies mixture modeling using the Elliptical Gamma distribution
(EGD)---a distribution that has parametrized tail and peak behaviors and offers
richer modeling power than the multivariate Gaussian. First, we study maximum
likelihood (ML) parameter estimation for a single EGD, a task that involves
nontrivial conic optimization problems. We solve these problems by developing
globally convergent fixed-point methods for them. Next, we consider fitting
mixtures of EGDs, for which we first derive a closed-form expression for the
KL-divergence between two EGDs and then use it in a "split-and-merge"
expectation maximization algorithm. We demonstrate the ability of our proposed
mixture modelling in modelling natural image patches.
