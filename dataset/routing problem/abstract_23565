An analysis is first given of the situation where a scalar field is contained
between two fixed, spatially flat, branes. The usual fine-tuning (RS) condition
is relaxed, and the branes are allowed to possess a positive effective
cosmological constant \lambda. We first analyze the eigenvalue problem for the
Kaluza-Klein masses when the metric is time dependent, and consider in detail
the case when \lambda is small. Thereafter we consider, in the case of one
single brane, the opposite limit in which \lambda is large, acting in a brief
period of time T, and present a "sudden approximation" calculation of the
energy produced on the brane by the rapidly expanding de Sitter space during
this period.
