Background: Network communities help the functional organization and
evolution of complex networks. However, the development of a method, which is
both fast and accurate, provides modular overlaps and partitions of a
heterogeneous network, has proven to be rather difficult. Methodology/Principal
Findings: Here we introduce the novel concept of ModuLand, an integrative
method family determining overlapping network modules as hills of an influence
function-based, centrality-type community landscape, and including several
widely used modularization methods as special cases. As various adaptations of
the method family, we developed several algorithms, which provide an efficient
analysis of weighted and directed networks, and (1) determine pervasively
overlapping modules with high resolution; (2) uncover a detailed hierarchical
network structure allowing an efficient, zoom-in analysis of large networks;
(3) allow the determination of key network nodes and (4) help to predict
network dynamics. Conclusions/Significance: The concept opens a wide range of
possibilities to develop new approaches and applications including network
routing, classification, comparison and prediction.
