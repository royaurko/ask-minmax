Given an L_{\omega_1 \omega}-elementary class C, that is the collection of
the countable models of some L_{\omega_1 \omega}-sentence, denote by \cong_C
and \equiv_C the analytic equivalence relations of, respectively, isomorphism
and bi-embeddability on C. Generalizing some questions of Louveau and Rosendal
[LR05], in [FMR09] it was proposed the problem of determining which pairs of
analytic equivalence relations (E,F) can be realized (up to Borel
bireducibility) as pairs of the form (\cong_C,\equiv_C), C some L_{\omega_1
\omega}-elementary class (together with a partial answer for some specific
cases). Here we will provide an almost complete solution to such problem: under
very mild conditions on E and F, it is always possible to find such an
L_{\omega_1 \omega}-elementary class C.
