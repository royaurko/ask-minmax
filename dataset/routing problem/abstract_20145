We are concerned with the Sturm-Liouville problem on the half line. We show
that when the potential $q$ is subject only to power decay at infinity the
$L^2$ solution may be continued into a sector of the so-called un-physical
sheet. This gives rise to resonance free regions and the numerical estimation
of resonances outside these regions.
