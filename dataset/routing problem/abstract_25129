The Fourier transforms of the products of two respectively three solutions of
the free Schroedinger equation in one space dimension are estimated in mixed
and, in the first case weighted, L^p - norms. Inserted into an appropriate
variant of the Fourier restriction norm method, these estimates serve to prove
local well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for the cubic nonlinear Schroedinger
(NLS) equation with data u_0 in the function space ^L^r:=^H^r_0, where for s
\in R the spaces ^H^r_s are defined by the norms
||u_0||_{^H^r_s}:=||^u_0||_{L^r'_\xi}, 1/r + 1/r'=1. Similar arguments,
combined with a gauge transform, lead to local well-posedness of the Cauchy
problem for the derivative nonlinear Schroedinger (DNLS) equation with data u_0
\in ^H^r_{1/2}. In the local result on cubic NLS the parameter r is allowed in
the whole subcritical range 1<r<\infty, while for DNLS we assume 1<r \le 2. In
the special case r=2 both results coincide with the optimal ones on the H^s -
scale. Furthermore, concerning the cubic NLS equation, it is shown by a
decomposition argument that the local solution extends globally, provided 2 \ge
r > 5/3.
