In this paper we give solutions of certain diophantine equations related to
triangular and tetrahedral numbers and propose several problems connected with
these numbers.
  The material of this paper was presented in part at the 11th International
Workshop for Young Mathematicians - NUMBER THEORY, Krak\'{o}w, 14th-20th
september 2008.
