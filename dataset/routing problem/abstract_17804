Conjecturing formulas and other symbolic relations occurs frequently in
number theory and combinatorics. If we could automate conjecturing, we could
benefit not only from speeding up, but also from finding conjectures previously
out of our grasp. Grammatical evolution, a genetic programming technique, can
be used for automated conjecturing in mathematics. Concretely, this work
describes how one can interpret the Frobenius problem as a symbolic regression
problem, and then apply grammatical evolution to it. In this manner, a few
formulas for Frobenius numbers of specific quadruples were found automatically.
The sketch of the proof for one conjectured formula, using lattice point
enumeration method, is provided as well.
  Same method can easily be used on other problems to speed up and enhance the
research process.
