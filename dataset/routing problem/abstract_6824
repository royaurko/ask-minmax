Let Z{t} be the ring of arithmetic power series that converge on the complex
open unit disc. A classical result of Harbater asserts that every finite group
occurs as a Galois group over the quotient field of Z{t}. We strengthen this by
showing that every finite split embedding problem over Q acquires a solution
over this field. More generally, we solve all t-unramified finite split
embedding problems over the quotient field of O{t}, where O is the ring of
integers of an arbitrary number field K.
