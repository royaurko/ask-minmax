The universe we observe is homogeneous on super-horizon scales, leading to
the ``cosmic homogeneity problem''. Inflation alleviates this problem but
cannot solve it within the realm of conservative extrapolations of classical
physics. A probabilistic solution of the problem is possible but is subject to
interpretational difficulties. A genuine deterministic solution of the
homogeneity problem requires radical departures from known physics.
