Second harmonic generation is a powerful tool directly connected to the
symmetry of materials. Phase transitions, lattice rotations or electromagnetic
coupling in multiferroic compounds can be revealed by using second harmonic
generation.[1-4] Here we show that the sense of the spontaneous electric
polarization Ps in trigonal ferroelectrics can lead to a pronounced spatial
dependence of the second harmonic generation. By using a two-dimensional
nonlinear photonic structure we demonstrate that counter-propagating beams
along the polar axis generate non-reciprocal second harmonic patterns. In
optics, with some exception,[5] non-reciprocal phenomena are generally related
to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry involving a magnetic field.[6,7]
Here, in contrast, the non-reciprocity is inherent to the quadratic nonlinear
tensor being related to the inversion symmetry breaking at the ferroelectric
phase. These findings provide novel routes to generate nonreciprocal
light-matter interaction processes in two-dimensional structures assembled onto
polar surfaces,[8,9] including metals for plasmonics or biological compounds.
