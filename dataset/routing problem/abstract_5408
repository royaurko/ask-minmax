We consider the determination of a conductivity function in a two-dimensional
domain from the Cauchy data of the solutions of the conductivity equation on
the boundary. We prove uniqueness results for this inverse problem, posed by
Calderon, for conductivities that are degenerate, that is, they may not be
bounded from above or below. In particular, for scalar conductivities we solve
the inverse problem in a class which is larger than $L^\infty$. Also, we give
new counterexamples for the uniqueness of the inverse conductivity problem.
  We say that a conductivity is visible if the inverse problem is solvable so
that the inside of the domain can be uniquely determined, up to a change of
coordinates, using the boundary measurements. The present counterexamples for
the inverse problem have been related to the invisibility cloaking. This means
that there are conductivities for which a part of the domain is shielded from
detection via boundary measurements. Such conductivities are called
invisibility cloaks.
  In the present paper we identify the borderline of the visible conductivities
and the borderline of invisibility cloaking conductivities. Surprisingly, these
borderlines are not the same. We show that between the visible and the cloaking
conductivities there are the electric holograms, conductivities which create an
illusion of a non-existing body. The electric holograms give counterexamples
for the uniqueness of the inverse problem which are less degenerate than the
previously known ones.
