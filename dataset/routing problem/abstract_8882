One of the delicated points is to obtain existence of positive solutions for
a boundary blow-up elliptic problem in presence of a k-Hessian operator in a
smooth bounded domain. Our intention is to give a necessary and sufficient
condition on f to ensure existence of at least one explosive strictly k-convex
positive solution. The main tools for proving existence are the comparison
principle and the method of sub and supersolutions. Several tehnical lemmas are
obtained.
