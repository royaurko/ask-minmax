We prove a global logarithmic stability estimate for the multi-channel
Gel'fand-Calder\'on inverse problem on a two-dimensional bounded domain, i.e.
the inverse boundary value problem for the equation $-\Delta \psi + v\, \psi =
0$ on $D$, where $v$ is a smooth matrix-valued potential defined on a bounded
planar domain $D$.
