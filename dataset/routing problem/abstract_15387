We study the existence of symmetric ground states to the supercritical
problem \[ -\Delta v=\lambda v+\left\vert v\right\vert ^{p-2}v\text{ \ in
}\Omega,\qquad v=0\text{ on }\partial\Omega, \] in a domain of the form \[
\Omega=\{(y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^{k+1}\times\mathbb{R}^{N-k-1}:\left( \left\vert
y\right\vert ,z\right) \in\Theta\}, \] where $\Theta$ is a bounded smooth
domain such that $\overline{\Theta} \subset\left( 0,\infty\right)
\times\mathbb{R}^{N-k-1},$ $1\leq k\leq N-3,$ $\lambda\in\mathbb{R},$ and
$p=\frac{2(N-k)}{N-k-2}$ is the $(k+1)$-st critical exponent. We show that
symmetric ground states exist for $\lambda$ in some interval to the left of
each symmetric eigenvalue, and that no symmetric ground states exist in some
interval $(-\infty,\lambda_{\ast})$ with $\lambda_{\ast}>0$ if $k\geq2.$
  Related to this question is the existence of ground states to the anisotropic
critical problem \[ -\text{div}(a(x)\nabla u)=\lambda b(x)u+c(x)\left\vert
u\right\vert ^{2^{\ast }-2}u\quad\text{in}\ \Theta,\qquad u=0\quad\text{on}\
\partial\Theta, \] where $a,b,c$ are positive continuous functions on
$\overline{\Theta}.$ We give a minimax characterization for the ground states
of this problem, study the ground state energy level as a function of
$\lambda,$ and obtain a bifurcation result for ground states.
