The hole in the charge distribution of $^3{\text He}$ is a major problem in
A=3 nuclei. The canonical wavefucntion of A=3 nuclei which does well for
electromagnetic properties of A=3 nuclei fails to produce the hole in A=3
nuclei. The hole is normally assumed to arise from explicit quark degree of
freedom. Very often quark degrees of freedom are imposed to propose a different
short range part of the wavefunction for A=3 to explain the hole in $^3{\text
He}$. So an hybrid model with nucleonic degree of freedom in outer part and
quark degrees of freedom in the inner part of the nucleus have been invoked to
understand the above problem. Here we present a different picture with a new
wavefunction working at short range within nucleonic degrees of freedom itself.
So the above problem is explained here based entirely on the nucleonic degree
of freedom only.
