The weak cosmic censorship hypothesis can be understood as a statement that
there exists a global Cauchy evolution of a selfgravitating system outside an
event horizon. The resulting Cauchy problem has a free null-like inner
boundary. We study a selfgravitating spherically symmetric nonlinear scalar
field. We show the global existence of a spacetime with a null inner boundary
that initially is located outside the Schwarzschild radius or, more generally,
outside an apparent horizon. The global existence of a patch of a spacetime
that is exterior to an event horizon is obtained as a limiting case.
