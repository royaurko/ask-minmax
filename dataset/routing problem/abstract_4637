For the hyperbolic system of quasilinear first-order partial differential
equations, linearizable by hodograph transformation, the conservation laws are
used to solve the Cauchy problem. The equivalence of the initial problem for
quasilinear system and the problem for conservation laws system permits to
construct the characteristic lines in domains, where Jacobian of hodograph
transformations is equal to zero. Moreover, the conservation laws give all
solutions of the linearized system. Some examples from the gas dynamics and
theory of plasticity are considered.
