Construction of signal sets with low correlation property is of interest to
designers of CDMA systems. One of the preferred ways of constructing such sets
is the interleaved construction which uses two sequences a and b with 2-level
autocorrelation and a shift sequence e. The shift sequence has to satisfy
certain conditions for the resulting signal set to have low correlation
properties. This article shows that the conditions reported in literature are
too strong and gives a version which results in more number of shift sequences.
An open problem on the existence of shift sequences for attaining an
interleaved set with maximum correlation value bounded by v+2 is also taken up
and solved.
