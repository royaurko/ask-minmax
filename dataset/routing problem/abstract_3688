Let D be a bounded domain in n-dimensional Eucledian space with a smooth
boundary. We indicate appropriate Sobolev spaces of negative smoothness to
study the non-homogeneous Cauchy problem for an elliptic differential complex
{A_i} of first order operators. In particular, we describe traces on the
boundary of tangential part t_i (u) and normal part n_i(u) of a
(vector)-function u from the corresponding Sobolev space and give an adequate
formulation of the problem. If the Laplacians of the complex satisfy the
uniqueness condition in the small then we obtain necessary and sufficient
solvability conditions of the problem and produce formulae for its exact and
approximate solutions. For the Cauchy problem in the Lebesgue spaces L^2(D) we
construct the approximate and exact solutions to the Cauchy problem with
maximal possible regularity. Moreover, using Hilbert space methods, we
construct Carleman's formulae for a (vector-) function u from the Sobolev space
H^1(D) by its Cauchy data t_i (u) on a subset S on the boundary of the domain D
and the values of A_i u in D modulo the null-space of the Cauchy problem. Some
instructive examples for elliptic complexes of operators with constant
coefficients are considered.
