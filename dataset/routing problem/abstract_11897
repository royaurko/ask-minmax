The entropy H_T(rho) of a state rho with respect to a channel T and the
Holevo capacity of the channel require the solution of difficult variational
problems. For a class of 1-qubit channels, which contains all the extremal
ones, the problem can be significantly simplified by associating an Hermitian
antilinear operator theta to every channel of the considered class. The
concurrence of the channel can be expressed by theta and turns out to be a flat
roof. This allows to write down an explicit expression for H_T. Its maximum
would give the Holevo (1-shot) capacity.
