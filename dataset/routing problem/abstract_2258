We have fabricated 2024 pixel microwave kinetic inductance detector (MKID)
arrays in the ultraviolet/optical/near-IR (UVOIR) regime that are currently in
use in astronomical instruments. In order to make MKIDs desirable for novel
instruments, larger arrays with nearly perfect yield need to be fabricated. As
array size increases, however, the percent yield often decreases due to
frequency collisions in the readout. The per-pixel performance must also be
improved, namely the energy resolution. We are investigating ways to reduce
frequency collisions and to improve the per pixel performance of our devices
through new superconducting material systems and fabrication techniques. There
are two main routes that we are currently exploring. First, we are attempting
to create more uniform titanium nitride films through the use of atomic layer
deposition rather than the more traditional sputtering method. In addition, we
are experimenting with completely new material systems for MKIDs, such as
platinum silicide.
