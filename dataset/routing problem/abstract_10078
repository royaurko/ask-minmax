Gradient methods are frequently used in large scale image deblurring problems
since they avoid the onerous computation of the Hessian matrix of the objective
function. Second order information is typically sought by a clever choice of
the steplength parameter defining the descent direction, as in the case of the
well-known Barzilai and Borwein rules. In a recent paper, a strategy for the
steplength selection approximating the inverse of some eigenvalues of the
Hessian matrix has been proposed for gradient methods applied to unconstrained
minimization problems. In the quadratic case, this approach is based on a
Lanczos process applied every m iterations to the matrix of the most recent m
back gradients but the idea can be extended to a general objective function. In
this paper we extend this rule to the case of scaled gradient projection
methods applied to non-negatively constrained minimization problems, and we
test the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in image deblurring problems in
both the presence and the absence of an explicit edge-preserving regularization
term.
