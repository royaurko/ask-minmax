We give a survey of recent results related to the problem of characterizing
finite-dimensional division algebras by the set of isomorphism classes of their
maximal subfields. We also discuss various generalizations of this problem and
some of its applications. In the last section, we extend the problem to the
context of absolutely almost simple algebraic groups.
