We say that a theory $T$ is intermediate under effective reducibility if the
isomorphism problems among its computable models is neither hyperarithmetic nor
on top under effective reducibility. We prove that if an infinitary sentence
$T$ is uniformly effectively dense, a property we define in the paper, then no
extension of it is intermediate, at least when relativized to every oracle on a
cone. As an application we show that no infinitary sentence whose models are
all linear orderings is intermediate under effective reducibility relative to
every oracle on a cone.
