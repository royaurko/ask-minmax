We study the initial value formulation of metric-affine f(R)-gravity in
presence of a Klein-Gordon scalar field acting as source of the field
equations. Sufficient conditions for the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem
are formulated. This result completes the analysis of the same problem already
considered for other sources.
