We consider N atoms trapped in an isotropic harmonic potential, with s-wave
interactions of infinite scattering length. In the zero-range limit, we obtain
several exact analytical results: mapping between the trapped problem and the
free-space zero-energy problem, separability in hyperspherical coordinates,
SO(2,1) hidden symmetry, and relations between the moments of the trapping
potential energy and the moments of the total energy.
