Genetic algorithm includes some parameters that should be adjusting so that
the algorithm can provide positive results. Crossover operators play very
important role by constructing competitive Genetic Algorithms (GAs). In this
paper, the basic conceptual features and specific characteristics of various
crossover operators in the context of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) are
discussed. The results of experimental comparison of more than six different
crossover operators for the TSP are presented. The experiment results show that
OX operator enables to achieve a better solutions than other operators tested.
