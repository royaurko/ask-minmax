Pulsars discovered since the end of the EGRET mission coincident with
unidentified high-energy gamma-ray sources are prime targets for AGILE. Both
general surveys and targeted observations have been successful in finding
energetic young pulsars in the plane of the Galaxy. For the latter, hard X-ray
imaging followed by deep radio searches of X-ray sources is a proven route.
High-resolution Chandra X-ray imaging has discovered several asymmetric pulsar
wind nebulae associated with apparently variable gamma-ray sources along the
Galactic plane. The unidentified sources at intermediate Galactic latitudes,
with their much larger error boxes, make new X-ray studies impractical. A radio
search of a number of these sources using the Parkes multibeam system has
resulted in the detection of several new binary pulsar systems. Whether these
are potential gamma-ray emitters has yet to be determined.
