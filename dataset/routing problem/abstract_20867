We prove the Freiheitssatz for right-symmetric algebras and the decidability
of the word problem for right-symmetric algebras with a single defining
relation. We also prove that two generated subalgebras of free right-symmetric
algebras are free and automorphisms of two generated free right-symmetric
algebras are tame.
