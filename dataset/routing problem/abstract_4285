We apply the variable speed of light into general relativity in order to
solve the problems we met in the standard cosmology. We're surprised to find
that, the results from the general relativity in cosmology are exactly the same
as those we got from Newtonian dynamics. The relation between the Newtonian
dynamics and the relativistic dynamics can be demonstrated with the variable
speed of light. With this approach, some problems in the standard cosmology
such as the flatness problem and the horizon problem doesn't arise any more.
All the cosmological results and the physical results are reasonable and
natural. There are no any difficulties in the standard cosmology.
