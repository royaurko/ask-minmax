Nonlinear deformations of relativistic symmetries at the Planck scale are
usually addressed in terms of modified dispersion relations. We explore here an
alternative route by directly deforming the two-point functions of an
underlying field theory. The proposed deformations depend on a length parameter
(Planck length) and preserve the basic symmetries of the corresponding theory.
We also study the physical consequences implied by these modifications at the
Planck scale by analyzing the response function of an accelerated detector in
Minkowski space, an inertial one in de Sitter space, and also in a black hole
spacetime.
