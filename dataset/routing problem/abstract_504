In this paper, we propose a new Quality Link Metric (QLM), ``Inverse Expected
Transmission Count (InvETX)'' in Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol.
Then we compare performance of three existing QLMs which are based on loss
probability measurements; Expected Transmission Count (ETX), Minimum Delay
(MD), Minimum Loss (ML) in Static Wireless Multi-hop Networks (SWMhNs). A novel
contribution of this paper is enhancement in conventional OLSR to achieve high
efficiency in terms of optimized routing load and routing latency. For this
purpose, first we present a mathematical framework, and then to validate this
frame work, we select three performance parameters to simulate default and
enhanced versions of OLSR. Three chosen performance parameters are; throughput,
Normalized Routing Load and End-to-End Delay. From simulation results, we
conclude that adjusting the frequencies of topological information exchange
results in high efficiency.
