A source coding problem over a noiseless broadcast channel where the source
is pre-informed about the contents of the cache of all receivers, is an index
coding problem. Furthermore, if each message is requested by one receiver, then
we call this an index coding problem with a unicast message setting. This
problem can be represented by a directed graph. In this paper, we first define
a structure (we call generalized interlinked cycles (GIC)) in directed graphs.
A GIC consists of cycles which are interlinked in some manner (i.e., not
disjoint), and it turns out that the GIC is a generalization of cliques and
cycles. We then propose a simple scalar linear encoding scheme with linear time
encoding complexity. This scheme exploits GICs in the digraph. We prove that
our scheme is optimal for a class of digraphs with message packets of any
length. Moreover, we show that our scheme can outperform existing techniques,
e.g., partial clique cover, local chromatic number, composite-coding, and
interlinked cycle cover.
