Novel route for the establishing of magnetism in realistic oxidized graphene
nanoribbons is proposed. Modelling of the migration of hydroxyl groups from
central part to the zig-zag edges of graphene nanoribbons passivated by oxygen
are performed with using density functional theory. The presence of hydroxyl
groups near the edges leads formation of dangling bonds there instead saturated
due to oxidation and repairs of magnetism diminished by edges oxidation. The
route of manufacturing and stability of new type of magnetic graphene
nanoribbons are also discussed.
