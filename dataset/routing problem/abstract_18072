We show that for any odd $k$ and any instance of the Max-kXOR constraint
satisfaction problem, there is an efficient algorithm that finds an assignment
satisfying at least a $\frac{1}{2} + \Omega(1/\sqrt{D})$ fraction of
constraints, where $D$ is a bound on the number of constraints that each
variable occurs in. This improves both qualitatively and quantitatively on the
recent work of Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann (2014), which gave a
\emph{quantum} algorithm to find an assignment satisfying a $\frac{1}{2} +
\Omega(D^{-3/4})$ fraction of the equations.
  For arbitrary constraint satisfaction problems, we give a similar result for
"triangle-free" instances; i.e., an efficient algorithm that finds an
assignment satisfying at least a $\mu + \Omega(1/\sqrt{D})$ fraction of
constraints, where $\mu$ is the fraction that would be satisfied by a uniformly
random assignment.
