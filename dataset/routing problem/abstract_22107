The self-organization processes of nanopattern formation on semiconductor
surfaces under low energy ion beam bombardment is considered. The new
mathematical model based on nonlinear evolution equation of the sixth order is
presented. The pseudo--spectral method for periodic boundary value problem for
this equation is discussed. The influence of high order terms on the evolution
of the semiconductor surface morphology is studied.
