In this study, we consider the identifiability problem for nonlinear time
series models. Special attention is paid to smooth transition GARCH, nonlinear
Poisson autoregressive, and multiple regime smooth transition autoregressive
models. Some sufficient conditions are obtained to establish the
identifiability of these models.
