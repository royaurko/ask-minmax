In this paper we present a method for estimating unknown parameter that
appear on a non-linear reaction-diffusion model of cancer invasion. This model
considers that tumor-induced alteration of micro-enviromental pH provides a
mechanism for cancer invasion. A coupled system reaction-diffusion describing
this model is given by three partial differential equations for the non
dimensional spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the density of
normal tissue, the neoplastic tissue growth and the excess concentration of
H$^+$ ions. Each of the model parameters has a corresponding biological
interpretation, for instance, the growth rate of neoplastic tissue, the
diffusion coefficient, the reabsorption rate and the destructive influence of
H$^+$ ions in the healthy tissue.
  After solving the forward problem properly, we use the model for the
estimation of parameters by fitting the numerical solution with real data,
obtained via in vitro experiments and fluorescence ratio imaging microscopy. We
define an appropriate functional to compare both the real data and the
numerical solution using the adjoint method for the minimization of this
functional.
  We apply Finite Element Method (FEM) to solve both the direct and inverse
problem, computing the \emph{a posteriori} error.
