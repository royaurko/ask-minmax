Among subsets of Euclidean space with prescribed measure, for which sets is
the $L^q$ norm of the Fourier transform of the indicator function maximized?
Various partial results concerning this question are established, including the
existence of maximizers and the identification of maximizers as ellipsoids for
exponents sufficiently close to even integers, for various combinations of
dimensions and exponents.
