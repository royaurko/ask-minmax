The gravitational neutrino oscillation problem is studied by considering the
Dirac Hamiltonian in a Riemann-Cartan space-time and calculating the dynamical
phase. Torsion contributions which depend on the spin direction of the mass
eigenstates are found. These effects are of the order of Planck scales.
