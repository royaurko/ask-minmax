We consider a multigravity approach to spacetime foam. As an application we
give indications on the computation of the cosmological constant, considered as
an eigenvalue of a Sturm-Liouville problem. A variational approach with
Gaussian trial wave functionals is used as a method to study such a problem. We
approximate the equation to one loop in a Schwarzschild background and a zeta
function regularization is involved to handle with divergences. The
regularization is closely related to the subtraction procedure appearing in the
computation of Casimir energy in a curved background. A renormalization
procedure is introduced to remove the infinities together with a
renormalization group equation.
