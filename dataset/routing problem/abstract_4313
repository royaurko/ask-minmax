The classical problem of algebraic models for homotopy types is precisely
stated, to our knowledge for the first time. Two different natural statements
for this problem are produced, the simplest one being entirely solved by the
notion of SSEH-structure, due to the contributors. Other tentative solutions,
Postnikov towers and E_\infty-chain complexes, are considered and compared with
the SSEH-structures. In particular, which looks at least like an unfortunate
imprecision in the usual definition of the k-``invariants'' is explained, which
implies we seem far from a solution for the ideal statement of our problem. At
the positive side, the problem of the computability of the Postnikov towers is
solved.
