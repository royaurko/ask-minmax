This paper addresses the problem of finding a class of representative
itemsets up to subitemset isomorphism. An efficient algorithm is of practical
importance in the domain of optimal sorting networks. Although only exponential
algorithms for solving the problem exist in the literature, the complexity
classification of the problem has never been addressed. In this paper, we
present a complexity classification of the itemset isomorphism and subitemset
isomorphism problems. We prove that the problem of checking whether two
itemsets are isomorphic to each other is GI-Hard; the Graph Isomorphism (GI)
problem is known to be in NP and LWPP, but widely believed to be neither P nor
NP-Complete. As an immediate consequence, we prove that finding a class
representative itemsets up to subitemset isomorphism is GI-Hard --- at least as
hard as the graph isomorphism problem.
