Let $G$ be an additive finite abelian group. A sequence over $G$ is called a
minimal zero-sum sequence if the sum of its terms is zero and no proper
subsequence has this property. Davenport's constant of $G$ is the maximum of
the lengths of the minimal zero-sum sequences over $G$. Its value is well-known
for groups of rank two. We investigate the structure of minimal zero-sum
sequences of maximal length for groups of rank two. Assuming a well-supported
conjecture on this problem for groups of the form $C_m \oplus C_m$, we
determine the structure of these sequences for groups of rank two. Combining
our result and partial results on this conjecture, yields unconditional results
for certain groups of rank two.
