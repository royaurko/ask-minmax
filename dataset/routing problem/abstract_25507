In this paper we describe splitting methods for solving Levitron, which is
motivated to simulate magnetostatic traps of neutral atoms or ion traps. The
idea is to levitate a magnetic spinning top in the air repelled by a base
magnet.
  The main problem is the stability of the reduced Hamiltonian, while it is not
defined at the relative equilibrium. Here it is important to derive stable
numerical schemes with high accuracy. For the numerical studies, we propose
novel splitting schemes and analyze their behavior. We deal with a Verlet
integrator and improve its accuracy with iterative and extrapolation ideas.
Such a Hamiltonian splitting method, can be seen as geometric integrator and
saves computational time while decoupling the full equation system.
  Experiments based on the Levitron model are discussed.
