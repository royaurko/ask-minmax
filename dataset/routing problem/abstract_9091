The paper deals with the problem of integration of equations of motion in
nonholonomic systems. By means of well-known theory of the differential
equations with an invariant measure the new integrable systems are discovered.
Among them there are the generalization of Chaplygin's problem of rolling
nonsymmetric ball in the plane and the Suslov problem of rotation of rigid body
with a fixed point. The structure of dynamics of systems on the invariant
manifold in the integrable problems is shown. Some new ideas in the theory of
integration of the equations in nonholonomic mechanics are suggested. The first
of them consists in using known integrals as the constraints. The second is the
use of resolvable groups of symmetries in nonholonomic systems. The existence
conditions of invariant measure with analytical density for the differential
equations of nonholonomic mechanics is given.
