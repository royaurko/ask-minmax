We are concerned with nonexistence results of nonnegative weak solutions for
a class of quasilinear parabolic problems with a potential on complete
noncompact Riemannian manifolds. In particular, we highlight the interplay
between the geometry of the underlying manifold, the power nonlinearity and the
behavior of the potential at infinity.
