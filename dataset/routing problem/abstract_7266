We develop Integer Programming (IP) solutions for some special college
admission problems arising from the Hungarian higher education admission
scheme. We focus on four special features, namely the solution concept of
stable score-limits, the presence of lower and common quotas, and paired
applications. We note that each of the latter three special feature makes the
college admissions problem NP-hard to solve. Currently, a heuristic based on
the Gale-Shapley algorithm is being used in the application. The IP methods
that we propose are not only interesting theoretically, but may also serve as
an alternative solution concept for this practical application, and also for
other ones.
