We refine and extend an earlier MDL denoising criterion for wavelet-based
denoising. We start by showing that the denoising problem can be reformulated
as a clustering problem, where the goal is to obtain separate clusters for
informative and non-informative wavelet coefficients, respectively. This
suggests two refinements, adding a code-length for the model index, and
extending the model in order to account for subband-dependent coefficient
distributions. A third refinement is derivation of soft thresholding inspired
by predictive universal coding with weighted mixtures. We propose a practical
method incorporating all three refinements, which is shown to achieve good
performance and robustness in denoising both artificial and natural signals.
