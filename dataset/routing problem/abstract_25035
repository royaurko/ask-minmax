The Fixed Center Approximation to the Faddeev equations (FCA) has been used
lately with success in the study of bound systems of three hadrons. It is also
important to set the limits of the approach in those problems to prevent
proliferation of inaccurate predictions. In this paper we study the case of the
$\phi(2170)$, which has been described by means of Faddeev equations as a
resonant state of $\phi$ and $K \bar{K}$, and show the problems derived from
the use of the FCA in its study. At the same time we also expose the
limitations of an alternative approach recently proposed.
