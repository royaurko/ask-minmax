Critical state problems which incorporate more than one component for the
magnetization vector of hard superconductors are investigated. The theory is
based on the minimization of a cost functional ${\cal C}[\vec{H}(\vec{x})]$
which weighs the changes of the magnetic field vector within the sample. We
show that Bean's simplest prescription of choosing the correct sign for the
critical current density $J_c$ in one dimensional problems is just a particular
case of finding the components of the vector $\vec{J}_c$. $\vec{J}_c$ is
determined by minimizing ${\cal C}$ under the constraint $\vec{J}\in\Delta
(\vec{H},\vec{x})$, with $\Delta$ a bounded set. Upon the selection of
different sets $\Delta$ we discuss existing crossed field measurements and
predict new observable features. It is shown that a complex behavior in the
magnetization curves may be controlled by a single external parameter, i.e.:
the maximum value of the applied magnetic field $H_m$.
