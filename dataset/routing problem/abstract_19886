The problem of glueball mass spectra using the relativistic Dirac equation is
studied. Also the Breit-Fermi approach used to obtaining hyperfine splitting in
glueballs. Our approach is based on the assumption, that the nature and the
forces between two gluons are the short-range. We were to calculate the
glueball masses with used screened potential.
