We have proposed an analytical approach for exact solution of multi-channel
scattering problems, in presence of Dirac Delta function couplings. Our
solution is quite general and is valid for any set of potentials, if the
Green's functions of the uncoupled potentials are known at the crossing point.
Using our model, it is possible to express N-channel problem by N independent
`single' channel problems and hence one can have a realistic solution of
multi-channel scattering problem. In this paper we have shown that transition
probability from first diabatic potential to any other potential can be easily
evaluated using a very simple analytical formula - which only require value of
eigenfunction of first uncoupled potential and value of Green's function of
other uncoupled potential, at the crossing.
