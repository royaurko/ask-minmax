We study the multi-channel Gel'fand-Calder\'on inverse problem in two
dimensions, i.e. the inverse boundary value problem for the equation $-\Delta
\psi + v(x) \psi = 0$, $x\in D$, where $v$ is a smooth matrix-valued potential
defined on a bounded planar domain $D$. We give an exact global reconstruction
method for finding $v$ from the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. This
also yields a global uniqueness results: if two smooth matrix-valued potentials
defined on a bounded planar domain have the same Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator
then they coincide.
