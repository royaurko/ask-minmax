We consider the interaction of two skyrmions in the framework of the sudden
approximation. The widely used product ansatz is investigated. Its failure in
reproducing an attractive central potential is associated with terms that
violate G-parity. We discuss the construction of alternative ans\"atze and
identify a plausible solution to the problem.
