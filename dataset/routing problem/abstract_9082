The paper addresses the problem of a a semi-infinite plane crack along the
interface between two 3D isotropic half-spaces. Two methods of solution have
been considered in the past: Lazarus and Leblond (1998) applied the "special"
method by Bueckner (1987) and found the expression of the variation of the
stress intensity factors for a wavy crack without solving the complete
elasticity problem; their solution is expressed in terms of the physical
variables, and it involves five constants whose analytical representation was
unknown; on the other hand the "general" solution to the problem has been
recently addressed by Bercial-Velez et al. (2005), using a Wiener-Hopf analysis
and singular asymptotics near the crack front.
  The main goal of the present paper is to complete the solution to the problem
by providing the connection between the two methods. This is done by
constructing an integral representation for the Lazarus-Leblond's weight
functions and by deriving the closed form representations of the
Lazarus-Leblond's constants.
