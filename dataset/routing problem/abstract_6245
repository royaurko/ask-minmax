The spectral measure of the position (momentum) operator $X$ for $q$-deformed
oscillator is calculated in the case of the indetermine Hamburger moment
problem. The exposition is given for concrete choice of generators for
$q$-oscillator algebra, although developed technique apply for every other
cases with indetermine moment problem. The Stieltjes transformation $m(z)$ of
spectral measure is expressed in terms of the entries of Jacobi matrix $X$
only. The direct connection between values of parameters labeling the spectral
measures and related selfadjoint extensions of $X$ is established.
