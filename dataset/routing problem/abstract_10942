We study the relation between the barrier conductance and the Coulomb
blockade peak splitting for two electrostatically equivalent dots connected by
tunneling channels with bandwidths much larger than the dot charging energies.
We note that this problem is equivalent to a well-known single-dot problem and
present solutions for the relation between peak splitting and barrier
conductance in both the weak and strong coupling limits. Results are in good
qualitative agreement with the experimental findings of F. R. Waugh et al.
