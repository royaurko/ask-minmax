We present a method of removing all infinite sums from the various forms of
the mirror TBA equations and the energy formula of the AdS/CFT spectral
problem. This new formulation of the TBA system is quasi-local because
Y-functions that are connected by the TBA equations are at most next to nearest
neighbors with respect to the Y-system diagram of AdS/CFT.
