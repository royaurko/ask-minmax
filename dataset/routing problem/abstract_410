A sequence of rational functions in a variable $q$ is $q$-holonomic if it
satisfies a linear recursion with coefficients polynomials in $q$ and $q^n$. We
prove that the degree of a $q$-holonomic sequence is eventually a quadratic
quasi-polynomial. Our proof uses differential Galois theory (adapting proofs
regarding holonomic $D$-modules to the case of $q$-holonomic $D$-modules)
combined with the Lech-Mahler-Skolem theorem from number theory. En route, we
use the Newton polygon of a linear $q$-difference equation, and introduce the
notion of regular-singular $q$-difference equation and a WKB basis of solutions
of a linear $q$-difference equation at $q=0$. We then use the
Lech-Mahler-Skolem theorem to study the vanishing of their leading term. Unlike
the case of $q=1$, there are no analytic problems regarding convergence of the
WKB solutions.Our proofs are constructive, and they are illustrated by an
explicit example.
