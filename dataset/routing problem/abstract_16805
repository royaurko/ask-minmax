Peak power control for multicarrier communications has been a long-lasting
problem in signal processing and communications. However, industry and academia
are confronted with new challenges regarding energy efficient system design.
Particularly, the envisioned boost in network energy efficiency (e.g. at least
by a factor of 1000 in the Green Touch consortium) will tighten the
requirements on component level so that the efficiency gap with respect to
single-carrier transmission must considerably diminish. This paper reflects
these challenges together with a unified framework and new directions in this
field. The combination of large deviation theory, de-randomization and selected
elements of Banach space geometry will offer a novel approach and will provide
ideas and concepts for researchers with a background in industry as well as
those from academia.
