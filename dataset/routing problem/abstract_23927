We investigate evolution equations for anomalous diffusion employing
fractional derivatives in space and time. Linkage between the space-time
variables leads to a new type of fractional derivative operator. Fractional
diffusion equations account for typical "anomalous" features which are observed
in many systems, e.g. in the case of dispersive transport in amorphous
semiconductors, liquid crystals, polymers, proteins and biosystems. In contrast
to Gaussian diffusion, fractional diffusion is related to LEVY STABLE
NON-GAUSSIAN PROCESSES. The typical features of the processes are heavy tails
of probability density distributions. Conservation laws in relation to
fractional operators are discussed. The next objective of this paper is an
application of main rules of fractional calculus, fractional Laplacians,
factorization of the Helmholtz equation to obtain four pairs of fractional
eigenfunctions allowing to construct a solution to the well known half-plane
diffraction problems. Factorizing the Leontovich-Fock equation, (parabolic wave
equation-PWE), we determine semi-differential fractional solutions, which allow
us to find paraxial solutions for given beam boundary conditions.
