In the week 3--9, October 2010, the Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut at
Oberwolfach hosted a mini workshop Linear Series on Algebraic Varieties. These
notes contain a variety of interesting problems which motivated the
participants prior to the event, and examples, results and further problems
which grew out of discussions during and shortly after the workshop. A lot of
arguments presented here are scattered in the literature or constitute
folklore. It was one of our aims to have a usable and easily accessible
collection of examples and results.
