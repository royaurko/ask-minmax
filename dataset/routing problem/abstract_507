Despite extensive work on the interplay between traffic dynamics and epidemic
spreading, the control of epidemic spreading by routing strategies has not
received adequate attention. In this paper, we study the impact of efficient
routing protocol on epidemic spreading. In the case of infinite node-delivery
capacity, where the traffic is free of congestion, we find that that there
exists optimal values of routing parameter, leading to the maximal epidemic
threshold. This means that epidemic spreading can be effectively controlled by
fine tuning the routing scheme. Moreover, we find that an increase in the
average network connectivity and the emergence of traffic congestion can
suppress the epidemic outbreak.
