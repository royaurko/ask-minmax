In this paper, we present an algorithm which computes a fundamental matrix of
formal solutions of completely integrable Pfaffian systems with normal
crossings in two variables, based on (Barkatou, 1997). A first step was set in
(Barkatou-LeRoux, 2006) where the problem of rank reduction was tackled via the
approach of (Levelt, 1991). We give instead a Moser-based approach. And, as a
complementary step, we associate to our problem a system of ordinary linear
singular differential equations from which the formal invariants can be
efficiently derived via the package ISOLDE, implemented in the computer algebra
system Maple.
