In this paper we discuss four problems regarding Markov equivalences for
subclasses of loopless mixed graphs. We classify these four problems as finding
conditions for internal Markov equivalence, which is Markov equivalence within
a subclass, for external Markov equivalence, which is Markov equivalence
between subclasses, for representational Markov equivalence, which is the
possibility of a graph from a subclass being Markov equivalent to a graph from
another subclass, and finding algorithms to generate a graph from a certain
subclass that is Markov equivalent to a given graph. We particularly focus on
the class of maximal ancestral graphs and its subclasses, namely regression
graphs, bidirected graphs, undirected graphs, and directed acyclic graphs, and
present novel results for representational Markov equivalence and algorithms.
