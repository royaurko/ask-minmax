In the preceding papers (see [1, 2]), the superfluidity of the classical
liquid was proved under the assumption that the parameters $N$ and $r$, where
$N$ is the particle number and $r$ it the capillary radius, tend respectively
to infinity and to zero so that $\frac 1N \ll \frac rR$, where $R$ is the
capillary length. In the present paper, this assumption is removed.
