In this Master's thesis, we consider the problem of classifying, up to
conjugation by linear symplectomorphisms, linear canonical relations
(lagrangian correspondences) from a finite-dimensional symplectic vector space
to itself. We give an elementary introduction to the theory of linear canonical
relations and present partial results toward the classification problem. This
exposition should be accessible to undergraduate students with a basic
familiarity with linear algebra.
