We review recent results obtained for the dynamics of incipient chaos. These
results suggest a common picture underlying the three universal routes to chaos
displayed by the prototypical logistic and circle maps. Namely, the period
doubling, intermittency, and quasiperiodicity routes. In these situations the
dynamical behavior is exactly describable through infinite families of Tsallis'
$q$-exponential functions. Furthermore, the addition of a noise perturbation to
the dynamics at the onset of chaos of the logistic map allows to establish
parallels with the behavior of supercooled liquids close to glass formation.
Specifically, the occurrence of two-step relaxation, aging with its
characteristic scaling property, and subdiffusion and arrest is corroborated
for such a system.
