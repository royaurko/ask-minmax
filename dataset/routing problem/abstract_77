Surveillance applications require a collection of heterogeneous vehicles to
visit a set of targets. In this article, we consider a fundamental routing
problem that arises in these applications involving two vehicles. Specifically,
we consider a routing problem where there are two heterogeneous vehicles that
start from distinct initial locations, and a set of targets. The objective is
to find a tour for each vehicle such that each of the targets is visited at
least once by a vehicle and the sum of the distances traveled by the vehicles
is a minimum. We present a primal-dual algorithm for a variant of this routing
problem that provides an approximation ratio of 2.
