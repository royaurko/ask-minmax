Taking the example of Koretweg--de Vries equation, it is shown that soliton
solutions need not always be the consequence of the trade-off between the
nonlinear terms and the dispersive term in the nonlinear differential equation.
Even the ordinary one dimensional linear partial differential equation can
produce a soliton.
