The exact discrete flavor symmetry, $S_3$ in the hadronic sector and $S_3
\times Z_2$ in the leptonic sector, which has been recently found, is
introduced in a supersymmetric extension of the standard model. We investigate
the supersymmetric flavor problem, and explicitly find that thanks to the
flavor symmetry the dangerous FCNC processes and CP-violating phases are
sufficiently suppressed.
