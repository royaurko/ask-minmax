We show that chaos is present in the symmetric two-block Burridge-Knopoff
model for earthquakes. This is in contrast with previous numerical studies, but
in agreement with experimental results. In this system, we have found a rich
dynamical behavior with an unusual route to chaos. In the three-block system,
we see the appearance of synchronized chaos, showing that this concept can have
potential applications in the field of seismology.
