To a system of second order ordinary differential equations (SODE) one can
assign a canonical nonlinear connection that describes the geometry of the
system. In this work we develop a geometric setting that allows us to assign a
canonical nonlinear connection also to a system of higher order ordinary
differential equations (HODE). For this nonlinear connection we develop its
geometry, and explicitly compute all curvature components of the corresponding
Jacobi endomorphism. Using these curvature components we derive a Jacobi
equation that describes the behavior of nearby geodesics to a HODE. We motivate
the applicability of this nonlinear connection using examples from the
equivalence problem, the inverse problem of the calculus of variations, and
biharmonicity. For example, using components of the Jacobi endomorphism we
express two Wuenschmann-type invariants that appear in the study of scalar
third or fourth order ordinary differential equations.
