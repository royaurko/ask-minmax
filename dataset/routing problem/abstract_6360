A recently proposed discrete version of the Schrodinger spectral problem is
considered. The whole hierarchy of differential-difference nonlinear evolution
equations associated to this spectral problem is derived. It is shown that a
discrete version of the KdV, sine-Gordon and Liouville equations are included
and that the so called `inverse' class in the hierarchy is local. The whole
class of related Darboux and Backlund transformations is also exhibited.
