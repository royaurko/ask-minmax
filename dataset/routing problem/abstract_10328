The concept of open weak CAD is introduced. Every open CAD is an open weak
CAD. On the contrary, an open weak CAD is not necessarily an open CAD. An
algorithm for computing open weak CADs is proposed. The key idea is to compute
the intersection of projection factor sets produced by different projection
orders. The resulting open weak CAD often has smaller number of sample points
than open CADs.
  The algorithm can be used for computing sample points for all open connected
components of $ f\ne 0$ for a given polynomial $f$. It can also be used for
many other applications, such as testing semi-definiteness of polynomials and
copositive problems. In fact, we solved several difficult semi-definiteness
problems efficiently by using the algorithm. Furthermore, applying the
algorithm to copositive problems, we find an explicit expression of the
polynomials producing open weak CADs under some conditions, which significantly
improves the efficiency of solving copositive problems.
