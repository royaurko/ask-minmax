We present molecular dynamics simulations of the homogeneous (mechanical)
melting transition of a bcc metal, vanadium. We study both the nominally
perfect crystal as well as one that includes point defects. According to the
Born criterion, a solid cannot be expanded above a critical volume, at which a
'rigidity catastrophe' occurs. This catastrophe is caused by the vanishing of
the elastic shear modulus. We found that this critical volume is independent of
the route by which it is reached whether by heating the crystal, or by adding
interstitials at a constant temperature which expand the lattice. Overall,
these results are similar to what was found previously for an fcc metal,
copper. The simulations establish a phase diagram of the mechanical melting
temperature as a function of the concentration of interstitials. Our results
show that the Born model of melting applies to bcc metals in both the nominally
perfect state and in the case where point defects are present.
