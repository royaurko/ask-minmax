Marine buoy is an important part of underwater acoustic communication system.
It is of great significance to track and locate it. It is widely used in ocean
environment three - dimensional monitoring, underwater multimedia
communication, underwater mobile carrier navigation and positioning, marine
resources detection, remote control of submarine topography mapping and
offshore oil industry, data acquisition, etc. This paper describes the
application of the monitoring service of GPRS / GPS module at Marine buoy. It
can achieve real - time location of underwater acoustic communication devices
and route tracking to avoid the loss of the device, as well as assist to
retrieve the lost device.
