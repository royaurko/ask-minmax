We discuss the optimal regularity and nondegeneracy of a free boundary
problem related to the fractional Laplacian. This work is related to, but
addresses a different problem from, recent work of Caffarelli, Roquejoffre, and
Sire. A variant of the boundary Harnack inequality is also proved, where it is
no longer required that the function be 0 along the boundary.
