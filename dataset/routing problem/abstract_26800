Let $G$ be a connected graph. A vertex $w$ strongly resolves a pair $u$, $v$
of vertices of $G$ if there exists some shortest $u-w$ path containing $v$ or
some shortest $v-w$ path containing $u$. A set $W$ of vertices is a strong
resolving set for $G$ if every pair of vertices of $G$ is strongly resolved by
some vertex of $W$. The smallest cardinality of a strong resolving set for $G$
is called the strong metric dimension of $G$. It is known that the problem of
computing this invariant is NP-hard. This suggests finding the strong metric
dimension for special classes of graphs or obtaining good bounds on this
invariant. In this paper we study the problem of finding exact values or sharp
bounds for the strong metric dimension of rooted product of graphs and express
these in terms of invariants of the factor graphs.
