In commodity markets, the convergence of futures towards spot prices as the
time to maturity of the contracts goes to zero is usually justified by
no-arbitrage arguments. In this paper we propose an alternative approach, that
relies on the expected profit maximization problem of an agent producing and
storing a commodity while trading in the associated futures contracts. In this
framework, the relation between the spot and the futures prices holds through
the well-posedness of the maximization problem. We show that the futures price
can still be seen as the risk-neutral expectation of the spot price at maturity
and we propose an explicit formula for the forward volatility. Moreover, we
provide an heuristic analysis of the optimal solution for the production /
storage / trading problem, in a Markovian setting. This approach is
particularly interesting in the case of energy commodity: it remains suitable
for commodities characterized by storability constraints, when standard
no-arbitrage arguments can not be safely applied.
