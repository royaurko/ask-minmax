We consider a symmetry-preserving approach to the nucleon-nucleon scattering
problem in the framework of the higher-derivative formulation of baryon chiral
perturbation theory. Within this framework the leading-order amplitude is
calculated by solving renormalizable equations and corrections are taken into
account perturbatively.
