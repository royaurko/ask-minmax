In THz reflection spectroscopy the complex permittivity of an opaque medium
is determined on the basis of the amplitude and of the phase of the reflected
wave. There is usually a problem of phase error due to misplacement of the
reference sample. Such experimental error brings inconsistency between phase
and amplitude invoked by the causality principle. We propose a rigorous method
to solve this relevant experimental problem by using an optimization method
based upon singly subtractive Kramers-Kronig relations. The applicability of
the method is demonstrated for measured data on an n-type undoped (100) InAs
wafer in the spectral range from 0.5 up to 2.5 THz.
