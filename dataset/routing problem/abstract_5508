In this work we investigate the complexity of some problems related to the
{\em Simultaneous Embedding with Fixed Edges} (SEFE) of $k$ planar graphs and
the PARTITIONED $k$-PAGE BOOK EMBEDDING (PBE-$k$) problems, which are known to
be equivalent under certain conditions.
  While the computational complexity of SEFE for $k=2$ is still a central open
question in Graph Drawing, the problem is NP-complete for $k \geq 3$ [Gassner
{\em et al.}, WG '06], even if the intersection graph is the same for each pair
of graphs ({\em sunflower intersection}) [Schaefer, JGAA (2013)].
  We improve on these results by proving that SEFE with $k \geq 3$ and
sunflower intersection is NP-complete even when the intersection graph is a
tree and all the input graphs are biconnected. Also, we prove NP-completeness
for $k \geq 3$ of problem PBE-$k$ and of problem PARTITIONED T-COHERENT
$k$-PAGE BOOK EMBEDDING (PTBE-$k$) - that is the generalization of PBE-$k$ in
which the ordering of the vertices on the spine is constrained by a tree $T$ -
even when two input graphs are biconnected. Further, we provide a linear-time
algorithm for PTBE-$k$ when $k-1$ pages are assigned a connected graph.
Finally, we prove that the problem of maximizing the number of edges that are
drawn the same in a SEFE of two graphs is NP-complete in several restricted
settings ({\em optimization version of SEFE}, Open Problem $9$, Chapter $11$ of
the Handbook of Graph Drawing and Visualization).
