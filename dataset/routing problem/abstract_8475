We prove regularity results up to the boundary for time independent
generalized Maxwell equations on Riemannian manifolds with boundary using the
calculus of alternating differential forms. We discuss homogeneous and
inhomogeneous boundary data and show 'polynomially weighted' regularity in
exterior domains as well.
