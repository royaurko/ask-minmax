We consider the horizon problem in a homogeneous but anisotropic universe
(Bianchi type I). We show that the problem cannot be solved if (1) the matter
obeys the strong energy condition with the positive energy density and (2) the
Einstein equations hold. The strong energy condition is violated during
cosmological inflation.
