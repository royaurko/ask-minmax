A non-axion solution to the Strong CP Problem is proposed that works even in
the context of gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking. Both
$\epsilon'/\epsilon$ and indirect CP violation in the $B-\bar{B}$ are predicted
to be unobservably small. $\mu \longrightarrow e \gamma$ is predicted to arise,
typically, with branching ration $3 \times 10^{-12}$. A new source of dark
matter is also predicted in the model.
