We consider an evolution equation with the regularized fractional derivative
of an order $\alpha \in (0,1)$ with respect to the time variable, and a
uniformly elliptic operator with variable coefficients acting in the spatial
variables. Such equations describe diffusion on inhomogeneous fractals. A
fundamental solution of the Cauchy problem is constructed and investigated.
