We prove that a two-component mirror-symmetric analytic obstacle in the plane
is determined by its resonance poles among such obstacles. The proof is
essentially the same as in the interior case (part II of the series). A
so-called interior/exterior duality formula is used to simplify the proof. A
fair amount of exposition is included for the sake of completeness.
