Because micro-ions accumulate around highly charged colloidal particles in
electrolyte solutions, the relevant parameter to compute their interactions is
not the bare charge, but an effective (or renormalized) quantity, whose value
is sensitive to the geometry of the colloid, the temperature or the presence of
added-salt. This non-linear screening effect is a central feature in the field
of colloidal suspensions or polyelectrolyte solutions. We propose a simple
method to predict effective charges of highly charged macro-ions, that is
reliable for mono-valent electrolytes (and counter-ions) in the colloidal limit
(large size compared to both screening length and Bjerrum length). Taking
reference to the non linear Poisson-Boltzmann theory, the method is
successfully tested against the geometry of the macro-ions, the possible
confinement in a Wigner-Seitz cell, and the presence of added salt. Moreover,
our results are corroborated by various experimental measures reported in the
literature. This approach provides a useful route to incorporate the non-linear
effects of charge renormalization within a linear theory for systems where
electrostatic interactions play an important role.
