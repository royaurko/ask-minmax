We consider the problems of parameter estimation for several models of
threshold ergodic diffusion processes in the asymptotics of large samples.
These models are the direct continuous time analogues of the well-known in time
series analysis threshold autoregressive (TAR) models. In such models the trend
is switching when the observed process atteints some (unknown) values and the
problem is to estimate it or to test some hypotheses concerning these values.
The related statistical problems correspond to the singular estimation or
testing, for example, the rate of convergence of estimators is $T$ and not
$\sqrt{T}$ as in regular estimation problems. We study the asymptotic behavior
of the maximum likelihood and bayesian estimators and discuss the possibility
of the construction of the goodness of fit test for such models of observation.
