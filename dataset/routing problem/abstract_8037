The onset of convection in a horizontal layer of fluid heated from below in
the presence of a gravity field varying across the layer is investigated. The
eigenvalue problem governing the linear stability of the mechanical equilibria
of the fluid layer in the case of free boundaries is solved using a Galerkin
method based on shifted polynomials (Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials).
