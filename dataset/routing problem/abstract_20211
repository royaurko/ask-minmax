Originally a technical tool, the derived category of coherent sheaves over an
algebraic variety has become over the last twenty years an important invariant
in the birational study of algebraic varieties. Problems of birational
invariance and of minimization of the derived category have appeared, inspired
by Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry conjecture and Mori's minimal model
program. We present the main conjectures and their proofs in dimension 3 and
for particular classes of flops.
