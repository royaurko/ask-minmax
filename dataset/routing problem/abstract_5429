In this paper, we study power allocation strategies for a fixed-gain
amplify-and-forward relay network employing multiple relays. We consider two
optimization problems for the relay network: 1) optimal power allocation to
maximize the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and 2) minimizing the total
consumed power while maintaining the end-to-end SNR over a threshold value. We
investigate these two problems for two relaying protocols of all-participate
relaying and selective relaying and multiple cases of available channel state
information (CSI) at the relays. We show that the SNR maximization problem is
concave and the power minimization problem is convex for all protocols and CSI
cases considered. We obtain closed-form expressions for the two problems in the
case for full CSI and CSI of all the relay-destination links at the relays and
solve the problems through convex programming when full CSI or CSI of the
relay-destination links are not available at the relays. Numerical results show
the benefit of having full CSI at the relays for both optimization problems.
However, they also show that CSI overhead can be reduced by having only partial
CSI at the relays with only a small degradation in performance.
