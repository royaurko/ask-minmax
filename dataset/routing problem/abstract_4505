We address multiscale elliptic problems with random coefficients that are a
perturbation of multiscale deterministic problems. Our approach consists in
taking benefit of the perturbative context to suitably modify the classical
Finite Element basis into a deterministic multiscale Finite Element basis. The
latter essentially shares the same approximation properties as a multiscale
Finite Element basis directly generated on the random problem. The specific
reference method that we use is the Multiscale Finite Element Method. Using
numerical experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of our approach and the
computational speed-up with respect to a more standard approach. We provide a
complete analysis of the approach, extending that available for the
deterministic setting.
