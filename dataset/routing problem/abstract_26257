We investigate confined L\'{e}vy flights under premises of the principle of
detailed balance. The master equation admits a transformation to L\'{e}vy -
Schr\"{o}dinger semigroup dynamics (akin to a mapping of the Fokker-Planck
equation into the generalized diffusion equation). We solve a stochastic
targeting problem for arbitrary stability index $0<\mu <2$ of L\'{e}vy drivers:
given an invariant probability density function (pdf), specify the jump - type
dynamics for which this pdf is a long-time asymptotic target. Our
("$\mu$-targeting") method is exemplified by Cauchy family and Gaussian target
pdfs. We solve the reverse engineering problem for so-called L\'{e}vy
oscillators: given a quadratic semigroup potential, find an asymptotic pdf for
the associated master equation for arbitrary $\mu$.
