We formulate and study the algorithmic mechanism design problem for a general
class of resource allocation settings, where the center redistributes the
private resources brought by individuals. Money transfer is forbidden. Distinct
from the standard literature, which assumes the amount of resources brought by
an individual to be public information, we consider this amount as an agent's
private, possibly multi-dimensional type. Our goal is to design truthful
mechanisms that achieve two objectives: max-min and Pareto efficiency. For each
objective, we provide a reduction that converts any optimal algorithm into a
strategy-proof mechanism that achieves the same objective. Our reductions do
not inspect the input algorithms but only query these algorithms as oracles.
Applying the reductions, we produce strategy-proof mechanisms in a non-trivial
application: network route allocation. Our models and result in the application
are valuable on their own rights.
