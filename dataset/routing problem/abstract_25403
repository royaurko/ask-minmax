The estimation of a covariance matrix from an insufficient amount of data is
one of the most common problems in fields as diverse as multivariate
statistics, wireless communications, signal processing, biology, learning
theory and finance. In \cite{MTS}, a new approach to handle singular covariance
matrices was suggested. The main idea was to use dimensionality reduction in
conjunction with an average over the unitary matrices. In this paper we
continue with this idea and we further consider new innovative approaches that
show considerable improvements with respect to traditional methods such as
diagonal loading. One of the methods is called the \emph{Ewens} estimator and
uses a randomization of the sample covariance matrix over all the permutation
matrices with respect to the Ewens measure. The techniques used to attack this
problem are broad and run from random matrix theory to combinatorics.
