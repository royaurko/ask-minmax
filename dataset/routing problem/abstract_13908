In this article we have solved an hypothetical problem related to the
stability and gross properties of two dimensional self-gravitating stellar
objects using Thomas-Fermi model. The formalism presented here is an extension
of the standard three-dimensional problem discussed in the book on statistical
physics, Part-I by Landau and Lifshitz.
