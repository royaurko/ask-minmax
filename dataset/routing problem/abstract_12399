We solve a certain case of the minimal genus problem for embedded surfaces in
elliptic 4-manifolds. The proofs involve a restricted transitivity property of
the action of the orientation preserving diffeomorphism group on the second
homology. In the case we consider we get the minimal possible genus allowed by
the adjunction inequality.
