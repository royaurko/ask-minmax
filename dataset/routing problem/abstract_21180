The solution of a boundary-value problem formulated for a modified
Kretschmann configuration shows that a surface-plasmon wave can be excited at
the planar interface of a sufficiently thin metal film and a nondissipative
structurally chiral medium, provided the exciting plane wave is p-polarized. An
estimate of the wavenumber of the surface-plasmon wave also emerges thereby.
