Means are used in several applications from electronic engeneering to
information theory, however there is no general theorem on how to extend a
given M(x, y) mean function to multiple variable forms. In this article we
would like to present a theorem, which gives one possible solution for this
problem, for every M(x, y) mean function, acting on positive numbers and
operators.
