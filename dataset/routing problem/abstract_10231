The "scenario approach" provides an intuitive method to address chance
constrained problems arising in control design for uncertain systems. It
addresses these problems by replacing the chance constraint with a finite
number of sampled constraints (scenarios). The sample size critically depends
on Helly's dimension, a quantity always upper bounded by the number of decision
variables. However, this standard bound can lead to computationally expensive
programs whose solutions are conservative in terms of cost and violation
probability. We derive improved bounds of Helly's dimension for problems where
the chance constraint has certain structural properties. The improved bounds
lower the number of scenarios required for these problems, leading both to
improved objective value and reduced computational complexity. Our results are
generally applicable to Randomized Model Predictive Control of chance
constrained linear systems with additive uncertainty and affine disturbance
feedback. The efficacy of the proposed bound is demonstrated on an inventory
management example.
