This work is devoted to the study of the existence and periodicity of
solutions of initial differential problems, paying special attention to the
explicit computation of the period. These problems are also connected with some
particular initial and boundary value problems with reflection, which allows us
to prove existence of solutions of the latter using the existence of the first.
