This paper is the first in a series of three which attempt to resolve the
difficulties that have plagued the $NN-\pi NN$ problem for the past ten years.
Various theoretical inconsistencies in the current formulation have been
pointed out and this work aims to eliminate these inconsistencies and so, we
hope, produce agreement with experiment. This is to be done by using covariant
perturbation theory, in which these inconsistencies are not present. The
covariant perturbation theory is developed starting from a model Lagrangian, in
order to fix notation and phases. It is shown that both old-fashioned
"time-ordered" perturbation theory and the convolution integral of Kvinikhidze
and Blankleider may be recovered from the covariant perturbation theory when
certain approximations are made. The connection of these results with the work
of Klein, L\'evy, Macke and Kadyshevsky is discussed. Two forthcoming papers
will pursue this covariant calculation in the $NN-\pi NN$ system using the
model and perturbation scheme developed in this paper and derive fully
covariant $NN-\pi NN$ equations without the double counting problems present in
previous covariant equations.
