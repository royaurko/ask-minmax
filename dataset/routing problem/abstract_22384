An operator $M$ acting on the space of real analytic functions is called a
multiplier if every monomial is its eigenvector. In this paper we state some
results concerning the problem of generating strongly continuous semigroups by
multipliers. In particular we show when the Euler differential operator of
finite order is a generator and when it is not.
