A brief discussion is given of the traditional version of the Maximum Entropy
Method, including a review of some of the criticism that has been made in
regard to its use in statistical inference. Motivated by these questions, a
modified version of the method is proposed and applied to a simple problem,
demonstrating its use in inference.
