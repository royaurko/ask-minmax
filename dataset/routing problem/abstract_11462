The summation of all rainbow diagrams in QED in a strong magnetic field leads
to a dynamical electron mass on the light-cone. Further contributions to this
summation however can cause problems with light-cone singularities. It is shown
that these problems are generally avoided by applying the point-splitting
regularization to every diagram. The possibility of implementing this procedure
into the Lagrangian of the theory is discussed.
