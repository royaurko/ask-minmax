Dribbling an opponent player in digital soccer environment is an important
practical problem in motion planning. It has special complexities which can be
generalized to most important problems in other similar Multi Agent Systems. In
this paper, we propose a hybrid computational geometry and evolutionary
computation approach for generating motion trajectories to avoid a mobile
obstacle. In this case an opponent agent is not only an obstacle but also one
who tries to harden dribbling procedure. One characteristic of this approach is
reducing process cost of online stage by transferring it to offline stage which
causes increment in agents' performance. This approach breaks the problem into
two offline and online stages. During offline stage the goal is to find desired
trajectory using evolutionary computation and saving it as a trajectory plan. A
trajectory plan consists of nodes which approximate information of each
trajectory plan. In online stage, a linear interpolation along with Delaunay
triangulation in xy-plan is applied to trajectory plan to retrieve desired
action.
