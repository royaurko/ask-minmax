Non-holonomic constraints, both in the Lagragian and Hamiltonian formalism,
are discussed from the geometrical viewpoint of implicit differential
equations. A precise statement of both problems is presented remarking the
similarities and differences with other classical problems with constraints. In
our discussion, apart from a constraint submanifold, a field of permitted
directions and a system of reaction forces are given, the later being in
principle unrelated to the constraint submanifold. An implicit differential
equation is associated to a non-holonomic problem using the Tulczyjew's
geometrical description of the Legendre transformation. The integrable part of
this implicit differential equation is extracted using an adapted version of
the integrability algorithm. Moreover, sufficient conditions are found that
guarantees the compatibility of the non-holonomic problem, i.e., that assures
that the integrability algorithm stops at first step, and moreover it implies
the existence of a vector field whose integral curves are the solutions to the
problem. In addition this vector field turns out to be a second order
differential equation. These compatibility conditions are shown to include as
particular cases many others obtained previously by other contributors. Several
examples and further lines of development of the subject are also discussed.
