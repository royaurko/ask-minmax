We study the dynamics of polariton condensate wave trains that propagate
along a quasi one-dimensional waveguide. Through the application of tuneable
potential barriers the propagation can be reflected and multiple reflections
used to confine and store a propagating state. Energy-relaxation processes
allow the delayed relaxation into a long-living coherent ground state. Aside
the potential routing of polariton condensate signals, the system forms an
AND-type logic gate compatible with incoherent inputs.
