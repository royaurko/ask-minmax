We use a semi-analytic model of halo formation to study the dynamical history
of giant field galaxies like the Milky Way. We find that in a concordance LCDM
cosmology, most isolated disk galaxies have remained undisturbed for 8-10 Gyr,
such that the age of the Milky Way's thin disk is unremarkable. Many systems
also have older disk components which have been thickened by minor mergers,
consistent with recent observations of nearby field galaxies. We do have a
considerable problem, however, reproducing the morphological mix of nearby
galaxies. In our fiducial model, most systems have disk-to-bulge mass ratios of
order 1, and look like S0s rather than spirals. This result depends mainly on
merger statistics, and is unchanged for most reasonable choices of our model
parameters. We discuss two possible solutions to this morphology problem in
LCDM.
