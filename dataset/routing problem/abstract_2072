The mutual compatibility of the dynamical equations and constraints
describing a massive particle of arbitrary spin, though essential for
consistency, is generically lost in the presence of interactions. The
conventional Lagrangian approach avoids this difficulty, but fails to ensure
light-cone propagation and becomes very cumbersome. In this paper, we take an
alternative route--the involutive form of the equations and constraints--to
guarantee their algebraic consistency. This approach enormously simplifies the
search for consistent interactions, now seen as deformations of the involutive
system, by keeping manifest the causal propagation of the correct number of
degrees of freedom. We consider massive particles of arbitrary integer spin in
electromagnetic and gravitational backgrounds to find their possible
non-minimal local couplings. Apart from easily reproducing some well-known
results, we find restrictions on the backgrounds for consistent propagation of
such a particle in isolation. The results can be altered by non-local
interactions that may arise from additional massive states in the interacting
theory.
