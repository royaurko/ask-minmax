We show tight bounds for both online integer multiplication and convolution
in the cell-probe model with word size w. For the multiplication problem, one
pair of digits, each from one of two n digit numbers that are to be multiplied,
is given as input at step i. The online algorithm outputs a single new digit
from the product of the numbers before step i+1. We give a Theta((d/w)*log n)
bound on average per output digit for this problem where 2^d is the maximum
value of a digit. In the convolution problem, we are given a fixed vector V of
length n and we consider a stream in which numbers arrive one at a time. We
output the inner product of V and the vector that consists of the last n
numbers of the stream. We show a Theta((d/w)*log n) bound for the number of
probes required per new number in the stream. All the bounds presented hold
under randomisation and amortisation. Multiplication and convolution are
central problems in the study of algorithms which also have the widest range of
practical applications.
