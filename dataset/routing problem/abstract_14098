The solution of the continuous time filtering problem can be represented as a
ratio of two expectations of certain functionals of the signal process that are
parametrized by the observation path. We introduce a new time discretisation of
these functionals corresponding to a chosen partition of the time interval and
show that the convergence rate of discretisation is proportional with the
square of the mesh of the partition.
