Boundary element methods produce dense linear systems that can be accelerated
via multipole expansions. Solved with Krylov methods, this implies computing
the matrix-vector products within each iteration with some error, at an
accuracy controlled by the order of the expansion, $p$. We take advantage of a
unique property of Krylov iterations that allow lower accuracy of the
matrix-vector products as convergence proceeds, and propose a relaxation
strategy based on progressively decreasing $p$. Via extensive numerical tests,
we show that the relaxed Krylov iterations converge with speed-ups of between
2x and 4x for Laplace problems and between 3.5x and 4.5x for Stokes problems.
We include an application to Stokes flow around red blood cells, computing with
up to 64 cells and problem size up to 131k boundary elements and nearly 400k
unknowns. The study was done with an in-house multi-threaded C++ code, on a
quad-core CPU.
