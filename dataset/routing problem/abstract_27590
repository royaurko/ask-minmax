In unlabeled multi-robot motion planning several interchangeable robots
operate in a common workspace. The goal is to move the robots to a set of
target positions such that each position will be occupied by some robot. In
this paper, we study this problem for the specific case of unit-square robots
moving amidst polygonal obstacles and show that it is PSPACE-hard. We also
consider three additional variants of this problem and show that they are all
PSPACE-hard as well. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first hardness
proof for the unlabeled case. Furthermore, our proofs can be used to show that
the labeled variant (where each robot is assigned with a specific target
position), again, for unit-square robots, is PSPACE-hard as well, which sets
another precedence, as previous hardness results require the robots to be of
different shapes.
