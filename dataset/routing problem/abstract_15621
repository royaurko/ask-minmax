Proceeding from a homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann universe a conceptional
problem concerning light propagation in an expanding universe is brought up. As
a possible solution of this problem it is suggested that light waves do not
scale with R(t). With the aid of a Generalized Equivalence Principle a
cosmologic model with variable "constants" c, H, and G is constructed. It is
shown that with an appropriate variation of the Boltzmann "constant" k the
thermal evolution of the universe is similar to the standard model. It is
further shown that this model explains the cosmological redshift as well as
certain problems of the standard model (horizon, flatness, accelerated
expansion of the universe).
