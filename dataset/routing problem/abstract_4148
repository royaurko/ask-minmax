Linearization problem of ordinary differential equations by a new set of
tangent transformations is considered in the paper. This set of transformations
allows one to extend the set of transformations applied for the linearization
problem. Criteria for fourth-order ordinary differential equations to be
linearizable are obtained in a particular case; a linearization test and
procedure for obtaining the linearizing transformations are provided in
explicit forms.
