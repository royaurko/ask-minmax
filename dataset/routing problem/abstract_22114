Consider a finitely generated group $G$ that is relatively hyperbolic with
respect to a family of subgroups $H_1, ..., H_n$. We present an axiomatic
approach to the problem of extending metric properties from the subgroups $H_i$
to the full group $G$. In particular, we show that both finite decomposition
complexity and straight finite decomposition complexity are extendable
properties, as are certain weakened versions.
