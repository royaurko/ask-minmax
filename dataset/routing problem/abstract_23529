In this paper we investigate the effects of gravitational backreaction for
the late time Hawking radiation of evaporating near-extremal black holes. This
problem can be studied within the framework of an effective one-loop solvable
model on AdS_2. We find that the Hawking flux goes down exponentially and it is
proportional to a parameter which depends on details of the collapsing matter.
This result seems to suggest that the information of the initial state is not
lost and that the boundary of AdS_2 acts, at least at late times, as a sort of
stretched horizon in the Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime.
