The phase transition from the Abrikosov state to the normal state with
superconducting fluctuations observed below the second critical field and
well-known as vortex lattice melting was one of the most popular problems in
the nineties. This problem had became popular after the discovery of high-Tc
superconductors because the fluctuation phenomena are much stronger in the HTSC
than in the conventional superconductors. Most people are sure that this sharp
transition was observed for the present only in HTSC and are ignorant that it
was observed as far back as 1981, before the HTSC discovery. In the last years
some papers devoted to the problem of vortex lattice melting in conventional
superconductors were published. The contributors of these papers and others should
be aware of the result obtained before the HTSC discovery. It was found first
in the presented paper that the transition into the Abrikosov vortex state is
very narrow in high quality samples with weak pinning and it is observed below
the second critical field. These results signify that this phase transition can
be first-order and it is not connected directly with appearance of a finite
density of superconducting pairs.
