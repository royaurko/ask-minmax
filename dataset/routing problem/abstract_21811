We discuss the discrete data assimilation problem for the 3D viscous
primitive equations arising in the modeling of large scale phenomena in oceanic
dynamics. Our main result states possibility of asymptotically reliable
prognosis based on a discrete sequence of finite number of scalar observations.
Our method is quite general and can be applied to a wide class of dissipative
systems.
