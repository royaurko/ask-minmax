We present an exact solution for the time-dependent Stokes problem of an
infinite cylinder of radius r=a in a fluid with harmonic boundary conditions at
infinity. This is a 3-dimensional problem but, because of translational
invariance along the axis of the cylinder it effectively reduces to a
2-dimensional one. The Stokes problem being a linear reduction of the full
Navier-Stokes equations, we show how to satisfy the no-slip boundary condition
at the cylinder surface and the harmonic boundary condition at infinity,
exhibit the full velocity field for radius r>a, and discuss the nature of the
solutions for the specific case of air at sea level.
