Several techniques and tools have been developed for verification of
properties expressed as Horn clauses with constraints over a background theory
(CHC). Current CHC verification tools implement intricate algorithms and are
often limited to certain subclasses of CHC problems. Our aim in this work is to
investigate the use of a combination of off-the-shelf techniques from the
literature in analysis and transformation of Constraint Logic Programs (CLPs)
to solve challenging CHC verification problems. We find that many problems can
be solved using a combination of tools based on well-known techniques from
abstract interpretation, semantics-preserving transformations, program
specialisation and query-answer transformations. This gives insights into the
design of automatic, more general CHC verification tools based on a library of
components.
