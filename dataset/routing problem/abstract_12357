In the previous papers in this series, the global regularity conjecture for
wave maps from two-dimensional Minkowski space $\R^{1+2}$ to hyperbolic space
$\H^m$ was reduced to the problem of constructing a minimal-energy blowup
solution which is almost periodic modulo symmetries in the event that the
conjecture fails. In this paper, we show that this problem can be reduced
further, to that of showing that solutions at the critical energy which are
either frequency-delocalised, spatially-dispersed, or spatially-delocalised
have bounded ``entropy''. These latter facts will be demonstrated in the final
paper in this series.
