We study a dynamic scenario of the static route planning problem in road
networks. Particularly, we put accent on the most practical dynamic case -
increased edge weights (up to infinity). We show how to enhance the scope-based
route planning approach presented at ESA'11 to intuitively by-pass closures by
detours. Three variants of a detour "admissibility" are presented - from a
simple one with straightforward implementation through its enhanced version to
a full and very complex variant variant which always returns an optimal detour.
