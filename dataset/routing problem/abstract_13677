In this paper we introduce trajectory-based labeling, a new variant of
dynamic map labeling, where a movement trajectory for the map viewport is
given. We define a general labeling model and study the active range
maximization problem in this model. The problem is NP-complete and W[1]-hard.
In the restricted, yet practically relevant case that no more than k labels can
be active at any time, we give polynomial-time algorithms. For the general case
we present a practical ILP formulation with an experimental evaluation as well
as approximation algorithms.
