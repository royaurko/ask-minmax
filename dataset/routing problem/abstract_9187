In this paper we continue the study started in part I (posted). We consider a
planar, bounded, $m$-connected region $\Omega$, and let $\bord\Omega$ be its
boundary. Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a cellular decomposition of
$\Omega\cup\bord\Omega$, where each 2-cell is either a triangle or a
quadrilateral. From these data and a conductance function we construct a
canonical pair $(S,f)$ where $S$ is a special type of a (possibly immersed)
genus $(m-1)$ singular flat surface, tiled by rectangles and $f$ is an energy
preserving mapping from ${\mathcal T}^{(1)}$ onto $S$. In part I the solution
of a Dirichlet problem defined on ${\mathcal T}^{(0)}$ was utilized, in this
paper we employ the solution of a mixed Dirichlet-Neumann problem.
