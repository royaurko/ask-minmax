We study competitive resource allocation problems in which players distribute
their demands integrally on a set of resources subject to player-specific
submodular capacity constraints. Each player has to pay for each unit of demand
a cost that is a nondecreasing and convex function of the total allocation of
that resource. This general model of resource allocation generalizes both
singleton congestion games with integer-splittable demands and matroid
congestion games with player-specific costs. As our main result, we show that
in such general resource allocation problems a pure Nash equilibrium is
guaranteed to exist by giving a pseudo-polynomial algorithm computing a pure
Nash equilibrium.
