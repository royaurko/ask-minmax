Dual decomposition is a powerful technique for deriving decomposition schemes
for convex optimization problems with separable structure. Although the
Augmented Lagrangian is computationally more stable than the ordinary
Lagrangian, the prox-term destroys the separability of the given problem. In
this paper we use another approach to obtain a smooth Lagrangian, based on a
smoothing technique developed by Nesterov, which preserves separability of the
problem. With this approach we derive a new decomposition method, called
proximal center algorithm, which from the viewpoint of efficiency estimates
improves the bounds on the number of iterations of the classical dual gradient
scheme by an order of magnitude. This can be achieved with the new
decomposition algorithm since the resulting dual function has good smoothness
properties and since we make use of the particular structure of the given
problem.
