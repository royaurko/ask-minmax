We present results for r-modes of relativistic nonbarotropic stars. We show
that the main differential equation, which is formally singular at lowest order
in the slow-rotation expansion, can be regularized if one considers the initial
value problem rather than the normal mode problem. However, a more physically
motivated way to regularize the problem is to include higher order terms. This
allows us to develop a practical approach for solving the problem and we
provide results that support earlier conclusions obtained for uniform density
stars. In particular, we show that there will exist a single r-mode for each
permissible combination of $l$ and $m$. We discuss these results and provide
some caveats regarding their usefulness for estimates of
gravitational-radiation reaction timescales. The close connection between the
seemingly singular relativistic r-mode problem and issues arising because of
the presence of corotation points in differentially rotating stars is also
clarified.
