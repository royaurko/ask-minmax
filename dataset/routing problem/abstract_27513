We analyze the distinguishability of two sources in a Neyman-Pearson set-up
when an attacker is allowed to modify the output of one of the two sources
subject to a distortion constraint. By casting the problem in a game-theoretic
framework and by exploiting the parallelism between the attacker's goal and
Optimal Transport Theory, we introduce the concept of Security Margin defined
as the maximum average per-sample distortion introduced by the attacker for
which the two sources can be distinguished ensuring arbitrarily small, yet
positive, error exponents for type I and type II error probabilities. Several
versions of the problem are considered according to the available knowledge
about the sources and the type of distance used to define the distortion
constraint. We compute the security margin for some classes of sources and
derive a general upper bound assuming that the distortion is measured in terms
of the mean square error between the original and the attacked sequence.
