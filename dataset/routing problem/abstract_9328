This paper introduces a three-phase heuristic approach for a large-scale
energy management and maintenance scheduling problem. The problem is concerned
with scheduling maintenance and refueling for nuclear power plants up to five
years into the future, while handling a number of scenarios for future demand
and prices. The goal is to minimize the expected total production costs. The
first phase of the heuristic solves a simplified constraint programming model
of the problem, the second performs a local search, and the third handles
overproduction in a greedy fashion.
  This work was initiated in the context of the ROADEF/EURO Challenge 2010, a
competition organized jointly by the French Operational Research and Decision
Support Society, the European Operational Research Society, and the European
utility company Electricite de France. In the concluding phase of the
competition our team ranked second in the junior category and sixth overall.
  After correcting an implementation bug in the program that was submitted for
evaluation, our heuristic solves all ten real-life instances, and the solutions
obtained are all within 2.45% of the currently best known solutions. The
results given here would have ranked first in the original competition.
