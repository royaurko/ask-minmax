This paper gives an analysis of the movement of n+1 almost parallel filaments
or vortices. Starting from a polygonal equilibrium of n vortices with equal
circulation and one vortex at the center of the polygon, we find bifurcation of
periodic solutions. The bifurcation result makes use of the orthogonal degree
in order to prove global bifurcation of periodic solutions depending on the
circulation of the central vortex. In the case of the filament problem these
solutions are periodic traveling waves.
