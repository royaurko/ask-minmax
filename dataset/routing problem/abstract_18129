Subspace clustering is the problem of clustering data that lie close to a
union of linear subspaces. In this paper, we consider an abstract version of
this problem, where one is given a set of points lying in general position
inside the algebraic variety of a union of subspaces, and the objective is to
decompose the underlying variety into its constituent subspaces. Prior
algebraic-geometric approaches to this problem require the subspaces to be of
equal dimension, or the number of subspaces to be known. While an algorithm
addressing the general case of an unknown number of subspaces of possibly
different dimensions had been proposed, a proof for its correctness had not
been given. In this paper, we propose a provably correct algorithm for
addressing the general case. Our algorithm uses the gradient of a vanishing
polynomial at a point in the variety to find a hyperplane containing the
subspace passing through that point. By intersecting the variety with this
hyperplane and recursively applying the procedure until no non-zero vanishing
polynomial exists, our algorithm identifies the subspace containing that point.
By repeating this procedure for other points, our algorithm eventually
identifies all the subspaces by returning a basis for their orthogonal
complement.
