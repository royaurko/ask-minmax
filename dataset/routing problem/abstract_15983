A novel parallel technique for Fourier-Galerkin pseudo-spectral methods with
applications to two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and inviscid Boussinesq
approximation equations is presented. It takes the advantage of the programming
structure of the phase-shift de-aliased scheme for pseudo-spectral codes, and
combines the task-distribution strategy [Yin, Clercx and Montgomery, Comput.
Fluids, 33, 509 (2004)] and parallelized Fast Fourier Transform scheme. The
performances of the resulting MPI Fortran90 codes with the new procedure on SGI
3800 are reported. For fixed resolution of the same problem, the peak speed of
the new scheme can be twice as fast as the old parallel methods. The
parallelized codes are used to solve some challenging numerical problems
governed by the Navier-Stokes equations and the Boussinesq equations. Two
interesting physical problems, namely, the double-valued $\omega$-$\psi $
structure in two-dimensional decaying turbulence and the collapse of the bubble
cap in the Boussinesq simulation, are solved by using the proposed parallel
algorithms.
