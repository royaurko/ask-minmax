We present an efficient algorithm for calculating the minimum energy path
(MEP) and energy barriers between local minima on a multidimensional potential
energy surface (PES). Such paths play a central role in the understanding of
transition pathways between metastable states. Our method relies on the
original formulation of the string method [Phys. Rev. B ${\bf 66}$, 052301
(2002)], i.e. to evolve a smooth curve along a direction normal to the curve.
The algorithm works by performing minimization steps on hyperplanes normal to
the curve. Therefore the problem of finding MEP on the PES is remodeled as a
set of constrained minimization problems. This provides the flexibility of
using minimization algorithms faster than the steepest descent method used in
the simplified string method [J. Chem. Phys., ${\bf 126}$(16),164103 (2007)].
At the same time, it provides a more direct analog of the finite temperature
string method. The applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated using various
examples.
