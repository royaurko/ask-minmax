We consider the problem of enumerating Dyck paths staying weakly above the
x-axis with a limit to the number of consecutive up steps, or a limit to the
number of consecutive down steps. We use Finite Operator Calculus to obtain
formulas for the number of all such paths reaching a given point in the first
quadrant. All our results are based on the Eulerian coefficients.
