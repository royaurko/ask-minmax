We consider an inverse scattering problem and its near-field approximation at
high frequencies. We first prove, for both problems, Lipschitz stability
results for determining the low-frequency component of the potential. Then we
show that, in the case of a radial potential supported sufficiently near the
boundary, infinite resolution can be achieved from measurements of the
near-field operator in the monotone case.
