We show that a $k$-fold covering using translates of an arbitrary convex
polygon can be decomposed into $\Omega(k)$ covers (using an efficient
algorithm). We generalize this result to obtain a constant factor approximation
to the sensor cover problem where the ranges of the sensors are translates of a
given convex polygon. The crucial ingredient in this generalization is a
constant factor approximation algorithm for a one-dimensional version of the
sensor cover problem, called the Restricted Strip Cover (RSC) problem, where
sensors are intervals of possibly different lengths. Our algorithm for RSC
improves on the previous $O(\log \log \log n)$ approximation.
