In this paper we construct strong exceptional collections of vector bundles
on smooth projective varieties that have a prescribed endomorphism algebra. We
prove the construction problem always have a solution. We consider some
applications to noncommutative projective planes and to the quiver connected
with the 3-point Ising function.
