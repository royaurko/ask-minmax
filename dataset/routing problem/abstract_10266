We consider the NP-hard problem of minimizing a convex quadratic function
over the integer lattice $Z^n$. We present a semidefinite programming (SDP)
method for obtaining a nontrivial lower bound on the optimal value of the
problem. By interpreting the solution to the SDP relaxation probabilistically,
we obtain a randomized algorithm for finding good suboptimal solutions. The
effectiveness of the method is shown for numerical problem instances of various
sizes. Finally, we introduce several extensions to the idea, including how to
reduce the search space of existing branch-and-bound type enumeration
algorithms for solving the problem globally, by using the tighter lower and
upper bounds.
