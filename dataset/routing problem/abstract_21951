We consider a stable driven degenerate stochastic differential equation,
whose coefficients satisfy a kind of weak H{\"o}rmander condition. Under mild
smoothness assumptions we prove the uniqueness of the martingale problem for
the associated generator under some dimension constraints. Also, when the
driving noise is scalar and tempered, we establish density bounds reflecting
the multi-scale behavior of the process.
