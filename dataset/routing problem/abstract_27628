The purpose of this paper is to study the indefinite Kirchhoff type problem:
\begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} M\left(
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}(|\nabla u|^{2}+u^{2})dx\right) \left[ -\Delta u+u\right]
=f(x,u) & \text{in }\mathbb{R}^{N}, \\ 0\leq u\in H^{1}\left(
\mathbb{R}^{N}\right), & \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $N\geq 1$,
$M(t)=am\left( t\right) +b$, $m\in C(\mathbb{R}^{+})$ and $
f(x,u)=g(x,u)+h(x)u^{q-1}$. We require that $f$ is \textquotedblleft
local\textquotedblright\ sublinear at the origin and \textquotedblleft
local\textquotedblright\ linear at infinite. Using the mountain pass theorem
and Ekeland variational principle, the existence and multiplicity of nontrivial
solutions are obtained. In particular, the criterion of existence of three
nontrivial solutions is established.
