For a large class of vanilla contingent claims, we establish an explicit
F\"ollmer-Schweizer decomposition when the underlying is an exponential of an
additive process. This allows to provide an efficient algorithm for solving the
mean variance hedging problem. Applications to models derived from the
electricity market are performed.
