In this paper we consider distributed allocation problems with memory
constraint limits. Firstly, we propose a tractable relaxation to the problem of
optimal symmetric allocations from [1]. The approximated problem is based on
the Q-error function, and its solution approaches the solution of the initial
problem, as the number of storage nodes in the network grows. Secondly,
exploiting this relaxation, we are able to formulate and to solve the problem
for storage allocations for memory-limited DSS storing and arbitrary memory
profiles. Finally, we discuss the extension to the case of multiple data
objects, stored in the DSS.
