In a recent arXiv preprint we proposed a statistical approach to the quantal
effects in nucleation rate, addressed particularly to solid state physics. We
now turn to transient nucleation rates incorporating either classical or
quantal statistics. A similar method may be applied to tackle nucleation
problems in anyon systems in 2D solids.
