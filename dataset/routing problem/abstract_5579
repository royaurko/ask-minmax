The problem of recovering geometric properties of a domain from the trace of
the heat kernel for an initial-boundary value problem arises in NMR microscopy
and other applications. It is similar to the problem of ``hearing the shape of
a drum'', for which a Poisson type summation formula relates geometric
properties of the domain to the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet or Neumann problem
for the Laplace equation. It is well known that the area, circumference, and
the number of holes in a planar domain can be recovered from the short time
asymptotics of the solution of the initial-boundary value problem for the heat
equation. It is also known that the length spectrum of closed billiard ball
trajectories in the domain can be recovered from the eigenvalues or from the
solution of the wave equation. This spectrum can also be recovered from the
heat kernel for a compact manifold without boundary. We show that for a planar
domain with boundary, the length spectrum can be recovered directly from the
short time expansion of the trace of the heat kernel. The results can be
extended to higher dimensions in a straightforward manner.
