We consider the operation to crush a subset of a manifold to one-point when
the result of the crushing also be a manifold. Then the Poincare conjecture is
split to two problems; for any closed orientable 3-manifold which is not
homeomorphic to the sphere, one is that this operation preserve
simply-connectedness, and another one is that we can get a non-simply connected
space by applying the operation. We show these propositions in this paper.
