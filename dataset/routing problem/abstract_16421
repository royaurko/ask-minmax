We present a modification of the BC-method in the inverse hyperbolic
problems. The main novelty is the study of the restrictions of the solutions to
the characteristic surfaces instead of the fixed time hyperplanes. The main
result is that the time-dependent Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator prescribed on a
part of the boundary uniquely determines the coefficients of the self-adjoint
hyperbolic operator up to a diffeomorphism and a gauge transformation. In this
paper we prove the crucial local step. The global step of the proof will be
presented in the forthcoming paper.
