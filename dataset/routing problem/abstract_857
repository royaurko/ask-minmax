Transport critical current densities and n-values were measured at 4.2 K in
fields up to 15 T on 7, 19, and 37-stack multifilamentary MgB2 strands made
using an in-situ route. Some strands included SiC additions (particle size 30
nm), while in others Mg-rich compositions were used. Two basic multifilamentary
variants were measured, the first had Nb filamentary barriers, the second had
Fe filamentary barriers. All samples incorporated stabilizer in the form of Cu
101. Simple, one-step heat treatments were used, with temperatures ranging from
700-800C, and times from 10-30 minutes. Transport critical current densities of
1.75 x 105 A/cm2 were seen at 4.2 K and 5 T in 37 stack strands.
