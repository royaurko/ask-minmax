A path in an edge colored graph is said to be a rainbow path if no two edges
on the path have the same color. An edge colored graph is (strongly) rainbow
connected if there exists a (geodesic) rainbow path between every pair of
vertices. The (strong) rainbow connectivity of a graph G, denoted by (src(G),
respectively) rc(G) is the smallest number of colors required to edge color the
graph such that G is (strongly) rainbow connected. In this paper we study the
rainbow connectivity problem and the strong rainbow connectivity problem from a
computational point of view. Our main results can be summarised as below:
  1) For every fixed k >= 3, it is NP-Complete to decide whether src(G) <= k
even when the graph G is bipartite.
  2) For every fixed odd k >= 3, it is NP-Complete to decide whether rc(G) <=
k. This resolves one of the open problems posed by Chakraborty et al. (J. Comb.
Opt., 2011) where they prove the hardness for the even case.
  3) The following problem is fixed parameter tractable: Given a graph G,
determine the maximum number of pairs of vertices that can be rainbow connected
using two colors.
  4) For a directed graph G, it is NP-Complete to decide whether rc(G) <= 2.
