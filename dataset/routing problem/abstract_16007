An efficient Bayesian inference method for problems that can be mapped onto
dense graphs is presented. The approach is based on message passing where
messages are averaged over a large number of replicated variable systems
exposed to the same evidential nodes. An assumption about the symmetry of the
solutions is required for carrying out the averages; here we extend the
previous derivation based on a replica symmetric (RS) like structure to include
a more complex one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB)-like ansatz. To
demonstrate the potential of the approach it is employed for studying critical
properties of the Ising linear perceptron and for multiuser detection in Code
Division Multiple Access (CDMA) under different noise models. Results obtained
under the RS assumption in the non-critical regime give rise to a highly
efficient signal detection algorithm in the context of CDMA; while in the
critical regime one observes a first order transition line that ends in a
continuous phase transition point. Finite size effects are also observed. While
the 1RSB ansatz is not required for the original problems, it was applied to
the CDMA signal detection problem with a more complex noise model that exhibits
RSB behaviour, resulting in an improvement in performance.
