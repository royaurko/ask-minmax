In a Symbiotic Cognitive Relaying (SCR) scenario, the Secondary users(SU)
nodes can act as multihop relays to assist the communication between Primary
User(PU) nodes in the case of a weak direct link. In return, the SU nodes are
incentivised with the right to carry out SU-SU communication using licensed PU
band for a fixed amount of time, referred to as the 'Time Incentive'. Existing
work on SCR is constrained to a fixed ad-hoc SU network. In this paper, we
introduce mobility in SCR by considering mobile SU nodes while keeping the PU
nodes fixed. This paper uses a specific mobility pattern and routing strategy
for the SU nodes to propose theoretical bounds on the throughput and delay of
PU-PU transmission. We derive analytically the least throughput and maximum
delay possible in our model.
