We consider the problem of finding a stopping time that minimises the
$L^1$-distance to $\theta$, the time at which a L\'evy process attains its
ultimate supremum. This problem was studied in [12] for a Brownian motion with
drift and a finite time horizon. We consider a general L\'evy process and an
infinite time horizon (only compound Poisson processes are excluded,
furthermore due to the infinite horizon the problem is only interesting when
the L\'evy process drifts to $-\infty$). Existing results allow us to rewrite
the problem as a classic optimal stopping problem, i.e. with an adapted payoff
process. We show the following. If $\theta$ has infinite mean there exists no
stopping time with a finite $L^1$-distance to $\theta$, whereas if $\theta$ has
finite mean it is either optimal to stop immediately or to stop when the
process reflected in its supremum exceeds a positive level, depending on
whether the median of the law of the ultimate supremum equals zero or is
positive. Furthermore, pasting properties are derived. Finally, the result is
made more explicit in terms of scale functions in the case when the L\'evy
process has no positive jumps.
