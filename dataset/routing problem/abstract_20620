Over last decades, the study of laser fluctuations has shown that laser
theory may be regarded as a prototypical example of a nonlinear nonequilibrium
problem. The present paper discusses the fluctuation relations, recently
derived in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, in the context of the
semiclassical laser theory.
