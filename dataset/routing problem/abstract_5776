We give subquadratic algorithms that, given two necklaces each with n beads
at arbitrary positions, compute the optimal rotation of the necklaces to best
align the beads. Here alignment is measured according to the p norm of the
vector of distances between pairs of beads from opposite necklaces in the best
perfect matching. We show surprisingly different results for p = 1, p even, and
p = \infty. For p even, we reduce the problem to standard convolution, while
for p = \infty and p = 1, we reduce the problem to (min, +) convolution and
(median, +) convolution. Then we solve the latter two convolution problems in
subquadratic time, which are interesting results in their own right. These
results shed some light on the classic sorting X + Y problem, because the
convolutions can be viewed as computing order statistics on the antidiagonals
of the X + Y matrix. All of our algorithms run in o(n^2) time, whereas the
obvious algorithms for these problems run in \Theta(n^2) time.
