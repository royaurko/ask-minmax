We apply a replica inference based Potts model method to unsupervised image
segmentation on multiple scales. This approach was inspired by the statistical
mechanics problem of "community detection" and its phase diagram. Specifically,
the problem is cast as identifying tightly bound clusters ("communities" or
"solutes") against a background or "solvent". Within our multiresolution
approach, we compute information theory based correlations among multiple
solutions ("replicas") of the same graph over a range of resolutions.
Significant multiresolution structures are identified by replica correlations
as manifest in information theory overlaps. With the aid of these correlations
as well as thermodynamic measures, the phase diagram of the corresponding Potts
model is analyzed both at zero and finite temperatures. Optimal parameters
corresponding to a sensible unsupervised segmentation correspond to the "easy
phase" of the Potts model. Our algorithm is fast and shown to be at least as
accurate as the best algorithms to date and to be especially suited to the
detection of camouflaged images.
