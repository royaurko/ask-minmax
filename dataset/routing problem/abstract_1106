We propose a route for the evaluation of risk based on a transformation of
the covariance matrix. The approach uses a `potential' or `objective' function.
This allows us to rescale data from different assets (or sources) such that
each data set then has similar statistical properties in terms of their
probability distributions. The method is tested using historical data from both
the New York and Warsaw Stock Exchanges.
