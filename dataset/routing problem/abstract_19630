The transport equation for transverse vibrations of magnetization in spin
polarized Fermi liquid is derived from integral equation for the vertex
function. The dispersion law for the transverse spin waves is established. The
existance of zero-temperature spin-waves attenuation is confirmed. The problem
of similar derivation in ferromagnetic "Fermi liquid" is discussed.
