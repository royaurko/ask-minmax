Given $k$ collections of 2SAT clauses on the same set of variables $V$, can
we find one assignment that satisfies a large fraction of clauses from each
collection? We consider such simultaneous constraint satisfaction problems, and
design the first nontrivial approximation algorithms in this context.
  Our main result is that for every CSP $F$, for $k < \tilde{O}(\log^{1/4} n)$,
there is a polynomial time constant factor Pareto approximation algorithm for
$k$ simultaneous Max-$F$-CSP instances. Our methods are quite general, and we
also use them to give an improved approximation factor for simultaneous
Max-w-SAT (for $k <\tilde{O}(\log^{1/3} n)$). In contrast, for $k = \omega(\log
n)$, no nonzero approximation factor for $k$ simultaneous Max-$F$-CSP instances
can be achieved in polynomial time (assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis).
  These problems are a natural meeting point for the theory of constraint
satisfaction problems and multiobjective optimization. We also suggest a number
of interesting directions for future research.
