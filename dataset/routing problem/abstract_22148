We apply a recently proposed method for the acceleration of model predictive
control (MPC) to 36 MPC implementations, which result from combining six sample
receding horizon control problems with six quadratic programming solvers. We
implement each of the 36 system-solver-combinations both with and without
constraint removal and compare computational times for statistically relevant
numbers of runs.
