This paper studies the economic utilities and the quality of service (QoS) in
a two-sided non-neutral market where Internet service providers (ISPs) charge
content providers (CPs) for the content delivery. We propose new models on a
two-sided market which involves a CP, an ISP, end users and advertisers. The CP
may have either the subscription revenue model (charging end users) or the
advertisement revenue model (charging advertisers). We formulate the
interactions between the ISP and the CP as a noncooperative game problem for
the former and an optimization problem for the latter. Our analysis shows that
the revenue model of the CP plays a significant role in a non-neutral Internet.
With the subscription model, both the ISP and the CP receive better (or worse)
utilities as well as QoS in the presence of side payment at the same time.
However, with the advertisement model, the side payment impedes the CP from
investing on its contents.
