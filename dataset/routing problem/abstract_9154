Inverse problem to recover the skew-self-adjoint Dirac-type system from the
generalized Weyl matrix function is treated in the paper. Sufficient conditions
under which the unique solution of the inverse problem exists, are formulated
in terms of the Weyl function and a procedure to solve the inverse problem is
given. The case of the generalized Weyl functions of the form
$\phi(\lambda)\exp\{-2i\lambda D\}$, where $\phi$ is a strictly proper rational
matrix function and $D=D^* \geq 0$ is a diagonal matrix, is treated in greater
detail. Explicit formulas for the inversion of the corresponding semiseparable
integral operators and recovery of the Dirac-type system are obtained for this
case.
