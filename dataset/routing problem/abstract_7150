There is much recent interest in excluded subposets. Given a fixed poset $P$,
how many subsets of $[n]$ can found without a copy of $P$ realized by the
subset relation? The hardest and most intensely investigated problem of this
kind is when $P$ is a diamond, i.e. the power set of a 2 element set. In this
paper, we show infinitely many asymptotically tight constructions using random
set families defined from posets based on Abelian groups. They are provided by
the convergence of Markov chains on groups. Such constructions suggest that the
diamond problem is hard.
