It is in general unknown which topological complex vector bundles on a
non-algebraic surface admit holomorphic structures. We solve this problem for
primary Kodaira surfaces by using results of Kani on curves of genus two with
elliptic differentials. Some of the corresponding moduli spaces will be smooth
compact and holomorphically symplectic.
