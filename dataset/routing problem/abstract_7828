We study the solution of the d-bar-Neumann problem on (0,1)-forms on the
product of two half-planes in C^2. In, particular, we show the solution can be
decomposed into functions smooth up to the boundary and functions which are
singular at the singular points of the boundary. Furthermore, we show the
singular functions are log and arctan terms.
