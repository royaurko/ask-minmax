We give necessary and sufficient conditions on a squarefree integer $d$ for
there to be non-trivial solutions to $x^{3} + y^{3} = z^{3}$ in $\Q(\sqrt{d})$,
conditional on the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. These conditions are
similar to those obtained by J. Tunnell in his solution to the congruent number
problem.
