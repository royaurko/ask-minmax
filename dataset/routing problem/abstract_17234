The arguments supporting the existence of the intrinsic magnetism in
carbon-based materials including pure graphene were analyzed critically
together with the numerous experimental evidences denying the magnetism in
these materials. The crucial experiment of Sepioni et al (Phys.Rev.Lett., v.105
p.207205 (2010)) showed clearly that no ferromagnetism was detected in pure
graphene at any temperature down to 2 K. Neither do they found strong
paramagnetism expected due to the massive amount of edge defects. Rather,
graphene is strongly diamagnetic, similar to graphite. Thus the possible traces
of a quasi-magnetic behavior which some contributors observed in their samples may
be attributed rather to induced magnetism due to the impurities, defects, etc.
On the basis of the present analysis the conclusion was made that the thorough
and detailed experimental studies of these problems only may shed light on the
very complicated problem of the magnetism of carbon-based materials.
