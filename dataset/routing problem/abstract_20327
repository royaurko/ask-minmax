It is proved that the action for nonlinear Beltrami equation (quasiclassical
dbar-problem) evaluated on its solution gives a tau-function for dispersionless
KP hierarchy. Infinitesimal transformations of tau-function corresponding to
variations of dbar-data are found. Determinant equations for the function
generating these transformations are derived. They represent a dispersionless
analogue of singular manifold (Schwarzian) KP equations. Dispersionless 2DTL
hierarchy is also considered.
