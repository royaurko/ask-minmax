We construct a real space renormalization group (RG) approach for Ising spin
glasses on hypercubic lattices within the scheme of the Migdal-Kadanoff
approximation using replicas. Our replica symmetric solution yields results
consistent with simple decimation previously obtained and the introduction of
breaking of replica symmetry within the RG is discussed, which inserts in a
natural fashion non-linear RG into the problem.
