We present an experiment studying the interaction of a strongly focused 25 fs
laser pulse with a tungsten nanotip, investigating the different regimes of
laser-induced electron emission. We study the dependence of the electron yield
with respect to the static electric field applied to the tip. Photoelectron
spectra are recorded using a retarding field spectrometer and peaks separated
by the photon energy are observed with a 45 % contrast. They are a clear
signature of above threshold photoemission (ATP), and are confirmed by
extensive spectrally resolved studies of the laser power dependence.
Understanding these mechanisms opens the route to control experiment in the
strong-field regime on nanoscale objects.
