The hypothesis that radiation of Sgr A* is caused by accretion onto a
supermassive compact object without the events horizon is studied. The main
equations of the accretion and a relativistic equation of the trasfer radiation
are obtained. The synchrotron spectrum in the vicinity of the maximum is
considered.
