Reinforcement learning would enjoy better success on real-world problems if
domain knowledge could be imparted to the algorithm by the modelers. Most
problems have both hidden state and unknown dynamics. Partially observable
Markov decision processes (POMDPs) allow for the modeling of both.
Unfortunately, they do not provide a natural framework in which to specify
knowledge about the domain dynamics. The designer must either admit to knowing
nothing about the dynamics or completely specify the dynamics (thereby turning
it into a planning problem). We propose a new framework called a partially
known Markov decision process (PKMDP) which allows the designer to specify
known dynamics while still leaving portions of the environment s dynamics
unknown.The model represents NOT ONLY the environment dynamics but also the
agents knowledge of the dynamics. We present a reinforcement learning algorithm
for this model based on importance sampling. The algorithm incorporates
planning based on the known dynamics and learning about the unknown dynamics.
Our results clearly demonstrate the ability to add domain knowledge and the
resulting benefits for learning.
