We investigate the problem asking whether the intersection of a context-free
language (CFL) and a Petri net language (PNL) is empty. Our contribution to
solve this long-standing problem which relates, for instance, to the
reachability analysis of recursive programs over unbounded data domain, is to
identify a class of CFLs called the finite-index CFLs for which the problem is
decidable. The k-index approximation of a CFL can be obtained by discarding all
the words that cannot be derived within a budget k on the number of occurrences
of non-terminals. A finite-index CFL is thus a CFL which coincides with its
k-index approximation for some k. We decide whether the intersection of a
finite-index CFL and a PNL is empty by reducing it to the reachability problem
of Petri nets with weak inhibitor arcs, a class of systems with infinitely many
states for which reachability is known to be decidable. Conversely, we show
that the reachability problem for a Petri net with weak inhibitor arcs reduces
to the emptiness problem of a finite-index CFL intersected with a PNL.
