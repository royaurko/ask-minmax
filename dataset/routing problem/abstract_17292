We define the Landau problem on two-dimensional surfaces of revolution of the
second order: ellipsoid, hyperboloid and paraboloid. We start form the
two-center MICZ-Kepler system Hamiltonian and then making the reduction into
the various two-dimensional surfaces listed above we obtain the Hamiltonians of
the charged particle moving on the corresponding surface of revolution with the
magnetic filed conserving the symmetry of the two-dimensional surface(Landau
problem). For each case we figure out at which values of parameters the
qualitative character of the moving coincides with that of a free particle
moving on the save two-dimensional surface. For the case of finite trajectories
(ellipsoid) we construct also the action-angle variables.
