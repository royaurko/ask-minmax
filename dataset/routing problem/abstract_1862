In recent years, the wireless sensor network (WSN) is playing a key role in
sensing, collecting and disseminating information in various applications. An
important feature associated with WSN is to develop an efficient data
distribution and routing scheme to ensure better quality of service (QoS) that
reduces the power consumption and the end-to-end data delivery time. In this
work, we propose an adaptive framework to transmit data packets from a source
to the sink in WSN across multiples paths with strategically distributed data
packets so as to minimize the power consumption as well as the end-to-end data
delivery time.
