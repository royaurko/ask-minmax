This paper addresses the problem of Monte Carlo approximation of posterior
probability distributions. In particular, we have considered a recently
proposed technique known as population Monte Carlo (PMC), which is based on an
iterative importance sampling approach. An important drawback of this
methodology is the degeneracy of the importance weights when the dimension of
either the observations or the variables of interest is high. To alleviate this
difficulty, we propose a novel method that performs a nonlinear transformation
on the importance weights. This operation reduces the weight variation, hence
it avoids their degeneracy and increases the efficiency of the importance
sampling scheme, specially when drawing from a proposal functions which are
poorly adapted to the true posterior.
  For the sake of illustration, we have applied the proposed algorithm to the
estimation of the parameters of a Gaussian mixture model. This is a very simple
problem that enables us to clearly show and discuss the main features of the
proposed technique. As a practical application, we have also considered the
popular (and challenging) problem of estimating the rate parameters of
stochastic kinetic models (SKM). SKMs are highly multivariate systems that
model molecular interactions in biological and chemical problems. We introduce
a particularization of the proposed algorithm to SKMs and present numerical
results.
