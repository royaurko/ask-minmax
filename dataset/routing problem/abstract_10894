Determinations of the main cosmological parameters are reviewed and the
implications for cold dark matter discussed. There is no longer an age problem
for an $\Omega_o = 1, \Lambda = 0$ model and, if anything, there is now an age
problem for low $\Omega_o, \Lambda > 0$ models. Large scale structure and CMB
fluctuation data are best fitted by a mixed dark matter $\Omega_o$ = 1
universe. Difficulties for this model with cluster evolution, the baryon
content of clusters, high z Lyman $\alpha$ galaxies, and the evidence from Type
Ia supernovae favouring low $\Omega_o, \Lambda > 0$ models, are discussed
critically.
