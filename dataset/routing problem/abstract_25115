In this paper, we tackle the problem of opportunistic spectrum access in
large-scale cognitive radio networks, where the unlicensed Secondary Users (SU)
access the frequency channels partially occupied by the licensed Primary Users
(PU). Each channel is characterized by an availability probability unknown to
the SUs. We apply evolutionary game theory to model the spectrum access problem
and develop distributed spectrum access policies based on imitation, a behavior
rule widely applied in human societies consisting of imitating successful
behavior. We first develop two imitation-based spectrum access policies based
on the basic Proportional Imitation (PI) rule and the more advanced Double
Imitation (DI) rule given that a SU can imitate any other SUs. We then adapt
the proposed policies to a more practical scenario where a SU can only imitate
the other SUs operating on the same channel. A systematic theoretical analysis
is presented for both scenarios on the induced imitation dynamics and the
convergence properties of the proposed policies to an imitation-stable
equilibrium, which is also the $\epsilon$-optimum of the system. Simple,
natural and incentive-compatible, the proposed imitation-based spectrum access
policies can be implemented distributedly based on solely local interactions
and thus is especially suited in decentralized adaptive learning environments
as cognitive radio networks.
