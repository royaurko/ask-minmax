Recent experimental efforts towards the detection of Majorana bound states
have focused on creating the conditions for topological superconductivity. Here
we demonstrate an alternative route, which achieves fully localised zero-energy
Majorana bound states when a topologically trivial superconductor is strongly
coupled to a helical metal. Majorana states emerge after crossing an
`exceptional point' in parameter space, defined as a degeneracy in the complex
eigenvalues of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian of the
normal-superconductor junction. We show that the lifetime of exceptional-point
Majoranas can be tuned to arbitrarily large values as the junction approaches
perfect Andreev reflection. We also show that their Majorana character, derived
from the eigenvalue bifurcation at the exceptional point, is protected by
particle-hole symmetry and is not a result of fine tuning. Consequently,
exceptional-point Majoranas exhibit the full range of properties associated to
conventional closed-system Majorana bound states (zero-energy,
self-conjugation, $4\pi$-periodic braiding...), while not requiring topological
superconductivity.
