Nonparametric regression for massive numbers of samples (n) and features (p)
is an increasingly important problem. In big n settings, a common strategy is
to partition the feature space, and then separately apply simple models to each
partition set. We propose an alternative approach, which avoids such
partitioning and the associated sensitivity to neighborhood choice and distance
metrics, by using random compression combined with Gaussian process regression.
The proposed approach is particularly motivated by the setting in which the
response is conditionally independent of the features given the projection to a
low dimensional manifold. Conditionally on the random compression matrix and a
smoothness parameter, the posterior distribution for the regression surface and
posterior predictive distributions are available analytically. Running the
analysis in parallel for many random compression matrices and smoothness
parameters, model averaging is used to combine the results. The algorithm can
be implemented rapidly even in very big n and p problems, has strong
theoretical justification, and is found to yield state of the art predictive
performance.
