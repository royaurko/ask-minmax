Here the All-pairs shortest path problem on weighted undirected sparse graphs
is being considered. For the problem considered, we propose ``disassembly and
assembly of a graph'' algorithm which uses a solution of the problem on a
small-dimensional graph to obtain the solution for the given graph. The
proposed algorithm has been compared to one of the fastest classic algorithms
on data from an open public source.
