To study large-scale effects on the Internet various mod- els have been
introduced to generate Internet-like autono- mous system (AS) topologies. The
models for large-scale AS topologies have been focused on replicating
structural graph properties. One of the most promising model is the Positive
Feedback Model model (PFP). These models how- ever lack the ability to generate
routing path and realistic latency. We present a model to enrich the AS peering
graph with peering points. Our new model allows to calculate path for the
connections between end hosts and to infer the latency from these paths. We
introduce a new notion for the genera- tion of AS topologies: the compactness
of an AS. We introduce an algorithm based on the PFP algorithm which generates
instances for our model. Verifying the gen- erated model instances shows that
the resulting latencies as well as the geographic properties match measured
data sets.
