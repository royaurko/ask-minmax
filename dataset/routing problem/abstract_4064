For the 5-components Maxwell-Bloch system the stability problem for the
isolated equilibria is completely solved. Using the geometry of the symplectic
leaves, a detailed construction of the homoclinic orbits is given. Studying the
problem of invariant sets for the system we discover a rich family of periodic
solutions in explicit form.
