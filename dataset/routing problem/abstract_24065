We point out a loophole problem in some recent experimental claims to produce
three-particle entanglement. The problem consists in the question whether
mixtures of two-particle entangled states might suffice to explain the
experimental data.
  In an attempt to close this loophole, we review two sufficient conditions
that distinguish between N-particle states in which all N particles are
entangled to each other and states in which only M particles are entangled
(with M<N). It is shown that three recent experiments to obtain three-particle
entangled states (Bouwmeester et al., Pan et al., and Rauschenbeutel et al.) do
not meet these conditions. We conclude that the question whether these
experiments provide confirmation of three-particle entanglement remains
unresolved. We also propose modifications of the experiments that would make
such confirmation feasible.
