We present a technique for reducing the order of polynomial-like iterative
equations; in particular, we answer a question asked by Wenmeng Zhang and
Weinian Zhang. Our method involves the asymptotic behaviour of the sequence of
consecutive iterates of the unknown function at a given point. As an
application we solve a problem of Zolt\'an Boros posed during the 50th ISFE
(2012).
