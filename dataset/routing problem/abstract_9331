We give computational results to study the accuracy of several quasicontinuum
methods for two benchmark problems - the stability of a Lomer dislocation pair
under shear and the stability of a lattice to plastic slip under tensile
loading. We find that our theoretical analysis of the accuracy near
instabilities for one-dimensional model problems can successfully explain most
of the computational results for these multi-dimensional benchmark problems.
However, we also observe some clear discrepancies, which suggest the need for
additional theoretical analysis and benchmark problems to more thoroughly
understand the accuracy of quasicontinuum methods.
