A path integral approach has been generalized for the non-relativistic
electron charge transfer processes. The charge transfer - the capture of an
electron by an ion passing another atom or more generally the problem of
rearrangement collisions is formulated in terms of influence functionals. It
has been shown that the electron charge transfer process can be treated either
as electron transition problem or as elastic scattering of ion and atom in the
some effective potential field. The first-order Born approximation for the
electron charge transfer cross section has been reproduced to prove the
adequacy of the path integral approach for this problem.
