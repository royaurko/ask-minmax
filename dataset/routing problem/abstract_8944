Logics for knowledge representation suffer from over-specialization: while
each logic may provide an ideal representation formalism for some problems, it
is less than optimal for others. A solution to this problem is to choose from
several logics and, when necessary, combine the representations. In general,
such an approach results in a very difficult problem of combination. However,
if we can choose the logics from a uniform framework then the problem of
combining them is greatly simplified. In this paper, we develop such a
framework for defeasible logics. It supports all defeasible logics that satisfy
a strong negation principle. We use logic meta-programs as the basis for the
framework.
