The L1-regularized Gaussian maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) has been shown
to have strong statistical guarantees in recovering a sparse inverse covariance
matrix, or alternatively the underlying graph structure of a Gaussian Markov
Random Field, from very limited samples. We propose a novel algorithm for
solving the resulting optimization problem which is a regularized
log-determinant program. In contrast to recent state-of-the-art methods that
largely use first order gradient information, our algorithm is based on
Newton's method and employs a quadratic approximation, but with some
modifications that leverage the structure of the sparse Gaussian MLE problem.
We show that our method is superlinearly convergent, and present experimental
results using synthetic and real-world application data that demonstrate the
considerable improvements in performance of our method when compared to other
state-of-the-art methods.
