We show that the Polonyi problem is solved in the minimum SUSY-GUT model in
which a self-coupling strength for a heavy Higgs $\Sigma$, $\lambda\Sigma^{3}$,
is very small $\lambda\sim 10^{-6}$. It is stressed that with this small
$\lambda$ the mass of the physical $\Sigma$ becomes $m_{\Sigma} \sim
10^{12}\GEV$ and the unification scale is raised up to the gravitational one,
$M\simeq 2\times 10^{18}\GEV$. A potential problem, however, is also pointed
out in this GUT model.
