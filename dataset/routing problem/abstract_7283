In this paper we study the nonlinear elliptic problem involving
p(x)-Laplacian with nonsmooth potential, where the weighted function may change
sign. By using critical point theory for locally Lipschitz functionals due to
Chang, we obtain conditions which ensure the existence of a solution for our
problem.
