Hybrid-NLIE equations, an alternative finite NLIE description for the
spectral problem of the super sigma model of AdS/CFT and its gamma-deformations
are derived by replacing the semi-infinite SU(2) and SU(4) parts of the AdS/CFT
TBA equations by a few appropriately chosen complex NLIE variables, which are
coupled among themselves and to the Y-functions associated to the remaining
central nodes of the TBA diagram. The integral equations are written explicitly
for the ground state of the gamma-deformed system. We linearize these NLIE
equations, analytically calculate the first correction to the asymptotic
solution and find agreement with analogous results coming from the original TBA
formalism. Our equations differ substantially from the recently published
finite FiNLIE formulation of the spectral problem.
