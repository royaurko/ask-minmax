Symplectic structures associated to connection forms on certain types of
principal fiber bundles are constructed via analysis of reduced geometric
structures on fibered manifolds invariant under naturally related symmetry
groups. This approach is then applied to nonstandard Hamiltonian analysis of of
dynamical systems of Maxwell and Yang-Mills type. A symplectic reduction theory
of the classical Maxwell equations is formulated so as to naturally include the
Lorentz condition (ensuring the existence of electromagnetic waves), thereby
solving the well known Dirac -Fock - Podolsky problem. Symplectically reduced
Poissonian structures and the related classical minimal interaction principle
for the Yang-Mills equations are also considered. 1.
