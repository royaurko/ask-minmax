Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consist of large number of randomly deployed
energy constrained sensor nodes. Sensor nodes have ability to sense and send
sensed data to Base Station (BS). Sensing as well as transmitting data towards
BS require high energy. In WSNs, saving energy and extending network lifetime
are great challenges. Clustering is a key technique used to optimize energy
consumption in WSNs. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering based routing
technique: Enhanced Developed Distributed Energy Efficient Clustering scheme
(EDDEEC) for heterogeneous WSNs. Our technique is based on changing dynamically
and with more efficiency the Cluster Head (CH) election probability. Simulation
results show that our proposed protocol achieves longer lifetime, stability
period and more effective messages to BS than Distributed Energy Efficient
Clustering (DEEC), Developed DEEC (DDEEC) and Enhanced DEEC (EDEEC) in
heterogeneous environments.
