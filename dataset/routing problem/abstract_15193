The Schr\"odinger eigenvalue problem is solved with the imaginary time
propagation technique. The separability of the Hamiltonian makes the problem
suitable for the application of splitting methods. High order fractional time
steps of order greater than two necessarily have negative steps and can not be
used for this class of diffusive problems. However, there exist methods which
use fractional complex time steps with positive real parts which can be used
with only a moderate increase in the computational cost. We analyze the
performance of this class of schemes and propose new methods which outperform
the existing ones in most cases. On the other hand, if the gradient of the
potential is available, methods up to fourth order with real and positive
coefficients exist. We also explore this case and propose new methods as well
as sixth-order methods with complex coefficients. In particular, highly
optimized sixth-order schemes for near integrable systems using positive real
part complex coefficients with and without modified potentials are presented. A
time-stepping variable order algorithm is proposed and numerical results show
the enhanced efficiency of the new methods.
