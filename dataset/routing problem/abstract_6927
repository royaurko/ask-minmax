In this paper we homogenise monotone parabolic problems with two spatial
scales and finitely many temporal scales. Under a certain well-separatedness
assumption on the spatial and temporal scales as explained in the paper, we
show that there is an H-limit defined by at most four distinct sets of local
problems corresponding to slow temporal oscillations, slow resonant spatial and
temporal oscillations (the "slow" self-similar case), rapid temporal
oscillations, and rapid resonant spatial and temporal oscillations (the "rapid"
self-similar case), respectively.
