We investigate the problem of a principal looking to contract an expert to
provide a probability forecast for a categorical event. We assume all experts
have a common public prior on the event's probability, but can form more
accurate opinions by engaging in research. Various experts' research costs are
unknown to the principal. We present a truthful and efficient mechanism for the
principal's problem of contracting an expert. This results in the principal
contracting the best expert to do the work, and the principal's expected
utility is equivalent to having the second best expert in-house. Our mechanism
connects scoring rules with auctions, a connection that is useful when
obtaining new information requires costly research.
