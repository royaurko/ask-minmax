We address lower bounds on the time complexity of algorithms solving the
propositional satisfiability problem. Namely, we consider two DPLL-type
algorithms, enhanced with the unit clause and pure literal heuristics.
Exponential lower bounds for solving satisfiability on provably satisfiable
formulas are proven.
