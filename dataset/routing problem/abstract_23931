Hermitian symplectic spaces provide a natural framework for the extension
theory of symmetric operators. Here we show that hermitian symplectic spaces
may also be used to describe the solution to the factorisation problem for the
scattering matrix on a graph, ie. we derive a formula for the scattering matrix
of a graph in terms of the scattering matrices of its subgraphs. The solution
of this problem is shown to be given by the intersection of a Lagrange plane
and a coisotropic subspace which, in an appropriate hermitian symplectic space,
forms a new Lagrange plane. The scattering matrix is given by a distinguished
basis to the Lagrange plane.
  Using our construction we are also able to give a simple proof of the
unitarity of the scattering matrix as well as provide a characterisation of the
discrete eigenvalues embedded in the continuous spectrum.
