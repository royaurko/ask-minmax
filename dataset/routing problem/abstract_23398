We consider the problem of trying to understand the recently measured
neutrino data simultaneously with understanding the heirarchical form of quark
and charged lepton Yukawa matrices. We summarise the data that a sucessful
model of neutrino mass must predict, and then move on to attempting to do so in
the context of spontaneously broken `family' symmetries. We consider first an
abelian U(1) family symmetry, which appears in the context of a type I string
model. Then we consider a model based on a non-abelian SU(3)_F, which is the
maximal family group consitent with an SO(10) GUT. In this case the symmetry is
more constraining, and is examined in the context of SUSY field theory.
