Consider a network linking the points of a rate-$1$ Poisson point process on
the plane. Write $\Psi^{\mbox{ave}}(s)$ for the minimum possible mean length
per unit area of such a network, subject to the constraint that the
route-length between every pair of points is at most $s$ times the Euclidean
distance. We give upper and lower bounds on the function
$\Psi^{\mbox{ave}}(s)$, and on the analogous "worst-case" function
$\Psi^{\mbox{worst}}(s)$ where the point configuration is arbitrary subject to
average density one per unit area. Our bounds are numerically crude, but raise
the question of whether there is an exponent $\alpha$ such that each function
has $\Psi(s) \asymp (s-1)^{-\alpha}$ as $s \downarrow 1$.
