We apply Bogoliubov compensation principle to the problem of forward-backward
asymmetry in $t \bar t$ production at TEVATRON. The non-trivial solution of
compensation equation for anomalous four-fermion interaction effective
interaction of doublets of heavy and light quarks leads to possibility of
existence of $\bar t u,\, \bar b d$ vector bound states (resonance). The
coupling of the bound state to $\bar t,\,u$ pair is calculated. With this
result we obtain satisfactory description of totality of data on the effect of
FB asymmetry including slope of effect dependence on invariant $t \bar t$ mass.
Predictions for the resonance mass and production cross-section at LHC are
presented.
