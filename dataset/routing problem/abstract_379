We are investigating numerically the non-linear behavior of a space-periodic
MHD system with ABC forcing. Most computations are performed for magnetic
Reynolds numbers increasing from 0 to 60 and a fixed kinematic Reynolds number,
small enough for the trivial solution with a zero magnetic field to be stable
to velocity perturbations. At the critical magnetic Reynolds number for the
onset of instability of the trivial solution the dominant eigenvalue of the
kinematic dynamo problem is real. In agreement with the bifurcation theory new
steady states with non-vanishing magnetic field appear in this bifurcation.
Subsequent bifurcations are investigated. A regime is detected, where chaotic
variations of the magnetic field orientation (analogous to magnetic field
reversals) are observed in the temporal evolution of the system.
