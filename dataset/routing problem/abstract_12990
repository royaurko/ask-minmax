Crystal surfaces may undergo thermodynamical as well kinetic,
out-of-equilibrium instabilities. We consider the case of mound and pyramid
formation, a common phenomenon in crystal growth and a long-standing problem in
the field of pattern formation and coarsening dynamics. We are finally able to
attack the problem analytically and get rigorous results. Three dynamical
scenarios are possible: perpetual coarsening, interrupted coarsening, and no
coarsening. In the perpetual coarsening scenario, mound size increases in time
as L=t^n, where the coasening exponent is n=1/3 when faceting occurs, otherwise
n=1/4.
