We present a unified treatment of the slicing (3+1) and threading (1+3)
decompositions of spacetime in terms of foliations. It is well-known how to
decompose the metric and connection in the slicing picture; this is at the
heart of any initial-value problem in general relativity. We describe here the
analogous problem in the threading picture, recovering the recent results of
Perjes on parametric manifolds.
