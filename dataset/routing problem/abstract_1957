We investigate the origin of various convective patterns using bifurcation
diagrams that are constructed using direct numerical simulations. We perform
two-dimensional pseudospectral simulations for a Prandtl number 6.8 fluid that
is confined in a box with aspect ratio $\Gamma = 2\sqrt{2}$. Steady convective
rolls are born from the conduction state through a pitchfork bifurcation at
$r=1$, where $r$ is the reduced Rayleigh number. These fixed points bifurcate
successively to time-periodic and quasiperiodic rolls through Hopf and
Neimark-Sacker bifurcations at $r \simeq 80$ and $r \simeq 500 $ respectively.
The system becomes chaotic at $r \simeq 750$ through a quasiperiodic route to
chaos. The size of the chaotic attractor increases at $r \simeq 840$ through an
"attractor-merging crisis" which also results in travelling chaotic rolls. We
also observe coexistence of stable fixed points and a chaotic attractor for $
846 \le r \le 849$ as a result of a subcritical Hopf bifurcation. Subsequently
the chaotic attractor disappears through a "boundary crisis" and only stable
fixed points remain. Later these fixed points become periodic and chaotic
through another set of bifurcations which ultimately leads to turbulence.
