In this article, we utilize \emph{q}--fractional Caputo initial value
problems of order $0<\alpha\leq 1$ to derive a \emph{q}--analogue for
Gronwall--type inequality. Some particular cases are derived where
\emph{q}--Mittag--Leffler functions and \emph{q}--exponential type functions
are used. An example is given to illustrate the validity of the derived
inequality.
