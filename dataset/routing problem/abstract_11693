In this paper we examine the model matching problem that concerns nonlinear
input - output discrete systems, containing products among delays of input and
output signals, through a special factorization. The algebraic framework of
$\de \e$-operators and the star-product that we adopt describe these systems.
Moreover, a certain procedure that resembles the Euclidean division, allows us
to discover the linear factors of those systems, with respect to the above
mentioned operations. The entire approach is symbolically algorithmic and
involves the use of suitable software.
