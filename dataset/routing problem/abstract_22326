In the work, we focus on a conjecture due to Z.X. Chen and H.X. Yi[1] which
is concerning the uniqueness problem of meromorphic functions share three
distinct values with their difference operators. We prove that the conjecture
is right for meromorphic function of finite order. Meanwhile, a result of J.
Zhang and L.W. Liao[10] is generalized from entire functions to meromorphic
functions.
