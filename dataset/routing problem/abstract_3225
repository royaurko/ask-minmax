For finite dimensional CMV matrices the classical inverse spectral problems
are considered. We solve the inverse problem of reconstructing a CMV matrix by
its Weyl's function, the problem of reconstructing the matrix by two spectra of
CMV matrices with different "boundary conditions", and the problem of
reconstructing the CMV matrix by its spectrum and the spectrum of the CMV
matrix obtained from it by truncation.
