Utilization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in military and civil
operations is getting popular. One of the challenges in effectively tasking
these expensive vehicles is planning the flight routes to monitor the targets.
In this work, we aim to develop an algorithm which produces routing plans for a
limited number of UAVs to cover maximum number of targets considering their
flight range. The proposed solution for this practical optimization problem is
designed by modifying the Max-Min Ant System (MMAS) algorithm. To evaluate the
success of the proposed method, an alternative approach, based on the Nearest
Neighbour (NN) heuristic, has been developed as well. The results showed the
success of the proposed MMAS method by increasing the number of covered targets
compared to the solution based on the NN heuristic.
