The problem of controlling a finite state Markov chain in the presence of an
adversary so as to ensure desired performance levels for a vector of objectives
is cast in the framework of Blackwell approachability. Relying on an elementary
two time scale construction a control scheme is proposed which ensures almost
sure convergence to the desired set regardless of the adversarial actions.
