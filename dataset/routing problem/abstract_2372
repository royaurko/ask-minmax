We study the ionization dynamics of Ar clusters exposed to ultrashort
near-infrared (NIR) laser pulses for intensities well below the threshold at
which tunnel ionization could ignite the nanoplasma formation. We find that the
emission of highly charged ions up to Ar$^{8+}$ can be switched on with unit
contrast by generating only a few seed electrons with an ultrashort extreme
ultraviolet (XUV) pulse prior to the NIR field. Molecular dynamics simulations
can explain the experimental observations and predict a generic scenario where
efficient heating via inverse bremsstrahlung and NIR avalanching are followed
by resonant collective nanoplasma heating. The temporally and spatially
well-controlled injection of the XUV seed electrons opens new routes for
controlling avalanching and heating phenomena in nanostructures and solids,
with implications for both fundamental and applied laser-matter science.
