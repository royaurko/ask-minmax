The decrease of the barrier transparency in
superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) Josephson junctions leads to the
deviations of the current-phase relation from the sinusoidal form. The sign of
second harmonics is important for many applications, in particular in junctions
with a more complex structure like SNINS or SFIFS, where N is a normal metal
and F is a weak metallic ferromagnet. In our work we study the static magnetic
flux distributions in long Josephson junctions taking into account the higher
harmonics in the Fourier-decomposition of the Josephson current. Stability
analysis is based on numerical solution of a spectral Sturm-Liouville problem
formulated for each distribution. In this approach the nullification of the
minimal eigenvalue of this problem indicates a bifurcation point in one of
parameters. At each step of numerical continuation in parameters of the model,
the corresponding nonlinear boundary problem is solved on the basis of the
continuous analog of Newton's method. The solutions which do not exist in the
traditional model have been found. The influence of second harmonic on
stability of magnetic flux distributions for main solutions is investigated.
