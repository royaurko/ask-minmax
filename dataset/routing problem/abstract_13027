The reconstruction of three-dimensional sparse volume functions from few
tomographic projections constitutes a challenging problem in image
reconstruction and turns out to be a particular instance problem of compressive
sensing. The tomographic measurement matrix encodes the incidence relation of
the imaging process, and therefore is not subject to design up to small
perturbations of non-zero entries. We present an average case analysis of the
recovery properties and a corresponding tail bound to establish weak
thresholds, in excellent agreement with numerical experiments. Our result
improve the state-of-the-art of tomographic imaging in experimental fluid
dynamics by a factor of three.
