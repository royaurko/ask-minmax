In this article we present local well-posedness results in the classical
Sobolev space H^s(R) with s > 1/4 for the Cauchy problem of the Gardner
equation, overcoming the problem of the loss of the scaling property of this
equation. We also cover the energy space H^1(R) where global well-posedness
follows from the conservation laws of the system. Moreover, we construct
solitons of the Gardner equation explicitly and prove that, under certain
conditions, this family is orbitally stable in the energy space.
