We classify the category of finite-dimensional real division composition
algebras having a non-abelian Lie algebra of derivations. Our complete and
explicit classification is largely achieved by introducing the concept of a
quasi-description of a category, and using it to express the problem in terms
of normal form problems for certain group actions on products of 3-spheres.
