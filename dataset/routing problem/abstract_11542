The Adams spectral sequence was invented by J.F.Adams almost fifty years ago
for calculations of stable homotopy groups of topological spaces and in
particular of spheres. The calculation of differentials of this spectral
sequence is one of the most difficult problem of Algebraic Topology. Here we
consider an approach to solve this problem in the case of Z/2 coefficients and
find inductive formulas for the differentials. It is based on the Stasheff
algebra structures, operad methods and functional homology operations.
