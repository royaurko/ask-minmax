We combine integer linear programming and recent advances in Monadic
Second-Order model checking to obtain two new algorithmic meta-theorems for
graphs of bounded vertex-cover. The first shows that cardMSO1, an extension of
the well-known Monadic Second-Order logic by the addition of cardinality
constraints, can be solved in FPT time parameterized by vertex cover. The
second meta-theorem shows that the MSO partitioning problems introduced by Rao
can also be solved in FPT time with the same parameter. The significance of our
contribution stems from the fact that these formalisms can describe problems
which are W[1]-hard and even NP-hard on graphs of bounded tree-width.
Additionally, our algorithms have only an elementary dependence on the
parameter and formula. We also show that both results are easily extended from
vertex cover to neighborhood diversity.
