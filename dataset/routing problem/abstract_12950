Genetic algorithms (GAs) emulate the process of biological evolution, in a
computational setting, in order to generate good solutions to difficult search
and optimisation problems. GA-based optimisers tend to be extremely robust and
versatile compared to most traditional techniques used to solve optimisation
problems. This review paper provides a very brief introduction to GAs and
outlines their utility in astronomy and astrophysics.
