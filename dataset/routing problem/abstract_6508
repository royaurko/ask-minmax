In this paper we review algorithms for checking diagnosability of
discrete-event systems and timed automata. We point out that the diagnosability
problems in both cases reduce to the emptiness problem for (timed) B\"uchi
automata. Moreover, it is known that, checking whether a discrete-event system
is diagnosable, can also be reduced to checking bounded diagnosability. We
establish a similar result for timed automata. We also provide a synthesis of
the complexity results for the different fault diagnosis problems.
