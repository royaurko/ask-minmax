Programs for complicated engineering and scientific tasks always have to deal
with a problem of showing numerous graphical results. The limits of the screen
space and often opposite requirements from different users are the cause of the
infinite discussions between designers and users, but the source of this
ongoing conflict is not in the level of interface design, but in the basic
principle of current graphical output: user may change some views and details,
but in general the output view is absolutely defined and fixed by the
developer. Author was working for several years on the algorithm that will
allow eliminating this problem thus allowing stepping from designer-driven
applications to user-driven. Such type of applications in which user is
deciding what, when and how to show on the screen, is the dream of scientists
and engineers working on the analysis of the most complicated tasks. The new
paradigm is based on movable and resizable graphics, and such type of graphics
can be widely used not only for scientific and engineering applications.
