Given a Lie pseudo-group action, an equivariant moving frame exists in the
neighborhood of a submanifold jet provided the action is free and regular. For
local equivalence problems the freeness requirement cannot always be satisfied
and in this paper we show that, with the appropriate modifications and
assumptions, the equivariant moving frame constructions extend to submanifold
jets where the pseudo-group does not act freely at any order. Once this is
done, we review the solution to the local equivalence problem of submanifolds
within the equivariant moving frame framework. This offers an alternative
approach to Cartan's equivalence method based on the theory of G-structures.
