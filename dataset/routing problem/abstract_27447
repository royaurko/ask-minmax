In this paper we study the higher regularity of the free boundary for the
elliptic Signorini problem. By using a partial hodograph-Legendre
transformation we show that the regular part of the free boundary is real
analytic. The first complication in the study is the invertibility of the
hodograph transform (which is only $C^{0,1/2}$) which can be overcome by
studying the precise asymptotic behavior of the solutions near regular free
boundary points. The second and main complication in the study is that the
equation satisfied by the Legendre transform is degenerate. However, the
equation has a subelliptic structure and can be viewed as a perturbation of the
Baouendi-Grushin operator. By using the $L^p$ theory available for that
operator, we can bootstrap the regularity of the Legendre transform up to real
analyticity, which imples the real analyticity of the free boundary.
