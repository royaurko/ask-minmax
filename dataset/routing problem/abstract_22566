X-ray emitting clusters of galaxies are considered in the context of modified
Newtonian dynamics (MOND). I show that self-gravitating isothermal gas spheres
are not good representations of rich clusters with respect to the radial gas
density distribution as indicated by the X-ray surface brightness. Pure gas
spheres with a density distribution described by a ``beta'' model, as observed,
also fail because, with MOND, these objects are far from isothermal. These
problems may be resolved by adding an additional dark mass component in the
central regions; a constant density sphere contained within two core radii and
having a total mass of one to two times that in the gas. With this additional
component, the observed luminosity-temperature relation for clusters of
galaxies is reproduced. When the observed X-ray surface brightness distribution
in actual clusters is modeled by such a two-component structure, the typical
mass discrepancy is three to four times smaller than with Newtonian dynamics.
Thus while MOND significantly reduces the mass of the dark component in
clusters it does not remove it completely. I speculate on the nature of the
dark component and argue that this is not a fundamental problem for MOND.
