Dynamics problem solving is highly specific to the problem at hand and to
develop the general mind framework to become an effective problem solver
requires ingenuity and creativity on top of a solid grounding on theoretical
and conceptual knowledge. A blended approach with prototype demo, problem-based
learning, and an opinion questionnaire was used during first semester of 2013.
Students working in randomly selected teams had to interact with classmates
while solving a randomly selected problem. The approach helps improve awareness
of what is important to learn in this class while reducing grading load. It
also provides a more rewarding contact time for both pupils and instructor.
