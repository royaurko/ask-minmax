The problem of the mutual attraction and joining of two black holes is of
importance as both a source of gravitational waves and as a testbed of
numerical relativity. If the holes start out close enough that they are
initially surrounded by a common horizon, the problem can be viewed as a
perturbation of a single black hole. We take initial data due to Misner for
close black holes, apply perturbation theory and evolve the data with the
Zerilli equation. The computed gravitational radiation agrees with and extends
the results of full numerical computations.
