In 1973, R. Penrose presented an argument that the total mass of a space-time
which contains black holes with event horizons of total area $A$ should be at
least $\sqrt{A/16\pi}$. An important special case of this physical statement
translates into a very beautiful mathematical inequality in Riemannian geometry
known as the Riemannian Penrose inequality. This inequality was first
established by G. Huisken and T. Ilmanen in 1997 for a single black hole and
then by one of the contributors (H.B.) in 1999 for any number of black holes. The
two approaches use two different geometric flow techniques and are described
here. We further present some background material concerning the problem at
hand, discuss some applications of Penrose-type inequalities, as well as the
open questions remaining.
