We revisit the relative perturbation theory for invariant subspaces of
positive definite matrix pairs. As a prototype model problem for our results we
consider parameter dependent families of eigenvalue problems. We show that new
estimates are a natural way to obtain sharp --- as functions of the parameter
indexing the family of matrix pairs --- estimates for the rotation of spectral
subspaces.
