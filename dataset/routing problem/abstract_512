We report the results of a detailed study of the structural, magnetic and
magnetotransport properties of as-grown and annealed Ga0.91Mn0.09As thin films
grown on (311)A and (311)B GaAs substrates. The high Curie temperature and hole
density of the (311)B material are comparable to those of GaMnAs grown on (001)
GaAs under the same growth conditions, while they are much lower for the (311)A
material. We find evidence that Mn incorporation is more efficient for (311)B
than for (001) and significantly less efficient for (311)A which is consistent
with the bonding on these surfaces. This indicates that growth on (311)B may be
a route to increased Curie temperatures in GaMnAs. A biaxial magnetic
anisotropy is observed for the (311) material with easy axes along the [010]
and [001] out-of-plane directions. An additional uniaxial in-plane anisotropy
is also observed with the easy axis along for the (311)A material, and along
for the (311)B material. This new observation may be of importance for the
resolution of the outstanding problem of the origin of uniaxial anisotropy in
(001) GaMnAs.
