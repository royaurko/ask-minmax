Let $P_1,...,P_{d+1} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be $d$-dimensional point sets such
that the convex hull of each $P_i$ contains the origin. We call the sets $P_i$
color classes, and we think of the points in $P_i$ as having color $i$. A
colorful choice is a set with at most one point of each color. The colorful
Caratheodory theorem guarantees the existence of a colorful choice whose convex
hull contains the origin. So far, the computational complexity of finding such
a colorful choice is unknown.
  We approach this problem from two directions. First, we consider
approximation algorithms: an $m$-colorful choice is a set that contains at most
$m$ points from each color class. We show that for any constant $\varepsilon >
0$, an $\lceil \varepsilon(d+1)\rceil$-colorful choice containing the origin in
its convex hull can be found in polynomial time. This notion of approximation
has not been studied before, and it is motivated through the applications of
the colorful Caratheodory theorem in the literature. In the second part, we
present a natural generalization of the colorful Caratheodory problem: in the
Nearest Colorful Polytope problem (NCP), we are given sets $P_1,...,P_n \subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ that do not necessarily contain the origin in their convex hulls.
The goal is to find a colorful choice whose convex hull minimizes the distance
to the origin. We show that computing local optima for the NCP problem is
PLS-complete, while computing a global optimum is NP-hard.
