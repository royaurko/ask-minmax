We discuss the problem of risk estimation in the classification problem, with
specific focus on finding distributions that maximize the confidence intervals
of risk estimation. We derived simple analytic approximations for the maximum
bias of empirical risk for histogram classifier. We carry out a detailed study
on using these analytic estimates for empirical estimation of risk.
