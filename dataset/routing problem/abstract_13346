The operator space $\text{OUMD}$ property was introduced by Pisier in the
context of vector-valued noncommutative $L_p$-spaces. It is an open problem
whether the column Hilbert space has this property. Based on some complex
interpolation techniques, we are able to relate this problem to the study of
the $\text{OUMD}_q$ property for non-commutative $L_p$-spaces.
