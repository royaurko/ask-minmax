We consider the variational problem of maximizing the weighted equilibrium
Green's energy of a distribution of charges free to move in a subset of the
upper half-plane, under a particular external field. We show that this problem
admits a solution and that, under some conditions, this solution is an S-curve
(in the sense of Gonchar-Rakhmanov). The above problem appears in the theory of
the semiclassical limit of the integrable focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation. In particular, its solution provides a justification of a crucial
step in the asymptotic theory of nonlinear steepest descent for the inverse
scattering problem of the associated linear non-self-adjoint Zakharov-Shabat
operator and the equivalent Riemann-Hilbert factorization problem.
