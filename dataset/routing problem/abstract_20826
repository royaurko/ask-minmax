Recently Kearton showed that any Seifert matrix of a knot is S--equivalent to
the Seifert matrix of a prime knot. We show in this note that such a matrix is
in fact S--equivalent to the Seifert matrix of a hyperbolic knot. This result
follows from reinterpreting this problem in terms of Blanchfield pairings and
by applying results of Kawauchi.
