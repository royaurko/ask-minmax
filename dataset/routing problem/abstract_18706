In the Survivable Network Design problem (SNDP), we are given an undirected
graph $G(V,E)$ with costs on edges, along with a connectivity requirement
$r(u,v)$ for each pair $u,v$ of vertices. The goal is to find a minimum-cost
subset $E^*$ of edges, that satisfies the given set of pairwise connectivity
requirements. In the edge-connectivity version we need to ensure that there are
$r(u,v)$ edge-disjoint paths for every pair $u, v$ of vertices, while in the
vertex-connectivity version the paths are required to be vertex-disjoint. The
edge-connectivity version of SNDP is known to have a 2-approximation. However,
no non-trivial approximation algorithm has been known so far for the vertex
version of SNDP, except for special cases of the problem. We present an
extremely simple algorithm to achieve an $O(k^3 \log n)$-approximation for this
problem, where $k$ denotes the maximum connectivity requirement, and $n$
denotes the number of vertices. We also give a simple proof of the recently
discovered $O(k^2 \log n)$-approximation result for the single-source version
of vertex-connectivity SNDP. We note that in both cases, our analysis in fact
yields slightly better guarantees in that the $\log n$ term in the
approximation guarantee can be replaced with a $\log \tau$ term where $\tau$
denotes the number of distinct vertices that participate in one or more pairs
with a positive connectivity requirement.
