We show that when the antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field is included in the
Randall-Sundrum scenario, although the hierarchy problem can be solved, it
requires an extreme fine tuning of the Kalb-Ramond field (about 1 part in
$10^{62}$). We interpret this as the return of the problem in disguise.
Further, we show that the Kalb-Ramond field induces a small negative
cosmological constant on the visible brane.
