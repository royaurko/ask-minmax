We prove almost global existence for supercritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equations on the $d$-torus ($d$ arbitrary) on the good geometry selected in
part I. This is seen as the Cauchy consequence of I, since the known invariant
measure of smooth solutions are supported on KAM tori. In the high frequency
limit, these quantitative solutions could also be relevant to Cauchy problems
for compressible Euler equations.
