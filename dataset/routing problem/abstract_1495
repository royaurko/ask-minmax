We propose to replace Ga in (Ga,Mn)As with Li and Zn as a route to high Curie
temperature, carrier mediated ferromagnetism in a dilute moment n-type
semiconductor. Superior material characteristics, rendering Li(Zn,Mn)As a
realistic candidate for such a system, include unlimited solubility of the
isovalent substitutional Mn impurity and carrier concentration controlled
independently of Mn doping by adjusting Li-(Zn,Mn) stoichiometry. Our
predictions are anchored by detail ab initio calculations and comparisons with
the familiar and directly related (Ga,Mn)As, by the microscopic physical
picture we provide for the exchange interaction between Mn local moments and
electrons in the conduction band, and by analysis of prospects for the
controlled growth of Li(Zn,Mn)As materials.
