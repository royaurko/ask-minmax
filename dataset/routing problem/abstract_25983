In this paper, we study the behaviour of a microcantilever beam under
electrostatic actuation using finite difference method. This problem has a lot
of applications in MEMS based devices like accelerometers, switches and others.
In this paper, we formulated the problem of a cantilever beam with proof mass
at its end and carried out the finite difference solution. we studied the
effects of length, width, and the gap size on the pull-in voltage using data
that are available in the literature. Also, the stability limit is compared
with the single degree of freedom commonly used in the earlier literature as an
approximation to calculate the pull-in voltage.
