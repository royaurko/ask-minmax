Decision circuits have been developed to perform efficient evaluation of
influence diagrams [Bhattacharjya and Shachter, 2007], building on the advances
in arithmetic circuits for belief network inference [Darwiche,2003]. In the
process of model building and analysis, we perform sensitivity analysis to
understand how the optimal solution changes in response to changes in the
model. When sequential decision problems under uncertainty are represented as
decision circuits, we can exploit the efficient solution process embodied in
the decision circuit and the wealth of derivative information available to
compute the value of information for the uncertainties in the problem and the
effects of changes to model parameters on the value and the optimal strategy.
