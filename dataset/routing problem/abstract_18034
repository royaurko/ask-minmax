In this paper, we design a set of multi-objective constrained optimization
problems (MCOPs) and propose a new repair operator to address them. The
proposed repair operator is used to fix the solutions that violate the box
constraints. More specifically, it employs a reversed correction strategy that
can effectively avoid the population falling into local optimum. In addition,
we integrate the proposed repair operator into two classical multi-objective
evolutionary algorithms MOEA/D and NSGA-II. The proposed repair operator is
compared with other two kinds of commonly used repair operators on benchmark
problems CTPs and MCOPs. The experiment results demonstrate that our proposed
approach is very effective in terms of convergence and diversity.
