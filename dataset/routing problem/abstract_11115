Applying the modular technology of developing of the problem-oriented
extensions of a CAD system to a problem of automation of creating of the
axonometric piping diagrams on an example of the program system TechnoCAD
GlassX is described. The features of realization of common operations,
composition and realization of special operations of a designing of the schemas
of the special technological pipe lines, systems of a water line and water
