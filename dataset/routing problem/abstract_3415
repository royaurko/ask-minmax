The three-node multiterminal lossy source coding problem is investigated. We
derive an inner bound to the general rate-distortion region of this problem
which is a natural extension of the seminal work by Kaspi'85 on the interactive
two-terminal source coding problem. It is shown that this (rather involved)
inner bound contains several rate-distortion regions of some relevant source
coding settings. In this way, besides the non-trivial extension of the
interactive two terminal problem, our results can be seen as a generalization
and hence unification of several previous works in the field. Specializing to
particular cases we obtain novel rate-distortion regions for several lossy
source coding problems. We finish by describing some of the open problems and
challenges. However, the general three-node multiterminal lossy source coding
problem seems to offer a formidable mathematical complexity.
