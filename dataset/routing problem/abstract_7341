We consider the problem of the representation of real continuous functions by
linear superpositions $\sum_{i=1}^{k}g_{i}\circ p_{i}$ with continuous $g_{i}$
and $p_{i}$. This problem was considered by many contributors. But complete, and at
the same time explicit and practical solutions to the problem was given only
for the case $k=2$. For $k>2$, a rather practical sufficient condition for the
representation can be found in Sternfeld [17] and Sproston, Strauss [16]. In
this short note, we give a necessary condition of such kind for the
representability of continuous functions.
