We compare variants of Anderson Mixing with the Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov
and Broyden methods applied to an instance of the k-eigenvalue formulation of
the linear Boltzmann transport equation. We present evidence that one variant
of Anderson Mixing finds solutions in the fewest number of iterations. We
examine and strengthen theoretical results of Anderson Mixing applied to linear
problems.
