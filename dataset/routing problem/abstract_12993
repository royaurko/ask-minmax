In this work we have found an exact solution for the problem of the movement
of a dipole type point vortex in an area of fluid limited by a flat boundary.
We also present a solution to the problem of dipole point vortex motion in a
right angle. It is shown that unlike a usual point vortex, the dipole vortex
always comes away from the boundary asymptotically. This important feature of
the dipole vortex allows it to be considered to be one of the efficient
mechanisms of vorticity transfer from boundary to media.
