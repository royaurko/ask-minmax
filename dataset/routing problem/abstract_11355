A cosmological scenario is proposed, which simultaneously solves the mass
hierarchy and the small dark energy problem. In the present scenario an
effective gravity mass scale (inverse of the Newton's constant) increases
during the inflationary period. The small cosmological constant or the dark
energy density in the present universe is dynamically realized by introducing
two, approximately O(2) symmetric dilatons, taking the fundamental mass scale
at TeV.
