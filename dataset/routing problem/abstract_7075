In this paper, we study the question of classifying self-similar sets under
bi-Lipschitz mappings and obtain an important bi-Lipschitz invariant, which is
an ideal of a ring related to IFS. Roughly speaking, different Lipschitz
equivalence classes of self-similar sets correspond to different ideal classes
of a related ring. This result reveals an interesting relationship between the
Lipschitz classification problem in fractal geometry and the Gauss class number
problem in algebraic number theory.
