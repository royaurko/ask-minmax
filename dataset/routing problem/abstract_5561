We reconsider the Polonyi problem in gravity-mediation models for
supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking. It has been argued that there is no problem in
the dynamical SUSY breaking scenarios, since the Polonyi field acquires a
sufficiently large mass of the order of the dynamical SUSY-breaking scale
Lamada_{SUSY}. However, we find that a linear term of the Polonyi field in the
Kahler potential brings us back to the Polonyi problem, unless the inflation
scale is sufficiently low, H_{inf} < 10^{8} GeV, or the reheating temperature
is extremely low, T_{R} < 100 GeV. Here, this Polonyi problem is more serious
than the original one, since the Polonyi field mainly decays into a pair of
gravitinos.
