A semiclassical diagrammatic approach is constructed for calculating
correlation functions of observables in open chaotic systems with time reversal
symmetry. The results are expressed in terms of classical correlation functions
involving Wigner representations of the observables. The formalism is used to
explain a recent microwave experiment on the 4-disk problem, and to
characterize the two-point function of the photodissociation cross section of
complex molecules.
