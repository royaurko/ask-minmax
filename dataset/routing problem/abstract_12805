In the present paper we introduce a notion of $G-$decompositions of matrices.
Main result of the paper is that a symmetric matrix $A_m$ has a
$G-$decomposition in the class of stochastic (resp. substochastic) matrices if
and only if $A_m$ belongs to the set ${\mathbf{U}}^m$ (resp. ${\mathbf{U}}_m$).
To prove the main result, we study extremal points and geometrical structures
of the sets ${\mathbf{U}}^m$, ${\mathbf{U}}_m$. Note that such kind of
investigations enables to study Birkhoff's problem for quadratic $G-$doubly
stochastic operators.
