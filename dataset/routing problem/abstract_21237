For the first time it is shown that for thin metallic films thickness of
which not exceed thickness of skin -- layer, the problem of description of
surface plasma oscillations allows analytical solution by arbitrary ratio
between length of electrons free path and thickness of a film. The dependance
of frequency surface plasma oscillations on wave number is carry out.
