Reliability prediction is an important research problem in software
reliability engineering, which has been widely studied in the last decades.
However, modelling and predicting user-perceived reliability of black-box
services remain an open problem. Software services, such as Web services and
Web APIs, generally provide black-box functionalities to users through the
Internet, leading to a lack of their internal information for reliability
analysis. Furthermore, the user-perceived service reliability depends not only
on the service itself, but also heavily on the invocation context (e.g.,
service workloads, network conditions), whereby traditional reliability models
become ineffective and inappropriate. To address these new challenges posed by
black-box services, in this paper, we propose CARP, a context-aware reliability
prediction approach that leverages historical usage data from users for
reliability prediction. Through context-aware model construction and
prediction, CARP is able to alleviate the data sparsity problem that heavily
limits the prediction accuracy of other existing approaches. The preliminary
evaluation results show that CARP can make significant improvement on
reliability prediction accuracy, e.g., 41% for MAE and 38% for RMSE when only
5% of data are available.
