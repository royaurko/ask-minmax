In this literature, we carefully investigate the structure of single- and
multi-frequency imaging functions, that are usually employed in inverse
scattering problems. Based on patterns of the singular vectors of the
Multi-Static Response (MSR) matrix, we establish a relationship between imaging
functions and the Bessel function. This relationship indicates certain
properties of imaging functions and the reason behind enhancement in the
imaging performance by multiple frequencies. Several numerical simulations with
a large amount of noisy data are performed in order to support our
investigation.
