We consider the identification of nonlinear heat conduction laws in
stationary and instationary heat transfer problems. Only a single additional
measurement of the temperature on a curve on the boundary is required to
determine the unknown parameter function on the range of observed temperatures.
We first present a new proof of Cannon's uniqueness result for the stationary
case, then derive a corresponding stability estimate, and finally extend our
argument to instationary problems.
