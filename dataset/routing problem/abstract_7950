The inverse problem of finding the refraction coefficient of a shallow ocean
from the observation of the extra Cauchy data for the acoustic field at the
surface of the ocean is studied. Uniqueness theorem is proved and a
reconstruction algorithm is obtained.
 Comments are given on the related results in the literature.
