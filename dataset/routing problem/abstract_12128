We consider the defocussing NLS equation with small periodic initial
condition. A new approach to study the Hamiltonian as a function of action
variables is demonstrated. The problems for the NLS equation is reformulated as
the problem of conformal mapping theory corresponding to quasimomentum of the
Zakharov-Shabat operator. The main tool is the L\"owner type equation for the
quasimomentum. In particular, we determine the asymptotics of the Hamiltonian
for small action variables. Moreover, we determine the gradient of Hamiltonian
with respect to action variables. This gives so called frequencies and
determines how the angles variables depend on the time.
