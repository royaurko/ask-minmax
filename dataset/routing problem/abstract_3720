Our idea is to imitate Smale's list of problems, in a restricted domain of
mathematical aspects of Celestial Mechanics. All the problems are on the n-body
problem, some with different homogeneity of the potential, addressing many
aspects such as central configurations, stability of relative equilibrium,
singularities, integral manifolds, etc. Following Steve Smale in his list, the
criteria for our selection are: (1) Simple statement. Also preferably
mathematically precise, and best even with a yes or no answer. (2) Personal
acquaintance with the problem, having found it not easy. (3) A belief that the
question, its solution, partial results or even attempts at its solution are
likely to have great importance for the development of the mathematical aspects
of Celestial Mechanics.
