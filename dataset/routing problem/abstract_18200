Encoding readout methods based on different schemes have been successfully
developed and tested with different types of position-sensitive detectors with
stripe-readout structures. However, how to construct an encoding scheme in a
more generic and systematic way is still under study. In this paper, we present
a graph model for the encoding scheme. With this model, encoding schemes can be
studied in a more systematic way. It is shown that by using an encoding readout
method, a maximum of n(n-1)/2+1 stripes can be processed with n channels if n
is odd, while a maximum of (n(n-2))/2+2 stripes can be processed with n
channels if n is even. Furthermore, based on the model, the encoding scheme
construction problem can be transformed into a problem in graph theory, in
which the aim is to construct an Eulerian path such that the length of the
shortest subcycle is as long as possible. A more generic approach to
constructing the encoding scheme is found by solving the associated
mathematical problem.
