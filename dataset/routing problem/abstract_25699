The light-front coupled-cluster (LFCC) method is a technique for solving
Hamiltonian eigenvalue problems in light-front-quantized field theories. Its
primary purpose is to provide a systematic sequence of solvable approximations
to the original eigenvalue problem without the truncation of Fock space. Here
we discuss the incorporation of zero modes, modes of zero longitudinal
momentum, into the formalism of the method. Without zero modes, the light-front
vacuum is trivial, and the vacuum expectation value of the field is always
zero. The LFCC method with zero modes provides for vacuum structure, in the
form of a generalized coherent state of zero modes, as is illustrated here in
two-dimensional model field theories.
