This paper is a continuation of our previous investigation on the truncated
matrix trigonometric moment problem in Ukrainian Math. J., 2011, 63, no.6,
786-797. In the present paper we obtain a Nevanlinna-type formula for this
moment problem in a general case. We only assume that we have more than one
moment, the moment problem is solvable and the problem has more than one
solution. The coefficients of the corresponding matrix linear fractional
transformation are explicitly expressed by the prescribed moments. Easy
conditions for the determinacy of the moment problem are given.
