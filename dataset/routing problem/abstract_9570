We propose a novel basis of vector functions, the mixed vector spherical
harmonics that are closely related to the functions $F_{lm}$ of Sheppard and
T\"or\"ok and help us reduce the concentration problem of tangential vector
fields within a spherical cap to an equivalent scalar problem. Exploiting an
analogy with previous results published by Gr\"unbaum and his colleagues, we
construct a differential operator that commutes with the concentration operator
of this scalar problem and propose a stable and convenient method to obtain its
eigenfunctions. Having obtained the scalar eigenfunctions, the calculation of
tangential vector Slepian functions is straightforward.
