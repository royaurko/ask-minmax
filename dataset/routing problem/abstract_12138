In this paper a result of Latala about the tail behavior of Gaussian
polynomials will be discussed. Latala proved an interesting result about this
problem in paper [2]. But his proof applied an incorrect statement at a crucial
point. Hence the question may arise whether the main result of paper [2] is
valid. The goal of this paper is to settle this problem by presenting such a
proof where the application of the erroneous statement is avoided. I discuss
the proofs in detail even at the price of a longer text and try to give such an
explanation that reveals the ideas behind them better than the original paper.
