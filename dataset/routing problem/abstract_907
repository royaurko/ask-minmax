We show that the symmetries of image formation by scattering enable
graph-theoretic manifold-embedding techniques to extract structural and timing
information from simulated and experimental snapshots at extremely low signal.
The approach constitutes a physically-based, computationally efficient, and
noise-robust route to analyzing the large and varied datasets generated by
existing and emerging methods for studying structure and dynamics by
scattering. We demonstrate three-dimensional structure recovery from X-ray
diffraction and cryo-electron microscope image snapshots of unknown
orientation, the latter at 12 times lower dose than currently in use. We also
show that ultra-low-signal, random sightings of dynamically evolving systems
can be sequenced into high quality movies to reveal their evolution. Our
approach offers a route to recovering timing information in time-resolved
experiments, and extracting 3D movies from two-dimensional random sightings of
dynamic systems.
