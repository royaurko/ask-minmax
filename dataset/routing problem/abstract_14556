The problem of vibration suppression in helicopter rotors is the main topic
of this paper. We revisit an strategy for the stabilization of helicopter
rotors based on delayed feedback. It is shown that the results presented in
previous works are incorrect and by means of an improved analysis, made
possible by more recently developed mathematical tools, we present more
insights on how the delay can be used as stabilization tool for this problem.
All our results are supported with numerical simulations. For simplicity, only
the case of hovering flight is considered.
