Directed signature is the solution of such problems when the signed message
contains information sensitive to the signature receiver. Generally, in many
application of directed signature, the signer is generally a single person. But
when the message is on behalf of an organization, a valid sensitive message may
require the approval of several people. Threshold signature schemes are used to
solve these problems. This paper presents a threshold directed signature
scheme.
