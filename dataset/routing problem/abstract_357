This paper examines the most probable route to chaos in high-dimensional
dynamical systems in a very general computational setting. The most probable
route to chaos in high-dimensional, discrete-time maps is observed to be a
sequence of Neimark-Sacker bifurcations into chaos. A means for determining and
understanding the degree to which the Landau-Hopf route to turbulence is
non-generic in the space of $C^r$ mappings is outlined. The results comment on
previous results of Newhouse, Ruelle, Takens, Broer, Chenciner, and Iooss.
