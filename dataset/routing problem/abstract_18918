The estimation of the number of passengers with the identical journey is a
common problem for public transport contributorities. This problem is also known as
the Origin- Destination estimation (OD) problem and it has been widely studied
for the past thirty years. However, the theory is missing when the observations
are not limited to the passenger counts but also includes station surveys. Our
aim is to provide a solid framework for the estimation of an OD matrix when
only a portion of the journey counts are observable. Our method consists of a
statistical estimation technique for OD matrix when we have the sum-of-row
counts and survey-based observations. Our technique differs from the previous
studies in that it does not need a prior OD matrix which can be hard to obtain.
Instead, we model the passengers behavior through the survey data, and use the
diagonalization of the partial OD matrix to reduce the space parameter and
derive a consistent global OD matrix estimator. We demonstrate the robustness
of our estimator and apply it to several examples showcasing the proposed
models and approach. We highlight how other sources of data can be incorporated
in the model such as explanatory variables, e.g. rainfall, indicator variables
for major events, etc, and inference made in a principled, non-heuristic way.
