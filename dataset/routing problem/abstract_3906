We have proved in [Topology, 45 1 (2006)] that fundamental groups of oriented
geometrizable 3-manifolds have a solvable conjugacy problem. We now consider
the case of groups of non-oriented geometrizable 3-manifolds in order to
conclude that fundamental groups of geometrizable 3-manifolds all have a
solvable conjugacy problem.
