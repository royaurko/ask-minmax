The linear system of differential equations for determination of transmission
and reflection amplytudes of scattered electron in the field of one dimensional
arbitrary potential is obtained. It is shown that in general the scattering
problem can be reduced to the Caushy problem for the stationary
 Shrodinger equation. An explicit functional for a dependance of transmission
amplitude from scattered field is found.
