We consider extra dimensional field theory descriptions of backgrounds with N
different throats where one of the extra dimensions in each throat is much
larger than the others. Such backgrounds can be described by field theory on N
5D warped spaces which intersect on a ultraviolet (UV) brane. Given a field
that propagates in all N throats there are N boundary conditions on the UV
brane (which are determined by the effective Lagrangian on the UV brane) in
addition to the boundary conditions on the N infrared branes. We derive a
general set of UV boundary conditions and give examples of how they are applied
to particular situations. Three simple example applications are given: in the
first the number of families is determined by the number of throats and the
SUSY flavor problem is solved via an S_3 symmetry of the throats; in the second
we embed this scenario in a SUSY GUT with a solution of the doublet-triplet
splitting problem based on the product group approach; while in the final
example we show a simple geometric implementation of a SUSY trinification model
on three throats.
