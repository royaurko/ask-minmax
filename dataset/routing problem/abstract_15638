Based on the recent understanding of the role of the densitized lapse
function in Einstein's equations and of the proper way to pose the thin
sandwich problem, a slight readjustment of the minimal distortion shift gauge
in the 3+1 approach to the dynamics of general relativity allows this shift
vector to serve as the vector potential for the longitudinal part of the
extrinsic curvature tensor in the new approach to the initial value problem,
thus extending the initial value decomposition of gravitational variables to
play a role in the evolution as well. The new shift vector globally minimizes
the changes in the conformal 3-metric with respect to the spacetime measure
rather than the spatial measure on the time coordinate hypersurfaces, as the
old shift vector did.
