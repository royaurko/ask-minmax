We investigate bivariate interpolation problems in characteristic 2. Given a
nonnegative integer $t$, we describe all the sub-linear systems generated by
monomials, in which there is no curve passing through a general point with
multiplicity at least $2^t$. As an application, we show that a certain linear
system of plane curves with 10 base points is non-special.
