Over the recent years a considerable amount of effort has been devoted
towards the performance evaluation and prediction of Mobile Networks.
Performance modeling and evaluation of mobile networks are very important in
view of their ever expending usage and the multiplicity of their component
parts together with the complexity of their functioning. The present paper
addresses current issues in traffic management and congestion control by
(signal to interference plus noise ratio) SINR prediction congestion control,
routing and optimization of cellular mobile networks.
