One of the most important problems in wireless sensor network is to develop a
routing protocol that has energy efficiency. Since the power of the sensor
Nodes are limited, conserving energy and network life is a critical issue in
wireless sensor network. Clustering is one of the known methods widely used to
face these challenges. In this paper, a cluster based communication protocol
with considering the low energy consumption in wireless sensor networks, is
introduced which balances the energy load among sensor nodes. The nodes close
to each other have more overlap; they sense the same data from environment and
cause a waste of energy by generating repetitive data. In this paper, a cluster
based routing protocol is introduced, in the proposed protocol, in each round a
certain number of nodes are specified; the nodes which have at least one
neighboring node at a distance less than the threshold. Then, among them the
nodes with less energy and greater overlap with their neighbors have been
chosen to go to sleep mode, Also, the energy imbalance among sensor nodes is
reduced by integrating the distance of the nodes from the base station into
clustering policies.
