We study two related problems in the context of a supergravity dual to N=1
SYM. One of the problems is finding kappa symmetric D5-brane probes in this
particular background. The other is the use of these probes to add flavors to
the gauge theory. We find a rich and mathematically appealing structure of the
supersymmetric embeddings of a D5-brane probe in this background. Besides, we
compute the mass spectrum of the low energy excitations of N=1 SQCD (mesons)
and match our results with some field theory aspects known from the study of
supersymmetric gauge theories with a small number of flavors.
