We construct non-associative key establishment protocols for all left
self-distributive (LD), multi-LD-, and other left distributive systems.
Instantiations of these protocols using generalized shifted conjugacy in braid
groups lead to instances of a natural and apparently new group-theoretic
problem, which we call the (subgroup) conjugacy coset problem.
