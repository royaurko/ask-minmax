In this paper we propose an efficiently preconditioned Newton method for the
computation of the leftmost eigenpairs of large and sparse symmetric positive
definite matrices. A sequence of preconditioners based on the BFGS update
formula is proposed, for the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient solution of the
linearized Newton system to solve $A \mathbf{u} = q(\mathbf{u}) \mathbf{u}$,
$q(\mathbf{u})$ being the Rayleigh Quotient. We give theoretical evidence that
the sequence of preconditioned Jacobians remains close to the identity matrix
if the initial preconditioned Jacobian is so. Numerical results onto matrices
arising from various realistic problems with size up to one million unknowns
account for the efficiency of the proposed algorithm which reveals competitive
with the Jacobi-Davidson method on all the test problems.
