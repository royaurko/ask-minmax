It is well-known that the automorphism towers of infinite centreless groups
of cardinality kappa terminate in less than (2^{kappa})^+ steps. But an easy
counting argument shows that (2^{kappa})^+ is not the best possible bound.
However, in this paper, we will show that it is impossible to find an explicit
better bound using ZFC.
