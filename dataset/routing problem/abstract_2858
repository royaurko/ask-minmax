In this paper we obtain an algorithm towards solving the two-dimensional
moment problem. This algorithm gives the necessary and sufficient conditions
for the solvability of the moment problem. It is shown that all solutions of
the moment problem can be constructed using this algorithm. In a consequence,
analogous results are obtained for the complex moment problem.
