Hilbert's fourth problem asks for the construction and the study of metrics
on subsets of projective space for which the projective line segments are
geodesics. Several solutions of the problem were given so far, depending on
more precise interpretations of this problem, with various additional
conditions satisfied. The most interesting solutions are probably those
inspired from an integral formula that was first introduced in this theory by
Herbert Busemann. Besides that, Busemann and his school made a thorough
investigation of metrics defined on subsets of projective space for which the
projective lines are geodesics and they obtained several results,
characterizing several classes of such metrics. We review some of the
developments and important results related to Hilbert's problem, especially
those that arose from Busemann's work, mentioning recent results and
connections with several branches of mathematics, including Riemannian
geometry, the foundations of mathematics, the calculus of variations, metric
geometry and Finsler geometry.
