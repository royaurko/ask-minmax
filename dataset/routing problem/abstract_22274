The exponential cubic B-spline functions together with Crank Nicolson are
used to solve numerically the nonlinear coupled Burgers' equation using
collocation method. This method has been tested by three different problems.
The proposed scheme is compared with some existing methods. We have noticed
that proposed scheme produced a highly accurate results.
