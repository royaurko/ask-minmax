Recent observations have extended the range of diversity among spectra of
Type Ia supernovae. I briefly discuss SN Ia explosion models in the
spectroscopic context, the observed diversity, and some recent results from
direct analysis with the Synow code for one normal and two peculiar SNe Ia.
Relating the observational manifestations of diversity to their physical causes
is looking like an ever more challenging problem.
