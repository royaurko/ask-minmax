We study the \emph{{interval completion}} problem, which asks for the
insertion of a set of at most $k$ edges to make a graph of $n$ vertices into an
interval graph. We focus on chordal graphs with no small obstructions, where
every remaining obstruction is known to have a shallow property. From such a
shallow obstruction we single out a subset 6 or 7 vertices, called the frame,
and 5 missed edges in the subgraph induced by the frame. We show that if none
of these edges is inserted, then the frame cannot be altered at all, and the
whole obstruction is also fixed, by and large, in the sense that their related
positions in an interval representation of the objective interval graph have a
specific pattern. We propose a simple bounded search process, which effectively
transforms a given graph to a graph with the structural property that all
obstructions are shallow and have fixed frames. Then we fill in polynomial time
all obstructions that have been previously left in indecision. These efforts
together deliver a simple parameterized algorithm of time $6^k\cdot n^{O(1)}$
for the problem, significantly improving the only known parameterized algorithm
of time $k^{2k}\cdot n^{O(1)}$.
