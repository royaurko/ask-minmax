The smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is a useful numerical tool
for the study of a variety of astrophysical and planetlogical problems.
However, it turned out that the standard SPH algorithm has problems in dealing
with hydrodynamical instabilities. This problem is due to the assumption that
the local density distribution is differentiable. In order to solve this
problem, a new SPH formulation, which does not require the differentiability of
the density, have been proposed. This new SPH method improved the treatment of
hydrodynamical instabilities. This method, however, is applicable only to the
equation of state (EOS) of the ideal gas. In this paper, we describe how to
extend the new SPH method to non-ideal EOS. We present the results of various
standard numerical tests for non-ideal EOS. Our new method works well for
non-ideal EOS. We conclude that our new SPH can handle hydrodynamical
instabilities for an arbitrary EOS and that it is an attractive alternative to
the standard SPH.
