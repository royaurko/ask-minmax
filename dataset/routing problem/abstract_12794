According to a recent paper by G. Vignale [Phys. Rev. A 77, 062511 (2008),
arXiv:0803.2727], the problems arising in the original derivation of
time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) based on the Runge-Gross (RG)
action-integral functional (AIF) are due to an incorrect variational principle
(VP). This argument and the proposed modification of the VP are critically
analyzed. The more fundamental problem, though, is the indefiniteness of the RG
AIF. In contrast to a widely held belief, that indefiniteness is not eliminated
in the variational procedure, which unwittingly is corroborated by Vignale's
initial point.
