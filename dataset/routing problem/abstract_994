To pave the way for the journey from geometry to conformal field theory
(CFT), these notes present the background for some basic CFT constructions from
Calabi-Yau geometry. Topics include the complex and Kaehler geometry of
Calabi-Yau manifolds and their classification in low dimensions.
  I furthermore discuss CFT constructions for the simplest known examples that
are based in Calabi-Yau geometry, namely for the toroidal superconformal field
theories and their Z2-orbifolds.
  En route from geometry to CFT, I offer a discussion of K3 surfaces as the
simplest class of Calabi-Yau manifolds where non-linear sigma model
constructions bear mysteries to the very day.
  The elliptic genus in CFT and in geometry is recalled as an instructional
piece of evidence in favor of a deep connection between geometry and conformal
field theory.
