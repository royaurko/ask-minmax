Synchronizability of stable, output-coupled, identical, time-varying linear
systems is studied. It is shown that if the observability grammian satisfies a
persistence of excitation condition, then there exists a bounded, time-varying
linear feedback law that yields exponential synchronization for all fixed,
asymmetrical interconnections with connected graphs. Also, a weaker condition
on the grammian is given for asymptotic synchronization. No assumption is made
on the strength of coupling. Moreover, related to the main problem, a
particular array of output-coupled systems that is pertinent to much-studied
consensus problems is investigated. In this array, the individual systems are
integrators with identical, time-varying, symmetric positive semi-definite
output matrices. Trajectories of this array are shown to stay bounded using a
time-invariant, quadratic Lyapunov function. Also, sufficient conditions on
output matrix for synchronization are provided. All of the results in the paper
are generated for both continuous time and discrete time.
