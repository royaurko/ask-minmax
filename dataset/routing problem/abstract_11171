We discuss isometric embedding diagrams for the visualization of initial data
for the problem of the head-on collision of two black holes. The problem of
constructing the embedding diagrams is explicitly presented for the best
studied initial data, the Misner geometry. We present a partial solution of the
embedding diagrams and discuss issues related to completing the solution.
