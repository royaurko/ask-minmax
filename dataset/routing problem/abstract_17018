Considering the interaction through mutual interference of the different
radio devices, the channel selection (CS) problem in decentralized parallel
multiple access channels can be modeled by strategic-form games. Here, we show
that the CS problem is a potential game (PG) and thus the fictitious play (FP)
converges to a Nash equilibrium (NE) either in pure or mixed strategies. Using
a 2-player 2-channel game, it is shown that convergence in mixed strategies
might lead to cycles of action profiles which lead to individual spectral
efficiencies (SE) which are worse than the SE at the worst NE in mixed and pure
strategies. Finally, exploiting the fact that the CS problem is a PG and an
aggregation game, we present a method to implement FP with local information
and minimum feedback.
