R. A. Fisher founded modern statistical inference in 1922 and identified its
fundamental problems to be: specification, estimation and distribution. Since
then the problem of statistical model specification has received scant
attention in the statistics literature. The paper traces the history of
statistical model specification, focusing primarily on pioneers like Fisher,
Neyman, and more recently Lehmann and Cox, and attempts a synthesis of their
views in the context of the Probabilistic Reduction (PR) approach. As argued by
Lehmann [11], a major stumbling block for a general approach to statistical
model specification has been the delineation of the appropriate role for
substantive subject matter information. The PR approach demarcates the
interrelated but complemenatry roles of substantive and statistical information
summarized ab initio in the form of a structural and a statistical model,
respectively. In an attempt to preserve the integrity of both sources of
information, as well as to ensure the reliability of their fusing, a purely
probabilistic construal of statistical models is advocated. This probabilistic
construal is then used to shed light on a number of issues relating to
specification, including the role of preliminary data analysis, structural vs.
statistical models, model specification vs. model selection, statistical vs.
substantive adequacy and model validation.
