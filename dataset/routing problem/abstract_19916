It is shown that we cannot put Majorana neutrinos in the standard Dirac
theory without violation of the gauge invariance. Experiments on $\nu_l \to l
(l = e, \mu, \tau)$ transitions do not confirm this supposition. It means that
on neutrino oscillation experiments, the Majorana neutrino oscillations cannot
be observed.
