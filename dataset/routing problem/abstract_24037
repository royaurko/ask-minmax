The problem of scattering of linear internal waves from small compact sea
bottom inhomogeneities is considered from the point of view of mode-to-mode
scattering. A simple formula for modal conversion coefficients, quantifying the
amount of energy that is scattered into the n-th mode from the incident field
m-th mode, is derived. In this formula the representation of inhomogeneities by
their expansions into the Fourier and Fourier-Bessel series with respect to
angular and radial coordinates respectively are used. Results of calculations,
performed in a simple model case, are presented. The obtained formula can be
used for a formulation of the inverse problem, as it was done in the acoustic
case.
