The kissing number k(3) is the maximal number of equal size nonoverlapping
spheres in three dimensions that can touch another sphere of the same size.
This number was the subject of a famous discussion between Isaac Newton and
David Gregory in 1694. The first proof that k(3)=12 was given by Sch\"utte and
van der Waerden only in 1953. In this paper we present a new solution of the
Newton-Gregory problem that uses our extension of the Delsarte method. This
proof relies on basic calculus and simple spherical geometry.
