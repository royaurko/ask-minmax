Accurate representation of the physical layer is required for analysis and
simulation of multi-hop networking in sensor, ad hoc, and mesh networks. This
paper investigates, models, and analyzes the correlations that exist in shadow
fading between links in multi-hop networks. Radio links that are geographically
proximate often experience similar environmental shadowing effects and thus
have correlated fading. We describe a measurement procedure and campaign to
measure a large number of multi-hop networks in an ensemble of environments.
The measurements show statistically significant correlations among shadowing
experienced on different links in the network, with correlation coefficients up
to 0.33. We propose a statistical model for the shadowing correlation between
link pairs which shows strong agreement with the measurements, and we compare
the new model with an existing shadowing correlation model of Gudmundson
(1991). Finally, we analyze multi-hop paths in three and four node networks
using both correlated and independent shadowing models and show that
independent shadowing models can underestimate the probability of route failure
by a factor of two or greater.
