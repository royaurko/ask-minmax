This work presents two new algorithms for performing constraint satisfaction.
The first algorithm presented, DMaxWalkSat, is a constraint solver specialized
for solving dynamic, weighted constraint satisfaction problems. The second
algorithm, RDMaxWalkSat, is a derivative of DMaxWalkSat that has been modified
into an anytime algorithm, and hence support realtime constraint satisfaction.
DMaxWalkSat is shown to offer performance advantages in terms of solution
quality and runtime over its parent constraint solver, MaxWalkSat. RDMaxWalkSat
is shown to support anytime operation. The introduction of these algorithms
brings another tool to the areas of computer science that naturally represent
problems as constraint satisfaction problems, an example of which is the robust
coherence algorithm.
