Let S be a bordered Riemann surface with genus g and m boundary components.
For a smooth family of smooth Jordan curves in the complex plane parametrized
by the boundary of S and such that all curves contain 0 in their interior we
show that there exists a holomorphic solution of the corresponding
Riemann-Hilbert problem with at most 2g+m-1 zeros on S.
