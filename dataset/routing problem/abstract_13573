We consider the initial value problem associated to the regularized
Benjamin-Ono equation, rBO. Our aim is to establish local and global
well-posedness results in weighted Sobolev spaces via contraction principle. We
also prove a unique continuation property that implies that arbitrary
polinomial type decay is not preserved yielding sharp results regarding
well-posedness of the initial value problem in most weighted Sobolev spaces.
