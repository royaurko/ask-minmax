We study a mean value of the classical additive divisor problem. The main
term we are interested in here is the one by Motohashi, but we also give an
upper bound for the case where the main term is that of Atkinson. Furthermore,
we point out that the proof yields an analogous upper bound for a shifted
convolution sum over Fourier coefficients of a fixed holomorphic cusp form in
mean.
