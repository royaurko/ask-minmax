We revisit the problem of accurately answering large classes of statistical
queries while preserving differential privacy. Previous approaches to this
problem have either been very general but have not had run-time polynomial in
the size of the database, have applied only to very limited classes of queries,
or have relaxed the notion of worst-case error guarantees. In this paper we
consider the large class of sparse queries, which take non-zero values on only
polynomially many universe elements. We give efficient query release algorithms
for this class, in both the interactive and the non-interactive setting. Our
algorithms also achieve better accuracy bounds than previous general techniques
do when applied to sparse queries: our bounds are independent of the universe
size. In fact, even the runtime of our interactive mechanism is independent of
the universe size, and so can be implemented in the "infinite universe" model
in which no finite universe need be specified by the data curator.
