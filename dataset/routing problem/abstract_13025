We study images of the unit ball under certain special classes of
quasiregular mappings. For homeomorphic, i.e., quasiconformal mappings problems
of this type have been studied extensively in the literature. In this paper we
also consider non-homeomorphic quasiregular mappings. In particular, we study
(topologically) closed quasiregular mappings originating from the work of J.
V\"ais\"al\"a and M. Vuorinen in 1970's. Such mappings need not be one-to-one
but they still share many properties of quasiconformal mappings. The global
behavior of closed quasiregular mappings is similar to the local behavior of
quasiregular mappings restricted to a so-called normal domain.
