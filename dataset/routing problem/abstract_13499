Although the history of informatics is recent, this field poses unusual
problems with respect to its preservation. These problems are amplified by
legal issues, digital law being in itself a subject matter whose history is
also worth presenting in a computer science museum. The purpose of this paper
is to present a quick overview of the evolution of law regarding digital
matters, from an historical perspective as well as with respect to the
preservation and presentation of the works.
