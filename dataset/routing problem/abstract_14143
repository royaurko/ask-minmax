A nonlinear Poisson--Boltzmann equation with transmission boundary conditions
at the interface between two materials is investigated. The model describes the
electrostatic potential generated by a vector of ion concentrations in a
periodic multiphase medium with dilute solid particles.
  The key issue is that the interfacial transfer allows jumps and thus
discontinuous solutions of the problem. Based on variational techniques, we
derive the homogenisation of the discontinuous problem subject to inhomogeneous
transmission interface conditions. Moreover, we establish a rigorous residual
error estimate up to the first order correction.
