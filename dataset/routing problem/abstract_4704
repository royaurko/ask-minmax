The first nontrivial eigenfunction of the Neumann eigenvalue problem for the
$p$-Laplacian, suitable normalized, converges as $p$ goes to $\infty$ to a
viscosity solution of an eigenvalue problem for the $\infty$-Laplacian. We show
among other things that the limit of the eigenvalue, at least for convex sets,
is in fact the first nonzero eigenvalue of the limiting problem. We then derive
a number of consequences, which are nonlinear analogues of well-known
inequalities for the linear (2-)Laplacian.
