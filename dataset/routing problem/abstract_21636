In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem of a time-dependent
drift-diffusion-Poisson system for semiconductors. Existence and uniqueness of
global weak solutions are proven for the system with a higher-order nonlinear
recombination-generation rate R. We also show that the global weak solution
will converge to a unique equilibrium as time tends to infinity.
