A formalism is presented to obtain closed evolution equations for asymptotic
probability distribution functions of turbulence magnitudes. The formalism is
derived for a generic evolution equation, so that the final result can be
easily applied to rather general problems. Although the approximation involved
cannot be ascertained a priori, we show that application of the formalism to
well known problems gives the correct results.
