A classical problem in Software Engineering is how to certify that every
system requirement is correctly implemented by source code. This problem,
albeit well studied, can still be considered an open one, given the problems
faced by software development organizations. Trying to solve this problem,
Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a specification technique that
automatically certifies that all functional requirements are treated properly
by source code, through the connection of the textual description of these
requirements to automated tests. However, in some areas, such as Enterprise
Information Systems, requirements are identified by Business Process Modeling -
which uses graphical notations of the underlying business processes. Therefore,
the aim of this paper is to present Business Language Driven Development
(BLDD), a method that aims to extend BDD, by connecting business process models
directly to source code, while keeping the expressiveness of text descriptions
when they are better fitted than graphical artifacts.
