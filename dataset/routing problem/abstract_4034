The synchronization problem is investigated for the class of locally strongly
transitive automata introduced in a previous work of the contributors. Some
extensions of this problem related to the notions of stable set and word of
minimal rank of an automaton are studied. An application to synchronizing
colorings of aperiodic graphs with a Hamiltonian path is also considered.
