The problem of finding perfect Euler cuboids or proving their non-existence
is an old unsolved problem in mathematics. The second cuboid conjecture is one
of the three propositions suggested as intermediate stages in proving the
non-existence of perfect Euler cuboids. It is associated with a certain
polynomial Diophantine equation of the order 10. In this paper a structural
theorem for the solutions of this Diophantine equation is proved and some
examples of its application are considered.
