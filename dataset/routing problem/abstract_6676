We study a class of one-dimensional interacting particle systems with random
boundaries as a microscopic model for Stefan's melting and freezing problem. We
prove that under diffusive rescaling these particle systems exhibit a
hydrodynamic behavior described by the solution of a Cauchy--Stefan problem.
