We show the appearance of multifractal wave functions on a one-dimensional
quasiperiodic system that has a monofractal energy spectrum. Using the Mantica
technique, we construct the model as an inverse problem from the energy
spectrum of a pure Cantor set. A relation between the critical state and the
information dimension is proved and it is applied to the finite-size
multifractal analysis.
