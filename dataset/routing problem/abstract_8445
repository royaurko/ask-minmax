In this work we consider a system of k non-linear elliptic equations where
the non-linear term is the sum of a quadratic form and a sub-critic term. We
show that under suitable assumptions, e.g. when the non-linear term has a zero
with non-zero coordinates, we can find a infinitely many solution of the
eigenvalue problem with radial symmetry. Such problem arises when we search
multiple standing-waves for a non-linear wave system.
