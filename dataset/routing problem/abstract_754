It has been revealed in the literature that pure multipoint relaying (MPR)
algorithms demonstrate both simplicity and outstanding performance, as compared
to other flooding algorithms in wireless networks. One drawback of pure MPR
algorithms is that the selected forwarding set may not represent the optimum
selection. In addition, little efforts have been carried-out to investigate the
performance of such algorithms in noisy mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs)
suffering from high packet-loss and node mobility. In this paper, we develop
and evaluate the performance of an optimal MPR (OMPR) algorithm for route
discovery in noisy MANETs. The main feature of this new algorithm is that it
calculates all possible sets of multipoint relays (MPRs) and then selects the
set with minimum number of nodes. The algorithm demonstrates an excellent
performance when it is compared with other route discovery algorithms as it
achieves the highest cost-effective reachability.
