Synthesis routes of novel piperidine-containing diacetylene are presented.
The new molecules are expected to exhibit plant growth stimulation properties.
In particular, the yield in a situation of drought is expected to increase. The
synthesis makes use of the Favorskii reaction between cycloketones/piperidone
and triple-bond containing glycols. The geometries of the obtained molecules
were determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The electronic
structure and geometries of the molecules were studied theoretically using
first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The
calculated geometries agree very well with the experimentally measured ones,
and also allow us to determine bond lengths, angles and charge distributions
inside the molecules. The stability of the OH-radicals located close to the
triple bond and the piperidine/cyclohexane rings was proven by both
experimental and theoretical analyses. The HOMO/LUMO analysis was done in order
to characterize the electron density of the molecule. The calculations show
that triple bond does not participate in intermolecular reactions which
excludes the instability of novel materials as a reason for low production
rate.
