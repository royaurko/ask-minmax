We study a question posed by Stephen Simons in his 2008 monograph involving
"bigger conjugate" (BC) functions and the partial infimal convolution. As
Simons demonstrated in his monograph, these function have been crucial to the
understanding and advancement of the state-of-the-art of harder problems in
monotone operator theory, especially the sum problem.
  In this paper, we provide some tools for further analysis of BC--functions
which allow us to answer Simons' problem in the negative. We are also able to
refute a similar but much harder conjecture which would have generalized a
classical result of Br\'ezis, Crandall and Pazy. Our work also reinforces the
importance of understanding unbounded skew linear relations to construct
monotone operators with unexpected properties.
