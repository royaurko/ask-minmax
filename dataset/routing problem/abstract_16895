In the first part of the paper boundary-value problems are considered under
weak assumptions on the smoothness of the domains. We assume nothing about
smoothness of the boundary $\partial D$ of a bounded domain $D$ when the
homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition is imposed; we assume boundedness of
the embedding $i_{1}:H^{1}(D)\to L^{2}(D)$ when the Neumann boundary condition
is imposed; we assume boundedness of the embeddings $i_{1}$ and of
$i_{2}:H^{1}(D)\to L^{2}(\partial D)$ when the Robin boundary condition is
imposed, and, if, in addition, $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ are compact, then the
boundary-value problems with the spectral parameter are of Fredholm type.
  Several examples of the classes of rough domains for which the embedding
$i_2$ is compact are given. Applications to scattering by rough obstacles are
mentioned.
