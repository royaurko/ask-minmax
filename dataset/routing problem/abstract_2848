A general method for solving nonlinear ill-posed problems is developed. The
method consists of solving a Cauchy problem with a regularized operator and
proving that the solution of this problem tends, as time grows, to a solution
of the original nonlinear stationary problem. Examples of applications of the
general method are given. Convergence theorems are proved.
