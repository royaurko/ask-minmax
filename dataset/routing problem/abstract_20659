It is pointed out that the Casimir energy in a medium can be obtained most
directly from the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic field because of its
reduced propagation velocity. This brings to the fore again the old problem
related to how the principle of relativity is combined with the Maxwell field
equations in a continuous medium.
