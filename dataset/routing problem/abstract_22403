The initial value problem for some coupled nonlinear Schrodinger system with
unbounded potential is investigated. In the defocusing case, global
well-posedness is obtained. For the focusing sign, existence of global and non
global solutions is discussed via potential well method. Moreover, existence of
ground state and instability of standing waves are proved.
