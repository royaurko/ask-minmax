A {\em parametric weighted graph} is a graph whose edges are labeled with
continuous real functions of a single common variable. For any instantiation of
the variable, one obtains a standard edge-weighted graph. Parametric weighted
graph problems are generalizations of weighted graph problems, and arise in
various natural scenarios. Parametric weighted graph algorithms consist of two
phases. A {\em preprocessing phase} whose input is a parametric weighted graph,
and whose output is a data structure, the advice, that is later used by the
{\em instantiation phase}, where a specific value for the variable is given.
The instantiation phase outputs the solution to the (standard) weighted graph
problem that arises from the instantiation. The goal is to have the running
time of the instantiation phase supersede the running time of any algorithm
that solves the weighted graph problem from scratch, by taking advantage of the
advice.
  In this paper we construct several parametric algorithms for the shortest
path problem. For the case of linear function weights we present an algorithm
for the single source shortest path problem.
