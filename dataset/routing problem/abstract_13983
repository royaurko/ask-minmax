Due to the requirements of high positioning accuracy, small swing angle,
short transportation time, and high safety, both motion and stabilization
control for an gantry crane system becomes an interesting issue in the field of
control technology development. In this paper, dynamic model of gantry crane is
extracted using Lagrange method. This model has been linearized and weaknesses
of state feedback control of this model is reviewed. To solve these problems,
state feedback gain matrix is calculated using LQR method and results are fully
investigated. Finally, a full nonlinear solution of problem using feedback
linearization method is implemented and results are compared with previous
works.
