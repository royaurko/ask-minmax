We discuss an eigenvalue problem which arises in the studies of asymptotic
stability of a self-similar attractor in the sigma model. This problem is
rather unusual from the viewpoint of the spectral theory of linear operators
and requires special methods to solve it. One of such methods based on
continued fractions is presented in detail and applied to determine the
eigenvalues.
