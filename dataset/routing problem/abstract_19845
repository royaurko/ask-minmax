We show that there is a double counting in the standard model of $n\bar{n}$
mixing in the medium, resulting in full cancellation of leading terms. The
direct calculation of $n\bar{n}$ transition, annihilation is performed. For
lower limit on the free-space $n\bar{n}$ oscillation time we get $\tau_{min}
\sim 10^{31}y$.
