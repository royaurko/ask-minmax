A time-dependent projection technique is used to treat the initial-value
problem for self-interacting fermionic fields. On the basis of the general
dynamics of the fields, we derive formal equations of kinetic type for the set
of one-body dynamical variables. A nonperturbative mean-field expansion can be
written for these equations. We treat this expansion in lowest order, which
corresponds to the Gaussian mean-field approximation, for a uniform system
described by the Chiral Gross-Neveu Hamiltonian. Standard stationary features
of the model, such as dynamical mass generation due to chiral symmetry breaking
and a phenomenon analogous to dimensional transmutation, are reobtained in this
context. The mean-field time evolution of non-equilibrium initial states is
discussed.
