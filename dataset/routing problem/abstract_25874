We present PetIGA, a code framework to approximate the solution of partial
differential equations using isogeometric analysis. PetIGA can be used to
assemble matrices and vectors which come from a Galerkin weak form, discretized
with Non-Uniform Rational B-spline basis functions. We base our framework on
PETSc, a high-performance library for the scalable solution of partial
differential equations, which simplifies the development of large-scale
scientific codes, provides a rich environment for prototyping, and separates
parallelism from algorithm choice. We describe the implementation of PetIGA,
and exemplify its use by solving a model nonlinear problem. To illustrate the
robustness and flexibility of PetIGA, we solve some challenging nonlinear
partial differential equations that include problems in both solid and fluid
mechanics. We show strong scaling results on up to 4096 cores, which confirm
the suitability of PetIGA for large scale simulations.
