The Einstein/Maxwell equations reduce in the stationary and axially symmetric
case to a harmonic map with prescribed singularities phi: R^3\Sigma -> H^2_C,
where Sigma is a subset of the axis of symmetry, and H^2_C is the complex
hyperbolic plane. Motivated by this problem, we prove the existence and
uniqueness of harmonic maps with prescribed singularities phi: R^n\Sigma -> H,
where Sigma is a submanifold of R^n of co-dimension at least 2, and H is a
classical Riemannian globally symmetric space of noncompact type and rank one.
This result, when applied to the black hole problem, yields solutions which can
be interpreted as equilibrium configurations of multiple co-axially rotating
charged black holes held apart by singular struts.
