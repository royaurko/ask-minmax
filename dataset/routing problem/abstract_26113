We investigate masses and coupling constants of mesons and nucleons within a
hard wall model of holographic QCD in a unified approach. We first examine an
appropriate form of fermionic solutions by restricting the mass coupling for
the five dimensional bulk fermions and bosons. We then derive approximated
analytic solutions for the nucleons and the corresponding masses in a small
mass coupling region. In order to treat meson and nucleon properties on the
same footing, we introduce the same infrared (IR) cut in such a way that the
meson-nucleon coupling constants, i.e., g_{pi NN} and g_{rho NN} are uniquely
determined. The first order approximation with respect to a dimensionless
expansion parameter, which is valid in the small mass coupling region,
explicitly shows difficulties to avoid the IR scale problem of the hard wall
model. We discuss possible ways of circumventing these problems.
