Evolution of extended data is considered in various flow problems, using
Nambu brackets as a tool applicable to all cases. Extra dimensions, N-brackets,
and extended structures are first employed to linearize the Euler equations.
N-bracket induced evolutions of strings, membranes, and other d-branes are then
discussed in detail.
