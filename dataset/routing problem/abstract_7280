The computation of the winning set for one-pair Streett objectives and for
k-pair Streett objectives in (standard) graphs as well as in game graphs are
central problems in computer-aided verification, with application to the
verification of open systems, checking interface compatibility, well-formedness
of specifications, the synthesis of systems from specifications, and the
synthesis of reactive systems. We give faster algorithms for the computation of
the winning set for (1) one-pair Streett objectives (aka parity-3 problem) in
game graphs and (2) for k-pair Streett objectives in graphs. For both problems
this represents the first improvement in asymptotic running time in 15 years.
