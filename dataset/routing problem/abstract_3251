We consider the problem of impulse control minimax in finite horizon, when
cost functions $(C(t,x,\xi)>0)$. We show existence of value function of the
problem. Moreover, the value function is characterized as the unique viscosity
solution of an Isaacs quasi-variational inequality. This problem is in relation
with an application in mathematical finance.
