The general problem of two-phase transport in phase-field models is analyzed:
the flux of a conserved quantity is driven by the gradient of a potential
through a medium that consists of domains of two distinct phases which are
separated by diffuse interfaces. It is shown that the finite thickness of the
interfaces induces two effects that are not present in the analogous
sharp-interface problem: a surface excess current and a potential jump at the
interfaces. It is shown that both effects can be eliminated simultaneously only
if the coefficient of proportionality between flux and potential gradient
(mobility) is allowed to become a tensor in the interfaces. This opens the
possibility for precise and efficient simulations of transport problems with
finite interface thickness.
