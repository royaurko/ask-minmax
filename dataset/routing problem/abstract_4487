We derive a posteriori error bounds for a quasilinear parabolic problem,
which is approximated by the $hp$-version interior penalty discontinuous
Galerkin method (IPDG). The error is measured in the energy norm. The theory is
developed for the semidiscrete case for simplicity, allowing to focus on the
challenges of a posteriori error control of IPDG space-discretizations of
strictly monotone quasilinear parabolic problems. The a posteriori bounds are
derived using the elliptic reconstruction framework, utilizing available a
posteriori error bounds for the corresponding steady-state elliptic problem.
