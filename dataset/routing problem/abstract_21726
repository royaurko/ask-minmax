Comparison of numerical performances of two methods for coefficient inverse
problems is described. The first one is the classical Gel'fand-Levitan-Krein
equation method, and the second one is the recently developed approximately
globally convergent numerical method. This comparison is performed for both
computationally simulated and experimental data.
