We describe a newly developed cosmological hydrodynamics code based on the
weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes for hyperbolic conservation
laws. High order finite difference WENO schemes are designed for problems with
piecewise smooth solutions containing discontinuities, and have been successful
in applications for problems involving both shocks and complicated smooth
solution structures. We couple hydrodynamics based on the WENO scheme with
standard Poisson solver - particle-mesh (PM) algorithm for evolving the
self-gravitating system. A third order total variation diminishing (TVD)
Runge-Kutta scheme has been used for time-integration of the system. We brief
the implementation of numerical technique. The cosmological applications in
simulating intergalactic medium and Ly$\alpha$ forest in the CDM scenario are
also presented.
