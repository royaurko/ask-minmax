The present status of theoretical and experimental studies of muon capture
reactions on light nuclei is reviewed. In particular, the recent results for
the two reactions 2H(\mu^-,\nu_\mu)nn and 3He(\mu^-,\nu_\mu)3H are presented,
and the unresolved discrepancies among different measurements and calculations,
open problems, and future developments are discussed.
