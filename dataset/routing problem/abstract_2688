The superconducting and ground state samples of PrFeAsO0.8F0.2 and PrFeAsO
have been synthesised via easy and versatile single step solid state reaction
route. X-ray & Reitveld refine parameters of the synthesised samples are in
good agreement to the earlier reported value of the structure. The ground state
of the pristine compound (PrFeAsO) exhibited a metallic like step in
resistivity below 150K followed by another step at 12K. The former is
associated with the spin density wave (SDW) like ordering of Fe spins and later
to the anomalous magnetic ordering for Pr moments. Both the resistivity
anomalies are absent in case of superconducting PrFeAsO0.8F0.2 sample. Detailed
high field (up to 12Tesla) electrical and magnetization measurements are
carried out for superconducting PrFeAsO0.8F0.2 sample. The PrFeAsO0.8F0.2
exhibited superconducting onset (Tconset) at around 47K with Tc({\rho} =0) at
38K. Though the Tconset remains nearly invariant, the Tc({\rho} =0) is
decreased with applied field, and the same is around 23K under applied field of
12Tesla. The upper critical field (Hc2) is estimated from the Ginzburg Landau
equation (GL) fitting, which is found to be ~ 182Tesla. Critical current
density (Jc) being calculated from high field isothermal magnetization (MH)
loops with the help of Beans critical state model, is found to be of the order
of 103 A/cm2. Summarily, the superconductivity characterization of single step
synthesised PrFeAsO0.8F0.2 superconductor is presented.
