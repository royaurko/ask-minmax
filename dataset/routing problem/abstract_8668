We consider the Dirichlet problem for semilinear elliptic equations on a
bounded domain which is diffeomorphic to a ball and investigate bifurcation
from a given (trivial) branch of solutions, where the radius of the ball serves
as bifurcation parameter. Our methods are based on well known results from
variational bifurcation theory, which we outline in a separate section for the
readers' convenience.
