The following is the very first set of the series in 'Problems and Solutions
in a Graduate Course in Classical Electrodynamics'. In each of the sets of the
problems we intend to follow a theme, which not only makes it unique but also
deals with the investigation of a certain class of problems in a thorough and
rigorous manner. Figures are not included.
