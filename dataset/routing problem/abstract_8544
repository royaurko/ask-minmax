We show that a problem on minimal periods of solutions of Lipschitz
functional differential equations is closely related to the unique solvability
of the periodic problem for linear functional differential equations. Sharp
bounds for minimal periods of non-constant solutions of higher order functional
differential equations with different Lipschitz nonlinearities are obtained.
