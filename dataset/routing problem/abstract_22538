We address the classical problem of star accretion onto a supermassive
central gaseous object in a galactic nucleus. The resulting supermassive
central gas-star object is assumed to be located at the centre of a dense
stellar system for which we use a simplified model consisting of a Plummer
model with an embedded density cusp using stellar point masses. From the number
of stars belonging to the loss-cone, which plunge onto the central object on
elongated orbits from outside, we estimate the accretion rate taking into
account a possible anisotropy of the surrounding stellar distribution. The
total heating rate in the supermassive star due to the loss-cone stars plunging
onto it is estimated. This semi-analytical study, revisiting and expanding
classical paper's work, is a starting point of future work on a more detailed
study of early evolutionary phases of galactic nuclei.
 It merits closer examination, because it is one of the key features for the
link between cosmology and galaxy formation.
