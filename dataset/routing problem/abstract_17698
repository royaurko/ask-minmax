We consider the two-dimensional water wave problem in the case where the free
interface of the fluid meets a vertical wall at a possibly non-right angle; our
problem also covers interfaces with angled crests. We assume that the fluid is
inviscid, incompressible, and irrotational, with no surface tension and with
air density zero. We construct a low-regularity energy and prove a closed
energy estimate for this problem. Our work differs from earlier work in that,
in our case, only a degenerate Taylor stability criterion holds, with
$-\frac{\partial P}{\partial {\bf n}} \ge 0$, instead of the strong Taylor
stability criterion $-\frac{\partial P}{\partial {\bf n}} \ge c > 0$.
