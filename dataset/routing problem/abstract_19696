A critical presentation of Rovelli's ``evolving constants of motion'' is
given. Previous criticisms by Kucha\v{r} concerning the role of factor ordering
and the non-existence of observables are dealt with and shown to be unfounded.
Kucha\v{r}'s criticisms that this approach does not solve the global, multiple
choice or Hilbert space problems of time are confirmed, and new insight into
why this is so is obtained.
