Minkowski's question mark function is strictly increasing on $[0, 1]$ and
hence defines a Stieltjes measure on $[0, 1]$. A problem originating from Salem
in 1943, is to determine whether the Fourier series of this measure decay to
zero or not. The purpose of this note is to mention that a recent result by
Jordan and Sahlsten implies that the Fourier transform decays to zero with a
polynomial speed.
