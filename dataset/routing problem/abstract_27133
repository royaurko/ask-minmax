Time-of-flight cameras provide depth information, which is complementary to
the photometric appearance of the scene in ordinary images. It is desirable to
merge the depth and colour information, in order to obtain a coherent scene
representation. However, the individual cameras will have different viewpoints,
resolutions and fields of view, which means that they must be mutually
calibrated. This paper presents a geometric framework for this multi-view and
multi-modal calibration problem. It is shown that three-dimensional projective
transformations can be used to align depth and parallax-based representations
of the scene, with or without Euclidean reconstruction. A new evaluation
procedure is also developed; this allows the reprojection error to be
decomposed into calibration and sensor-dependent components. The complete
approach is demonstrated on a network of three time-of-flight and six colour
cameras. The applications of such a system, to a range of automatic
scene-interpretation problems, are discussed.
