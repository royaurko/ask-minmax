This paper proposes a geometric solution to the problem of prime
decomposability of concurrent processes first explored by R. Milner and F.
Moller in [MM93]. Concurrent programs are given a geometric semantics using
cubical areas, for which a unique factorization theorem is proved. An effective
factorization method which is correct and complete with respect to the
geometric semantics is derived from the factorization theorem. This algorithm
is implemented in the static analyzer ALCOOL.
