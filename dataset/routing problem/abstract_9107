We consider the multi-channel inverse scattering problem in one-dimension in
the presence of thresholds and bound states for a potential of finite support.
Utilizing the Levin representation, we derive the general Marchenko integral
equation for N-coupled channels and show that, unlike to the case of the radial
inverse scattering problem, the information on the bound state energies and
asymptotic normalization constants can be inferred from the reflection
coefficient matrix alone. Thus, given this matrix, the Marchenko inverse
scattering procedure can provide us with a unique multi-channel potential. The
relationship to supersymmetric partner potentials as well as possible
applications are discussed. The integral equation has been implemented
numerically and applied to several schematic examples showing the
characteristic features of multi-channel systems. A possible application of the
formalism to technological problems is briefly discussed.
