Lattice QCD studies on charmonium at finite temperature are presented After a
discussion about problems for the Maximum Entropy Method applied to finite
temperature lattice QCD, I show several results on charmonium spectral
functions. The ``wave function'' of charmonium is also discussed to study the
spatial correlation between quark and anti-quark in deconfinement phase.
