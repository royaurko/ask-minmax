Three problems are considered in which inhomogeneous broadening can yield
unusual consequences. One problem involves the energy levels of atoms moving
within nanopores of nearly cylindrical cross section. A second involves atomic
or molecular motion in a quasi-one dimensional interstitial channel within a
bundle of carbon nanotubes. The third problem involves motion within a groove
between two nanotubes at the surface of such a bundle. In each case, the
density of states at low energy is qualitatively different from that occurring
in the perfectly homogeneous case.
