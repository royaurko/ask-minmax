When verifying a sophisticated numerical code, it is a usual practice to
compare the results with reliable solutions obtained by other means. This work
provides such solutions for the wavelength dependent dust radiative transfer
problem. We define a set of benchmark problems in spherical geometry and solve
them by three radiative transfer codes which implement different numerical
schemes. Results for the dust temperature and emerging spectra agree to better
than 0.1%, and can be used as benchmark solutions for the verification of the
dust radiative transfer codes.
