For finite dimensional CMV matrices the mixed inverse spectral problem of
reconstruction the matrix by its submatrix and a part of its spectrum is
considered. A general rational interpolation problem which arises in solving
the mixed inverse spectral problem is studied, and the description of the space
of its solutions is given. We apply the developed technique to give sufficient
conditions for the uniqueness of the solution of the mixed inverse spectral
problem.
