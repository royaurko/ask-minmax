A fully-asynchronous network with one target sensor and a few anchors (nodes
with known locations) is considered. Localization and synchronization are
traditionally treated as two separate problems. In this paper, localization and
synchronization is studied under a unified framework. We present a new model in
which time-stamps obtained either via two-way communication between the nodes
or with a broadcast based protocol can be used in a simple estimator based on
least-squares (LS) to jointly estimate the position of the target node as well
as all the unknown clock-skews and clock-offsets. The Cram\'er-Rao lower bound
(CRLB) is derived for the considered problem and is used as a benchmark to
analyze the performance of the proposed estimator.
