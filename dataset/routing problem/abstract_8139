We sharply characterize the performance of different penalization schemes for
the problem of selecting the relevant variables in the multi-task setting.
Previous work focuses on the regression problem where conditions on the design
matrix complicate the analysis. A clearer and simpler picture emerges by
studying the Normal means model. This model, often used in the field of
statistics, is a simplified model that provides a laboratory for studying
complex procedures.
