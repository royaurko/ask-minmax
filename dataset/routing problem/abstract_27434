A Flux Coordinate Independent (FCI) approach for anisotropic systems, not
based on magnetic flux coordinates has been introduced in [F. Hariri and M.
Ottaviani, Comput. Phys. Commun., 184,2419 (2013)]. In this paper, we show that
the approach can tackle magnetic configurations including X-points. Using the
code FENICIA, an equilibrium with a magnetic island has been used to show the
robustness of the FCI approach to cases in which a magnetic separatrix is
present in the system, either by design or as a consequence of instabilities.
Numerical results are in good agreement with the analytic solutions of the
sound-wave propagation problem. Conservation properties are veri?ed. Finally,
the critical gain of the FCI approach in situations including the magnetic
separatrix with an X-point is demonstrated by a fast convergence of the code
with the numerical resolution in the direction of symmetry. The results
highlighted in this paper show that the FCI approach should be able to address
turbulent transport problems in X-point geometries.
