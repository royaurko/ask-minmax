In this paper, we propose a procedure for designing controlled test problems
for single-objective bilevel optimization. The construction procedure is
flexible and allows its user to control the different complexities that are to
be included in the test problems independently of each other. In addition to
properties that control the difficulty in convergence, the procedure also
allows the user to introduce difficulties caused by interaction of the two
levels. As a companion to the test problem construction framework, the paper
presents a standard test suite of twelve problems, which includes eight
unconstrained and four constrained problems. Most of the problems are scalable
in terms of variables and constraints. To provide baseline results, we have
solved the proposed test problems using a nested bilevel evolutionary
algorithm. The results can be used for comparison, while evaluating the
performance of any other bilevel optimization algorithm. The codes related to
