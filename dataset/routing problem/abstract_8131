We consider the spectral problem associated with the Klein-Gordon equation
for unbounded electric potentials. If the spectrum of this problem is contained
in two disjoint real intervals and the two inner boundary points are
eigenvalues, we show that these extremal eigenvalues are simple and possess
strictly positive eigenfunctions. Examples of electric potentials satisfying
these assumptions are given.
