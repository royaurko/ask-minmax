We prove that a group has word problem that is a growing context-sensitive
language precisely if its word problem can be solved using a non-deterministic
Cannon's algorithm (the deterministic algorithms being defined by Goodman and
Shapiro). We generalise their results to find many examples of groups not
admitting non-deterministic Cannon's algorithms. This adds to the examples of
Kambites and Otto of groups separating context-sensitive and growing
context-sensitive word problems, and provides a new language-theoretic
separation result.
