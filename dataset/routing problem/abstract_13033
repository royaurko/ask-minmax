We study the uniqueness problem of $\sigma$-regular solution of the equation,
$$-\Delta_p u+ \abs u^{q-1}u =h \quad on\quad \RN, $$ where $q>p-1>0.$ and $N>
p.$ Other coercive type equations associated to more general differential
operators are also investigated. Our uniqueness results hold for equations
associated to the mean curvature type operators as well as for more general
quasilinear subelliptic operators.
