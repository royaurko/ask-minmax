In this contribution, we consider the problem of the blind separation of
noisy instantaneously mixed images. The images are modelized by hidden Markov
fields with unknown parameters. Given the observed images, we give a Bayesian
formulation and we propose to solve the resulting data augmentation problem by
implementing a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) procedure. We separate the
unknown variables into two categories:
  1. The parameters of interest which are the mixing matrix, the noise
covariance and the parameters of the sources distributions. 2. The hidden
variables which are the unobserved sources and the unobserved pixels
classification labels.
  The proposed algorithm provides in the stationary regime samples drawn from
the posterior distributions of all the variables involved in the problem
leading to a flexibility in the cost function choice.
  We discuss and characterize some problems of non identifiability and
degeneracies of the parameters likelihood and the behavior of the MCMC
algorithm in this case.
  Finally, we show the results for both synthetic and real data to illustrate
the feasibility of the proposed solution. keywords: MCMC, blind source
