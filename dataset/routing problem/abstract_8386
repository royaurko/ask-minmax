The Bivariate Function Hard Problem (BFHP) has been in existence implicitly
in almost all number theoretic based cryptosystems. This work defines the BFHP
in a more general setting and produces an efficient asymmetric cryptosystem.
The cryptosystem has a complexity order of O(n^2) for both encryption and
decryption.
