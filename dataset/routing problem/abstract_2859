In this paper, we find the minimizer of the eigenvalue gap for the
single-well potential problem and the eigenvalue ratio for the single-barrier
density problem and symmetric single-well (single-barrier)density problem for
$p$-Laplacian. This extends the results of the classical Sturm-Liouville
problem.
