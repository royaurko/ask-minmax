The exact complexity of geometric cuts and bisections is the longstanding
open problem including even the dimension one. In this paper, we resolve this
problem for dimension one (the real line) by designing an exact polynomial time
algorithm. Our results depend on a new technique of dealing with metric
equalities and their connection to dynamic programming. The method of our
solution could be also of independent interest.
