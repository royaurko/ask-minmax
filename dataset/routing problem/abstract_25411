The variance in number and types of tasks required to be implemented within
Distributed Virtual Environments (DVE) highlights the needs for communication
protocols can achieve consistency. In addition, these applications have to
handle an increasing number of participants and deal with the difficult problem
of scalability. Moreover, the real-time requirements of these applications make
the scalability problem more difficult to solve. In this paper, we have
implemented Updatable Queue Abstraction protocol (UQA) on TCP (TCP-UQA) and
compared it with original TCP, UDP, and Updatable Queue Abstraction based on
UDP (UDP-UQA) protocols. Results showed that TCP-UQA was the best in queue
management.
