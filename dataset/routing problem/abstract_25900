We study the problem of finding a minimal graph with prescribed boundary data
in arbitrary dimension and codimension. Existence, uniqueness, stability and
regularity are treated. We first present the well-known results for codimension
one: Jenkins-Serrin's existence theorem, convexity properties of the area which
give uniqueness and stability and De Giorgi's theorem for regularity. In higher
codimension we first discuss the counterexamples of Lawson and Osserman. Then
we present the recent results of Mu-Tao Wang: we use the mean curvature flow to
show existence for small boundary data and we prove a new Bernstein theorem
(also due to Mu-Tao Wang) which holds for every area-decreasing minimal graph.
We finally deduce from the Bernstein theorem that an area-decreasing minimal
graph is always smooth.
