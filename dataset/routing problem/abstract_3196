In this paper we present a novel tool to evaluate problem solving systems.
Instead of using a system to solve a problem, we suggest using the problem to
evaluate the system. By finding a numerical representation of a problem's
complexity, one can implement genetic algorithm to search for the most complex
problem the given system can solve. This allows a comparison between different
systems that solve the same set of problems. In this paper we implement this
approach on pattern recognition neural networks to try and find the most
complex pattern a given configuration can solve. The complexity of the pattern
is calculated using linguistic complexity. The results demonstrate the power of
the problem evolution approach in ranking different neural network
configurations according to their pattern recognition abilities. Future
research and implementations of this technique are also discussed.
