In this article, we are interested in the Dirichlet problem for parabolic
viscous Hamilton-Jacobi Equations. It is well-known that the gradient of the
solution may blow up in finite time on the boundary of the domain, preventing a
classical extension of the solution past this singularity. This behavior comes
from the fact that one cannot prescribe the Dirichlet boundary condition for
all time and, in order to define a solution globally in time, one has to use
"generalized boundary conditions" in the sense of viscosity solution. In this
work, we treat the case when the diffusion operator is the $p$-Laplacian where
the gradient dependence in the diffusion creates specific difficulties. In this
framework, we obtain the existence and uniqueness of a continuous, global in
time, viscosity solution. For this purpose, we prove a Strong Comparison Result
between semi-continuous viscosity sub and super-solutions. Moreover, the
asymptotic behavior of $\dfrac{u(x; t)}{t}$ is analyzed through the study of
the associated ergodic problem.
