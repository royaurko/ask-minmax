We present scalable parallel algorithms with sublinear communication volume
and low latency for several fundamental problems related to finding the most
relevant elements in a set: the classical selection problem with unsorted
input, its variant with locally sorted input, bulk parallel priority queues,
multicriteria selection using threshold algorithms, and finding the most
frequent objects. All of these algorithms push the owner-computes rule to
extremes. The output of these algorithms might unavoidably be unevenly
distributed over the processors. We therefore also explain how to redistribute
this data with minimal communication.
