With a small parameter $\epsilon$, Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) systems over a
finite one-dimensional (1D) spatial domain have steady state solutions, called
1D boundary layer solutions, which profiles form boundary layers near boundary
points and become at in the interior domain as $\epsilon$ approaches zero. For
the stability of 1D boundary layer solutions to (time-dependent) PNP systems,
we estimate the solution of the perturbed problem with global
electroneutrality. We prove that the $H^{-1}_x$ norm of the solution of the
perturbed problem decays exponentially (in time) with exponent independent of
$\epsilon$ if the coefficient of the Robin boundary condition of electrostatic
potential has a suitable positive lower bound. The main difficulty is that the
gradients of 1D boundary layer solutions at boundary points may blow up as
$\epsilon$ tends to zero. The main idea of our argument is to transform the
perturbed problem into another parabolic system with a new and useful energy
law for the proof of the exponential decay estimate.
