The Standard Model quark and neutrino mixing matrices are of independent
empirical origin, but they do suggest unification. In this paper I obtained two
united one-parameter quark and neutrino mixing matrices inferred from two
semi-empirical deviation-from-mass-degeneracy (DMD) flavor rules (quadratic
DMD-hierarchy rule and Dirac-Majorana DMD-duality rule) without use of the
common exact-flavor-symmetry suggestions for that particular unification
problem. One small empirical parameter quantitatively defines the pattern of
particle flavor physics. The main predictions are: 1) hierarchical connections
between the 2 large solar and atmospheric neutrino mixing angels, and the 2
small quark mixing angels, 2) universal sequence of 14 equality relations to
that one-empirical-parameter of the quark and neutrino mixing-matrix
parameters, CP-phases and lepton mass ratios, which are free dimensionless
constants in the Standard Model, 3) complementarity connections between doubled
large neutrino and small quark mixing angles, 4) tentative solution of the
CP-violation problem in framework of Standard Model mixing matrix phenomenology
by suggesting a universal set of two nonzero values ~58.8 and ~31.2 degrees for
Dirac and Majorana CP-violating phases.
