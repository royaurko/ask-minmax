The parabolic Anderson problem is the Cauchy problem for the heat equation
with random potential and localized initial condition. In this paper we
consider potentials which are constant in time and independent exponentially
distributed in space. We study the growth rate of the total mass of the
solution in terms of weak and almost sure limit theorems, and the spatial
spread of the mass in terms of a scaling limit theorem. The latter result shows
that in this case, just like in the case of heavy tailed potentials, the mass
gets trapped in a single relevant island with high probability.
