Given a potential $V$ and the associated Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta+V$,
we consider the problem of providing sharp upper and lower bound on the energy
of the operator. It is known that if for example $V$ or $V^{-1}$ enjoys
suitable summability properties, the problem has a positive answer. In this
paper we show that the corresponding isoperimetric-like inequalities can be
improved by means of quantitative stability estimates.
