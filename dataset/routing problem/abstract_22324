Let $\pi$ be a set of primes. We say that a finite group $G$ is a
$D_\pi$-group if all its maximal $\pi$-subgroups are conjugate. In this paper,
we give an affirmative answer to the problem 17.44(b) from "The Kourovka
notebook": we prove that in a $D_\pi$-group an overgroup of a $\pi$-Hall
subgroup is always a $D_\pi$-group.
