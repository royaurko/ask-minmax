We use the Wilf-Zeilberger method to prove identities between Mahler measures
of polynomials. In particular, we offer a new proof of a formula due to
Lal\'{i}n, and we show how to translate the identity into a formula involving
elliptic dilogarithms. This work settles a challenge problem proposed by
Kontsevich and Zagier in their paper "Periods".
