We show that the presence of a localized drive in an otherwise diffusive
system results in steady-state density and current profiles that decay
algebraically to their global average value, away from the drive in two or
higher dimensions. An analogy to an electrostatic problem is established,
whereby the density profile induced by a driving bond maps onto the
electrostatic potential due to an electric dipole located along the bond. The
dipole strength is proportional to the drive, and is determined
self-consistently by solving the electrostatic problem. The profile resulting
from a localized configuration of more than one driving bond can be
straightforwardly determined by the superposition principle of electrostatics.
This picture is shown to hold even in the presence of exclusion interaction
between particles.
