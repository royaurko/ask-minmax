The density matrix positivity is a natural counterpart of unitarity. The
resulting constraints for various parton distribution and correlations are
considered. Their compatibility with leading order QCD evolution is guaranteed
by the probabilistic interpretation of the latter. In the case of non-forward
distributions the positivity constraints naturally imply the symmetric form of
the evolution equation.
