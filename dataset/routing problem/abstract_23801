The study of solutions with fixed energy of certain classes of Lagrangian (or
Hamiltonian) systems is reduced, via the classical Maupertuis--Jacobi
variational principle, to the study of geodesics in Riemannian manifolds. We
are interested in investigating the problem of existence of brake orbits and
homoclinic orbits, in which case the Maupertuis--Jacobi principle produces a
Riemannian manifold with boundary and with metric degenerating in a non trivial
way on the boundary. In this paper we use the classical Maupertuis--Jacobi
principle to show how to remove the degeneration of the metric on the boundary,
and we prove in full generality how the brake orbit and the homoclinic orbit
multiplicity problem can be reduced to the study of multiplicity of orthogonal
geodesic chords in a manifold with {\em regular} and {\em strongly concave}
boundary.
