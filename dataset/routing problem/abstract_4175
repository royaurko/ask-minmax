Deciding whether an ideal of a number field is principal and finding a
generator is a fundamental problem with many applications in computational
number theory. For indefinite quaternion algebras, the decision problem reduces
to that in the underlying number field. Finding a generator is hard, and we
present a heuristically subexponential algorithm.
