We present a non-perturbative approach to the problem of quasiparticles
coupled to spin-fluctuations. If the fully dressed spin-fluctuation propagator
is used in the Feynman graph expansion of the single-particle Green's function,
the problem of summing all spin-fluctuation exchange graphs (i.e without
virtual fermion loops) can be cast as a functional integral over gaussian
distributed random vector fields. A Monte Carlo sampling of this functional
integral does not suffer from the 'fermion sign problem' and offers an
attractive alternative to perturbative calculations. We compare the results of
our computer simulations with perturbation theory and self-consistent one-loop
calculations.
