We perform the a posteriori error analysis of residual type of a transmission
problem with sign changing coefficients. According to [6] if the contrast is
large enough, the continuous problem can be transformed into a coercive one. We
further show that a similar property holds for the discrete problem for any
regular meshes, extending the framework from [6]. The reliability and
efficiency of the proposed estimator is confirmed by some numerical tests.
