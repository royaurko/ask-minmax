Complex bands $\vec{k}^{\perp}(E)$ in a semiconductor crystal, along a
general direction $\vec{n}$, can be computed by casting Schr\"odinger's
equation as a generalized polynomial eigenvalue problem. When working with
primitive lattice vectors, the order of this eigenvalue problem can grow large
for arbitrary $\vec{n}$. It is however possible to always choose a set of
non-primitive lattice vectors such that the eigenvalue problem is restricted to
be quadratic. The complex bands so obtained need to be unfolded onto the
primitive Brillouin zone. In this paper, we present a unified method to unfold
real and complex bands. Our method ensures that the measure associated with the
projections of the non-primary wavefunction onto all candidate primary
wavefunctions is invariant with respect to the energy $E$.
