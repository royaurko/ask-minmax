Highly accurate numerical solutions to the problem of Black Holes surrounded
by uniformly rotating rings in axially symmetric, stationary spacetimes are
presented. The numerical methods developed to handle the problem are discussed
in some detail. Related Newtonian problems are described and numerical results
provided, which show that configurations can reach an inner mass-shedding limit
as the mass of the central object increases. Exemplary results for the full
relativistic problem for rings of constant density are given and the
deformation of the event horizon due to the presence of the ring is
demonstrated. Finally, we provide an example of a system for which the angular
momentum of the central Black Hole divided by the square of its mass exceeds
one.
