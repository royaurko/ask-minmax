We prove the existence of some types of periodic orbits for a particle moving
in Euclidean three-space under the influence of the gravitational force induced
by a fixed homogeneous circle. These types include periodic orbits very far and
very near the homogeneous circle, as well as eight and spiral periodic orbits.
