The singularity space consists of all germs $(X,x)$, with $X$ a Noetherian
scheme and $x$ a point, where we identify two such germs if they become the
same after an analytic extension of scalars.
  This is a Polish space for the metric given by the order to which
infinitesimal neighborhoods, or jets, agree after base change. In other words,
the classification of singularities up to analytic extensions of scalars is a
smooth problem in the sense of descriptive set-theory. Over $\mathbb C$, the
following two classification problems up to isomorphism are now smooth: (i)
analytic germs; and (ii) polarized schemes.
