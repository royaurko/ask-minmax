The stellar population synthesis in unresolved composite objects is a very
tricky problem. Indeed, it is a degenerate problem since many parameters affect
the observables. The stellar population synthesis issue thus deserves a deep
and rigourous analysis. In this paper we present a method of inversion which
uses as observables the intensities at each pixel of a galactic spectrum and
provides the stellar contribution to luminosity of all stars considered in a
database. The main contribution of this paper to the synthesis problem is that
it provides an analytical computation of the uncertainties accompanying a
solution. This constitutes an important improvement relative to previous
methods which do not provide such infomation except in the method described by
Pelat (1997) and Moultaka & Pelat (2000). The latter uses the equivalent widths
and intensities of stellar spectra in order to reproduce the equivalent widths
of a galactic spectrum. The novelty of this work relative to the previous one
is that the dust emission present in the IR spectra can be modeled as well as
the velocity dispersion of stars that broadens the lines of a galactic
spectrum. Tests are also performed in order to estimate the reliability of the
method and the influence on the results of an additive continuum present in a
studied spectrum, for example in the case of AGNs.
