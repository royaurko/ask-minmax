We solve the inverse spectral problem of recovering the singular potentials
$q\in W^{-1}_{2}(0,1)$ of Sturm-Liouville operators by two spectra. The
reconstruction algorithm is presented and necessary and sufficient conditions
on two sequences to be spectral data for Sturm-Liouville operators under
consideration are given.
