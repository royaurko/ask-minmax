We present a Chebyshev collocation method for linear ODE and DDE problems. We
first give a posteriori estimates for the accuracy of the approximate solution
of a scalar ODE initial value problem. Examples of the success of the estimate
are given. For linear, periodic DDEs with integer delays we define and discuss
the monodromy operator U as our main goal is reliable estimation of the
stability of such DDEs. We prove a theorem which gives a posteriori estimates
for eigenvalues of U, our main result. This result is based on a generalization
to operators on Hilbert spaces of the Bauer-Fike theorem for (matrix)
eigenvalue perturbation problems. We generalize these results to systems of
DDEs. A delayed, damped Mathieu equation example is given. The computation of
good bounds on ODE fundamental solutions is an important technical issue; an a
posteriori method for such bounds is given. Certain technical issues are also
addressed, namely the evaluation of polynomials and the estimation of L^\infty
norms of analytic functions. Generalization to the non-integer delays case is
also considered.
