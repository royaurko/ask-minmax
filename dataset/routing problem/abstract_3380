The problem of finding, in an edge-weighted bidirected graph $G=(V,E)$, a
cycle with minimum mean weight of its edges generalizes similar problems for
both directed and undirected graphs. (The problem is considered in two
variants: for the cycles without repeated edges and for the cycles without
repeated nodes.) In this note we develop an algorithm to solve this problem in
$O(V^2 \min(V^2, E\log V))$-time (to compare: the complexity of an improved
version of Barahona's algorithm for undirected cycles is $O(V^4)$). Our
algorithm is based on a certain general approach to minimum mean problems and
uses, as a subroutine, Gabow's algorithm for the minimum weight 2-factor
problem in a graph. The problem admits a reformulation in terms of regular
cycles in a skew-symmetric graph.
