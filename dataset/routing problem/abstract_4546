We consider a constrained minimax single facility location problem on the
plane with rectilinear distance. The feasible set of location points is
restricted to rectangles with sides oriented at a 45 degrees angle to the axes
of Cartesian coordinates. To solve the problem, an algebraic approach based on
an extremal property of eigenvalues of irreducible matrices in idempotent
algebra is applied. A new algebraic solution is given that reduces the problem
to finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of appropriately defined matrices.
