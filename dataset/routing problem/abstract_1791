We demonstrate an eight-channel reconfigurable optical filter on a silicon
chip consisting of cascaded microring resonators and integrated compact
heaters. With an embedded Mach-Zehnder (MZ) arm coupling to a microring
resonator, the important parameters of a filter such as center frequency,
extinction ratio and bandwidth can be controlled simultaneously for purposes of
filtering, routing and spectral shaping, thus making our method potentially
useful in dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) and radio frequency
arbitrary waveform generation (RFAWG). Multichannel filter response was
successfully tuned to match the International Telecommunication Unit (ITU) grid
with 50, 100 and 200GHz in channel spacing. Programmable channel selectivity
was demonstrated by heating the MZ arm, and continuous adjustment of
through-port extinction ratio from 0dB to 27dB was achieved. Meanwhile, the 3dB
bandwidth in the drop port changed from 0.11nm to 0.15nm due to the heating.
The device had an ultra-compact footprint (1200\mu mx100\mu m) excluding the
metal leads and contact pads, making it suitable for large scale integration.
