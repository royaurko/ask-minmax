We construct a new RC phase shift network based Chua's circuit, which
exhibits a period-doubling bifurcation route to chaos. Using coupled versions
of such a phase-shift network based Chua's oscillators, we describe a new
method for achieving complete synchronization (CS), approximate lag
synchronization (LS) and approximate anticipating synchronization (AS) without
delay or parameter mismatch. Employing the Pecora and Carroll approach, chaos
synchronization is achieved in coupled chaotic oscillators, where the drive
system variables control the response system. As a result, AS or LS or CS is
demonstrated without using a variable delay line both experimentally and
numerically.
