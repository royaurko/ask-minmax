In this paper, using geometric properties of the field rotation parameters,
we present a solution of Smale's Thirteenth Problem on the maximum number of
limit cycles for Li\'{e}nard's polynomial system. We also generalize the
obtained result and present a solution of Hilbert's Sixteenth Problem on the
maximum number of limit cycles surrounding a singular point for an arbitrary
polynomial system. Besides, we consider a generalized Li\'{e}nard's cubic
system with three finite singularities, for which the developed geometric
approach can complete its global qualitative analysis: in particular, it easily
solves the problem on the maximum number of limit cycles in their different
distribution. We give also an alternative proof of the main theorem for the
generalized Li\'{e}nard's system applying the Wintner-Perko termination
principle for multiple limit cycles and discuss some other results concerning
this system.
