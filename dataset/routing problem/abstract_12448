We derive the asymptotic behavior of determinants of truncated Wiener-Hopf
operators generated by symbols having Fisher-Hartwig singularities. This task
is achieved thanks to an asymptotic resolution of the Riemann-Hilbert problem
associated to some generalized sine kernel. As a byproduct, we give yet another
derivation of the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz determinants having
Fisher-Hartwig singularities. The Riemann-Hilbert problem approach to these
asymptotics yields a systematic although quickly cumbersome way to compute
their sub-leading asymptotics.
