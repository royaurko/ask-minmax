Let G be a finite undirected graph. A vertex dominates itself and all its
neighbors in G. A vertex set D is an efficient dominating set (e.d. for short)
of G if every vertex of G is dominated by exactly one vertex of D. The
Efficient Domination (ED) problem, which asks for the existence of an e.d. in
G, is known to be NP-complete even for very restricted graph classes.
  In particular, the ED problem remains NP-complete for 2P3-free graphs and
thus for P7-free graphs. We show that the weighted version of the problem
(abbreviated WED) is solvable in polynomial time on various subclasses of
2P3-free and P7-free graphs, including (P2+P4)-free graphs, P5-free graphs and
other classes.
  Furthermore, we show that a minimum weight e.d. consisting only of vertices
of degree at most 2 (if one exists) can be found in polynomial time. This
contrasts with our NP-completeness result for the ED problem on planar
bipartite graphs with maximum degree 3.
