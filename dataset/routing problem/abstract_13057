This paper talks about that monotone circuit is P-Complete.
  Decision problem that include P-Complete is mapping that classify input with
a similar property. Therefore equivalence relation of input value is important
for computation. But monotone circuit cannot compute the equivalence relation
of the value because monotone circuit can compute only monotone function.
Therefore, I make the value constraint explicitly in the input and monotone
circuit can compute equivalence relation. As a result, we can compute
P-Complete problem with monotone circuit. We can reduce implicit value
constraint to explicit with logarithm space. Therefore, monotone circuit is
P-Complete.
