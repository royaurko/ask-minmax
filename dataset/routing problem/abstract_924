This paper presents a partial implementation of the ES-IS Routing Information
Exchange Protocol packet processing in Linux Kernel 2.6, which is for use in
conjunction with the Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP) in Aeronautical
Telecommunication Network (ATN). First, we show the data structures involved in
the protocol operation. Second, we describe the map of the packet processing
whose design has been developed in the research. Third, we explain how the
protocol is implemented as a loadable kernel module. Finally, we conclude the
implementation result based on performed tests.
