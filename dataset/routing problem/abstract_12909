We analyze collocation methods for nonlinear homogeneous Volterra-Hammerstein
integral equations with non-Lipschitz nonlinearity. We present different kinds
of existence and uniqueness of nontrivial collocation solutions and we give
conditions for such existence and uniqueness in some cases. Finally we
illustrate these methods with an example of a collocation problem, and we give
some examples of collocation problems that do not fit in the cases studied
previously.
