We introduce and compare new compression approaches for obtaining regularized
solutions of large linear systems which are commonly encountered in large scale
inverse problems. We first describe how to approximate matrix vector operations
with a large matrix through a matrix of smaller size, by borrowing from ideas
used in wavelet image compression. Next, we describe and compare approaches
based on the use of the low rank SVD factorization, which can result in further
size reductions. We show some analytical results concerning the different
methods and illustrate the application of the different approaches using a very
large linear system from a Geotomography application, where we obtain
significant compression gains with our methods, while still resolving the main
features of the solutions.
