This paper concerns with nonuniform sampling and interpolation methods
combined with variational models for the solution of a generalized image
inpainting problem and the restoration of digital signals. In particular, we
discuss the problem of reconstructing a digital signal/image from very few,
sparse, and complete information and a substantial incomplete information,
which will be assumed as the result of a nonlinear distortion. As a typical and
inspiring example, we illustrate the concrete problem of the color restoration
of a destroyed art fresco from its few known fragments and some gray picture
taken prior to the damage. Numerical implementations are included together with
several examples and numerical results to illustrate the proposed method. The
numerical experience suggests furthermore that a particular system of coupled
Hamilton-Jacobi equations is well-posed.
