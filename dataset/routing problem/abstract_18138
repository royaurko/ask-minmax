The problem of finding a point in the intersection of closed sets can be
solved by the method of alternating projections and its variants. It was shown
in earlier papers that for convex sets, the strategy of using quadratic
programming (QP) to project onto the intersection of supporting halfspaces
generated earlier by the projection process can lead to an algorithm that
converges multiple-term superlinearly. The main contributions of this paper are
to show that this strategy can be effective for super-regular sets, which are
structured nonconvex sets introduced by Lewis, Luke and Malick. Manifolds
should be approximated by hyperplanes rather than halfspaces. We prove the
linear convergence of this strategy, followed by proving that superlinear and
quadratic convergence can be obtained when the problem is similar to the
setting of the Newton method. We also show an algorithm that converges at an
arbitrarily fast linear rate if halfspaces from older iterations are used to
construct the QP.
