Initial-boundary value problems for the 2D Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation posed
on bounded rectangles and on a strip are considered. Spectral properties of a
linearized operator and critical sizes of domains are studied. Exponential
decay of regular solutions for the original nonlinear problems is proved.
