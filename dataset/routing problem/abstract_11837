The problem of localization of megalithic memorials on the Earth surface is
investigated. It is pointed on existence of Great Belt of megalithic
observatories - of con- centration of astronomically significant objects near
geographical latitude 51 grad. N. The latent fundamental (and astronomical)
sense is discussed of this phenomenon- the tendency to functional and
architectural simplisity, to simmetry of megali- thic observatories (in view of
the Symmetric Mandale. It is pointed on possibility of existence of other
stretching concentrations-of clusters of megalithic observatories (the Great
Belts) in connection with other fixed position of the Poles of the World (of
the Earth rotation) in past
