Tikhonov regularization is studied in the case of linear pseudodifferential
operator as the forward map and additive white Gaussian noise as the
measurement error. The measurement model for an unknown function u(x) is m(x) =
Au(x) + delta*epsilon(x), where delta>0 is the noise magnitude. If epsilon was
an L^2-function, Tikhonov regularization gives an estimate T_alpha(m) =
argmin_{u in H^r}{|Au-m|_{L^2}^2+ alpha*|u|_{H^r}^2} for u where
alpha=alpha(delta) is the regularization parameter. Here penalization of the
Sobolev norm |u|_{H^r} covers the cases of standard Tikhonov regularization
(r=0) and first derivative penalty (r=1). Realizations of white Gaussian noise
are almost never in L^2, but do belong to H^s with probability one if s<0 is
small enough. A modification of Tikhonov regularization theory is presented,
covering the case of white Gaussian measurement noise. Furthermore, the
convergence of regularized reconstructions to the correct solution as delta ->
0 is proven in appropriate function spaces using microlocal analysis. The
convergence of the related finite dimensional problems to the infinite
dimensional problem is also analyzed.
