We describe a novel approach to statistical learning from particles tracked
while moving in a random environment. The problem consists in inferring
properties of the environment from recorded snapshots. We consider here the
case of a fluid seeded with identical passive particles that diffuse and are
advected by a flow. Our approach rests on efficient algorithms to estimate the
weighted number of possible matchings among particles in two consecutive
snapshots, the partition function of the underlying graphical model. The
partition function is then maximized over the model parameters, namely
diffusivity and velocity gradient. A Belief Propagation (BP) scheme is the
backbone of our algorithm, providing accurate results for the flow parameters
we want to learn. The BP estimate is additionally improved by incorporating
Loop Series (LS) contributions. For the weighted matching problem, LS is
compactly expressed as a Cauchy integral, accurately estimated by a saddle
point approximation. Numerical experiments show that the quality of our
improved BP algorithm is comparable to the one of a fully polynomial randomized
approximation scheme, based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method,
while the BP-based scheme is substantially faster than the MCMC scheme.
