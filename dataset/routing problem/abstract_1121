We propose a route to all-graphene integrated electronic devices by exploring
the influence of strain on the electronic structure of graphene. We show that
strain can be easily tailored to generate electron beam collimation, 1D
channels, surface states and confinement, the basic elements for all-graphene
electronics. In addition this proposal has the advantage that patterning can be
made on substrates rather than on the graphene sheet, thereby protecting the
integrity of the latter.
