We study the problem of maximizing Betti numbers of simplicial complexes. We
prove an upper bound of 1.32^n for the sum of Betti numbers of any n-vertex
flag complex and 1.25^n for the independence complex of a triangle-free graph.
These findings imply upper bounds for the Betti numbers of various related
classes of spaces, including the neighbourhood complex of a graph. We also make
some related observations.
