We maximize the expected utility of terminal wealth in an incomplete market
where there are cone constraints on the investor's portfolio process and the
utility function is not assumed to be strictly concave or differentiable. We
establish the existence of the optimal solutions to the primal and dual
problems and their dual relationship. We simplify the present proofs in this
area and extend the existing duality theory to the constrained nonsmooth
setting.
