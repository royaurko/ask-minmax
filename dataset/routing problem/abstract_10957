The single impurity Kondo problem in the one-dimensional $\delta$-potential
Fermi gas is exactly solved for two sets of special coupling constants via
Bethe ansatz. It is found that ferromagnetic Kondo screening does occur in one
case which confirms the Furusaki-Nagaosa conjecture while in the other case it
does not, which we explain in a simple physical picture. The surface energy,
the low temperature specific heat and the Pauli susceptibility induced by the
impurity and thereby the Kondo temperature are derived explicitly.
