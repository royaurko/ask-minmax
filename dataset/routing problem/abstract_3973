In their study of the Yamabe problem in the presence of isometry group, Hebey
and Vaugon announced a conjecture. This conjecture generalizes Aubin's
conjecture, which has already been proven and is sufficient to solve the Yamabe
problem. In this paper, we generalize Aubin's theorem and we prove the
Hebey--Vaugon conjecture in some new cases.
