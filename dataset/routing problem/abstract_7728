In this paper we devise an extremely efficient fully dynamic distributed
algorithm for maintaining sparse spanners. Our resuls also include the first
fully dynamic centralized algorithm for the problem with non-trivial bounds for
both incremental and decremental update. Finally, we devise a very efficient
streaming algorithm for the problem.
