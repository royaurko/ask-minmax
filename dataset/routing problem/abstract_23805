Let \Xi be a discrete set in R^d. Call the elements of \Xi centers. The
well-known Voronoi tessellation partitions R^d into polyhedral regions (of
varying volumes) by allocating each site of R^d to the closest center. Here we
study allocations of R^d to \Xi in which each center attempts to claim a region
of equal volume \alpha.
  We focus on the case where \Xi arises from a Poisson process of unit
intensity. It was proved in math.PR/0505668 that there is a unique allocation
which is stable in the sense of the Gale-Shapley marriage problem. We study the
distance X from a typical site to its allocated center in the stable
allocation.
  The model exhibits a phase transition in the appetite \alpha. In the critical
case \alpha=1 we prove a power law upper bound on X in dimension d=1. It is an
open problem to prove any upper bound in d\geq 2. (Power law lower bounds were
proved in math.PR/0505668 for all d). In the non-critical cases \alpha<1 and
\alpha>1 we prove exponential upper bounds on X.
