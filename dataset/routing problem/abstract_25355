We study the strong coupling problem in the Horava-Melby-Thompson setup of
the Horava-Lifshitz gravity with an arbitrary coupling constant $\lambda$,
generalized recently by da Silva, where $\lambda$ describes the deviation of
the theory in the infrared from general relativity that has $\lambda_{GR} = 1$.
We find that a scalar field in the Minkowski background becomes strong coupling
for processes with energy higher than $\Lambda_{\omega} [\equiv
(M_{pl}/c_1)^{3/2} M_{pl}|\lambda - 1|^{5/4}]$, where generically $c_1 \ll
M_{pl}$. However, this problem can be cured by introducing a new energy scale
$M_{*}$, so that $M_{*} < \Lambda_{\omega}$, where $M_{*}$ denotes the
suppression energy of high order derivative terms of the theory.
