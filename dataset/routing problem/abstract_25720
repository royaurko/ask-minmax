Synchronization of rotations is the problem of estimating a set of rotations
R_i in SO(n), i = 1, ..., N, based on noisy measurements of relative rotations
R_i R_j^T. This fundamental problem has found many recent applications, most
importantly in structural biology. We provide a framework to study
synchronization as estimation on Riemannian manifolds for arbitrary n under a
large family of noise models. The noise models we address encompass zero-mean
isotropic noise, and we develop tools for Gaussian-like as well as heavy-tail
types of noise in particular. As a main contribution, we derive the
Cram\'er-Rao bounds of synchronization, that is, lower-bounds on the variance
of unbiased estimators. We find that these bounds are structured by the
pseudoinverse of the measurement graph Laplacian, where edge weights are
proportional to measurement quality. We leverage this to provide interpretation
in terms of random walks and visualization tools for these bounds in both the
anchored and anchor-free scenarios. Similar bounds previously established were
limited to rotations in the plane and Gaussian-like noise.
