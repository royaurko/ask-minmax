NiTi porous materials with unprecedented superelasticity and shape memory
were manufactured by self-entangling, compacting and heat treating NiTi wires.
The versatile processing route used here allows to produce entanglements of
either superelastic or ferroelastic wires with tunable mesostructures. Three
dimensional (3D) X-ray microtomography shows that the entanglement
mesostructure is homogeneous and isotropic. The thermomechanical compressive
behavior of the entanglements was studied using optical measurements of the
local strain field. At all relative densities investigated here ($\sim$ 25 -
40$\%$), entanglements with superelastic wires exhibit remarkable macroscale
superelasticity, even after compressions up to 25$\%$, large damping capacity,
discrete memory effect and weak strain-rate and temperature dependencies.
Entanglements with ferroelastic wires resemble standard elastoplastic fibrous
systems with pronounced residual strain after unloading. However, a full
recovery is obtained by heating the samples, demonstrating a large shape memory
effect at least up to 16% strain.
