The divergences problem in QFT should be overcame presumably due to the
unification of the fundamental interactions. We evidently cannot to achieve
this goal now. Together with this there are divergences in problems where the
high-energy processes simply cannot be involved (say electron self-energy,
Lamb's shift, etc.). Last ones reflect the formal character of perturbation
theory applied to interacting secondly quantized amplitudes of the pointwise
particles. These difficulties are borrowed partly from the classical theory. I
would like to establish some general framework for the future unified theory
avoiding to use the method of classical analogy.
