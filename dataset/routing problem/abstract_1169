The Radiation Monitor (RADOM) payload is a miniature dosimeter-spectrometer
onboard Chandrayaan-1 mission for monitoring the local radiation environment in
near-Earth space and in lunar space. RADOM measured the total absorbed dose and
spectrum of the deposited energy from high energy particles in near-Earth
space, en-route and in lunar orbit. RADOM was the first experiment to be
switched on soon after the launch of Chandrayaan-1 and was operational till the
end of the mission. This paper summarizes the observations carried out by RADOM
during the entire life time of the Chandrayaan-1 mission and some the salient
results.
