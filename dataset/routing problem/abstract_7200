In this work, we focus on separable convex optimization problems with linear
and box constraints and compute the solution in closed-form as a function of
some Lagrange multipliers that can be easily computed in a finite number of
iterations. This allows us to bridge the gap between a wide family of power
allocation problems of practical interest in signal processing and
communications and their efficient implementation in practice.
