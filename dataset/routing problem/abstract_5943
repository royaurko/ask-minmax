Phenomenological effective interactions like Skyrme and Gogny forces are
currently used in mean-field calculations in nuclear physics. Mean-field models
represent the first order in the perturbative many-body problem and effective
interactions are adjusted and used at this order. In this work, we analyze the
renormalizability of the nuclear many-body problem in the case where the
effective Skyrme interaction is employed in its standard form and the
perturbative problem is solved up to second order. For simplicity, we focus on
symmetric nuclear matter and its equation of state, which can be calculated
analytically at this order. Specific density dependences are found for which
the problem is renormalizable, one of which generates a reasonable equation of
state over a quite large range of densities around saturation. However, it is
shown that the standard Skyrme interaction does not in general lead to a
renormalizable theory. For renormalizability, other terms should be added to
the interaction and employed perturbatively only at first order.
