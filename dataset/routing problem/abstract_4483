We discuss the ill-posed Cauchy problem for elliptic equations, which is
pervasive in inverse boundary value problems modeled by elliptic equations. We
provide essentially optimal stability results, in wide generality and under
substantially minimal assumptions. As a general scheme in our arguments, we
show that all such stability results can be derived by the use of a single
building brick, the three-spheres inequality.
