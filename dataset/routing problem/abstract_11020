In the Stable Marriage Problem two sets of agents must be paired according to
mutual preferences, which may happen to conflict. We present two
generalizations of its sex-oriented version, aiming to take into account
correlations between the preferences of agents and costly information. Their
effects are investigated both numerically and analytically.
