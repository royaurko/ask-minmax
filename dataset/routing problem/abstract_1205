We use conformal, but ghostful, Weyl gravity to study its ghost-free, second
derivative, partially massless (PM) spin 2 component in presence of Einstein
gravity with positive cosmological constant. Specifically, we consider both
gravitational- and self- interactions of PM via the fully non-linear
factorization of conformal gravity's Bach tensor into Einstein times Schouten
operators. We find that extending PM beyond linear order suffers from familiar
higher-spin consistency obstructions: it propagates only in Einstein
backgrounds, and the conformal gravity route generates only the usual safe,
Noether, cubic order vertices.
