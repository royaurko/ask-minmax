In these notes we study a family of Banach spaces, denoted $\,
D^{0,\,\al}(\Ov)\,,$ $\,\al \in\,\R^+\,,$ and called H-log spaces. For
$\,0<\,\la\leq\,1\,,$ one has $ C^{0,\,\la}(\Ov)\subset D^{0,\,\al}(\Ov)
\subset\,C(\Ov)\,,$ with compact embedding. These spaces present the following
"intermediate" regularity behavior. Solutions $\,u\,$ of second order linear
elliptic boundary value problems, under "external forces" $\,f\in\,
D^{0,\,\al}(\Ov)\,$ for some $\,\al>\,1\,,$ satisfy $\,\na^2\,u\in\,
D^{0,\,\al-\,1}(\Ov)\,$. This result is optimal, since $\,\na^2\,u\in\,
D^{0,\,\beta}(\Ov)\,,$ for some $\,\beta >\,\al-1\,,$ is false in general. We
present a preliminary study on this subject.
