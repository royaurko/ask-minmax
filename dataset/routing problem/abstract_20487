A Wronskian determinant approach is suggested to study the energy and the
wave function for one-dimensional Schrodinger equation. An integral equation
and the corresponding Green's function are constructed. As an example, we
employed this approach to study the problem of double-well potential with
strong coupling. A series expansion of ground state energy up to the second
order approximation of iterative procedure is given.
