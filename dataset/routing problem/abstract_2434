The properties of higher-index saddle points have been invoked in recent
theories of the dynamics of supercooled liquids. Here we examine in detail a
mapping of configurations to saddle points using minimization of $|\nabla
E|^2$, which has been used in previous work to support these theories. The
examples we consider are a two-dimensional model energy surface and binary
Lennard-Jones liquids and solids. A shortcoming of the mapping is its failure
to divide the potential energy surface into basins of attraction surrounding
saddle points, because there are many minima of $|\nabla E|^2$ that do not
correspond to stationary points of the potential energy. In fact, most liquid
configurations are mapped to such points for the system we consider. We
therefore develop an alternative route to investigate higher-index saddle
points and obtain near complete distributions of saddles for small
Lennard-Jones clusters. The distribution of the number of stationary points as
a function of the index is found to be Gaussian, and the average energy
increases linearly with saddle point index in agreement with previous results
for bulk systems.
