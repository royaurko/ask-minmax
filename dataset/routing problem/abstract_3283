We discuss the solution of regular and singular Sturm-Liouville problems by
means of High Order Finite Difference Schemes. We describe a code to define a
discrete problem and its numerical solution by means of linear algebra
techniques. Different test problems are proposed to emphasize the behaviour of
the proposed algorithm.
