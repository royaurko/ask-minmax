We consider the perturbation problem of a Mode III interfacial crack. The
perturbation is of geometrical type and can be both perturbation of the crack
faces and perturbation of the interface, which can deviate from the initial
straight line configuration. Asymptotic formulae are derived for the
first-order perturbation of the stress intensity factor. It is shown that, due
to the unsymmetrical nature of the problem, the Mode III skew-symmetric weight
function derived in Piccolroaz et al. (2009) is essential for the derivation of
the correct asymptotic formulae. To illustrate the method, we present the
numerical results for different geometrical perturbations of a half-plane
interfacial crack in an infinite bimaterial structure. Discussion on the
extension of the method to finite bodies is also presented.
