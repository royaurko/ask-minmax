In this paper we construct variational problems without Lie non-trivial
variational symmetry and solving them using new class of symmetries
($\mu$-symmetry) which introduced by Guiseppe Gaeta and Paola Morando (2004).
The central object in this paper is horizontal one-form $\mu$ on first order
jet space $J^1 M$.
