We present the results of our numerical exploration of the fractal structure
found by S.P. Novikov in the problem of the behviour of magnetoresistance in a
normal metal under a strong magnetic field. The case we discuss in this paper
is the simplest non-trivial one, namely the case of 2 Fermi Surfaces that cut
the brillouin zone along of the coordinate axes (i.e. Fermi surfaces have genus
3).
