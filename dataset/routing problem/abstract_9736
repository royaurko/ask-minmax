Fitness landscape analysis aims to understand the geometry of a given
optimization problem in order to design more efficient search algorithms.
However, there is a very little knowledge on the landscape of multiobjective
problems. In this work, following a recent proposal by Zitzler et al. (2010),
we consider multiobjective optimization as a set problem. Then, we give a
general definition of set-based multiobjective fitness landscapes. An
experimental set-based fitness landscape analysis is conducted on the
multiobjective NK-landscapes with objective correlation. The aim is to adapt
and to enhance the comprehensive design of set-based multiobjective search
approaches, motivated by an a priori analysis of the corresponding set problem
properties.
