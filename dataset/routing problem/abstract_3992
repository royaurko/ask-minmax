In this paper, we consider a minimal value problem and obtain an algebraic
inequality. As an application, we prove the $C^2$ a priori estimate for a class
of prescribed $\sigma_2$ curvature measure equations, which generalizes the
results of the $\sigma_2$ case in Guan-Li-Li\cite{GLL11} by a different method.
