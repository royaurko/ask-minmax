A general solution to the positive ion feedback problem in Hybrid Photon
Detectors (HPD), photo multipliers (PM) and other similar detectors was found
in the insertion of a permanent electrostatic potential barrier which prevents
drift of positive ions from the anode, or the first dynode, towards the
photocathode. In this paper we present the method as applied to the Intevac
HPD.
