The paper has a form of a survey and consists of three parts. It is focused
on the relationship between the many-sorted theory, which leads to logical
geometry and one-sorted theory, which is based on the important model-theoretic
concepts. Our aim is to show that both approaches go in parallel and there are
bridges which allow to transfer results, notions and problems back and forth.
Thus, an additional freedom in choosing an approach appear.
