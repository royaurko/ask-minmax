The formulation of a relativistic dynamical problem as a system of Hamilton
equations by respecting the principles of Relativity is a delicate task,
because in their classical form the Hamilton equations require the use of a
time coordinate, which of course contradicts the Relativity. Two interesting
solutions have been proposed during the last century: the covariant phase space
and the multisymplectic formalism. These two approaches were inspired at the
beginning by different points of view. However, as shown by works by
Kijowski-Szczyrba, Forger-Romero and Vitagliano, a synthetic vision of the two
theories leads probably to the most satisfactory answer to the basic question
of understanding the Hamiltonian structure of relativistic fields theory.
