We evaluate the effect of screening by bound electron in (7Be,e) + p -->
(8B,e) + photon transition in the framework of the adiabatic representation of
the three particle problem. Comparison with two approaches (united nucleus and
static) is presented. We discuss possible applications of this effect both for
Solar Neutrinos and low energy fusion experiments.
