Advances in gauge theories and unified theories have not thrown light on the
meaning of electron. The problem of the origin of electronic charge is made
precise, new insights gained from Weyl space are summarized, and the origin of
charge in terms of fractional spin is suggested. New perspective on the abelian
Chern-Simons theory is presented to explain charge.
