In this paper we present a method for estimating unknown parameter that
appear in a two dimensional nonlinear reaction-diffusion model of cancer
invasion. This model considers that tumor-induced alteration of
microenvironmental pH provides a mechanism for cancer invasion. A coupled
system reaction-diffusion describing this model is given by three partial
differential equations for the 2D non-dimensional spatial distribution and
temporal evolution of the density of normal tissue, the neoplastic tissue
growth and the excess concentration of H+ ions. Each of the model parameters
has a corresponding biological interpretation, for instance, the growth rate of
neoplastic tissue, the diffusion coefficient, the re-absorption rate and the
destructive influence of H+ ions in the healthy tissue. After solving the
direct problem, we propose a model for the estimation of parameters by fitting
the numerical solution with real data, obtained via in vitro experiments and
fluorescence ratio imaging microscopy. We define an appropriate functional to
compare both the real data and the numerical solution using the adjoint method
for the minimization of this functional. We apply a splitting strategy joint
with Adaptive Finite Element Method (AFEM) to solve the direct problem and the
adjoint problem. The minimization problem (the inverse problem) is solved by
using a trust-region-reflective method including the computation of the
derivative of the functional.
