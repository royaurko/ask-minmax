We show that simple highest weight modules for sl_12 may have reducible
characteristic variety. This answers a question of Borho-Brylinski and Joseph
from 1984. The relevant singularity under Beilinson-Bernstein localization is
the (in)famous Kashiwara-Saito singularity. We sketch the rather indirect route
via the p-canonical basis, W-graphs and decomposition numbers for perverse
sheaves that led us to examine this singularity.
