We investigate the concept of symmetry and its role in problem solving. This
paper first defines precisely the elements that constitute a "problem" and its
"solution," and gives several examples to illustrate these definitions. Given
precise definitions of problems, it is relatively straightforward to construct
a search process for finding solutions. Finally this paper attempts to exploit
the concept of symmetry in improving problem solving.
