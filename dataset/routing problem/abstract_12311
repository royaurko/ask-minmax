We consider a discrete facility location problem with a new form of equity
criterion. The model discussed in the paper analyzes the case where demand
points only have strict preference order on the sites where the plants can be
located. The goal is to find the location of the facilities minimizing the
total envy felt by the entire set of demand points. We define this new total
envy criterion and provide several integer linear programming formulations that
reflect and model this approach. Extensive computational tests are reported,
showing the potentials and limits of each formulation on several types of
instances.
