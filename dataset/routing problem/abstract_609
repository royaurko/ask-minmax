Given a random variable $N$ with values in ${\mathbb{N}}$, and $N$ i.i.d.
positive random variables $\{\mu_k\}$, we consider a queue with renewal
arrivals and $N$ exponential servers, where server $k$ serves at rate $\mu_k$,
under two work conserving routing schemes. In the first, the service rates
$\{\mu_k\}$ need not be known to the router, and each customer to arrive at a
time when some servers are idle is routed to the server that has been idle for
the longest time (or otherwise it is queued). In the second, the service rates
are known to the router, and a customer that arrives to find idle servers is
routed to the one whose service rate is greatest. In the many-server heavy
traffic regime of Halfin and Whitt, the process that represents the number of
customers in the system is shown to converge to a one-dimensional diffusion
with a random drift coefficient, where the law of the drift depends on the
routing scheme. A related result is also provided for nonrandom environments.
