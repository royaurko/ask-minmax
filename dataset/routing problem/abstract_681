We propose a mechanism where high entanglement between very distant boundary
spins is generated by suddenly connecting two long Kondo spin chains. We show
that this procedure provides an efficient way to route entanglement between
multiple distant sites. We observe that the key features of the entanglement
dynamics of the composite spin chain are remarkably well described using a
simple model of two singlets, each formed by two spins. The proposed
entanglement routing mechanism is a footprint of the emergence of a Kondo cloud
in a Kondo system and can be engineered and observed in varied physical
settings.
