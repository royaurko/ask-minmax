We consider the problem of two interacting particles on a sphere. The
potential of the interaction depends on the distance between the particles. The
case of Newtonian-type potentials is studied in most detail. We reduce this
system to a system with two degrees of freedom and give a number of remarkable
periodic orbits. We also discuss integrability and stochastization of the
motion.
