An account is given of the features, of the kind pertaining to q-statistics,
of the dynamics at the one-dimensional critical attractors associated to the
three familiar routes to chaos, intermittency, period doubling and
quasiperiodicity. Connections between the properties of these attractors and
those of systems with many degrees of freedom at extremal or transitional
states are briefly described.
