Conventional solutions to the (Mean) King's problem without using
entanglement have been investigated by Aravind [P. K. Aravind, ``Best
conventional solutions to the King's problem'', Z. Naturforsch. 58a, 682
(2003)]. We report that the upper bound for the success probability claimed
there is not valid in general, and give a condition for the claim to be
justified.
