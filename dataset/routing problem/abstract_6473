Bitangential interpolation problems in the class of matrix valued functions
in the generalized Schur class are considered in both the open unit disc and
the open right half plane, including problems in which the solutions is not
assumed to be holomorphic at the interpolation points. Linear fractional
representations of the set of solutions to these problems are presented for
invertible and singular Hermitian Pick matrices. These representations make use
of a description of the ranges of linear fractional transformations with
suitably chosen domains that was developed in a previous paper.
