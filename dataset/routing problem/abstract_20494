We give formal content to some concepts, naturally stemming from consistent
history approach (CHA), which are not formalized in the standard formulation of
the theory. The outcoming (extended) conceptual basis is used to perform a
formal, conceptually transparent analysis of some debated questions in CHA. As
results, the problems raised by contrary inferences of Kent are ruled out,
whereas some prescriptions of the theory cannot be mantained.
