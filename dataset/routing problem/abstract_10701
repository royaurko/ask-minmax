In this paper the new methods and devices introduced into the learning
process of programming for IT engineers at our college is described. Based on
our previous research results we supposed that project methods and some new
devices can reduce programming problems during the first term. These problems
are rooted in the difficulties of abstract thinking and they can cause the
decrease of programming self-concept and other learning motives. We redesigned
the traditional learning environment. As a constructive approach project method
was used. Our students worked in groups of two or three; small problems were
solved after every lesson. In the problem solving process students use
programmable robots (e.g. Surveyor, LEGO NXT and RCX). They had to plan their
program, solve some technical problems and test their solution. The usability
of mobile robots in the learning process and the short-term efficiency of our
teaching method were checked with a control group after a semester (n = 149).
We examined the effects on our students' programming skills and on their
motives, mainly on their attitudes and programming self-concept. After a
two-year-long period we could measure some positive long-term effects.
