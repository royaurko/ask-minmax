We define counting classes #P_R and #P_C in the Blum-Shub-Smale setting of
computations over the real or complex numbers, respectively. The problems of
counting the number of solutions of systems of polynomial inequalities over R,
or of systems of polynomial equalities over C, respectively, turn out to be
natural complete problems in these classes. We investigate to what extent the
new counting classes capture the complexity of computing basic topological
invariants of semialgebraic sets (over R) and algebraic sets (over C). We prove
that the problem of computing the (modified) Euler characteristic of
semialgebraic sets is FP_R^{#P_R}-complete, and that the problem of computing
the geometric degree of complex algebraic sets is FP_C^{#P_C}-complete. We also
define new counting complexity classes in the classical Turing model via taking
Boolean parts of the classes above, and show that the problems to compute the
Euler characteristic and the geometric degree of (semi)algebraic sets given by
integer polynomials are complete in these classes. We complement the results in
the Turing model by proving, for all k in N, the FPSPACE-hardness of the
problem of computing the k-th Betti number of the zet of real zeros of a given
integer polynomial. This holds with respect to the singular homology as well as
for the Borel-Moore homology.
