This paper consists of two parts. In the first part we describe the recent
works on the inverse problems for the wave equation in $(n+1)$-dimensional
space equipped with pseudo-Riemannian metric with Lorentz signature. We study
the conditions of the existence of black (or white) holes for these wave
equations. In the second part we prove energy type estimates on a finite time
interval in the presence of black or white holes. We use these estimates to
prove the nonuniqueness of the inverse problems.
