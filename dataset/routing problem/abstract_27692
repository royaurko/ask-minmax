This paper is devoted to the mechanics of fractal materials. A continuum
framework accounting for the topological and metric properties of fractal
domains in heterogeneous media is developed. The kinematics of deformations is
elucidated and the symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor is established. The
mapping of mechanical problems for fractal materials into the corresponding
problems for the fractal continuum is discussed. Stress and strain
distributions in elastic fractal bars are analyzed. Some features of acoustic
wave propagation and localization in scale-invariant media are briefly
discussed. The effect of fractal correlations in the material microstructure on
the crack mechanics is revealed. It is shown that the fractal nature of
heterogeneity can either delay or assist the crack initiation and propagation,
depending on the interplay between metric and topological properties of the
fractal domain.
