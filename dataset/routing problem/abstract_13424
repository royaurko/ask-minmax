We consider a general hyperbolic model of chemotaxis in the multidimensional
case. For this system we show the global existence of smooth solutions to the
Cauchy problem and we determine their asymptotic behavior. Since this model
does not enter in the classical framework of dissipative problems, we analyze
it combining the features of the hyperbolic and the parabolic parts and using
detailed decay estimates of the Green function.
