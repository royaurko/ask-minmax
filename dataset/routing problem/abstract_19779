The increase with time of computer resources devoted to simulations of full
QCD is spectacular. Yet the reduction of systematic errors is comparatively
slow. This is due to the algorithmic complexity of the problem. I review, in
elementary terms, the origin of this complexity, and estimate it for 3 exact
fermion algorithms.
