Source separation problems are ubiquitous in the physical sciences; any
situation where signals are superimposed calls for source separation to
estimate the original signals. In this tutorial I will discuss the Bayesian
approach to the source separation problem. This approach has a specific
advantage in that it requires the designer to explicitly describe the signal
model in addition to any other information or assumptions that go into the
problem description. This leads naturally to the idea of informed source
separation, where the algorithm design incorporates relevant information about
the specific problem. This approach promises to enable researchers to design
their own high-quality algorithms that are specifically tailored to the problem
at hand.
