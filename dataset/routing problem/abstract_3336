We study the phase diagram and the algorithmic hardness of the random
`locked' constraint satisfaction problems, and compare them to the commonly
studied 'non-locked' problems like satisfiability of boolean formulas or graph
coloring. The special property of the locked problems is that clusters of
solutions are isolated points. This simplifies significantly the determination
of the phase diagram, which makes the locked problems particularly appealing
from the mathematical point of view. On the other hand we show empirically that
the clustered phase of these problems is extremely hard from the algorithmic
point of view: the best known algorithms all fail to find solutions. Our
results suggest that the easy/hard transition (for currently known algorithms)
in the locked problems coincides with the clustering transition. These should
thus be regarded as new benchmarks of really hard constraint satisfaction
problems.
