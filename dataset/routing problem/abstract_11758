We establish the existence of a real solution y(x,T) with no poles on the
real line of the following fourth order analogue of the Painleve I equation,
x=Ty-({1/6}y^3+{1/24}(y_x^2+2yy_{xx})+{1/240}y_{xxxx}). This proves the
existence part of a conjecture posed by Dubrovin. We obtain our result by
proving the solvability of an associated Riemann-Hilbert problem through the
approach of a vanishing lemma. In addition, by applying the Deift/Zhou
steepest-descent method to this Riemann-Hilbert problem, we obtain the
asymptotics for y(x,T) as x\to\pm\infty.
