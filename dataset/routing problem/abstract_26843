We aim to completely formalize the rough topological analysis of integrable
Hamiltonian systems admitting analytical solutions such that the initial phase
variables along with the time derivatives of the auxiliary variables are
expressed as rational functions (in fact, as polynomials) in some set of
radicals depending on one variable each. We suggest a method to define the
admissible regions in the integral constants space, the segments of oscillation
of the separated variables and the number of connected components of integral
manifolds and critical integral surfaces. This method is based on some
algorithms of processing the tables of some Boolean vector-functions and of
reducing the matrices of linear Boolean vector-functions to some canonical
form. From this point of view we consider here the topologically richest
classical problems of the rigid body dynamics. The article will be continued
with the investigation of some new integrable problems.
