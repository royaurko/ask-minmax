This paper reviews advances in Stein-type shrinkage estimation for
spherically symmetric distributions. Some emphasis is placed on developing
intuition as to why shrinkage should work in location problems whether the
underlying population is normal or not. Considerable attention is devoted to
generalizing the "Stein lemma" which underlies much of the theoretical
development of improved minimax estimation for spherically symmetric
distributions. A main focus is on distributional robustness results in cases
where a residual vector is available to estimate an unknown scale parameter,
and, in particular, in finding estimators which are simultaneously generalized
Bayes and minimax over large classes of spherically symmetric distributions.
Some attention is also given to the problem of estimating a location vector
restricted to lie in a polyhedral cone.
