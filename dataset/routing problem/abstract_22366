We consider the construction of global non-vacuum solutions to the
one-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations for a viscous and
heat-conducting ideal polytropic gas whose transport coefficients depend on
both the density and the temperature. A global solvability result to its Cauchy
problem is obtained for general adiabatic exponent and large initial data.
