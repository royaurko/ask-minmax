We discuss the squashed fuzzy sphere, which is a projection of the fuzzy
sphere onto the equatorial plane, and use it to illustrate the stringy aspects
of noncommutative field theory. We elaborate explicitly how strings linking its
two coincident sheets arise in terms of fuzzy spherical harmonics. In the large
N limit, the matrix-model Laplacian is shown to correctly reproduce the
semi-classical dynamics of these charged strings, as given by the Landau
problem.
