The role of sparse representations in the context of structured noise
filtering is discussed. A strategy, especially conceived so as to address
problems of an ill posed nature, is presented. The proposed approach revises
and extends the Oblique Matching Pursuit technique. It is shown that, by
working with an orthogonal projection of the signal to be filtered, it is
possible to apply orthogonal matching pursuit like strategies in order to
accomplish the required signal discrimination
