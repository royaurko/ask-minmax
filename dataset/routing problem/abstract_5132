Bone adaptation models are often solved in the forward direction, meaning
that the response of bone to a given set of loads is determined by running a
bone tissue adaptation model. The model is generally solved using a numerical
technique such as the finite element model. Conversely, one may be interested
in the loads that have resulted in a given state of bone. This is the inverse
of the former problem. Even though the inverse problem has several
applications, it has not received as much attention as the forward problem,
partly because solving the inverse problem is more difficult. A nonlinear
system identification technique is needed for solving the inverse problem. In
this study, we use artificial neural networks for prediction of tissue
adaptation loads from a given density distribution of trabecular bone. It is
shown that the proposed method can successfully identify the loading parameters
from the density distribution of the tissue. Two important challenges for all
load prediction algorithms are the non-uniqueness of the solution of the
inverse problem and the inaccuracies in the measurement of the morphology of
the tissue. Both challenges are studied, and it is shown that the load
prediction technique proposed in this paper can overcome both.
