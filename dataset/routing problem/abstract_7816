A simple corollary of the localization theorem (due to the contributor and,
independently, to Lian-Liu-Yau) is applied to several problems in enumerative
geometry. New formulas for Schubert calculus on flag manifolds, due to Kong,
and a new reconstruction theorem for genus-zero Gromov-Witten invariants, due
to Bertram-Kley, are discussed, as well as some simple functorial properties of
Givental's J-function. This paper will appear in the issue of the Michigan
Mathematical Journal dedicated to Bill Fulton.
