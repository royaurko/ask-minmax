The mean king's problem with maximal mutually unbiased bases (MUB's) in
general dimension d is investigated. It is shown that a solution of the problem
exists if and only if the maximal number (d+1) of orthogonal Latin squares
exists. This implies that there is no solution in d=6 or d=10 dimensions even
if the maximal number of MUB's exists in these dimensions.
