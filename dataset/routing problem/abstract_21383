A loop algebra approach to the Gerdjikov-Mikhailov-Valchev (GMV) equation is
provided to exploit the associated twisted integrable structure and a new
twisted integrable hierarchy is discovered. Using the twisted loop algebra
structure, we obtain a transparent treatment of the associated scattering and
inverse scattering theory and solve the initial value problem for the GMV
equation.
