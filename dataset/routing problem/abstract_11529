To every oriented tree, we associate a moduli problem for sheaves over a
projective manifold $X$. We define the corresponding notion of semistability
and establish the existence of moduli spaces. Applying the results to the tree
*->*, we obtain a GIT construction for the moduli space of holomorphic triples
of Bradlow and Garcia-Prada.
