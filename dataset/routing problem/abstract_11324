Anomaly mediation of supersymmetry breaking solves the supersymmetric flavor
problem thanks to its ultraviolet-insensitivity. However, it suffers from two
problems: sleptons have negative masses-squared, and there are likely bulk
moduli that spoil the framework. Here, we present the first fully
ultraviolet-insensitive model of anomaly mediation with positive slepton
masses-squared in a purely four-dimensional framework. Our model is based on
the additional D-term contributions to the sparticle masses, and the conformal
sequestering mechanism.
