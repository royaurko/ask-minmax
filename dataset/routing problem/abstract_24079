We study the problem of joint estimation of real squeezing and amplitude of
the radiation field, deriving the measurement that maximizes the probability
density of detecting the true value of the unknown parameters. More generally,
we provide a solution for the problem of estimating the unknown unitary action
of a nonunimodular group in the maximum likelihood approach. Remarkably, in
this case the optimal measurements do not coincide with the so called
square-root measurements. In the case of squeezing and displacement we analyze
in detail the sensitivity of estimation for coherent states and displaced
squeezed states, deriving the asymptotic relation between the uncertainties in
the joint estimation and the corresponding uncertainties in the optimal
separate measurements of squeezing and displacement. A two-mode setup is also
analyzed, showing how entanglement between optical modes can be used to
approximate perfect estimation.
