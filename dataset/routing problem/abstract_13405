The qualitative analysis of the initial value problem P related to a non
linear third order parabolic equation typical of diffusive models is discussed.
Some basic properties of the the fundamental solution of a related linear
operator are determined and are applied to an equivalent integro differential
formulation of the problem. By the fixed point theorem, existence and
uniqueness results are obtained
