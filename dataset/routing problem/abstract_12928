Let $K$ be a compact subset of $\mathbb C^n$, $K^\ast K$ a closed subset. In
this paper we are dealing with evolution $E_t(K,K^\ast)$ of $K$ with fixed part
$K^\ast$ by Levi form. This amounts to solve a parabolic problem for an
elliptic operator. We prove existence and unicity for such a problem and the
solution $u(z,t)$ exists for any time $t\ge 0$.If $K$ is a smooth graph
$\Gamma$ and $K^\ast={\rm b}\Gamma$ the the evolution $E_t(\Gamma,{\rm
b}\Gamma)$ is still a graph. In particular, if ${\rm b}\Gamma$ bounds a Levi
flat hypersurface $M$ then $E_t(\Gamma,{\rm b}\Gamma)\to M$ as $t\to+\infty$.
