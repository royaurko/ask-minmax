This study explores, both theoretically and experimentally, the
photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo-CIDNP) of 19F
nuclei, the associated spin relaxation, cross-relaxation and cross-correlation
effects, as well as potential applications of 19F CIDNP to protein structure
and folding problems. Keywords: CIDNP, relaxation, fluorine, NMR, NOE,
TR-CIDNP, tc5b, Trp-cage, GFP
