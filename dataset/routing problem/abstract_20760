This work answers the basic questions of superconductivity in a
question-and-answer format. We extend a basic hypothesis to various
superconductors. This hypothesis is that superconductivity requires that the
pairing gap locates around the Fermi level. On the basis of this hypothesis our
calculations give the so-called three factor theory with which some key
problems of the high temperature superconductivity are explained.
