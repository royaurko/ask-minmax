This paper is divided in two parts. In the first part, the inverse spectral
problem for tight-binding hamiltonians is studied. This problem is shown to
have an infinite number of solutions for properly chosen energies. The space of
such solutions is characterized by a hypersurface in the space of hopping
amplitudes (i.e. couplings), whose dimension is half the number of sites in the
array. Low dimensional examples for short chains are carefully studied and a
table of exactly solvable inverse problems is provided in terms of Lie
algebraic structures. With the aim of providing a method to generate lattice
configurations, a set of equations for coupling constants in terms of energies
is obtained; this is done by means of a new formula for the calculation of
characteristic polynomials. Two examples with randomly generated spectra are
studied numerically, leading to peaked distributions of couplings. In the
second part of the paper, our results are applied to the design of bent
waveguides, reproducing specific spectra below propagation threshold. As a
demonstration, the Dirac and the finite oscillator are realized in this way. A
few partially isospectral configurations are also presented.
