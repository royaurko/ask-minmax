A solid-liquid-gas moving contact line is considered through a
diffuse-interface model with the classical boundary condition of no-slip at the
solid surface. Examination of the asymptotic behaviour as the contact line is
approached shows that the relaxation of the classical model of a sharp
liquid-gas interface, whilst retaining the no-slip condition, resolves the
stress and pressure singularities associated with the moving contact line
problem while the fluid velocity is well defined (not multi-valued). The moving
contact line behaviour is analysed for a general problem relevant for any
density dependent dynamic viscosity and volume viscosity, and for general
microscopic contact angle and double well free-energy forms. Away from the
contact line, analysis of the diffuse-interface model shows that the
Navier--Stokes equations and classical interfacial boundary conditions are
obtained at leading order in the sharp-interface limit, justifying the creeping
flow problem imposed in an intermediate region in the seminal work of Seppecher
[Int. J. Eng. Sci. 34, 977--992 (1996)]. Corrections to Seppecher's work are
given, as an incorrect solution form was originally used.
