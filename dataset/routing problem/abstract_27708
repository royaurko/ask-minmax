We study the problem of how to build a deep learning representation for 3D
shape. Deep learning has shown to be very effective in variety of visual
applications, such as image classification and object detection. However, it
has not been successfully applied to 3D shape recognition. This is because 3D
shape has complex structure in 3D space and there are limited number of 3D
shapes for feature learning. To address these problems, we project 3D shapes
into 2D space and use autoencoder for feature learning on the 2D images. High
accuracy 3D shape retrieval performance is obtained by aggregating the features
learned on 2D images. In addition, we show the proposed deep learning feature
is complementary to conventional local image descriptors. By combing the global
deep learning representation and the local descriptor representation, our
method can obtain the state-of-the-art performance on 3D shape retrieval
benchmarks.
