We study integrality gaps and approximability of two closely related problems
on directed graphs. Given a set V of n nodes in an underlying asymmetric metric
and two specified nodes s and t, both problems ask to find an s-t path visiting
all other nodes. In the asymmetric traveling salesman path problem (ATSPP), the
objective is to minimize the total cost of this path. In the directed latency
problem, the objective is to minimize the sum of distances on this path from s
to each node. Both of these problems are NP-hard. The best known approximation
algorithms for ATSPP had ratio O(log n) until the very recent result that
improves it to O(log n/ log log n). However, only a bound of O(sqrt(n)) for the
integrality gap of its linear programming relaxation has been known. For
directed latency, the best previously known approximation algorithm has a
guarantee of O(n^(1/2+eps)), for any constant eps > 0. We present a new
algorithm for the ATSPP problem that has an approximation ratio of O(log n),
but whose analysis also bounds the integrality gap of the standard LP
relaxation of ATSPP by the same factor. This solves an open problem posed by
Chekuri and Pal [2007]. We then pursue a deeper study of this linear program
and its variations, which leads to an algorithm for the k-person ATSPP (where k
s-t paths of minimum total length are sought) and an O(log n)-approximation for
the directed latency problem.
