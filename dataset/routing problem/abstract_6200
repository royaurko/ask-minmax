Although numerical simulation in lattice field theory is one of the most
effective tools to study non-perturbative properties of field theories, it
faces serious obstacles coming from the sign problem in some theories such as
finite density QCD and lattice field theory with the $\theta$ term. We
reconsider this problem from the point of view of the maximum entropy method.
