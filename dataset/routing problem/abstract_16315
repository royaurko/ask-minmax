We propose a variable decomposition algorithm -greedy block coordinate
descent (GBCD)- in order to make dense Gaussian process regression practical
for large scale problems. GBCD breaks a large scale optimization into a series
of small sub-problems. The challenge in variable decomposition algorithms is
the identification of a subproblem (the active set of variables) that yields
the largest improvement. We analyze the limitations of existing methods and
cast the active set selection into a zero-norm constrained optimization problem
that we solve using greedy methods. By directly estimating the decrease in the
objective function, we obtain not only efficient approximate solutions for
GBCD, but we are also able to demonstrate that the method is globally
convergent. Empirical comparisons against competing dense methods like
Conjugate Gradient or SMO show that GBCD is an order of magnitude faster.
Comparisons against sparse GP methods show that GBCD is both accurate and
capable of handling datasets of 100,000 samples or more.
