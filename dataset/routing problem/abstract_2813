Harris Corporation has an interest in making HF radios a suitable medium for
wireless information networks using standard Internet protocols. Although HF
radio links have many unique characteristics, HF wireless subnets can be
subject to many of the same traffic flow characteristics and topologies as
existing line-of-sight (LOS) radio networks, giving rise to similar issues
(media access, connectivity, routing) which lend themselves to investigation
through simulation. Accordingly, we have undertaken to develop efficient,
high-fidelity simulations of various aspects of HF radio communications and
networking using the OMNeT++ framework. Essential aspects of these simulations
include HF channel models simulating relevant channel attributes such as Signal
to Noise Ratio, multipath, and Doppler spread; a calibrated physical layer
model reproducing the error statistics (including burst error distributions) of
the MIL-STD-188-110B/C HF modem waveforms, both narrowband (3 kHz) and wideband
(up to 24 kHz) on the simulated HF channels; a model of the NATO STANAG 5066
data link protocol; and integration of these models with the OMNeT++ network
simulation framework and its INET library of Internet protocol models. This
simulation is used to evaluate the impacts of different STANAG 5066
configuration settings on TCP network performance, and to evaluate strategies
for optimizing throughput over HF links using TCP Performance Enhancing Proxy
(PEP) techniques.
