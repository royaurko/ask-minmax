I discuss a SUSY-GUT model with a non-Abelian discrete family symmetry that
explains the observed hierarchical pattern of quark and lepton masses. This
$SO(10) \times \Delta(75)$ model predicts modified quadratic seesaw neutrino
masses and mixing angles which are interesting for three reasons: i.) they
offer a solution to the solar neutrino problem, ii.) the tau neutrino has the
right mass for a cosmologically interesting hot dark matter candidate, and
iii.) they suggest a positive result for the $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\tau$
oscillation searches by the CHORUS and NOMAD collaborations. However, the model
shares some problems with many other predictive GUT models of quark and lepton
masses. Well-known and once successful mass and angle relations, such as the
$SU(5)$ relation $\lambda_b^{GUT}=\lambda_\tau^{GUT}$, are found to be in
conflict with the current experimental status. Attempts to correct these
relations seem to lead to rather contrived models.
