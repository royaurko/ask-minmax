Given a set of integers W, the Partition problem determines whether W can be
divided into two disjoint subsets with equal sums. We model the Partition
problem as a system of polynomial equations, and then investigate the
complexity of a Hilbert's Nullstellensatz refutation, or certificate, that a
given set of integers is not partitionable. We provide an explicit construction
of a minimum-degree certificate, and then demonstrate that the Partition
problem is equivalent to the determinant of a carefully constructed matrix
called the partition matrix. In particular, we show that the determinant of the
partition matrix is a polynomial that factors into an iteration over all
possible partitions of W.
