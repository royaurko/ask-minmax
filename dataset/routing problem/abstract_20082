We show that the main problem left open in Wenzel: "Real and complex
operator ideals" (wenzelopidls.latex), can be solved using the Banach spaces
$Z_\alpha$ recently constructed by Kalton: "An elementary example of a Banach
space not isomorphic to its complex conjugate" (kaltoncmplxbsp.tex). This
gives an example of a complex operator ideal that has no real analogue. It
thus shows the richer structure of complex operator ideals compared with the
real ones.
