We study several problems related to finding reset words in deterministic
finite automata. In particular, we establish that the problem of deciding
whether a shortest reset word has length k is complete for the complexity class
DP. This result answers a question posed by Volkov. For the search problems of
finding a shortest reset word and the length of a shortest reset word, we
establish membership in the complexity classes FP^NP and FP^NP[log],
respectively. Moreover, we show that both these problems are hard for
FP^NP[log]. Finally, we observe that computing a reset word of a given length
is FNP-complete.
