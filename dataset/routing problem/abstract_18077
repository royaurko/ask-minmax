Continuing work initiated in earlier publications [Ichita, Yamada and Asada,
Phys. Rev. D {\bf 83}, 084026 (2011); Yamada and Asada, Phys. Rev. D {\bf 86},
124029 (2012)], we examine the post-Newtonian (PN) effects on the stability of
the triangular solution in the relativistic three-body problem for general
masses. For three finite masses, a condition for stability of the triangular
solution is obtained at the first post-Newtonian (1PN) order, and it recovers
previous results for the PN restricted three-body problem when one mass goes to
zero. The stability regions still exist even at the 1PN order, though the PN
triangular configuration for general masses is less stable than the PN
restricted three-body case as well as the Newtonian one.
