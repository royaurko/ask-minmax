Various notions of stable ranks are studied for topological algebras. Some
partial answers to R.G. Swan's problem (Have two Banach or good Fr\'echet
algebras as in the density theorem in K-theory the same stable rank ?) are
obtained. For example, a Fr\'echet dense $\ast$-subalgebra $A$ of a
$C^\ast$-algebra $B$, closed under $C^\infty$-functional calculus of
self-adjoint elements, has the same Bass stable rank as $B$.
