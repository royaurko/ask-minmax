We study second order parabolic equations on Lipschitz domains subject to
inhomogeneous Neumann (or, more generally, Robin) boundary conditions. We prove
existence and uniqueness of weak solutions and their continuity up to the
boundary of the parabolic cylinder. Under natural assumptions on the
coefficients and the inhomogeneity we can also prove convergence to an
equilibrium or asymptotic almost periodicity.
