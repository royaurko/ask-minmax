The space of complete collineations is a compactification of the space of
matrices of fixed dimension and rank, whose boundary is a divisor with normal
crossings. It was introduced in the 19th century and has been used to solve
many enumerative problems.
  We show that this venerable space can be understood using the latest quotient
constructions in algebraic geometry. Indeed, there is a detailed analogy
between the complete collineations and the moduli space of stable pointed
curves of genus zero. The remarkable results of Kapranov exhibiting the latter
space as a Chow quotient, Hilbert quotient, and so on, all have counterparts
for complete collineations.
  This analogy encompasses Vainsencher's construction of the complete
collineations, as well as a form of the Gel'fand-MacPherson correspondence.
There is also a tangential relation with the Gromov-Witten invariants of
Grassmannians. The symmetric and anti-symmetric versions of the problem are
considered as well.
  An appendix explains the original motivation, which came from the space of
broken Morse flows for the moment map of a circle action.
