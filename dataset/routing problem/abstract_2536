We study the conditions under which, using a canonical transformation, the
phases sought after for the repulsive Hubbard model, namely a Mott insulator in
the paramagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic phases, and a putative d-wave
superfluid can be deduced from observations in an optical lattice loaded with a
spin-imbalanced ultra-cold Fermi gas with attractive interactions, thus
realizing the attractive Hubbard model. We show that the Mott insulator and
antiferromagnetic phase of the repulsive Hubbard model are in fact more easy to
observe as a paired, and superfluid phase respectively, in the attractive
Hubbard model. The putative d-wave superfluid phase of the repulsive Hubbard
model doped away from half-filling is related to a d-wave antiferromagnetic
phase for the attractive Hubbard model. We discuss the advantages of this
approach to 'quantum simulate' the Hubbard model in an optical lattice over the
approach that attempts to directly simulate the doped Hubbard model in the
repulsive regime. We also point out a number of technical difficulties of the
proposed approach and, in some cases, suggest possible solutions.
