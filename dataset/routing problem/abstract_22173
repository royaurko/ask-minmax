Fundamental limitations in accelerator gradient, emittance, alignment and
polarization in acceleration schemes are considered in application for novel
schemes of acceleration, including laser-plasma and structure-based schemes.
Problems for each method are underlined whenever it is possible. Main attention
is paid to the scheme with a tilted laser bunch.
