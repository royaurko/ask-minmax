We derive a formula that simplifies the original asymptotic iteration method
formulation to find the energy eigenvalues for the analytically solvable cases.
We then show that there is a connection between the asymptotic iteration and
the Nikiforov--Uvarov methods, which both solve the second order linear
ordinary differential equations analytically.
