In this article we review some problems in physics, chemistry and mathematics
that lead naturally to a class of polyhedra which include the Platonic solids.
Examples include the study of electrons on a sphere, cages of carbon atoms,
central configurations of gravitating point particles, rare gas microclusters,
soliton models of nuclei, magnetic monopole scattering and geometrical problems
concerning point particles.
