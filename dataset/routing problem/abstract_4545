In this paper, by using the similar methods of [O. Sh. Mukhtarov and M.
Kadakal, Some spectral properties of one Sturm-Liouville type problem with
discontinuous weight, Siberian Mathematical Journal, 46 (2005) 681-694] we
extend some spectral properties of regular Sturm-Liouville problems to those
which consist of a Sturm-Liouville equation with discontinuous weight at two
interior points together with spectral parameter-dependent boundary conditions.
We give an operator-theoretic formulation for the considered problem and obtain
asymptotic formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.
