The discovery of about 50 K superconductivity in the tetragonal Fe-based
pnictides has stimulated the search for superconductivity in a wide class of
materials with similar structure. Copper forms compounds isostructural to
LaOFeAs. Single phase BiOCuS can be prepared by a solid state reaction at
temperature lower than 500 C from a mixture of Bi2O3, Bi2S3 and Cu2S. The
samples have been characterized by means of EDX analysis, X-ray diffraction,
magnetic and electrical measurements. The cell parameters are a = 3.8708 A, c =
8.565 A. Charge carrier doping can be realized either by F substitutions for O,
or by Cu off-stoichiometry. The latter doping route leads to the occurrence of
superconductivity below Tc = 5.8 K.
