We consider the problem of existence of polynomials with small norm. This
range of problems has been extensively studied by many contributors in the case of
the unit circle (or a compact Abelian group), i.e. when the characters are
bounded. In general, on compact homogeneous Riemannian manifolds, the
eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator are not uniformly bounded. This
creates difficulties of a fundamental nature in applications of known methods
and results. The method we develop is based on a geometric inequality between
norms induced by two convex bodies in Euclidean space.
