Precision measurements in the neutrino sector are becoming increasingly
feasible due to the development of relatively high-rate experimental
capabilities. These important developments command renewed attention to the
systematic corrections needed to interpret the data. Hadronic multi-particle
final state measurements made using CLAS at Jefferson Lab, together with a
broad theoretical effort that links electro-nucleus and neutrino-nucleus data,
will address this problem, and will elucidate long-standing problems in
intermediate energy nuclear physics. This new work will ultimately enable
precision determinations of fundamental quantities such as the neutrino mixing
matrix elements in detailed studies of neutrino oscillations.
