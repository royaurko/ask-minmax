We develop a new chemical route to prepare carbon nanotubes at room
temperature. Graphite powder is immersed in a mixed solution of nitric and
sulfuric acid with potassium chlorate. After heating the solution up to
70{\deg}C and leaving them in the air for 3 days, we obtained carbon nanotube
bundles. This process could provide an easy and inexpensive method for the
preparation of carbon nanotubes.
