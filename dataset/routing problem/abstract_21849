We give an exact formula for the Bellman function of the weak type of
martingale transform. We also give the extremal functions (actually extremal
sequences of functions). We find them using the precise form of the Bellman
function. The extremal examples have a fractal nature as it often happens in
that kind of problems. This article is devoted to the unweighted weak type
estimate.
