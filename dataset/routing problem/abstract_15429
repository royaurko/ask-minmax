Set-membership estimation is in general referred in literature as the
deterministic approach to state estimation, since its solution can be
formulated in the context of set-valued calculus and no stochastic calculations
are necessary. This turns out not to be entirely true. In this paper, we show
that set-membership estimation can be equivalently formulated in the stochastic
setting by employing sets of probability measures. Inferences in set-membership
estimation are thus carried out by computing expectations w.r.t. the updated
set of probability measures P as in the stochastic case. In particular, we show
that inferences can be computed by solving a particular semi-infinite linear
programming problem, which is a special case of the truncated moment problem in
which only the zero-th order moment is known (i.e., the support). By writing
the dual of the above semi-infinite linear programming problem, we show that,
if the nonlinearities in the measurement and process equations are polynomials
and if the bounding sets for initial state, process and measurement noises are
described by polynomial inequalities, then an approximation of this
semi-infinite linear programming problem can efficiently be obtained by using
the theory of sum-of-squares polynomial optimization. We then derive a smart
greedy procedure to compute a polytopic outer-approximation of the true
membership-set, by computing the minimum-volume polytope that outer-bounds the
set that includes all the means computed w.r.t. P.
