In this paper, we consider solving multiple-block separable convex
minimization problems using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).
Motivated by the fact that the existing convergence theory for ADMM is mostly
limited to the two-block case, we analyze in this paper, both theoretically and
numerically, a new strategy that first transforms a multi-block problem into an
equivalent two-block problem (either in the primal domain or in the dual
domain) and then solves it using the standard two-block ADMM. In particular, we
derive convergence results for this two-block ADMM approach to solve
multi-block separable convex minimization problems, including an improved
O(1/\epsilon) iteration complexity result. Moreover, we compare the numerical
efficiency of this approach with the standard multi-block ADMM on several
separable convex minimization problems which include basis pursuit, robust
principal component analysis and latent variable Gaussian graphical model
selection. The numerical results show that the multiple-block ADMM, although
lacks theoretical convergence guarantees, typically outperforms two-block
ADMMs.
