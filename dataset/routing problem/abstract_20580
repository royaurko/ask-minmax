In Weyl's geometry the nonintegrability problem and difficulties in defining
measuring standards are reconsidered. Approaches removing the nonintegrability
of lengthin in the interior of atoms are given, so that atoms may serve as
measuring standards. The Weyl space become a well founded framework for
classical theories of gravitation and electromagnetism,
