This paper studies the problem for an affine hypersurface system to reach a
polytopic target set starting from inside a polytope in the state space. We
present an exhaustive solution which begins with a characterization of states
which can reach the target by open-loop control and concludes with a systematic
procedure to synthesize a feedback control. Our emphasis is on methods of
subdivision, triangulation, and covers which explicitly account for the
capabilities of the control system. In contrast with previous literature, the
partition methods are guaranteed to yield a correct feedback synthesis,
assuming the problem is solvable by open-loop control.
