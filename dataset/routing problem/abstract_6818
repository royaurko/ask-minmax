We describe the asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues of interior
transmission problem in absorbing medium. We apply the Cartwright's theory and
the technique from asymptotic periodic entire function theory. We find a Weyl's
type of density theorem on counting the eigenvalues for spherically symmetric
interior transmission problem in absorbing medium.
