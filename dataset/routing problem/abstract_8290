We study a mixed initial-boundary value problem for the Navier-Stokes
equations, where the Dirichlet, Neumann and slip boundary conditions are
prescribed on the faces of a three-dimensional polyhedral domain. We prove the
existence, uniqueness and smoothness of the solution on a time interval
$(0,T^*)$, where $0<T^*\leq T$.
