We present an exact algorithm that decides, for every fixed $r \geq 2$ in
time $O(m) + 2^{O(k^2)}$ whether a given multiset of $m$ clauses of size $r$
admits a truth assignment that satisfies at least $((2^r-1)m+k)/2^r$ clauses.
Thus \textsc{Max-$r$-Sat} is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by
the number of satisfied clauses above the tight lower bound $(1-2^{-r})m$. This
solves an open problem of Mahajan et al. (J. Comput. System Sci., 75, 2009).
  Our algorithm is based on a polynomial-time data reduction procedure that
reduces a problem instance to an equivalent algebraically represented problem
with $O(k^2)$ variables. This is done by representing the instance as an
appropriate polynomial, and by applying a probabilistic argument combined with
some simple tools from Harmonic analysis to show that if the polynomial cannot
be reduced to one of size $O(k^2)$, then there is a truth assignment satisfying
the required number of clauses.
  We introduce a new notion of bikernelization from a parameterized problem to
another one and apply it to prove that the above-mentioned parameterized
\textsc{Max-$r$-Sat} admits a polynomial-size kernel.
  Combining another probabilistic argument with tools from graph matching
theory and signed graphs, we show that if an instance of \textsc{Max-2-Sat}
with $m$ clauses has at least $3k$ variables after application of certain
polynomial time reduction rules to it, then there is a truth assignment that
satisfies at least $(3m+k)/4$ clauses.
  We also outline how the fixed-parameter tractability and polynomial-size
kernel results on \textsc{Max-$r$-Sat} can be extended to more general families
of Boolean Constraint Satisfaction Problems.
