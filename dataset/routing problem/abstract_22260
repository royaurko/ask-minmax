In this short paper we consider the problem of monitoring physical activity
in the smart house. The contributors suggested a simple device that allows medical
staff and relatives to monitor the activity for older adults living alone. This
sensor monitors the switching-on of electrical devices. The fact of switching
is seen as confirmation of physical activity. It is confirmed by SMS
notifications to observers.
