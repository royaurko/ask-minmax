In order to operate an electrical distribution network in a secure and
cost-efficient way, it is necessary, due to the rise of renewable energy-based
distributed generation, to develop Active Network Management (ANM) strategies.
These strategies rely on short-term policies that control the power injected by
generators and/or taken off by loads in order to avoid congestion or voltage
problems. While simple ANM strategies would curtail the production of
generators, more advanced ones would move the consumption of loads to relevant
time periods to maximize the potential of renewable energy sources. However,
such advanced strategies imply solving large-scale optimal sequential
decision-making problems under uncertainty, something that is understandably
complicated. In order to promote the development of computational techniques
for active network management, we detail a generic procedure for formulating
ANM decision problems as Markov decision processes. We also specify it to a
75-bus distribution network. The resulting test instance is available at
http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~anm/. It can be used as a test bed for
comparing existing computational techniques, as well as for developing new
ones. A solution technique that consists in an approximate multistage program
is also illustrated on the test instance.
