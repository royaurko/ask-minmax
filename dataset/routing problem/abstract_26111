When a nonequilibrium growing interface in the presence of a wall is
considered a nonequilibrium wetting transition may take place. This transition
can be studied trough Langevin equations or discrete growth models. In the
first case, the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, which defines a very robust
universality class for nonequilibrium moving interfaces, with a soft-wall
potential is considered. While in the second, microscopic models, in the
corresponding universality class, with evaporation and deposition of particles
in the presence of hard-wall are studied. Equilibrium wetting is related to a
particular case of the problem, it corresponds to the Edwards-Wilkinson
equation with a potential in the continuum approach or to the fulfillment of
detailed balance in the microscopic models. In this review we present the
analytical and numerical methods used to investigate the problem and the very
rich behavior that is observed with them.
