We address the problem of equivalence of count-distinct aggregate queries,
prove that the problem is decidable, and can be decided in the third level of
Polynomial hierarchy. We introduce the notion of core for conjunctive queries
with comparisons as an extension of the classical notion for relational
queries, and prove that the existence of isomorphism among cores of queries is
a sufficient and necessary condition for equivalence of conjunctive queries
with comparisons similar to the classical relational setting. However, it is
not a necessary condition for equivalence of count-distinct queries. We
introduce a relaxation of this condition based on a new notion, which is a
potentially new query equivalent to the initial query, introduced to capture
the behavior of count-distinct operator.
