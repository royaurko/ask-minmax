This paper is devoted to a study of $S$-curves, that is systems of curves in
the complex plane whose equilibrium potential in a harmonic external field
satisfies a special symmetry property ($S$-property). Such curves have many
applications. In particular, they play a fundamental role in the theory of
complex (non-hermitian) orthogonal polynomials. One of the main theorems on
zero distribution of such polynomials asserts that the limit zero distribution
is presented by an equilibrium measure of an $S$-curve associated with the
problem if such a curve exists. These curves are also the starting point of the
matrix Riemann-Hilbert approach to srtong asymptotics. Other approaches to the
problem of strong asymptotics (differential equations, Riemann surfaces) are
also related to $S$-curves or may be interpreted this way. Existence problem
$S$-curve in a given class of curves in presence of a nontrivial external field
presents certain challenge. We formulate and prove a version of existence
theorem for the case when both the set of singularities of the external field
and the set of fixed points of a class of curves are small (in main case --
finite). We also discuss various applications and connections of the theorem.
