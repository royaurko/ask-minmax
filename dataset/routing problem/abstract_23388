Warped extra dimensions allow a novel way of solving the hierarchy problem,
with all fundamental mass parameters of the theory naturally of the order of
the Planck scale. The observable value of the Higgs vacuum expectation value is
red-shifted, due to the localization of the Higgs field in the extra dimension.
It has been recently observed that, when the gauge fields propagate in the
bulk, unification of the gauge couplings may be achieved. Moreover, the
propagation of fermions in the bulk allows for a simple solution to potentially
dangerous proton decay problems. However, bulk gauge fields and fermions pose a
phenomenological challenge, since they tend to induce large corrections to the
precision electroweak observables. In this article, we study in detail the
effect of gauge and fermion fields propagating in the bulk in the presence of
gauge brane kinetic terms compatible with gauge coupling unification, and we
present ways of obtaining a consistent description of experimental data, while
allowing values of the first Kaluza Klein mode masses of the order of a few
TeV.
