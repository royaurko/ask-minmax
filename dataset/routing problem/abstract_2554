In the framework of Nambu Mechanics, we have recently argued that
Non-Hamiltonian Chaotic Flows in $ R^{3} $, are dissipation induced
deformations, of integrable volume preserving flows, specified by pairs of
Intersecting Surfaces in $R^{3}$. In the present work we focus our attention to
the Lorenz system with a linear dissipative sector in its phase space dynamics.
In this case the Intersecting Surfaces are Quadratic. We parametrize its
dissipation strength through a continuous control parameter $\epsilon$, acting
homogeneously over the whole 3-dim. phase space. In the extended
$\epsilon$-Lorenz system we find a scaling relation between the dissipation
strength $ \epsilon $ and Reynolds number parameter r . It results from the
scale covariance, we impose on the Lorenz equations under arbitrary rescalings
of all its dynamical coordinates. Its integrable limit, ($ \epsilon = 0 $, \
fixed r), which is described in terms of intersecting Quadratic Nambu
"Hamiltonians" Surfaces, gets mapped on the infinite value limit of the
Reynolds number parameter (r $\rightarrow \infty,\ \epsilon= 1$). In effect
weak dissipation, through small $\epsilon$ values, generates and controls the
well explored Route to Chaos in the large r-value regime. The non-dissipative
$\epsilon=0 $ integrable limit is therefore the gateway to Chaos for the Lorenz
system.
