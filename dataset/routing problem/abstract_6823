We present a parametrized study of the effects of free thermal neutron
injection on primordial nucleosynthesis, where both the rate and the time scale
of injection are varied. This generic approach is found to yield a successful
solution for reducing the 7Li abundance without causing significant problems to
other elemental abundances. Our analysis demonstrates that hadronic injection,
possibly due to decays or annihilations of dark matter particles with a mass of
about 1 to 30 GeV, provides a possible solution to an outstanding problem in
the standard Big Bang model.
