A classical problem in algebraic deformation theory is whether an
infinitesimal deformation can be extended to a formal deformation. The answer
to this question is usually given in terms of Massey powers. If all Massey
powers of the cohomology class determined by the infinitesimal deformation
vanish, then the deformation extends to a formal one. We consider another
approach to this problem, by constructing a miniversal deformation of the
algebra. One advantage of this approach is that it answers not only the
question of existence, but gives a construction of an extension as well.
