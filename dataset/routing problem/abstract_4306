The inverse spectral problem is solved for the class of Sturm-Liouville
operators with singular real-valued potentials from the space $W^{-1}_2(0,1)$.
The potential is recovered via the eigenvalues and the corresponding norming
constants. The reconstruction algorithm is presented and its stability proved.
Also, the set of all possible spectral data is explicitly described and the
isospectral sets are characterized.
