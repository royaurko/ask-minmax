This paper investigates the decay rate of the probability that the row sum of
a triangular array of truncated heavy tailed random variables is larger than an
integer (k) times the truncating threshold, as both - the number of summands
and the threshold go to infinity. The method of attack for this problem is
significantly different from the one where k is not an integer, and requires
much sharper estimates.
