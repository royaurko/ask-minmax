Coupled oscillators are prevalent throughout the physical world. Dynamical
system formulations of weakly coupled oscillator systems have proven effective
at capturing the properties of real-world systems. However, these formulations
usually deal with the `forward problem': simulating a system from known
coupling parameters. Here we provide a solution to the `inverse problem':
determining the coupling parameters from measurements. Starting from the
dynamic equations of a system of coupled phase oscillators, given by a
nonlinear Langevin equation, we derive the corresponding equilibrium
distribution. This formulation leads us to the maximum entropy distribution
that captures pair-wise phase relationships. To solve the inverse problem for
this distribution, we derive a closed form solution for estimating the phase
coupling parameters from observed phase statistics. Through simulations, we
show that the algorithm performs well in high dimensions (d=100) and in cases
with limited data (as few as 100 samples per dimension). Because the
distribution serves as the unique maximum entropy solution for pairwise phase
statistics, the distribution and estimation technique can be broadly applied to
phase coupling estimation in any system of phase oscillators.
