The problem of finding a martingale on a manifold with a fixed random
terminal value can be solved by considering BSDEs with a generator with
quadratic growth. We study here a generalization of these equations and we give
uniqueness and existence results in two different frameworks, using
differential geometry tools. Applications to PDEs are given, including a
certain class of Dirichlet problems on manifolds.
