Market-based mechanisms such as auctions are being studied as an appropriate
means for resource allocation in distributed and mulitagent decision problems.
When agents value resources in combination rather than in isolation, they must
often deliberate about appropriate bidding strategies for a sequence of
auctions offering resources of interest. We briefly describe a discrete dynamic
programming model for constructing appropriate bidding policies for resources
exhibiting both complementarities and substitutability. We then introduce a
continuous approximation of this model, assuming that money (or the numeraire
good) is infinitely divisible. Though this has the potential to reduce the
computational cost of computing policies, value functions in the transformed
problem do not have a convenient closed form representation. We develop {em
grid-based} approximation for such value functions, representing value
functions using piecewise linear approximations. We show that these methods can
offer significant computational savings with relatively small cost in solution
quality.
