In the context of quintessence, the concept of tracking solutions allows to
address the fine-tuning and coincidence problems. When the field is on tracks
today, one has $Q\approx m_{\rm Pl}$ demonstrating that, generically, any
realistic model of quintessence must be based on supergravity. We construct the
most simple model for which the scalar potential is positive. The scalar
potential deduced from the supergravity model has the form
$V(Q)=\frac{\Lambda^{4+\alpha}}{Q^{\alpha}}e^{\frac{\kappa}{2}Q^2}$. We show
that despite the appearence of positive powers of the field, the coincidence
problem is still solved. If $\alpha \ge 11$, the fine-tuning problem can be
overcome. Moreover, due to the presence of the exponential term, the value of
the equation of state, $\omega_Q$, is pushed towards the value -1 in contrast
to the usual case for which it is difficult to go beyond $\omega_Q\approx
-0.7$. For $\Omega_{\rm m}\approx 0.3$, the model presented here predicts
$\omega_Q\approx -0.82$. Finally, we establish the $\Omega_{\rm m}-\omega_Q$
relation for this model.
