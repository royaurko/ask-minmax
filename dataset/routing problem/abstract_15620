I discuss the conformal approach to the numerical simulation of radiating
isolated systems in general relativity. The method is based on conformal
compactification and a reformulation of the Einstein equations in terms of
rescaled variables, the so-called ``conformal field equations'' developed by
Friedrich. These equations allow to include ``infinity'' on a finite grid,
solving regular equations, whose solutions give rise to solutions of the
Einstein equations of (vacuum) general relativity. The conformal approach
promises certain advantages, in particular with respect to the treatment of
radiation extraction and boundary conditions. I will discuss the essential
features of the analytical approach to the problem, previous work on the
problem - in particular a code for simulations in 3+1 dimensions, some new
results, open problems and strategies for future work.
