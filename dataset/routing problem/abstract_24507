The investigation of light nuclei with ab-initio methods provides an optimal
setting to probe our knowledge on nuclear forces, because the few-nucleon
problem can be solved accurately. Nucleons interact not only in pairs but also
via many-body forces. Theoretical efforts need to be taken towards the
identification of nuclear observables sensitive to the less known many-nucleon
forces. Electromagnetic reactions can potentially provide useful information on
this. We present results on photo-absorption and electron scattering off light
nuclei, emphasizing the role of three-body forces and the comparison with
experimental data. On the other hand, reactions induced by weak probes, like
neutrino interactions with nucleonic matter, are relevant to astrophysics and
can be calculated with few-body techniques. In this case, since often no
experiment is possible, ab-initio predictions provide valuable input for
astrophysical simulations.
