In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of graph resilience. The
(local) resilience of a graph G with respect to a property P measures how much
one has to change G (locally) in order to destroy P. Estimating the resilience
leads to many new and challenging problems. Here we focus on random and
pseudo-random graphs and prove several sharp results.
