We investigate the influence of the thermal properties of the boundaries in
turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection on analytical bounds on convective heat
transport. Using the Doering-Constantin background flow method, we
systematically formulate a bounding principle on the Nusselt-Rayleigh number
relationship for general mixed thermal boundary conditions of constant Biot
number \eta which continuously interpolates between the previously studied
fixed temperature ($\eta = 0$) and fixed flux ($\eta = \infty$) cases, and
derive explicit asymptotic and rigorous bounds. Introducing a control parameter
R as a measure of the driving which is in general different from the usual
Rayleigh number Ra, we find that for each $\eta > 0$, as R increases the bound
on the Nusselt number Nu approaches that for the fixed flux problem.
Specifically, for $0 < \eta \leq \infty$ and for sufficiently large R ($R > R_s
= O(\eta^{-2})$ for small \eta) the Nusselt number is bounded as $Nu \leq
c(\eta) R^{1/3} \leq C Ra^{1/2}$, where C is an \eta-independent constant. In
the $R \to \infty$ limit, the usual fixed temperature assumption is thus a
singular limit of this general bounding problem.
