The aim of this paper is twofold: to prove, for L^1-data, the existence and
uniqueness of an entropy solution to the obstacle problem for nonlinear
elliptic equations with variable growth, and to show some convergence and
stability properties of the corresponding coincidence set. The latter follow
from extending the Lewy--Stampacchia inequalities to the general framework of
L^1.
