We study algorithms for the Submodular Multiway Partition problem (SubMP). An
instance of SubMP consists of a finite ground set $V$, a subset of $k$ elements
$S = \{s_1,s_2,...,s_k\}$ called terminals, and a non-negative submodular set
function $f:2^V\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ on $V$ provided as a value oracle. The
goal is to partition $V$ into $k$ sets $A_1,...,A_k$ such that for $1 \le i \le
k$, $s_i \in A_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^k f(A_i)$ is minimized. SubMP generalizes
some well-known problems such as the Multiway Cut problem in graphs and
hypergraphs, and the Node-weighed Multiway Cut problem in graphs. SubMP for
arbitrarysubmodular functions (instead of just symmetric functions) was
considered by Zhao, Nagamochi and Ibaraki \cite{ZhaoNI05}. Previous algorithms
were based on greedy splitting and divide and conquer strategies. In very
recent work \cite{ChekuriE11} we proposed a convex-programming relaxation for
SubMP based on the Lov\'asz-extension of a submodular function and showed its
applicability for some special cases. In this paper we obtain the following
results for arbitrary submodular functions via this relaxation. (i) A
2-approximation for SubMP. This improves the $(k-1)$-approximation from
\cite{ZhaoNI05} and (ii) A $(1.5-1/k)$-approximation for SubMP when $f$ is
symmetric. This improves the $2(1-1/k)$-approximation from
\cite{Queyranne99,ZhaoNI05}.
