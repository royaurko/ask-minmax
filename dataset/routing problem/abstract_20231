The f-invariant is an injective homomorphism from the 2-line of the
Adams-Novikov spectral sequence to a group which is closely related to divided
congruences of elliptic modular forms. We compute the f-invariant for two
infinite families of beta-elements and explain the relation of the arithmetic
of divided congruences with the Kervaire invariant one problem.
