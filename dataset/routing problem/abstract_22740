The controversial problem of an isolated system with an internal adiabatic
wall is investigated with the use of a simple microscopic model and the
Boltzmann equation. In the case of two infinite volume one-dimensional ideal
fluids separated by a piston whose mass is equal to the mass of the fluid
particles we obtain a rigorous explicit stationary non-equilibrium solution of
the Boltzmann equation. It is shown that at equal pressures on both sides of
the piston, the temperature difference induces a non-zero average velocity,
oriented toward the region of higher temperature. It thus turns out that
despite the absence of macroscopic forces the asymmetry of fluctuations results
in a systematic macroscopic motion. This remarkable effect is analogous to the
dynamics of stochastic ratchets, where fluctuations conspire with spatial
anisotropy to generate direct motion. However, a different mechanism is
involved here. The relevance of the discovered motion to the adiabatic piston
problem is discussed.
