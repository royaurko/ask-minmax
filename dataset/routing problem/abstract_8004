One of the outstanding problems of philosophy of science and mathematics
today is whether there is just "one" unique mathematics or the same can be

problem is offered here. This will allow us to appreciate the manner in which
mathematics acts as an exact and precise language of nature. This has
significant implications for Artificial Intelligence.
