In this note we investigate the existence of flat orthogonal matrices, i.e.
real orthogonal matrices with all entries having absolute value close to
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$. Entries of $\pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ correspond to
Hadamard matrices, so the question of existence of flat orthogonal matrices can
be viewed as a relaxation of the Hadamard problem.
