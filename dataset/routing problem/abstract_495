In the mobile ad hoc networks the major role is played by the routing
protocols in order to route the data from one mobile node to another mobile
node. But in such mobile networks, routing protocols are vulnerable to various
kinds of security attacks such as blackhole node attacks. The routing protocols
of MANET are unprotected and hence resulted into the network with the malicious
mobile nodes in the network. These malicious nodes in the network are basically
acts as attacks in the network. In this paper, we modify the existing DSR
protocol with the functionality of attacks detection without affecting overall
performance of the network. Also, we are considering the various attacks on
mobile ad hoc network called blackhole attack, flooding attack and show the
comparative analysis of these attacks using network simulator ns-2.
