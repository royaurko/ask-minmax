In this work we present the implementation of generators for W and Z bosons
in association with two jets interfaced to parton showers using the POWHEG BOX.
We incorporate matrix elements from the parton-level Monte Carlo program MCFM
in the POWHEG BOX, allowing for a considerable improvement in speed compared to
previous implementations. We address certain problems that arise when processes
that are singular at the Born level are implemented in a shower framework using
either a generation cut or a Born suppression factor to yield weighted events.
In such a case, events with very large weights can be generated after the
shower through a number of mechanisms. Events with very small transverse
momentum at the Born level can develop large transverse momentum either after
the hardest emission, after the shower, or after the inclusion of multi-parton
interactions. We present a solution to this problem that can be easily
implemented in the POWHEG BOX. We also show that a full solution to this
problem can only be achieved if the generator maintains physical validity also
when the transverse momentum of the emitted partons becomes unresolved. One
such scheme is the recently-proposed MiNLO method for the choice of scale and
the exponentiation of Sudakov form factors in NLO computations. We present a
validation study of our generators, by comparing their output to available LHC
data.
