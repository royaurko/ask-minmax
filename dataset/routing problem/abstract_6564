We show set of transformations which allow to obtain analytic solutions in
several quantum-optical problems. We start with the ion-laser (time dependent)
interaction, continue with the problem of a slow atom interacting with a
quantized field to end with a master equation that describes losses. In all
cases it is shown that one may find useful transformations that simplify the
problems.
