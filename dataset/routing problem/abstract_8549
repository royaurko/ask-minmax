Boundary problem for linear partial differential algebraic equations system
with multiple characteristic curves is considered. It is supposed that
matrix-functions pencil of the system under consideration is smoothly
equivalent to special canonical form. For this problem, with the help of the
spline collocation method, a difference scheme of arbitrary degree of
approximation with respect to each variable is constructed. Sufficient
conditions for its absolute stability is found.
