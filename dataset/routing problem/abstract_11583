We give a class of three-dimensional Stein spaces W together with a
hypersurface H, such that the complement W-H is not Stein, but such that for
every analytic surface S \subset W the complement S-S \cap H is Stein. This
class is constructed using forcing equations and gives new counter-examples to
the hypersection problem.
