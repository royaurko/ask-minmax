It is known since the works of Zariski in early 40ies that desingularization
of varieties along valuations (called local uniformization of valuations) can
be considered as the local part of the desingularization problem. It is still
an open problem if local uniformization exists in positive characteristic and
dimension larger than three. In this paper, we prove that Zariski local
uniformization of algebraic varieties is always possible after a purely
inseparable extension of the field of rational functions, i.e. any valuation
can be uniformized by a purely inseparable alteration.
