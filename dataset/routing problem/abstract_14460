Computing an optimal chain of fragments is a classical problem in string
algorithms, with important applications in computational biology. There exist
two efficient dynamic programming algorithms solving this problem, based on
different principles. In the present note, we show how it is possible to
combine the principles of two of these algorithms in order to design a hybrid
dynamic programming algorithm that combines the advantages of both algorithms.
