We prove Manin's conjecture for a split singular quartic del Pezzo surface
with singularity type $2\Aone$ and eight lines. This is achieved by equipping
the surface with a conic bundle structure. To handle the sum over the family of
conics, we prove a result of independent interest on a certain restricted
divisor problem for four binary linear forms.
