We study the geometry of the critical clusters in fully coordinated
percolation on the square lattice. By Monte Carlo simulations (static
exponents) and normal mode analysis (dynamic exponents), we find that this
problem is in the same universality class with ordinary percolation statically
but not so dynamically. We show that there are large differences in the number
and distribution of the interior sites between the two problems which may
account for the different dynamic nature.
