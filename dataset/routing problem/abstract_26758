In a series of papers \cite{BRV1}, \cite{BRV2}, \cite{BRV3} we introduced
full quivers and pseudo-quivers of representations of algebras, and used them
as tools in describing PI-varieties of algebras. In this paper we apply them to
obtain a complete proof of Belov's solution of Specht's problem for affine
algebras over an arbitrary Noetherian ring. The inductive step relies on a
theorem that enables one to find a "$\bar q$-characteristic
coefficient-absorbing polynomial in each T-ideal $\Gamma$," i.e., a
non-identity of the representable algebra $A$ arising from $\Gamma$, whose
ideal of evaluations in $A$ is closed under multiplication by $\bar q$-powers
of the characteristic coefficients of matrices corresponding to the generators
of $A$, where $\bar q$ is a suitably large power of the order of the base
field. The passage to an arbitrary Noetherian base ring $C$ involves localizing
at finitely many elements a kind of $C$, and reducing to the field case by a
local-global principle.
