We have employed a new route to synthesize single phase F-doped LaOFeAs
compound and confirmed the superconductivity above 20 K in this Fe-based
system. We show that the new superconductor has a rather high upper critical
field of about 54 T. A clear signature of superconducting gap opening below
T$_c$ was observed in the far-infrared reflectance spectra, with
2$\Delta/\textit{k}T_c\approx$3.5-4.2. Furthermore, we show that the new
superconductor has electron-type conducting carrier with a rather low carrier
density.
