Different mechanisms for the creation of strange non-chaotic dynamics in the
quasiperiodically forced logistic map are studied. These routes to strange
nonchaos are characterised through the behavior of the largest nontrivial
Lyapunov exponent, as well as through the characteristic distributions of
finite time Lyapunov exponents. Strange nonchaotic attractors can be created at
a saddle-node bifurcation when the dynamics shows Type-I intermittency; this
intermittent transition, which is studied in detail, is characterised through
scaling exponents. Band-merging crises through which dynamics remains
nonchaotic are also studied, and correspondence is made with analogous behavior
in the unforced logistic map. Robustness of these phenomena with respect to
additive noise is investigated.
