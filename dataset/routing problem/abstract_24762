We quantize the massless p-form field that obeys the generalized Maxwell
field equations in curved spacetimes of dimension n > 1. We begin by showing
that the classical Cauchy problem of the generalized Maxwell field is well
posed and that the field possess the expected gauge invariance. Then the
classical phase space is developed in terms of gauge equivalent classes, first
in terms of the Cauchy data and then reformulated in terms of Maxwell
solutions. The latter is employed to quantize the field in the framework of
Dimock. Finally, the resulting algebra of observables is shown to satisfy the
wave equation with the usual canonical commutation relations.
