We show that Casimir-force calculations for a finite number of
non-overlapping obstacles can be mapped onto quantum-mechanical billiard-type
problems which are characterized by the scattering of a fictitious point
particle off the very same obstacles. With the help of a modified Krein trace
formula the genuine/finite part of the Casimir energy is determined as the
energy-weighted integral over the log-determinant of the multi-scattering
matrix of the analog billiard problem. The formalism is self-regulating and
inherently shows that the Casimir energy is governed by the infrared end of the
multi-scattering phase shifts or spectrum of the fluctuating field. The
calculation is exact and in principle applicable for any separation(s) between
the obstacles. In practice, it is more suited for large- to medium-range
separations. We report especially about the Casimir energy of a fluctuating
massless scalar field between two spheres or a sphere and a plate under
Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. But the formalism can easily be
extended to any number of spheres and/or planes in three or arbitrary
dimensions, with a variety of boundary conditions or non-overlapping
potentials/non-ideal reflectors.
