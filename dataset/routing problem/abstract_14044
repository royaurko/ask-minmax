We find a new regularization scheme which is motivated by the Bose-Einstein
condensation. The energy of the virtual particle is considered as discrete.
Summing them and regulating the summation by the Riemann $\zeta$ function can
give the result of loop integral. All the divergences vanish, we can get almost
the same results as Dimensional Regularization. The prediction beyond
Dimensional Regularization is also shown in the QED. The hierarchy problem of
the radiative correction of scalar mass completely vanish.
