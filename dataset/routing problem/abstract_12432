We investigate an approach to matroid complexity that involves describing a
matroid via a list of independent sets, bases, circuits, or some other family
of subsets of the ground set. The computational complexity of algorithmic
problems under this scheme appears to be highly dependent on the choice of
input-type. We define an order on the various methods of description, and we
show how this order acts upon ten types of input. We also show that under this
approach several natural algorithmic problems for matroids are complete in
classes thought not to be equal to P.
