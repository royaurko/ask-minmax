This thesis addresses the foundational aspects of formal methods for
applications in security and in particular in anonymity. More concretely, we
develop frameworks for the specification of anonymity properties and propose
algorithms for their verification. Since in practice anonymity protocols always
leak some information, we focus on quantitative properties, which capture the
amount of information leaked by a protocol.
  The main contribution of this thesis is cpCTL, the first temporal logic that
allows for the specification and verification of conditional probabilities
(which are the key ingredient of most anonymity properties). In addition, we
have considered several prominent definitions of information-leakage and
developed the first algorithms allowing us to compute (and even approximate)
the information leakage of anonymity protocols according to these definitions.
We have also studied a well-known problem in the specification and analysis of
distributed anonymity protocols, namely full-information scheduling. To
overcome this problem, we have proposed an alternative notion of scheduling and
adjusted accordingly several anonymity properties from the literature. Our last
major contribution is a debugging technique that helps on the detection of
flaws in security protocols.
