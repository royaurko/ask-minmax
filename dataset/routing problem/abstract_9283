We describe an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm for a restricted class of
scattering problems in radiation transfer. This class includes many
astrophysically interesting problems, including the scattering of ultraviolet
and visible light by grains. The algorithm correctly accounts for
multiply-scattered light. We describe the algorithm, present a number of
important optimizations, and explicity show how the algorithm can be used to
estimate quantities such as the emergent and mean intensity. We present two
test cases, examine the importance of the optimizations, and show that this
algorithm can be usefully applied to optically-thin problems, a regime
sometimes considered limited to explicit single-scattering plus attenuation
approximations.
