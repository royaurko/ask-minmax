We study the Robin boundary-value problem for bounded domains with isolated
singularities. Because for such domains trace spaces of space $H^1(D)$ on its
boundaries are weighted Sobolev spaces $L^{2, \xi}(\partial D)$ existence and
uniqueness of corresponding Robin boundary-value problems depends on properties
of embedding operators $I_1: H^{1}(D)\to L^{2}(D)$ and $I_{2}:H^{1}(D)\to
L^{2,\xi}(\partial D)$ i.e. on type of singularities. We obtain an exact
description of the weights $\xi$ for bounded domains with 'outside peaks' on
its boundaries. This result allows us to formulate correctly the corresponding
Robin boundary-value problems for elliptic operators.
