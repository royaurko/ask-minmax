In line with the study presented in the part I of this paper, the structure
of a laminar rich premixed methane flame doped with 1,3-butadiene has been
investigated. The flame contains 20.7% (molar) of methane, 31.4% of oxygen and
3.3% of 1,3-butadiene, corresponding to an equivalence ratio of 1.8, and a
ratio C4H6 / CH4 of 16 %. The flame has been stabilized on a burner at a
pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant, with a gas velocity at the burner
of 36 cm/s at 333 K. The temperature ranged from 600 K close to the burner up
to 2150 K. Quantified species included usual methane C0-C2 combustion products
and 1,3-butadiene, but also propyne, allene, propene, propane, 1,2-butadiene,
butynes, vinylacetylene, diacetylene, 1,3-pentadiene, 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene
(isoprene), 1-pentene, 3-methyl-1-butene, benzene and toluene. In order to
model these new results, some improvements have been made to a mechanism
previously developed in our laboratory for the reactions of C3-C4 unsaturated
hydrocarbons. The main reaction pathways of consumption of 1,3-butadiene and of
formation of C6 aromatic species have been derived from flow rate analyses. In
this case, the C4 route to benzene formation plays an important role in
comparison to the C3 pathway.
