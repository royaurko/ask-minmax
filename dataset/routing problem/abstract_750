The advent and development in the field of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in
recent years has seen the growth of extremely small and low-cost sensors that
possess sensing, signal processing and wireless communication capabilities.
These sensors can be expended at a much lower cost and are capable of detecting
conditions such as temperature, sound, security or any other system. A good
protocol design should be able to scale well both in energy heterogeneous and
homogeneous environment, meet the demands of different application scenarios
and guarantee reliability. On this basis, we have compared six different
protocols of different scenarios which are presenting their own schemes of
energy minimizing, clustering and route selection in order to have more
effective communication. This research is motivated to have an insight that
which of the under consideration protocols suit well in which application and
can be a guide-line for the design of a more robust and efficient protocol.
MATLAB simulations are performed to analyze and compare the performance of
LEACH, multi-level hierarchal LEACH and multihop LEACH.
