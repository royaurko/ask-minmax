Based on reasonable testing model problems, we study the preservation by
symplectic Runge-Kutta method (SRK) and symplectic partitioned Runge-Kutta
method (SPRK) of structures for fixed points of linear Hamiltonian systems. The
structure-preservation region provides a practical criterion for choosing
step-size in symplectic computation. Examples are given to justify the
investigation.
