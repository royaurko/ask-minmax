In the presented article we present an algorithm for the computation of
ground state spin configurations for the 2d random bond Ising model on planar
triangular lattice graphs. Therefore, it is explained how the respective ground
state problem can be mapped to an auxiliary minimum-weight perfect matching
problem, solvable in polynomial time. Consequently, the ground state properties
as well as minimum-energy domain wall (MEDW) excitations for very large 2d
systems, e.g. lattice graphs with up to N=384x384 spins, can be analyzed very
fast. Here, we investigate the critical behavior of the corresponding T=0
ferromagnet to spin-glass transition, signaled by a breakdown of the
magnetization, using finite-size scaling analyses of the magnetization and MEDW
excitation energy and we contrast our numerical results with previous
simulations and presumably exact results.
