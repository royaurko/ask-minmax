We consider an American put option under the CEV process. This corresponds to
a free boundary problem for a PDE. We show that this free bondary satisfies a
nonlinear integral equation, and analyze it in the limit of small $\rho$ = $2r/
\sigma^2$, where $r$ is the interest rate and $\sigma$ is the volatility. We
use perturbation methods to find that the free boundary behaves differently for
five ranges of time to expiry.
