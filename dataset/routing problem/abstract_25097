In order to produce high dynamic range images in radio interferometry, bright
extended sources need to be removed with minimal error. However, this is not a
trivial task because the Fourier plane is sampled only at a finite number of
points. The ensuing deconvolution problem has been solved in many ways, mainly
by algorithms based on CLEAN. However, such algorithms that use image pixels as
basis functions have inherent limitations and by using an orthonormal basis
that span the whole image, we can overcome them. The construction of such an
orthonormal basis involves fine tuning of many free parameters that define the
basis functions. The optimal basis for a given problem (or a given extended
source) is not guaranteed. In this paper, we discuss the use of generalized
prolate spheroidal wave functions as a basis. Given the geometry (or the region
of interest) of an extended source and the sampling points on the visibility
plane, we can construct the optimal basis to model the source. Not only does
this gives us the minimum number of basis functions required but also the
artifacts outside the region of interest are minimized.
