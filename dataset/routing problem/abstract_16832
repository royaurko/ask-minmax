We investigate performance limits of a multiple access communication system
with energy harvesting nodes where the utility function is taken to be the
long-term average sum-throughput. We assume a causal structure for energy
arrivals and study the problem in the continuous time regime. For this setting,
we first characterize a storage dam model that captures the dynamics of a
battery with energy harvesting and variable transmission power. Using this
model, we next establish an upper bound on the throughput problem as a function
of battery capacity. We also formulate a non-linear optimization problem to
determine optimal achievable power policies for transmitters. Applying a
calculus of variation technique, we then derive Euler-Lagrange equations as
necessary conditions for optimum power policies in terms of a system of coupled
partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs). Based on a Gauss-Seidel
algorithm, we devise an iterative algorithm to solve these equations. We also
propose a fixed-point algorithm for the symmetric multiple access setting in
which the statistical descriptions of energy harvesters are identical. Along
with the analysis and to support our iterative algorithms, comprehensive
numerical results are also obtained.
