No realistic black holes localized on a 3-brane in the Randall-Sundrum
infinite braneworld have been found so far. The problem of finding a static
black hole solution is reduced to a boundary value problem. We solve it by
means of a numerical method, and show numerical examples of a localized black
hole whose horizon radius is small compared to the bulk curvature scale. The
sequence of small localized black holes exhibits a smooth transition from a
five-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole, which is a solution in the limit of
small horizon radius. The localized black hole tends to flatten as its horizon
radius increases. However, it becomes difficult to find black hole solutions as
its horizon radius increases.
