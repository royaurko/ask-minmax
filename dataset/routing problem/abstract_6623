In this paper we show existence of finite energy solutions for the Cauchy
problem associated with a semilinear wave equation with interior damping and
supercritical source terms. The main contribution consists in dealing with
super-supercritical source terms (terms of the order of $|u|^p$ with $p\geq 5$
in $n=3$ dimensions), an open and highly recognized problem in the literature
on nonlinear wave equations.
