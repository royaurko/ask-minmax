We propose a new class of fundamental solutions for the numerical analysis of
boundary value problems for the Maxwell equations. We prove completeness of
systems of such fundamental solutions in appropriate Sobolev spaces on a smooth
boundary and support the relevancy of our approach by numerical results.
