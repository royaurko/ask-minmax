We rediscuss a nonequilibrium x-ray edge problem which in recent publications
led to discrepancies between the results of the perturbative and of an extended
Nozieres-De Dominicis approach. We show that the this problem results from an
uncritical separation of momenta of the scattering potential, and we propose a
corrected Nozieres-De Dominicis solution.
