We solve two open problems regarding the classification of certain classes of
Cayley graphs with integer eigenvalues. We first classify all finite groups
that have a "non-trivial" Cayley graph with integer eigenvalues, thus solving a
problem proposed by Abdollahi and Jazaeri. The notion of Cayley integral groups
was introduced by Klotz and Sander. These are groups for which every Cayley
graph has only integer eigenvalues. In the second part of the paper, all Cayley
integral groups are determined.
