In a recent paper S. Friedland and the contributor presented a formal expression
for Lambda_d(p) of the monomer-dimer problem in d dimensions involving a power
series in p. We there presented the result of computations for the terms in the
power series through the sixth power. I herein present the result for the
seventh power term, in d = 2. An interesting feature of the new computation is
that it would have been impossible without a new algorithm for computation of
the Tutte polynomial, by Bjorklund, Husfeldt, Kaski, and Koivisto.
