We study a nonlinear regression problem of fitting a circle (or a circular
arc) to scattered data. We prove that under any standard assumptions on the
statistical distribution of errors that are commonly adopted in the literature,
the estimates of the circle center and radius have infinite moments. We also
discuss methodological implications of this fact.
