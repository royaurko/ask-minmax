A problem of the gauge-mediated SUSY breaking model is its difficulty to
generate a natural value of mu/Bmu, while the NMSSM is a natural framework to
solve the mu/Bmu problem. The NMSSM in gauge-mediated SUSY breaking in its
original form does not work well since the singlet field cannot develop a
desired vacuum expectation value. It also suffers from the cosmological domain
wall problem. We study an extension of the model to include additional
vector-like matter, which is charged under the hidden QCD. It is shown that
this simple extension solves both the problems. We study phenomenological and
cosmological implications of this extended models. The lightest Higgs mass can
be as large as 130-140 GeV for some model points.
