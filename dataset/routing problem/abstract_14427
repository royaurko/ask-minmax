Let $u$ be a plurisubharmonic function. We prove the existence of a nonzero
holomorphic function such that the logarithm of its modulus is not more than
local averages of this function $u$. This is the abstract for scientific
conference "Algebra, Analysis and Related Problems of Mathematical Modeling"
(Vladikavkaz, June 26-27, 2015) dedicated to the 60th anniversary of Professor,
Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences Vladimir A. Koibaev
