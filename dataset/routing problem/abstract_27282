Parametric timed automata extend timed automata (Alur and Dill, 1991) in that
they allow the specification of parametric bounds on the clock values. Since
their introduction in 1993 by Alur, Henzinger, and Vardi, it is known that the
emptiness problem for parametric timed automata with one clock is decidable,
whereas it is undecidable if the automaton uses three or more parametric
clocks. The problem is open for parametric timed automata with two parametric
clocks. Metric temporal logic, MTL for short, is a widely used specification
language for real-time systems. MTL-model checking of timed automata is
decidable, no matter how many clocks are used in the timed automaton. In this
paper, we prove that MTL-model checking for parametric timed automata is
undecidable, even if the automaton uses only one clock and one parameter and is
deterministic.
