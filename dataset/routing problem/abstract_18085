Leray and G{\aa}rding have developed a multiplier technique for deriving a
priori estimates for solutions to scalar hyperbolic equations in either the
whole space or the torus. In particular, the arguments in Leray and
G{\aa}rding's work provide with at least one local multiplier and one local
energy functional that is controlled along the evolution. The existence of such
a local multiplier is the starting point of the argument by Rauch for the
derivation of semigroup estimates for hyperbolic initial boundary value
problems. In this article, we explain how this multiplier technique can be
adapted to the framework of finite difference approximations of transport
equations. The technique applies to numerical schemes with arbitrarily many
time levels, and encompasses a somehow magical trick that has been known for a
long time for the leapfrog scheme. More importantly, the existence and
properties of the local multiplier enable us to derive optimal semigroup
estimates for fully discrete hyperbolic initial boundary value problems, which
answers a problem raised by Trefethen, Kreiss and Wu.
