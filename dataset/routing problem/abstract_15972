Many physical systems can be adequately modelled using a second order
approximation. The problem of plant identification reduces to the problem of
estimating the position of a single pair of complex conjugate poles. One
approach to the problem is to apply the method of least squares to the time
domain data. This type of computation is best carried out in "batch" mode and
applies to an entire data set. Another approach would be to design an adaptive
filter and to use autoregressive, AR, techniques. This would be well suited to
continuous real-time data and could track slow changes on the underlying plant.
I this paper we present a very fast but approximate technique for the
estimation of the position of a single pair of complex conjugate poles, using
the Hilbert transform to reconstruct the analytic signal.
