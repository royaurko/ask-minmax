We survey known results about the complexity of surjective homomorphism
problems, studied in the context of related problems in the literature such as
list homomorphism, retraction and compaction. In comparison with these
problems, surjective homomorphism problems seem to be harder to classify and we
examine especially three concrete problems that have arisen from the
literature, two of which remain of open complexity.
