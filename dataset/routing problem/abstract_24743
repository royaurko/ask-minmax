Let $X_1,...,X_n$ be i.i.d. observations, where $X_i=Y_i+\sigma_n Z_i$ and
the $Y$'s and $Z$'s are independent. Assume that the $Y$'s are unobservable and
that they have the density $f$ and also that the $Z$'s have a known density
$k.$ Furthermore, let $\sigma_n$ depend on $n$ and let $\sigma_n\to 0$ as
$n\to\infty.$ We consider the deconvolution problem, i.e. the problem of
estimation of the density $f$ based on the sample $X_1,...,X_n.$ A popular
estimator of $f$ in this setting is the deconvolution kernel density estimator.
We derive its asymptotic normality under two different assumptions on the
relation between the sequence $\sigma_n$ and the sequence of bandwidths $h_n.$
We also consider several simulation examples which illustrate different types
of asymptotics corresponding to the derived theoretical results and which show
that there exist situations where models with $\sigma_n\to 0$ have to be
preferred to the models with fixed $\sigma.$
