In this paper we define a restricted version of Monotone NAE-3SAT and show
that it remains NP-Complete even under that restriction. We expect this result
would be useful in proving NP-Completeness results for problems on
$k$-colourable graphs ($k \ge 5$). We also prove the NP-Completeness of the
Triangle-Free Cut problem.
