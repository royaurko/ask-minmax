We consider the stochastic control problem of a financial trader that needs
to unwind a large asset portfolio within a short period of time. The trader can
simultaneously submit active orders to a primary market and passive orders to a
dark pool. Our framework is flexible enough to allow for price-dependent impact
functions describing the trading costs in the primary market and
price-dependent adverse selection costs associated with dark pool trading. We
prove that the value function can be characterized in terms of the unique
smooth solution to a PDE with singular terminal value, establish its explicit
asymptotic behavior at the terminal time, and give the optimal trading strategy
in feedback form.
