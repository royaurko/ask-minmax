The blocking problem naturally arises in transportation systems as multiple
vehicles with different itineraries share available resources. In this paper,
we investigate the impact of the blocking problem to the waiting time at the
intersections of transportation systems. We assume that different vehicles,
depending on their Internet connection capabilities, may communicate their
intentions (e.g., whether they will turn left or right or continue straight) to
intersections (specifically to devices attached to traffic lights). We consider
that information collected by these devices are transmitted to and processed in
a cloud-based traffic control system. Thus, a cloud-based system, based on the
intention information, can calculate average waiting times at intersections. We
consider this problem as a queuing model, and we characterize average waiting
times by taking into account (i) blocking probability, and (ii) vehicles'
ability to communicate their intentions. Then, by using average waiting times
at intersection, we develop a shortest delay algorithm that calculates the
routes with shortest delays between two points in a transportation network. Our
simulation results confirm our analysis, and demonstrate that our shortest
delay algorithm significantly improves over baselines that are unaware of the
blocking problem.
