Based on the algebraico-categorical (:sheaf-theoretic and sheaf
cohomological) conceptual and technical machinery of Abstract Differential
Geometry, a new, genuinely background spacetime manifold independent, field
quantization scenario for vacuum Einstein gravity and free Yang-Mills theories
is introduced. The scheme is coined `third quantization' and, although it
formally appears to follow a canonical route, it is fully covariant, because it
is an expressly functorial `procedure'. Various current and future Quantum
Gravity research issues are discussed under the light of 3rd-quantization. A
postscript gives a brief account of this contributor's personal encounters with
Rafael Sorkin and his work.
