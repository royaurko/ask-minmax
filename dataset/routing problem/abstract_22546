We have analyzed the effects of photoelectric heating by dust grains in
photoionization models of planetary nebulae. We have shown that this process is
particularly important if planetary nebulae contain a population of small
grains. The presence of such grains would solve a number of problems that have
found no satisfactory solution so far: i) the thermal energy deficit in some
objects inferred from tailored photoionization modelling; ii) the large
negative temperature gradients inferred directly from spatially resolved
observations and indirectly from integrated spectra in some planetary nebulae;
iii) the fact that the temperatures derived from the Balmer jump are smaller
than those derived from [O III] 4363/5007; iv) the fact that the observed
intensities of [O I] 6300 are often larger than predicted by photoionization
models. In presence of moderate density inhomogeneities, such as inferred from
high resolution images of planetary nebulae, photoelectric heating would boost
the temperature of the tenuous component, which would then better confine the
clumps. The temperature structure of such dusty and filamentary nebulae would
solve the long standing problem of temperature fluctuations posed by Peimbert
(1967, ApJ, 150, 825).
