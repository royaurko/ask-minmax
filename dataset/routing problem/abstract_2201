Photonic metasurfaces are ultrathin electromagnetic wave-molding
metamaterials providing the missing link for the integration of nanophotonic
chips with nanoelectronic circuits. An extra twist in this field originates
from spin-optical metasurfaces providing the photon spin (polarization
helicity) as an additional degree of freedom in light-matter interactions at
the nanoscale. Here we report on a generic concept to control the photonic
transport by disordered (random) metasurfaces with a custom-tailored geometric
phase. This approach combines the peculiarity of random patterns to support
extraordinary information capacity within the intrinsic limit of speckle noise,
and the optical spin control in the geometric phase mechanism, simply
implemented in two-dimensional structured matter. By manipulating the local
orientations of anisotropic optical nanoantennas, we observe spin-dependent
near-field and free-space open channels, generating state-of-the-art
multiplexing and interconnects. Spin-optical disordered metasurfaces provide a
route for multitask wavefront shaping via a single ultrathin nanoscale photonic
device.
