A short overview of the direct reaction mechanism and the models used for the
analysis of such processes is given. Nuclear reactions proceeding through the
direct mechanism and involved in solar hydrogen burning are discussed. The
significance of these nuclear reactions with respect to the solar neutrino
problem is investigated.
