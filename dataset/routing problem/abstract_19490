By an exotic algebraic structure on the affine space ${\bf C}^n$ we mean a
smooth affine algebraic variety which is diffeomorphic to ${\bf R}^{2n}$ but
not isomorphic to ${\bf C}^n$. This is a survey of the recent developement on
the subject, which emphasizes its analytic aspects and points out some open
problems.
