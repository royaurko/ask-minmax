Problem: This paper addresses the design of an intelligent software system
for the IC (incident commander) of a team in order to coordinate actions of
agents (field units or robots) in the domain of emergency/crisis response
operations. Objective: This paper proposes GICoordinator. It is a GIS-based
assistant software agent that assists and collaborates with the human planner
in strategic planning and macro tasks assignment for centralized multi-agent
coordination. Method: Our approach to design GICoordinator was to: analyze the
problem, design a complete data model, design an architecture of GICoordinator,
specify required capabilities of human and system in coordination problem
solving, specify development tools, and deploy. Result: The result was an
architecture/design of GICoordinator that contains system requirements.
Findings: GICoordinator efficiently integrates geoinformatics with artifice
intelligent techniques in order to provide a spatial intelligent coordinator
system for an IC to efficiently coordinate and control agents by making
macro/strategic decisions. Results define a framework for future works to
develop this system.
