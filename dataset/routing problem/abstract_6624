This document contains several related specifications, together they describe
the document formats related to the solver competition which will be organized
by Mancoosi. In particular, this document describes: - DUDF (Distribution
Upgradeability Description Format), the document format to be used to submit
upgrade problem instances from user machines to a (distribution-specific)
database of upgrade problems; - CUDF (Common Upgradeability Description
Format), the document format used to encode upgrade problems, abstracting over
distribution-specific details. Solvers taking part in the competition will be
fed with input in CUDF format.
