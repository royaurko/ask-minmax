This paper presents GRT, a domain-independent heuristic planning system for
STRIPS worlds. GRT solves problems in two phases. In the pre-processing phase,
it estimates the distance between each fact and the goals of the problem, in a
backward direction. Then, in the search phase, these estimates are used in
order to further estimate the distance between each intermediate state and the
goals, guiding so the search process in a forward direction and on a best-first
basis. The paper presents the benefits from the adoption of opposite directions
between the preprocessing and the search phases, discusses some difficulties
that arise in the pre-processing phase and introduces techniques to cope with
them. Moreover, it presents several methods of improving the efficiency of the
heuristic, by enriching the representation and by reducing the size of the
problem. Finally, a method of overcoming local optimal states, based on domain
axioms, is proposed. According to it, difficult problems are decomposed into
easier sub-problems that have to be solved sequentially. The performance
results from various domains, including those of the recent planning
competitions, show that GRT is among the fastest planners.
