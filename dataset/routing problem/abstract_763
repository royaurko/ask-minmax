We develop a unified model to explain the dynamics of driven one dimensional
ribbon for materials with strain and magnetic order parameters. We show that
the model equations in their most general form explain several results on
driven magnetostrictive metallic glass ribbons such as the period doubling
route to chaos as a function of a dc magnetic field in the presence of a
sinusoidal field, the quasiperiodic route to chaos as a function of the
sinusoidal field for a fixed dc field, and induced and suppressed chaos in the
presence of an additional low amplitude near resonant sinusoidal field. We also
investigate the influence of a low amplitude near resonant field on the period
doubling route. The model equations also exhibit symmetry restoring crisis with
an exponent close to unity. The model can be adopted to explain certain results
on magnetoelastic beam and martensitic ribbon under sinusoidal driving
conditions. In the latter case, we find interesting dynamics of a periodic one
orbit switching between two equivalent wells as a function of an ac magnetic
field that eventually makes a direct transition to chaos under resonant driving
condition. The model is also applicable to magnetomartensites and materials
with two order parameters.
