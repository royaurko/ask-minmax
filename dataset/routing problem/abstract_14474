We establish simple connections between response functions of the dynamical
Dirac systems and $A$-amplitudes and Weyl functions of the spectral Dirac
systems. Using these connections we propose a new and rigorous procedure to
recover a general-type dynamical Dirac system from its response function as
well as a procedure to construct explicit solutions of this problem.
