We study the problem of a potential interaction of a finite-dimensional
Lagrangian system (an oscillator) with a linear infinite-dimensional one (a
thermostat). In spite of the energy preservation and the Lagrangian
(Hamiltonian) nature of the total system, under some natural assumptions the
final dynamics of the finite-dimensional component turns out to be simple while
the thermostat produces an effective dissipation.
