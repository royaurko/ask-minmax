It is shown that for "ideal" macroscopic objects there are superselection
rules forbidding superpositions of macroscopically distinguishable states of
the objects. For real macroscopic bodies the notion of "weak" superselection
rules is introduced. Some other aspects of the measurement problem are
discussed.
