We propose a fairly simple and natural extension of Stollmann's lemma to
correlated random variables. This extension allows (just as the original
Stollmann's lemma does) to obtain Wegner-type estimates even in some problems
of spectral analysis of random operators where the Wegner's lemma is
inapplicable (e.g. for multi-particle Hamiltonians).
