We consider the problem of approximation of density functions which is
important in the theory of pricing of basket options. Our method is well
adopted to the multidimensional case. Observe that implementations of
polynomial and spline approximation in this situation are connected with
difficulties of fundamental nature. A simple approximation formula for European
call options is presented. It is shown that this approximation formula has
exponential rate of convergence.
