We consider the problem of an heavy particle in a double well potential (DWP)
interacting with an electron bath. Under general assumptions, we map the
problem to a three-color logarithmic gas model, where the size of the core of
the charged particles is proportional to the tunneling time, $\tau_{tun}$, of
the heavy particle between the two wells. For times larger then $\tau_{tun}$
this model is equivalent to the anisotropic two-channel Kondo (2CK) model in a
transverse field. This allows us to establish a relationship between the
microscopic parameters of DWP and the 2CK problem. We show that the strong
coupling fixed point of the 2CK model can never be reached for the DWP problem,
in agreement with the results of Kagan and Prokof'ev, [Sov.Phys. JEPT, 69, 836
(1989)] and Aleiner et al., [Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 2629 (2001)].
