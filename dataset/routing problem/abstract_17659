In this paper, the transmission of an improper-complex second-order
stationary data sequence is considered over a strictly band-limited
frequency-selective channel. It is assumed that the transmitter employs linear
modulation and that the channel output is corrupted by additive proper-complex
cyclostationary noise. Under the average transmit power constraint, the problem
of minimizing the mean-squared error at the output of a widely linear receiver
is formulated in the time domain to find the optimal transmit and receive
waveforms. The optimization problem is converted into a frequency-domain
problem by using the vectorized Fourier transform technique and put into the
form of a double minimization. First, the widely linear receiver is optimized
that requires, unlike the linear receiver design with only one waveform, the
design of two receive waveforms. Then, the optimal transmit waveform for the
linear modulator is derived by introducing the notion of the impropriety
frequency function of a discrete-time random process and by performing a line
search combined with an iterative algorithm. The optimal solution shows that
both the periodic spectral correlation due to the cyclostationarity and the
symmetric spectral correlation about the origin due to the impropriety are well
exploited.
