The dynamics of real magnets is often governed by several interacting
processes taking place simultaneously at different length scales. For dynamical
simulations the relevant length scales should be coupled, and the energy
transfer accurately described. We show that in this case the micromagnetic
theory is not always reliable. We present a coarse-graining approach applicable
to nonlinear problems, which provides a unified description of all relevant
length scales, allowing a smooth, seamless coupling. The simulations performed
on model systems show that the coarse-graining approach achieves nearly the
precision of all-atom simulations.
