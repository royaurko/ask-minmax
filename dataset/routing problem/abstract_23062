Two fundamental laws are needed for prediction in the universe: (1) a basic
dynamical law and (2) a law for the cosmological initial condition. Quantum
cosmology is the area of basic research concerned with the search for a theory
of the initial cosmological state. The issues involved in this search are
presented in the form of eight problems. (To appear in Physics 2001, ed. by M.
