We demonstrate the applicability of a new PAINT method to speed up iterations
of interactive methods in multiobjective optimization. As our test case, we
solve a computationally expensive non-linear, five-objective problem of
designing and operating a wastewater treatment plant. The PAINT method
interpolates between a given set of Pareto optimal outcomes and constructs a
computationally inexpensive mixed integer linear surrogate problem for the
original problem. We develop an IND-NIMBUS(R) PAINT module to combine the
interactive NIMBUS method and the PAINT method and to find a preferred solution
to the original problem. With the PAINT method, the solution process with the
NIMBUS method take a comparatively short time even though the original problem
is computationally expensive.
