We consider the problem of minimizing queue-length costs in a system with
heterogenous parallel servers, operating in a many-server heavy-traffic regime
with nondegenerate slowdown. This regime is distinct from the well-studied
heavy traffic diffusion regimes, namely the (single server) conventional regime
and the (many-server) Halfin-Whitt regime. It has the distinguishing property
that waiting times and service times are of comparable magnitudes. We establish
an asymptotic lower bound on the cost and devise a sequence of policies that
asymptotically attain this bound. As in the conventional regime, the
asymptotics can be described by means of a Brownian control problem, the
solution of which exhibits a state space collapse.
