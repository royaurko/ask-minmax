We provide a simple linear time transformation from a directed or undirected
graph with labeled edges to an unlabeled digraph, such that paths in the input
graph in which no two consecutive edges have the same label correspond to paths
in the transformed graph and vice versa. Using this transformation, we provide
efficient algorithms for finding paths and cycles with no two consecutive equal
labels. We also consider related problems where the paths and cycles are
required to be simple; we find efficient algorithms for the undirected case of
these problems but show the directed case to be NP-complete. We apply our path
and cycle finding algorithms in a program for generating and solving Sudoku
puzzles, and show experimentally that they lead to effective puzzle-solving
rules that may also be of interest to human Sudoku puzzle solvers.
