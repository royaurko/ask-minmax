The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) can be solved efficiently with
variants of the DPLL algorithm. For industrial SAT problems, DPLL with conflict
analysis dependent dynamic decision heuristics has proved to be particularly
efficient, e.g. in Chaff. In this work, algorithms that initialize the variable
activity values in the solver MiniSAT v1.14 by analyzing the CNF are evolved
using genetic programming (GP), with the goal to reduce the total number of
conflicts of the search and the solving time. The effect of using initial
activities other than zero is examined by initializing with random numbers. The
possibility of countering the detrimental effects of reordering the CNF with
improved initialization is investigated. The best result found (with validation
testing on further problems) was used in the solver Actin, which was submitted
to SAT-Race 2006.
