For two dimensional Schroedinger Hamiltonians we formulate boundary
conditions that split the Hilbert space according to the chirality of the
eigenstates on the boundary. With magnetic fields, and in particular, for
Quantum Hall Systems, this splitting corresponds to edge and bulk states.
Applications to the integer and fractional Hall effect and some open problems
are described.
