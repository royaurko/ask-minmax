We study the linear convergence of variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithms for
some classes of strongly convex problems, using only affine-invariant
quantities. As in Guelat & Marcotte (1986), we show the linear convergence of
the standard Frank-Wolfe algorithm when the solution is in the interior of the
domain, but with affine invariant constants. We also show the linear
convergence of the away-steps variant of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, but with
constants which only depend on the geometry of the domain, and not any property
of the location of the optimal solution. Running these algorithms does not
require knowing any problem specific parameters.
