It has been known that the supersymmetric flavor changing neutral current
problem can be avoided if the squarks take the following mass pattern, namely
the first two generations with the same chirality are degenerate with masses
around the weak scale, while the third generation is very heavy. We realize
this scenario through the supersymmetric extension of a topcolor model with
gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking.
