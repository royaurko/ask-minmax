This paper considers heuristics for well known resource-constrained project
scheduling problem (RCPSP). First a feasible schedule is constructed using
randomized best insertion algorithm. The construction is followed by a local
search where a new solution is generated as follows: first we randomly delete m
activities from the list, which are then reinserted in the list in consecutive
order. At the end of run, the schedule with the minimum makespan is selected.
Experimental work shows very good results on standard test instances found in
