There are many conceivable possibilities of embedding the MSSM in string
theory. These proceedings describe an approach which is based on grand
unification in higher dimensions. This allows one to obtain global
string-derived models with the exact MSSM spectrum and built-in gauge coupling
unification. It turns out that these models exhibit various appealing features
such as (i) see-saw suppressed neutrino masses, (ii) an order one top Yukawa
coupling and potentially realistic flavor structures, (iii) non-Abelian
discrete flavor symmetries relaxing the supersymmetric flavor problem, (iv) a
hidden sector whose scale of strong dynamics is consistent with TeV-scale soft
masses, and (v) a solution to the mu-problem. The crucial and unexpected
property of these features is that they are not put in by hand nor explicitly
searched for but happen to occur automatically, and might thus be viewed as
"stringy surprises".
