This paper is aimed to prove the strong duality theorem for continuous-time
linear programming problems in which the coefficients are assumed to be
piecewise continuous functions. The previous paper proved the strong duality
theorem for the case of piecewise continuous functions in which the
discontinuities are the left-continuities. In this paper, we propose the
completely different type of discretized primal and dual problems that can be
used to prove the strong duality theorem for the general situation of
discontinuities.
