For each integer $n\ge 2$, we demonstrate that a 2n-dimensional generalized
MICZ-Kepler problem has an $\widetilde{\mr{Spin}}(2, 2n+1)$ dynamical symmetry
which extends the manifest $\mr{Spin}(2n)$ symmetry. The Hilbert space of bound
states is shown to form a unitary highest weight $\widetilde{\mr{Spin}}(2,
2n+1)$-module which occurs at the first reduction point in the
Enright-Howe-Wallach classification diagram for the unitary highest weight
modules. As a byproduct, we get a simple geometric realization for such a
unitary highest weight $\widetilde{\mr{Spin}}(2, 2n+1)$-module.
