The experiment conducted at the Brookhaven AGS at 1962 [1] on the interaction
of high-energy neutrinos with matter is considered in literature the
observation of electron and muon types of neutrinos. After analysis of the
experiment we have concluded that the latter does not give direct evidence of
the neutrino family existence.
