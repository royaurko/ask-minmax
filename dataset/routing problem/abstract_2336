In recent years, unconventional metamaterial properties have triggered a
revolution of electromagnetic research which has unveiled novel scenarios of
wave-matter interaction. A very small dielectric permittivity is a leading
example of such unusual features, since it produces an exotic static-like
regime where the electromagnetic field is spatially slowly-varying over a
physically large region. The so-called epsilon-near-zero metamaterials thus
offer an ideal platform where to manipulate the inner details of the
"stretched" field. Here we theoretically prove that a standard nonlinearity is
able to operate such a manipulation to the point that even a thin slab produces
a dramatic nonlinear pulse transformation, if the dielectric permittivity is
very small within the field bandwidth. The predicted non-resonant releasing of
full nonlinear coupling produced by the epsilon-near-zero condition does not
resort to any field enhancement mechanisms and opens novel routes to exploiting
matter nonlinearity for steering the radiation by means of ultra-compact
structures.
