The two-phase free boundary problem for the Navier-Stokes system is
considered in a situation where the initial interface is close to a halfplane.
By means of $L_p$-maximal regularity of the underlying linear problem we show
local well-posedness of the problem, and prove that the solution, in particular
the interface, becomes instantaneously real analytic.
