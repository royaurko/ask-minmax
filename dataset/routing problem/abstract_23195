We present results of the careful study of the Gribov copies problem in SU(2)
lattice gauge theory for the direct maximal center projection widely used in
confinement studies. Applying simulated annealing algorithm we demonstrate that
this problem is more severe than it was thought before. The projected (gauge
noninvariant) string tension is not in the agreement with the physical string
tension. We do not find any indications that P-vortices reproduce the full
SU(2) string tension neither in the infinite volume limit nor in the continuum
limit.
