We show continuity in generalized weighted Morrey spaces of sub-linear
integral operators generated by some classical integral operators and
commutators. The obtained estimates are used to study global regularity of the
solution of the Dirichlet problem for linear uniformly elliptic operators with
discontinuous data.
