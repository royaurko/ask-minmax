In this paper, we generalize the classical extragradient algorithm for
solving variational inequality problems by utilizing non-null normal vectors of
the feasible set. In particular, two conceptual algorithms are proposed and
each of them has three different variants which are related to modified
extragradient algorithms.
  Our analysis contains two main parts: The first part contains two different
linesearches, one on the boundary of the feasible set and the other one along
the feasible direction. The linesearches allow us to find suitable halfspaces
containing the solution set of the problem. By using non-null normal vectors of
the feasible set, these linesearches can potentially accelerate the
convergence. If all normal vectors are chosen as zero, then some of these
variants reduce to several well-known projection methods proposed in the
literature for solving the variational inequality problem. The second part
consists of three special projection steps, generating three sequences with
different interesting features.
  Convergence analysis of both conceptual algorithms is established, assuming
existence of solutions, continuity and a weaker condition than
pseudomonotonicity on the operator. Examples, on each variant, show that the
modifications proposed here perform better than previous classical variants.
These results suggest that our scheme may significantly improve the
extragradient variants.
