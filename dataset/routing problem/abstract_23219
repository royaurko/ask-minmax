It is a well--known problem that in supersymmetric models there are new
CP--violating phases which, if unsuppressed, would give a neutron electric
dipole moment $10^2$ to $10^3$ times the present experimental limit. Here we
propose that these new phases are suppressed by CP invariance, which is broken
spontaneously at a high scale and that this breaking shows up at low energies
only through a universal phase of the gaugino masses. It is shown that this can
well fit both $\epsilon$ and $\epsilon^\prime$ of the neutral Kaon system. The
electric dipole moments of the neutron and the electron should be not much
below present limits. A model incorporating these ideas in a very economical
way is presented.
