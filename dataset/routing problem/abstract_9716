Let $X$ be a compact connected strongly pseudoconvex $CR$ manifold of real
dimension 2n-1 in $\mathbb{C}^{N}$. It has been an interesting question to find
an intrinsic smoothness criteria for the complex Plateau problem. For $n\ge 3$
and $N=n+1$, Yau found a necessary and sufficient condition for the interior
regularity of the Harvey-Lawson solution to the complex Plateau problem by
means of Kohn-Rossi cohomology groups on $X$ in 1981. For n=2 and $N\ge n+1$,
the problem has been open for over 30 years. In this paper we introduce a new
CR invariant $g^{(1,1)}(X)$ of $X$. The vanishing of this invariant will give
the interior regularity of the Harvey-Lawson solution up to normalization. In
case $n=2$ and N=3, the vanishing of this invariant is enough to give the
interior regularity.
