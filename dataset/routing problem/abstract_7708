This work presents the study of the excited states of the Cooper problem in
the three-dimensional Anderson model. It is shown that the excited pair states
remain localized while their excitation energy $\Delta E$ is negative. For
$\Delta E>0$ the particles are delocalized over the three-dimensional lattice.
