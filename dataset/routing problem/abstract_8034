A connection between the state estimation problem and the separability
problem is noticed and exploited to find efficient numerical algorithms to
solve the first one. Based on these ideas, we also derive a systematic method
to obtain upper bounds on the maximum local fidelity when the states are
distributed among several distant parties.
