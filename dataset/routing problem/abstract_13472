We investigate the problem of pure gravitational localization of matter
fields within the 5D standing wave braneworld generated by gravity coupled to a
phantom-like scalar field. We show that in the case of increasing warp factor
there exist normalizable zero modes of spin-0, -1/2, -1, and -2 fields on the
brane.
