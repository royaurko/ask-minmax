An information-spectrum approach is applied to solve the multiterminal source
coding problem for correlated general sources, where sources may be
nonstationary and/or nonergodic, and the distortion measure is arbitrary and
may be nonadditive. A general formula for the rate-distortion region of the
multiterminal source coding problem with the maximum distortion criterion under
fixed-length coding is shown in this correspondence.
