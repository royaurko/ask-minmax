A Borg-Marchenko type uniqueness theorem (in terms of the Weyl function) is
obtained here for the system auxiliary to the N-wave equation. A procedure to
solve inverse problem is used for this purpose. The asymptotic condition on the
Weyl function, under which the inverse problem is uniquely solvable, is
completed by the new and simple sufficient condition on the potential, granting
the fulfillment of this asymptotic condition. The evolution of the Weyl
function is discussed and the solution of an initial-boundary value problem for
the N-wave equation follows. Explicit solutions of the system are obtained.
System with a shifted argument is treated.
