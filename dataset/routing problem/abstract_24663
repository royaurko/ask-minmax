Let $\Omega$ represent a two$-$dimensional isotropic elastic body. We
consider the problem of determining the body force $F$ whose form
$\phi(t)(f_1(x),f_2(x))$ with $\phi$ be given inexactly. The problem is
nonlinear and ill-posed. Using the Fourier transform, the methods of Tikhonov's
regularization and truncated integration, we construct a regularized solution
from the data given inexactly and derive the explicitly error estimate.
