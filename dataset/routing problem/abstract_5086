We investigate the severity of the sign problem in a random matrix model for
QCD at finite temperature T and baryon chemical potential mu. We obtain
analytic expression for the average phase factor -- the measure of the severity
of the sign problem at arbitrary T and mu. We observe that the sign problem
becomes less severe as the temperature is increased. We also find the domain
where the sign problem is maximal -- the average phase factor is zero, which is
related to the pion condensation phase in the QCD with finite isospin chemical
potential. We find that, in the matrix model we studied, the critical point is
located inside the domain of the maximal sign problem, making the point
inaccessible to conventional reweighting techniques. We observe and describe
the scaling behavior of the size and shape of the pion condensation near the
chiral limit.
