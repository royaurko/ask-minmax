In a previous work, we associated with any submartingale $X$ of class
$(\Sigma)$, defined on a filtered probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F},
\mathbb{P}, (\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \geq 0})$ satisfying some technical conditions,
a $\sigma$-finite measure $\mathcal{Q}$ on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$, such that
for all $t \geq 0$, and for all events $\Lambda_t
  \in \mathcal{F}_t$: $$ \mathcal{Q} [\Lambda_t, g\leq t] =
\mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{P}} [\mathds{1}_{\Lambda_t} X_t],$$ where $g$ is the last
hitting time of zero by the process $X$. The measure $\mathcal{Q}$, which was
previously studied in particular cases related with Brownian penalisations and
problems in mathematical finance, enjoys some remarkable properties which are
detailed in this paper. Most of these properties are related to a certain class
of nonnegative martingales, defined as the local densities (with respect to
$\mathbb{P}$) of the finite measures which are absolutely continuous with
respect to $\mathcal{Q}$. From the properties of the measure $\mathcal{Q}$, we
also deduce a universal class of penalisation results of the probability
measure $\mathbb{P}$ with a large class of functionals: the measure
$\mathcal{Q}$ appears to be the unifying object in these problems.
