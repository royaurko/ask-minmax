The numerical solution of the Milne problem for semi-infinite plane-parallel
magnetized electron atmosphere is obtained. It is assumed that magnetic field
is directed along the normal to the atmosphere. The angular dependence, the
polarization degree and positional angle of outgoing radiation are presented in
the tables for various values of the Faraday rotation parameter and the degree
of absorption q=0, 0.2 and 0.4. We assume that magnetic field B~1000000G when
one can neglect the effects of circular dichroism and take into account only
the Faraday rotation effect.
