We study the problem of recovering the initial data of the two dimensional
wave equation from values of its solution on the boundary $\partial \Om$ of a
smooth convex bounded domain $\Om \subset \R^2$. As a main result we establish
back-projection type inversion formulas that recover any initial data with
support in $\Om$ modulo an explicitly computed smoothing integral operator
$\K_\Om$. For circular and elliptical domains the operator $\K_\Om$ is shown to
vanish identically and hence we establish exact inversion formulas of the
back-projection type in these cases. Similar results are obtained for
recovering a function from its mean values over circles with centers on
$\partial \Om$. Both reconstruction problems are, amongst others, essential for
the hybrid imaging modalities photoacoustic and thermoacoustic tomography.
