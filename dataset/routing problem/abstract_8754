We use the newly introduced conformable fractional derivative, which is
different from the Caputo and Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives, to
reformulate several common boundary value problems, including those with
conjugate, right-focal, and Lidstone conditions. With the fractional
differential equation and fractional boundary conditions established, we find
the corresponding Green's functions and prove their positivity under
appropriate assumptions.
