While much research on the hard problem of in-depth story understanding by
computer was performed starting in the 1970s, interest shifted in the 1990s to
information extraction and word sense disambiguation. Now that a degree of
success has been achieved on these easier problems, I propose it is time to
return to in-depth story understanding. In this paper I examine the shift away
from story understanding, discuss some of the major problems in building a
story understanding system, present some possible solutions involving a set of
interacting understanding agents, and provide pointers to useful tools and
resources for building story understanding systems.
