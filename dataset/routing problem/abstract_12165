We develop a compactness result near the boundary for families of locally
convex immersions. We also develop a mod 2 degree theory for immersion of
constant (and prescribed) Gaussian curvature with prescribed boundary. These
are then used to solve the Plateau problem for immersions of constant (and
prescribed) Gaussian curvature in general Hadamard manifolds.
