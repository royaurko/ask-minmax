This paper deals with the routing protocols for distributed wireless sensor
networks. The conventional protocols for WSNs like Low Energy adaptive
Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH), Stable Election Protocol (SEP), Threshold
Sensitive Energy Efficient Network (TEEN), Distributed Energy Efficient
Clustering Protocol (DEEC) may not be optimal. We propose a scheme called Away
Cluster Head (ACH) which effectively increases the efficiency of conventional
clustering based protocols in terms of stability period and number of packets
sent to base station (BS). We have implemented ACH scheme on LEACH, SEP, TEEN
and DEEC. Simulation results show that LEACHACH, SEP-ACH, TEEN-ACH and DEEC-ACH
performs better than LEACH, SEP, TEEN and DEEC respectively in terms of
stability period and number of packets sent to BS. The stability period of the
existing protocols prolongs by implementing ACH on them.
