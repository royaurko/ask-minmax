This paper extends some results of Hatcher and Quinn beyond the metastable
range. We give a bordism theoretic obstruction to deforming a map between
manifolds simultaneously off of a finite collection of pairwise disjoint
submanifolds. In a certain range of dimensions, our obstruction is the entire
story.
