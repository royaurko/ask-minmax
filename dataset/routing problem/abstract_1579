The last multiplier of Jacobi provides a route for the determination of
families of Lagrangians for a given system. We show that the members of a
family are equivalent in that they differ by a total time derivative. We derive
the Schr\"odinger equation for a one-degree-of-freedom system with a constant
multiplier. In the sequel we consider the particular example of the simple
harmonic oscillator. In the case of the general equation for the simple
harmonic oscillator which contains an arbitrary function we show that all
Schr\"odinger equations possess the same number of Lie point symmetries with
the same algebra. From the symmetries we construct the solutions of the
Schr\"odinger equation and find that they differ only by a phase determined by
the gauge.
