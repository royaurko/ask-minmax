We introduce negotiations, a model of concurrency close to Petri nets, with
multiparty negotiation as primitive. We study the problems of soundness of
negotiations and of, given a negotiation with possibly many steps, computing a
summary, i.e., an equivalent one-step negotiation. We provide a complete set of
reduction rules for sound, acyclic, weakly deterministic negotiations and show
that, for deterministic negotiations, the rules compute the summary in
polynomial time.
