We present some basic properties of two distinguished discretizations of
elliptic operators: the self-adjoint 5-point and 7-point schemes on a two
dimensional lattice. We first show that they allow to solve Dirichlet boundary
value problems; then we present their Darboux transformations. Finally we
construct their Lelieuvre formulas and we show that, at the level of the normal
vector and in full analogy with their continuous counterparts, the self-adjoint
5-point scheme characterizes a two dimensional quadrilateral lattice (a lattice
whose elementary quadrilaterals are planar), while the self-adjoint 7-point
scheme characterizes a generic 2D lattice.
