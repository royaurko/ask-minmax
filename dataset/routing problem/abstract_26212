We develop a theory of the Cauchy problem for linear evolution systems of
partial differential equations with the Caputo-Dzrbashyan fractional derivative
in the time variable $t$. The class of systems considered in the paper is a
fractional extension of the class of systems of the first order in $t$
satisfying the uniform strong parabolicity condition. We construct and
investigate the Green matrix of the Cauchy problem. While similar results for
the fractional diffusion equations were based on the H-function representation
of the Green matrix for equations with constant coefficients (not available in
the general situation), here we use, as a basic tool, the subordination
identity for a model homogeneous system. We also prove a uniqueness result
based on the reduction to an operator-differential equation.
