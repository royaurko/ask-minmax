Tackling the problem of ordinal preference revelation and reasoning, we
propose a novel methodology for generating an ordinal utility function from a
set of qualitative preference statements. To the best of our knowledge, our
proposal constitutes the first nonparametric solution for this problem that is
both efficient and semantically sound. Our initial experiments provide strong
evidence for practical effectiveness of our approach.
