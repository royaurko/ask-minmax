We consider the discretization of a boundary value problem for a general
linear second-order elliptic operator with smooth coefficients using the
Virtual Element approach. As in [59] the problem is supposed to have a unique
solution, but the associated bilinear form is not supposed to be coercive.
Contrary to what was previously done for Virtual Element Methods (as for
instance in [9]), we use here, in a systematic way, the L^2-projection
operators as designed in [1]. In particular, the present method does not reduce
to the original Virtual Element Method of [9] for simpler problems as the
classical Laplace operator (apart from the lowest order cases). Numerical
experiments show the accuracy and the robustness of the method, and they show
as well that a simple-minded extension of the method in [9] to the case of
variable coefficients produces, in general, sub-optimal results.
