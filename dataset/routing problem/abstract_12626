As an alternative to the paradigmatic fragmentation problem of a single
object crushed into a great number of pieces, we survey a large collection of
identical bodies, each one randomly split into two fragments only. While some
key features of usual fragmentation are preserved, this minimal approach allows
for closed analytical results on both, shape abundances and mass distributions
for the fragments, with robust power-law regimes. All the results are compared
to numerical simulations.
