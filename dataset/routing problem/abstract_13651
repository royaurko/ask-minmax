The paper is devoted to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for
existence of solutions to the problem ${\rm inf}{{\rm ess sup}_{x \in \Omega}
f(\nabla u(x)): u \in u_0 + W^{1,\infty}_0(\Omega)}$ when the supremand $f$ is
not necessarily level convex. These conditions are obtained through a
comparison with the related level convex problem and are written in terms of a
diff?erential inclusion involving the boundary datum. Several conditions of
convexity for the supremand $f$ are also investigated.
