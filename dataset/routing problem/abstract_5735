We consider the computational versions of the Erd\H os-Szekeres theorem and
related problems in 3 dimensions. We show that, in constrast to the planar
case, no polynomial time algorithm exists for determining the largest (empty)
convex subset (unless P=NP) among a set of points, by proving that the
corresponding decision problem is NP-hard. This answers a question by Dobkin,
Edelsbrunner and Overmars from 1990.
  As a corollary, we derive a similar result for the closely related problem of
testing weak epsilon-nets in R^3. Answering a question by Chazelle et al. from
1995, our reduction shows that the problem is co-NP-hard.
  This is work in progress - we are still trying to find a smart approximation
algorithm for the problems.
