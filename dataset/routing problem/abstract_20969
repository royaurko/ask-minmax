We study the aggregation/disaggregation problem of random parameter AR(1)
processes and its relation to the long memory phenomenon. We give a
characterization of a subclass of aggregated processes which can be obtained
from simpler, "elementary", cases. In particular cases of the mixture
densities, the structure (moving average representation) of the aggregated
process is investigated.
