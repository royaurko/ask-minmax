The difference in light's travel time from CERN to GPS to Gran Sasso, on the
one hand, and light going the direct route in vacuum (mimicked by neutrinos),
on the other hand, is analyzed with a modified Robertson test theory of the
Lorentz transformations. The modification consists simply in removing the
restriction of what Robertson referred to as agreement to equate the to and
from speeds of light. For reasons that will be contained in a paper to soon
follow, we restrict ourselves, within the new freedom, to the case of preferred
frame kinematics with absolute simultaneity.
  At the level of not assuming any concomitant dynamical changes in this
alternative, the analysis yields \QTR{it}{zero effect}, i.e. no change with
respect to special relativity (to be expected). The 60 ns would thus remain
unexplained. However, a gravitation related effect that would likely accompany
an alternative kinematics yields that value up to uncertainties due to the need
to simplify the experimental set up for analysis. The effect amounts to
$(\lambda /2)(D/c)(V/c)^{2}$, where $D$ is distance to GPS, $V$ is speed with
respect to the frame of isotropy of the cosmic background radiation and
$\lambda$ is a factor greater than 1, but likely not greater than 1.2 or 1.3,
that reflects lack of precise knowledge of the average distance to the common
view GPS satellite. A $\lambda $ factor of \ 1.2 yields 60 ns.
