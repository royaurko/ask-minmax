In this paper, we propose a new routing protocol for heterogeneous Wireless
Body Area Sensor Networks (WBASNs); Mobility-supporting Adaptive
Threshold-based Thermal-aware Energy-efficientMulti-hop ProTocol (M-ATTEMPT). A
prototype is defined for employing heterogeneous sensors on human body. Direct
communication is used for real-time traffic (critical data) or on-demand data
while Multi-hop communication is used for normal data delivery. One of the
prime challenges in WBASNs is sensing of the heat generated by the implanted
sensor nodes. The proposed routing algorithm is thermal-aware which senses the
link Hot-spot and routes the data away from these links. Continuous mobility of
human body causes disconnection between previous established links. So,
mobility support and energy-management is introduced to overcome the problem.
Linear Programming (LP) model for maximum information extraction and minimum
energy consumption is presented in this study. MATLAB simulations of proposed
routing algorithm are performed for lifetime and successful packet delivery in
comparison with Multi-hop communication. The results show that the proposed
routing algorithm has less energy consumption and more reliable as compared to
Multi-hop communication.
