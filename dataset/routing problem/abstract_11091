We study the Kondo model --a magnetic impurity coupled to a one dimensional
wire via exchange coupling-- by using Wilson's numerical renormalization group
(NRG) technique. By applying an approach similar to which was used to compute
the two impurity problem we managed to improve the bad spatial resolution of
the numerical renormalization group method. In this way we have calculated the
impurity spin - conduction electron spin correlation function which is a
measure of the Kondo compensation cloud whose existence has been a long
standing problem in solid state physics. We also present results on the
temperature dependence of the Kondo correlations.
