In this paper we introduce a novel gossiping primitive to support privacy
preserving data analytics (PPDA). In contrast to existing computational PPDA
primitives such as secure multiparty computation and data randomization based
approaches, the proposed primitive `anonymous gossiping' is a communication
primitive for privacy preserving personalized information aggregation
complementing such traditional computational analytics. We realize this novel
primitive by composing existing gossiping mechanisms for peer sampling &
information aggregation and onion routing technique for establishing anonymous
communication. This is more an `ideas' paper, rather than providing concrete
and quantified results.
