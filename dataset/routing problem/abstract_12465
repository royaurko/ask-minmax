Let A be an infinite set of generators for a group G, and let L_A(r) denote
the number of elements of G whose word length with respect to A is exactly r.
The purpose of this note is to determine all growth functions L_A(r) associated
to infinite generating sets for groups, and to describe a phase transition
phenomenon associated with infinite generating sets. A list of open problems is
also.included.
