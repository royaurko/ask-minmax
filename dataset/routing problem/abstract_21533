The problem of constructing elliptic curves suitable for pairing applications
has received a lot of attention. To solve this, we propose a variant algorithm
of a known method by Brezing and Weng. We produce new families of parameters
using our algorithm for pairing-friendly elliptic curves of embedding degree 8,
and we actually compute some explicit curves as numerical examples.
