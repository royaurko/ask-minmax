We study the joint probability distribution function (pdf) of the maximum M
of the height and its position X_M of a curved growing interface belonging to
the universality class described by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation in 1+1
dimensions. We obtain exact results for the closely related problem of p
non-intersecting Brownian bridges where we compute the joint pdf P_p(M,\tau_M)
where \tau_M is there the time at which the maximal height M is reached. Our
analytical results, in the limit p \to \infty, become exact for the interface
problem in the growth regime. We show that our results, for moderate values of
p \sim 10 describe accurately our numerical data of a prototype of these
systems, the polynuclear growth model in droplet geometry. We also discuss
applications of our results to the ground state configuration of the directed
polymer in a random potential with one fixed endpoint.
