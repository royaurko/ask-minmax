The partition of graphs into nice subgraphs is a central algorithmic problem
with strong ties to matching theory. We study the partitioning of undirected
graphs into stars, a problem known to be NP-complete even for the case of stars
on three vertices. We perform a thorough computational complexity study of the
problem on subclasses of perfect graphs and identify several polynomial-time
solvable and NP-hard cases, for example, on interval graphs, grid graphs, and
bipartite permutation graphs.
