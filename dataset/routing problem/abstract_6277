This is a revised version of ANT-0332: "A support problem for the
intermediate Jacobians of l-adic representations", by G. Banaszak, W. Gajda &
P. Krason, which was placed on these archives on the 29th of January 2002.
  Following a suggestion of the referee we have subdivided the paper into two
separate parts: "Support problem for the intermediate Jacobians of l-adic
representations", and "On Galois representations for abelian varieties with
complex and real multiplications".
  Our results on the image of Galois and the Mumford-Tate conjecture for some
RM abelian varieties are contained in the second paper. Both papers were
accepted for publication.
