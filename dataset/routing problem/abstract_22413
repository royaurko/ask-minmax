We give some reasonable and usable conditions on a sequence of norm one in a
dual banach space under which the sequence does not converges to the origin in
the $w^*$-topology. These requirements help to ensure that the Lagrange
multipliers are nontrivial, when we are interested for example on the infinite
dimensional infinite-horizon Pontryagin Principles for discrete-time problems.
