Role of urban planning and management in Hyderabad is becoming more and more
crucial due to the dramatic increase in urban population and allied urban
problems. Hyderabad is experiencing a rapid urbanization rate. Urbanization
contributes many advantages in terms of economics, but if uncontrolled, would
produce negative consequences to the physical, social and natural environment.
With the advancement of GIS, which considerably influenced the dynamic nature
of urban and regional planning, incorporation of GIS becomes imperative for
better and improved decision-making in urban planning and management. It offers
a solution to the urban problems and decision-making, which is more reliant to
the real-time spatial modelling. The integration of Geographical Information
System (GIS) and Remote Sensing has provided a tool, which can contribute to
much clearer understanding of real planning problems as well as prescriptive
planning scenarios to enhance the quality of urban planning and management.
