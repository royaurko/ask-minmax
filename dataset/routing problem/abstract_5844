The Data Aggregation Problem occurs when a large collection of data takes on
a higher security level than any of its individual component records.
Traditional approaches of breaking up the data and restricting access on a
"need to know" basis take away one of the great advantages of collecting the
data in the first place. This paper introduces a new cryptographic primitive,
Double Blind Comparisons, which allows two co-operating users, who each have an
encrypted secret, to determine the equality or inequality of those two secrets,
even though neither user can discover any information about what the secret is.
This paper also introduces a new problem in bilinear groups, conjectured to be
a hard problem. Assuming this conjecture, it is shown that neither user can
discover any information about whether the secrets are equal, without the other
user's co-operation. We then look at how Double Blind Comparisons can be used
to mitigate the Data Aggregation Problem. Finally, the paper concludes with
some suggested possibilities for future research and some other potential uses
for Double Blind Comparisons.
