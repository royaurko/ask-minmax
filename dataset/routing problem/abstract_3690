Finite differences, as a subclass of direct methods in the calculus of
variations, consist in discretizing the objective functional using appropriate
approximations for derivatives that appear in the problem. This article
generalizes the same idea for fractional variational problems. We consider a
minimization problem with a Lagrangian that depends on the left
Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative. Using the Grunwald-Letnikov
definition, we approximate the objective functional in an equispaced grid as a
multi-variable function of the values of the unknown function on mesh points.
The problem is then transformed to an ordinary static optimization problem. The
solution to the latter problem gives an approximation to the original
fractional problem on mesh points.
