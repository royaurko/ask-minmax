We propose a self-consistent Ornstein-Zernike approximation for studying the
Edwards-Anderson spin glass model. By performing two Legendre transforms in
replica space, we introduce a Gibbs free energy depending on both the
magnetizations and the overlap order parameters. The correlation functions and
the thermodynamics are then obtained from the solution of a set of coupled
partial differential equations. The approximation becomes exact in the limit of
infinite dimension and it provides a potential route for studying the stability
of the high-temperature phase against replica-symmetry breaking fluctuations in
finite dimensions. As a first step, we present the numerical predictions for
the freezing temperature and the zero-field thermodynamic properties above
freezing as a function of dimensionality.
