The paper deals with an integrodi?erential operator which models numerous
phenomena in superconductivity, in biology and in viscoelasticity.
Initialboundary value problems with Neumann, Dirichlet and mixed boundary
conditions are analyzed. An asymptotic analysis is achieved proving that for
large t, the in uences of the initial data vanish, while the e?ects of boundary
disturbances are everywhere bounded.
