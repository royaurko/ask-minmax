In "equation-free" multiscale computation a dynamic model is given at a fine,
microscopic level; yet we believe that its coarse-grained, macroscopic dynamics
can be described by closed equations involving only coarse variables. These
variables are typically various low-order moments of the distributions evolved
through the microscopic model. We consider the problem of integrating these
unavailable equations by acting directly on kinetic Monte Carlo microscopic
simulators, thus circumventing their derivation in closed form. In particular,
we use projective multi-step integration to solve the coarse initial value
problem forward in time as well as backward in time (under certain conditions).
Macroscopic trajectories are thus traced back to unstable, source-type, and
even sometimes saddle-like stationary points, even though the microscopic
simulator only evolves forward in time. We also demonstrate the use of such
projective integrators in a shooting boundary value problem formulation for the
computation of "coarse limit cycles" of the macroscopic behavior, and the
approximation of their stability through estimates of the leading "coarse
Floquet multipliers".
