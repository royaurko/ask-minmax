Interference is a main limiting factor of the performance of a wireless ad
hoc network. The temporal and the spatial correlation of the interference makes
the outages correlated temporally (important for retransmissions) and spatially
correlated (important for routing). In this letter we quantify the temporal and
spatial correlation of the interference in a wireless ad hoc network whose
nodes are distributed as a Poisson point process on the plane when ALOHA is
used as the multiple-access scheme.
