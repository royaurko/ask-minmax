Due to the renewed interest in dark matter after the upgrade of the large
hadron collider and its dedication to dark matter research it is timely to
reassess the whole problem. Dark matter is one way to reconcile the discrepancy
between the velocity of matter in the outer regions of galaxies and the
observed galactic mass. So far, no credible candidate for dark matter has been
identified. Here, we develop a model accounting for observations by rotations
and interactions between rotating objects analogous to magnetic fields and
interactions with moving charges. The magnitude of these fields is described by
a fundamental constant of the order 10-41kg-1. The same interactions can be
observed in the solar system where they lead to small changes of planetary
orbits.
