In this paper we address an issue that has been brought to the attention of
the database community with the advent of the Semantic Web, i.e. the issue of
how ontologies (and semantics conveyed by them) can help solving typical
database problems, through a better understanding of KR aspects related to
databases. In particular, we investigate this issue from the ILP perspective by
considering two database problems, (i) the definition of views and (ii) the
definition of constraints, for a database whose schema is represented also by
means of an ontology. Both can be reformulated as ILP problems and can benefit
from the expressive and deductive power of the KR framework DL+log. We
illustrate the application scenarios by means of examples. Keywords: Inductive
