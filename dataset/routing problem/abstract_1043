We have prepared powder samples of NaxCoO2 x yH2O using a new synthesis
route. Superconductivity was observed in Na0.3CoO2 x 1.3H2O between 4 and 5K as
indicated by the magnetic susceptibility. The bulk compressibilities of
Na0.3CoO2 x 1.3H2O, Na0.3CoO2 x 0.6H2O and Na0.3CoO2 were determined using a
diamond anvil cell and synchrotron powder diffraction. Chemical changes
occurring under pressure when using different pressure transmitting media are
discussed and further transport measurements are advocated.
