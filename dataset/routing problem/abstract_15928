The theory of quadrature domains for harmonic functions and the Hele-Shaw
problem of the fluid dynamics are related subjects of the complex variables and
mathematical physics. We present results generalizing the above subjects for
elliptic PDEs with variable coefficients emerging in a class of the
free-boundary problems for viscous flows in non-homogeneous media. Such flows
posses an infinite number of conservation laws, whose special cases may be
viewed as quadrature identities for solutions of variable-coefficient elliptic
PDEs. If such PDEs are gauge equivalent to the Laplace equation (gauge-trivial
case), a time-dependent conformal map technique, employed for description of
the quadrature domains, leads to differential equations, known as "string"
constraints in the theory of integrable systems. Although analogs of the string
constraints have non-local forms for gauge-non-trivial equations, it is still
possible to construct the quadrature domains explicitly, if the elliptic
operator belongs to a class of the Calogero-Moser Hamiltonians.
