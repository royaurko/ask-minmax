Recently a scale invariant theory of gravity was constructed by imposing a
conformal symmetry on general relativity. The imposition of this symmetry
changed the configuration space from superspace - the space of all Riemannian
3-metrics modulo diffeomorphisms - to conformal superspace - the space of all
Riemannian 3-metrics modulo diffeomorphisms and conformal transformations.
However, despite numerous attractive features, the theory suffers from at least
one major problem: the volume of the universe is no longer a dynamical
variable. In attempting to resolve this problem a new theory is found which has
several surprising and atractive features from both quantisation and
cosmological perspectives. Furthermore, it is an extremely restrictive theory
and thus may provide testable predictions quickly and easily. One particularly
interesting feature of the theory is the resolution of the cosmological
constant problem.
