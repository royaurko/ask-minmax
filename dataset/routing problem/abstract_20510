The feedback stabilization problem for ensembles of coupled spin 1/2 systems
is discussed from a control theoretic perspective. The noninvasive nature of
the bulk measurement allows for a fully unitary and deterministic closed loop.
The Lyapunov-based feedback design presented does not require spins that are
selectively addressable. With this method, it is possible to obtain control
inputs also for difficult tasks, like suppressing undesired couplings in
identical spin systems.
