Given a bounded domain $M$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with a conformally Euclidean
metric $g=\rho\,dx^2$, in this paper we consider the inverse problem of
recovering a semigeodesic neighborhood of a domain $\Gamma\subset \partial M$
and the conformal factor $\rho$ in the neighborhood from the travel time data
(defined below) and the Cartesian coordinates of $\Gamma$. We develop an
explicit reconstruction procedure for this problem. The key ingredient is the
relation between the reconstruction and a Cauchy problem of the conformal
Killing equation.
