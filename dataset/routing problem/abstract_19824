We investigate a scenario in which the CKM matrix arises from
leptoquark--down quark mixing in a particular standard--like superstring model.
We find that for some choices of F and D flat directions realistic quark mixing
can be obtained without any phenomenological problems. This scenario predicts a
symmetric (in absolute value) CKM matrix.
