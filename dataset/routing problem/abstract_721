Thirty years ago the Hubbard model was introduced by Gutzwiller, Hubbard and
Kanamori with the main purpose of mimicking the ferromagnetism of transition
metals. Soon after, Nagaoka and Thouless pointed out a basic mechanism for
ferromagnetism in strongly correlated electron systems by studying the motion
of a single hole in a half--filled Hubbard model. This important work was hoped
to shed light onto metallic ferromagnetism from the low doping regime.
Unfortunately, this low doping route towards ferromagnetism has not been
successful as far as rigorous results for finite doping concentrations are
concerned. In the work presented here, we start from the opposite limit of low
particle concentrations. In this limit we provide the first proof of a fully
polarized metallic ground state for a Hubbard model. The proof proceeds by
mapping Hubbard ``zigzag'' chains onto a continuum model with an additional
degree of freedom and local first Hund's rule coupling. For this model the
maximum total spin multiplet is shown to be the unique ground state for
infinite Hubbard coupling. Our proof may open a low density route towards the
understanding of the ferromagnetism of Hubbard models.
