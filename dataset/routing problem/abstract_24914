In this paper we propose a look at the capital risk problem inspired by
deterministic, known from classical mechanics, problem of juggling. We propose
capital equivalents to the Newton's laws of motion and on this basis we
determine the most secure form of credit repayment with regard to maximisation
of profit. Then we extend the Newton's laws to models in linear spaces of
arbitrary dimension with the help of matrix rates of return. The matrix rates
describe the evolution of multidimensional capital and they are sensitive to
both quantitative changes of individual elements and flows between them. This
allows us for simultaneous analysis of evolution of complex capital in both
continuous and discrete time models.
