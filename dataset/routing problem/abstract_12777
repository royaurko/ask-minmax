We show a direct product result for two-way public coin communication
complexity of all relations in terms of a new complexity measure that we
define. Our new measure is a generalization to non-product distributions of the
two-way product subdistribution bound of [J, Klauck and Nayak 08], thereby our
result implying their direct product result in terms of the two-way product
subdistribution bound.
  We show that our new complexity measure gives tight lower bound for the
set-disjointness problem, as a result we reproduce strong direct product result
for this problem, which was previously shown by [Klauck 00].
