The Schroedinger functional treatment of 2+1 D Yang-Mills theory (related to
the magnetic mass problem of 4D hot gluons) is recapitulated by following
Karabali, Kim and Nair in Nucl. Phys. B 524 (1998) 661 (first half). The notes
include the Hermitean WZW model and end up with the lowest eigenvalue (mass
gap) of the functional kinetic energy. Let calculational details be invariant
under the (german) language used.
