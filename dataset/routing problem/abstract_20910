The universal covering symmetry algebra of the Robinson-Trautman equations of
Petrov Type III is shown to include the infinite-dimensional affine Kac-Moody
algebra A_1 as a prolongation algebra. This algebra has slower growth than the
contragradient algebra K_2 obtained previously for this equation.
