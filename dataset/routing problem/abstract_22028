In this work we derive a point-wise formula that will allows us to study the
well-posedness of initial value problem associated to nonlinear dispersive
equations in fractional weighted Sobolev spaces $H^s(\R)\cap L^2(|x|^{2r}dx)$,
$s, r \in \R$. As an application of this formula we will study local and global
well posedness of the $k$-generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation in these
weighted Sobolev spaces.
