Let $\Omega$ be a two-dimensional heat conduction body. We consider the
problem of determining the heat source $F(x,t)=\varphi(t)f(x,y)$ with $\varphi$
be given inexactly and $f$ be unknown. The problem is nonlinear and ill-posed.
By a specific form of Fourier transforms, we shall show that the heat source is
determined uniquely by the minimum boundary condition and the temperature
distribution in $\Omega$ at the initial time $t=0$ and at the final time $t=1$.
Using the methods of Tikhonov's regularization and truncated integration, we
construct the regularized solutions. Numerical part is given.
