We get back to the computation of the leading finite size corrections to some
random link matching problems, first adressed by Mezard and Parisi [J. Physique
48 (1987) 1451-1459]. In the so-called bipartite case, their result is in
contradiction with subsequent works. We show that they made some mistakes, and
correcting them, we get the expected result. In the non bipartite case, we
agree with their result but push the analytical treatment further
