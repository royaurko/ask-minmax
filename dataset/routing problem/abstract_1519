The MINOS long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment is comprised of three
calorimeters, a Near Detector at FNAL, a Far Detector at the Soudan mine in
northern Minnesota, and a Calibration Detector in a test beam at CERN. The
light produced in the interactions of neutrinos in the Near Detector at FNAL
will be routed by optical fibres onto the pixels of Hamamatsu R5900-00-M64
multi-anode photomultiplier tubes. This article reports the measurements
performed on 15 of these tubes to evaluate them for their use in MINOS.
