For a newform $f=\sum a_n q^n$ of weight $k \geq 3$ and a prime $\lambda$ of
$\mathbf{Q}(a_n)$, the deformation problem for its associated mod $\lambda$
Galois representation is unobstructed for all primes outside some finite set.
Previous results gave an explicit bound on this finite set for $f$ of
squarefree level; we modify this bound and remove the squarefree hypothesis. We
also show that if the $\lambda$-adic deformation problem for $f$ is
unobstructed, then $f$ is not congruent mod $\lambda$ to a newform of lower
level.
