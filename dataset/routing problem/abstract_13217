We give a solution of the Riemann problem in relativistic hydrodynamics in
the case of ultrarelativistic equation of state and nonvanishing components of
the velocity tangent to the initial discontinuity. Simplicity of the
ultra-relativistic equation of state (the pressure being directly proportional
to the energy density) allows us to express this solution in analytical terms.
The result can be used both to construct and test numerical schemes for
relativistic Euler equations in (3 + 1) dimensions.
