The problems with background independence are discussed in the example of
open string theory. Based on the recent proposal by Witten I calculate the
String Field Theory action in conformal perturbation theory to second order and
demonstrate that the proper treatment of contact terms leads to nontrivial
equations of motion. I conjecture the form of the field theory action to all
orders.
