In this paper we present a characteristic method for solving the transfer
equation in differentially moving media in a curved spacetime. The method is
completely general, but its capabilities are exploited at best in presence of
symmetries, when the existence of conserved quantities allows to derive
analytical expressions for the photon trajectories in phase space. In
spherically--symmetric, stationary configurations the solution of the transfer
problem is reduced to the integration of a single ordinary differential
equation along the bi--parametric family of characteristic rays. Accurate
expressions for the radiative processes relevant to continuum transfer in a hot
astrophysical plasma have been used in evaluating the source term, including
relativistic e--p, e--e bremsstrahlung and Compton scattering. A numerical code
for the solution of the transfer problem in moving media in a Schwarzschild
spacetime has been developed and tested. Some applications, concerning ``hot''
and ``cold'' accretion onto non--rotating black holes as well as static
atmospheres around neutron stars, are presented and discussed.
