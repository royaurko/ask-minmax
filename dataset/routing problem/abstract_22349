The Bergman theory of domains $\{ |{z_{1} |^{k}} < |{z_{2}} | < 1 \}$ in
$\mathbb{C}^2$ is studied for certain values of $k$, including all positive
integers. For these $k$, we obtain a closed form expression for the Bergman
kernel, $\mathbb{B}_{k}$. Using these formulas, we make new discoveries about
the Lu Qi-Keng problem and are able to explicitly analyze the behavior of
$\mathbb{B}_{k}(z,z)$ as $z$ tends to singular boundary points.
