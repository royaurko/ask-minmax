In infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, the application of the concept of
quasi-Hermiticity to the description of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real
spectra may lead to problems related to the definition of the metric operator.
We discuss these problems by examining some examples taken from the recent
literature and propose a formulation that is free of these difficulties.
