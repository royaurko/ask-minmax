H. Steinhaus asked in the 1950's whether there exists a set in the plane R^2
meeting every isometric copy of Z^2 in precisely one point. Such a "Steinhaus
set" was constructed by Jackson and Mauldin. What about three-space R^3? Is
there a subset of R^3 meeting every isometric copy of Z^3 in exactly one point?
We offer heuristic evidence that the answer is "no".
