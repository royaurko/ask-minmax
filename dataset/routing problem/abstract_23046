In this paper we report some results obtained by applying the radial gauge to
2+1 dimensional gravity. The general features of this gauge are reviewed and it
is shown how they allow the general solution of the problem in terms of simple
quadratures. Then we concentrate on the general stationary problem providing
the explicit solving formulas for the metric and the explicit support
conditions for the energy momentum tensor. The chosen gauge allows, due to its
physical nature, to exploit the weak energy condition and in this connection it
is proved that for an open universe conical at space infinity the weak energy
condition and the absence of closed time like curves (CTC) at space infinity
imply the total absence of CTC. It is pointed out how the approach can be used
to examine cosmological solution in 2+1 dimensions.
