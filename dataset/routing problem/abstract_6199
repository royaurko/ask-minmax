Current algorithms used to put a lattice gauge configuration into Landau
gauge either suffer from the problem of critical slowing-down or involve an
additional computational expense to overcome it. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs),
which have been widely applied to other global optimisation problems, may be of
use in gauge fixing. Also, being global, they should not suffer from critical
slowing-down as do local gradient based algorithms. We apply EA's and also a
Steepest Descent (SD) based method to the problem of Landau Gauge Fixing and
compare their performance.
