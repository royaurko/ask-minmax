In order to solve backward parabolic problems F. John [{\it Comm. Pure. Appl.
Math.} (1960)] introduced the two constraints "$\|u(T)\|\le M$" and $\|u(0) - g
\| \le \delta$ where $u(t)$ satisfies the backward heat equation for
$t\in(0,T)$ with the initial data $u(0).$
  The {\it slow-evolution-from-the-continuation-boundary} (SECB) constraint has
been introduced by A. Carasso in [{\it SIAM J. Numer. Anal.} (1994)] to attain
continuous dependence on data for backward parabolic problems even at the
continuation boundary $t=T$. The additional "SECB constraint" guarantees a
significant improvement in stability up to $t=T.$ In this paper we prove that
the same type of stability can be obtained by using only two constraints among
the three. More precisely, we show that the a priori boundedness condition
$\|u(T)\|\le M$ is redundant. This implies that the Carasso's SECB condition
can be used to replace the a priori boundedness condition of F. John with an
improved stability estimate. Also a new class of regularized solutions is
introduced for backward parabolic problems with an SECB constraint. The new
regularized solutions are optimally stable and we also provide a constructive
scheme to compute. Finally numerical examples are provided.
