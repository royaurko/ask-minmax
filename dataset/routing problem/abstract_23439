We study extractions of |V_us| based on finite energy sum rule (FESR)
analyses of hadronic tau decay data. We show (i) that the ``(0,0) spectral
weight'' implementation (proposed previously in the literature as a favorable
version of this analysis) suffers from significant convergence problems, but
(ii) that alternate implementations exist which bring these problems under
control. Results based on present spectral data are shown to be in agreement
with those of other approaches, though with, at present, somewhat larger
experimental errors. Sub-1% determinations of |V_us| are also shown to be
expected from these alternate analyses once tau data from the B factories
becomes available.
