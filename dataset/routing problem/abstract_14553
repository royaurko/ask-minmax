In this work we consider the finiteness problem for central configurations of
the $n-$body problem. We prove that there exists a closed subset $B$ in the
mass space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, such that if $(m_1,...,m_n) \in
\mathbb{R}^n\setminus B$, then there is a finite number of associated
$(n-2)-$dimensional central configurations with semi-integer potential,
provided that $n\geq 4$. Also, for each integer $k \geq 1$, we show that the
set of the mutual distances associated to a $k-$dimensional central
configuration is included in a determinantal algebraic set.
