Fibonacci gate problems have severed as computation primitives to solve other
problems by holographic algorithm and play an important role in the dichotomy
of exact counting for Holant and CSP frameworks. We generalize them to weighted
cases and allow each vertex function to have different parameters, which is a
much boarder family and #P-hard for exactly counting. We design a fully
polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for this generalization by
correlation decay technique. This is the first deterministic FPTAS for
approximate counting in the general Holant framework without a degree bound. We
also formally introduce holographic reduction in the study of approximate
counting and these weighted Fibonacci gate problems serve as computation
primitives for approximate counting. Under holographic reduction, we obtain
FPTAS for other Holant problems and spin problems. One important application is
developing an FPTAS for a large range of ferromagnetic two-state spin systems.
This is the first deterministic FPTAS in the ferromagnetic range for two-state
spin systems without a degree bound. Besides these algorithms, we also develop
several new tools and techniques to establish the correlation decay property,
which are applicable in other problems.
