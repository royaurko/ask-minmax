We are concerned with minimax signal detection. In this setting, we discuss
non-asymptotic and asymptotic approaches through a unified treatment. In
particular, we consider a Gaussian sequence model that contains classical
models as special cases, such as, direct, well-posed inverse and ill-posed
inverse problems. Working with certain ellipsoids in the space of
squared-summable sequences of real numbers, with a ball of positive radius
removed, we compare the construction of lower and upper bounds for the minimax
separation radius (non-asymptotic approach) and the minimax separation rate
(asymptotic approach) that have been proposed in the literature. Some
additional contributions, bringing into light links between non-asymptotic and
asymptotic approaches to minimax signal, are also presented. An example of a
mildly ill-posed inverse problem is used for illustrative purposes. In
particular, it is shown that tools used to derive `asymptotic' results can be
exploited to draw `non-asymptotic' conclusions, and vice-versa.
