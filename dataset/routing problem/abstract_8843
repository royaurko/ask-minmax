A theory of $\infty$-Besov capacities is developed and several applications
are provided. In particular, we solve an open problem in the theory of limits
of the $\infty$-Besov semi-norms, we obtain new restriction-extension
inequalities and we characterize the point-wise multipliers acting on the
$\infty$-Besov spaces.
