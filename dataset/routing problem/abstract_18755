A fundamental property of codes, the second-order weight distribution, is
proposed to solve the problems such as computing second moments of weight
distributions of linear code ensembles. A series of results, parallel to those
for weight distributions, is established for second-order weight distributions.
In particular, an analogue of MacWilliams identities is proved. The
second-order weight distributions of regular LDPC code ensembles are then
computed. As easy consequences, the second moments of weight distributions of
regular LDPC code ensembles are obtained. Furthermore, the application of
second-order weight distributions in random coding approach is discussed. The
second-order weight distributions of the ensembles generated by a so-called
2-good random generator or parity-check matrix are computed, where a 2-good
random matrix is a kind of generalization of the uniformly distributed random
matrix over a finite filed and is very useful for solving problems that involve
pairwise or triple-wise properties of sequences. It is shown that the 2-good
property is reflected in the second-order weight distribution, which thus plays
a fundamental role in some well-known problems in coding theory and
combinatorics. An example of linear intersecting codes is finally provided to
illustrate this fact.
