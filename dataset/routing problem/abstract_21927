This work consists in two parts. The first part is a review of the finite
element method (FEM) for one and two-dimensional problems. The second part,
concerns the application of the FEM to find numerical solutions of the Stokes
equation and the Convection-Diffusion equation. Finally, it couples the stokes
velocity to be the convection of the Convection-Diffusion equation.
