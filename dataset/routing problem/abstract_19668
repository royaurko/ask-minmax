We describe a pricing structure for the provision of IT services that ensures
trust without requiring repeated interactions between service providers and
users. It does so by offering a pricing structure that elicits truthful
reporting of quality of service (QoS) by providers while making them
profitable. This mechanism also induces truth-telling on the part of users
reserving the service.
