The Cauchy problem is considered for the scalar wave equation in the
Schwarzschild geometry. Using an integral spectral representation we derive the
exact decay rate for solutions of the Cauchy problem with spherical symmetric
initial data, which is smooth and compactly supported outside the event
horizon.
