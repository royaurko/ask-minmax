In this work, we analyze a Lagrangian formalism recently proposed to approach
the issue of the Abraham-Lorentz force. Instead of involving only position and
velocity, as usual in Classical Mechanics, this Lagrangian involves the
acceleration of the charge. We find the conserved momentum of the charge in the
absence of any field and show that it contains an acceleration term. This
enables us to re-visit the well-known pre-acceleration problem and show that,
contrary to what has been widely believed, it is not related to any violation
of causality.
