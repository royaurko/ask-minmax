How do the quark and gluon share the nucleon momentum? How does the nucleon
spin distribute among its constituents? What means the quark and gluon
momentum, spin and orbital angular momentum? These problems are analyzed and a
solution is proposed based on {\it gauge invariance principle, canonical
quantization rule and Poincar$\acute{e}$ covariance}.
