We present a data augmentation scheme to perform Markov chain Monte Carlo
inference for models where data generation involves a rejection sampling
algorithm. Our idea, which seems to be missing in the literature, is a simple
scheme to instantiate the rejected proposals preceding each data point. The
resulting joint probability over observed and rejected variables can be much
simpler than the marginal distribution over the observed variables, which often
involves intractable integrals. We consider three problems, the first being the
modeling of flow-cytometry measurements subject to truncation. The second is a
Bayesian analysis of the matrix Langevin distribution on the Stiefel manifold,
and the third, Bayesian inference for a nonparametric Gaussian process density
model. The latter two are instances of problems where Markov chain Monte Carlo
inference is doubly-intractable. Our experiments demonstrate superior
performance over state-of-the-art sampling algorithms for such problems.
