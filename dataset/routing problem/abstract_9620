The Ritt problem asks if there is an algorithm that tells whether one prime
differential ideal is contained in another one if both are given by their
characteristic sets. We give several equivalent formulations of this problem.
In particular, we show that it is equivalent to testing if a differential
polynomial is a zero divisor modulo a radical differential ideal. The technique
used in the proof of equivalence yields algorithms for computing a canonical
decomposition of a radical differential ideal into prime components and a
canonical generating set of a radical differential ideal. Both proposed
representations of a radical differential ideal are independent of the given
set of generators and can be made independent of the ranking.
