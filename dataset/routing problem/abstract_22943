The objective of this policy paper is to formulate a new policy in the field
of scientific and technical information (STI) in Kyrgyz Republic in the light
of emergence and rapid development of electronic scientific communication. The
major problem with communication in science in the Republic is lack of adequate
access to information by scientists. An equally serious problem is poor
visibility of research conducted in Kyrgyzstan and, as consequence, negligible
research impact on academic society globally. The paper proposes an integrated
approach to formulation of a new STI policy based on a number of policy
components: telecommunication networks, computerization, STI systems,
legislation & standards, and education & trainings. Two alternatives were
considered: electronic vs. paper-based scientific communication and development
of the national STI system vs. cross-national virtual collaboration. The study
results in suggesting a number of policy recommendations for identified
stakeholders.
