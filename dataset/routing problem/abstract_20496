The q-fermion numbers emerging from the q-fermion oscillator algebra are used
to reproduce the q-fermionic Stirling and Bell numbers. New recurrence
relations for the expansion coefficients in the 'anti-normal ordering' of the
q-fermion operators are derived. The roles of the q-fermion numbers in
q-stochastic point processes and the Bargmann space representation for
q-fermion operators are explored.
