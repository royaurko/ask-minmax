In a bounded domain $\Omega$, we consider a positive solution of the problem
$\Delta u+f(u)=0$ in $\Omega$, $u=0$ on $\partial\Omega$, where
$f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is a locally Lipschitz continuous function. Under
sufficient conditions on $\Omega$ (for instance, if $\Omega$ is convex), we
show that $\partial\Omega$ is contained in a spherical annulus of radii
$r_i<r_e$, where $r_e-r_i\leq C\,[u_\nu]_{\partial\Omega}^\alpha$ for some
constants $C>0$ and $\alpha\in (0,1]$. Here, $[u_\nu]_{\partial\Omega}$ is the
Lipschitz seminorm on $\partial\Omega$ of the normal derivative of $u$. This
result improves to H\"older stability the logarithmic estimate obtained in [1]
for Serrin's overdetermined problem. It also extends to a large class of
semilinear equations the H\"older estimate obtained in [6] for the case of
torsional rigidity ($f\equiv 1$) by means of integral identities. The proof
hinges on ideas contained in [1] and uses Carleson-type estimates and improved
Harnack inequalities in cones.
