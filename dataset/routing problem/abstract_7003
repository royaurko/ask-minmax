The redundancy allocation problem is formulated minimizing the design cost
for a series-parallel system with multiple component choices whereas ensuring a
given system reliability level. The obtained model is a nonlinear integer
programming problem with a non linear, non separable constraint. We propose an
algebraic method, based on Gr\"obner bases, to obtain the exact solution of the
problem. In addition, we provide a closed form for the required Gr\"obner
bases, avoiding the bottleneck associated with the computation, and promising
computational results.
