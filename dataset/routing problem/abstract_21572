The integral in noncommutative geometry (NCG) involves a non-standard trace
called a Dixmier trace. The geometric origins of this integral are well known.
From a measure-theoretic view, however, the formulation contains several
difficulties. We review results concerning the technical features of the
integral in NCG and some outstanding problems in this area. The review is aimed
for the general user of NCG.
