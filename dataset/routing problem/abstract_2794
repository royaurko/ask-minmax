We present the result of our microsimulation study on the effects of six
traffic schemes $T=\{t_0, t_1, \dots, t_5\}$ on the mean total delay time
($\Delta$) and mean speed ($\Sigma$) of vehicles at the non-signalized Bicutan
Roundabout (BR) in Upper Bicutan, Taguig City, Metro Manila, with $t_0$ as the
current traffic scheme being enforced and $t_{i>0}$ as the proposed ones. We
present first that our simulation approach, a hybridized multi-agent system
(MAS) with the car-following and lane-changing models (CLM), can mimic the
current observed traffic scenario $C$ at a statistical significance of
$\alpha=0.05$. That is, the respective absolute differences of the $\Delta$ and
$\Sigma$ between $C$ and $t_0$ are not statistically different from zero. Next,
using our MAS-CLM, we simulated all proposed $t_{i>0}$ and compared their
respective $\Delta$ and $\Sigma$. We found out using DMRT that the best traffic
scheme is $t_3$ (i.e., when we converted the bi-directional 4-lane PNR-PNCC
road into a bi-directional 1-lane PNR-to-PNCC and 3-lane PNCC-to-PNR routes
during rush hours). Then, we experimented on converting BR into a signalized
junction and re-implemented all $t_3$ with controlled stops of $S=\{15s,
45s\}$. We found out that $t_3$ with a 15-s stop has the best performance.
Finally, we simulated the effect of increased in vehicular volume $V$ due to
traffic improvement and we found out that $t_3$ with 15-s stop still
outperforms the others for all increased in $V=\{10\%, 50\%, 100\%\}$.
