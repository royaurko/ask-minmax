Classic distributed control problems have an interesting dichotomy: they are
either trivial or undecidable. If we allow the controllers to fully
synchronize, then synthesis is trivial. In this case, controllers can
effectively act as a single controller with complete information, resulting in
a trivial control problem. But when we eliminate communication and restrict the
supervisors to locally available information, the problem becomes undecidable.
In this paper we argue in favor of a middle way. Communication is, in most
applications, expensive, and should hence be minimized. We therefore study a
solution that tries to communicate only scarcely and, while allowing
communication in order to make joint decision, favors local decisions over
joint decisions that require communication.
