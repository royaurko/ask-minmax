We present a complete description on the spectrum and eigenfunctions of the
following two point boundary value problem $$(p(x)f')'-(q(x)-\lambda
r(x))f=0\;, \;\; 0<x<L \quad ; \quad f'(0)=(\alpha_{1} \lambda + \alpha_{2})
f(0) \quad ; \quad f'(L)=(\beta_{1}\lambda -\beta_{2})f(L), $$ where $\lambda$
and $\alpha_{i}, \beta_{i}$ are spectral and physical parameters. Our survey is
focused mainly in the case $\alpha_{1}>0$ and $\beta_{1}<0$, where neither self
adjoint operator theorems on Hilbert spaces nor Sturm's comparison results can
be used directly. We describe the spectrum and the oscillatory results of the
eigenfunctions from a geometrical approach, using a function related to the
Pr\"ufer angle. The proofs of the asymptotic results of the eigenvalues and
separation theorem of the eigenfunctions are developed through classical second
order differential equation tools. Finally, the results on the spectrum of the
equation are used for the study of the linear instability of a simple model for
the fingering phenomenon on the flooding oil recovery process.
