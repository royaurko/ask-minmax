For $\ell_2$, there exists the powerful dimension reduction transform of
Johnson and Lindenstrauss [JL84], with a host of known applications. Here, we
consider the problem of dimension reduction for all $\ell_p$ spaces . Although
strong lower bounds are known for dimension reduction in $\ell_1$, Ostrovsky
and Rabani [OR02] successfully circumvented these by presenting an $\ell_1$
embedding that maintains fidelity in only a bounded distance range, with
applications to clustering and nearest neighbor search. However, their
embedding techniques are specific to $\ell_1$ and do not naturally extend to
other norms.
  In this paper, we apply a range of advanced techniques and produce bounded
range dimension reduction embeddings for all of $1 \le p < \infty$, thereby
demonstrating that the approach initiated by Ostrovsky and Rabani for $\ell_1$
can be extended to a much more general framework. As a result we achieve
improved bounds for a host of proximity problems including nearest neighbor
search, snowflake embeddings, and clustering, for various values of p. In
particular, our nearest neighbor search structure for p > 2 provides an
algorithmic solution to a major open problem.
