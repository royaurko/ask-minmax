We consider the abstract initial value problem for the system of evolution
equations which describe motion of incompressible viscous and heat-conductive
fluids in a bounded domain. It is difficulty of our problem that we do not
neglect the viscous dissipation function in contrast to the Boussinesq
approximation. This problem has uniquely a mild solution locally in time for
general initial data, and globally in time for small initial data. Moreover, a
mild solution of this problem can be a strong or classical solution under
appropriate assumptions for initial data. We prove the above properties by the
theory of analytic semigroups on Banach spaces.
