We show that the problem k-Dominating Set and its several variants including
k-Connected Dominating Set, k-Independent Dominating Set, and k-Dominating
Clique, when parameterized by the solution size k, are W[1]-hard in either
multiple-interval graphs or their complements or both. On the other hand, we
show that these problems belong to W[1] when restricted to multiple-interval
graphs and their complements. This answers an open question of Fellows et al.
In sharp contrast, we show that d-Distance k-Dominating Set for d >= 2 is
W[2]-complete in multiple-interval graphs and their complements. We also show
that k-Perfect Code and d-Distance k-Perfect Code for d >= 2 are W[1]-complete
even in unit 2-track interval graphs. In addition, we present various new
results on the parameterized complexities of k-Vertex Clique Partition and
k-Separating Vertices in multiple-interval graphs and their complements, and
present a very simple alternative proof of the W[1]-hardness of k-Irredundant
Set in general graphs.
