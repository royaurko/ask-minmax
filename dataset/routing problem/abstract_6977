Since the breakthrough papers from 2005/2006, the field of numerical
relativity has experienced a growth spurt that took the two-body problem in
general relativity from the category of "really-hard-problems" to the realm of
"things-we-know-how-to-do". Simulations of binary black holes in circular
orbits, the holy grail of numerical relativity, are now tractable problems that
lead to some of the most spectacular results in general relativity in recent
years. We cover here some of the latest achievements and highlight the field's
next challenges.
