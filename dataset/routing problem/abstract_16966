One of my recent papers transforms an NP-Complete problem into the question
of whether or not a feasible real solution exists to some Linear Program. The
unique feature of this Linear Program is that though there is no explicit bound
on the minimum required number of linear inequalities, which is most probably
exponential to the size of the NP-Complete problem, the Linear Program can
still be described efficiently. The reason for this efficient description is
that coefficients keep repeating in some pattern, even as the number of
inequalities is conveniently assumed to tend to Infinity. I discuss why this
convenient assumption does not change the feasibility result of the Linear
Program. I conclude with two Conjectures, which might help to make an efficient
decision on the feasibility of this Linear Program.
