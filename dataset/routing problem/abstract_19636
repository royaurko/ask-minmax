We discuss various ensembles of homogeneous complex networks and a
Monte-Carlo method of generating graphs from these ensembles. The method is
quite general and can be applied to simulate micro-canonical, canonical or
grand-canonical ensembles for systems with various statistical weights. It can
be used to construct homogeneous networks with desired properties, or to
construct a non-trivial scoring function for problems of advanced motif
searching.
