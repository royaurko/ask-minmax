Certain methods of analysis require the knowledge of the spatial distances
between entities whose data are stored in a microdata table. For instance, such
knowledge is necessary and sufficient to perform data mining tasks such as
nearest neighbour searches or clustering. However, when inter-record distances
are published in addition to the microdata for research purposes, the risk of
identity disclosure has to be taken into consideration again. In order to
tackle this problem, we introduce a flexible graph model for microdata in a
metric space and propose a linkage attack based on realistic assumptions of a
data snooper's background knowledge. This attack is based on the idea of
finding a maximum approximate common subgraph of two vertex-labelled and
edge-weighted graphs. By adapting a standard argument from algorithmic graph
theory to our setup, this task is transformed to the maximum clique detection
problem in a corresponding product graph. Using a toy example and experimental
results on simulated data show that publishing even approximate distances could
increase the risk of identity disclosure unreasonably.
