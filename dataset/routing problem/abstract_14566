In 2009, Kong, Wang, and Lee introduced the problem of finding the
edge-balanced index sets ($EBI$) of complete bipartite graphs $K_{m,n}$, where
they examined the cases $n=1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$ and the case $m=n$. Since
then the problem of finding $EBI(K_{m,n})$, where $m \geq n$, has been
completely resolved for the $m,n=$ odd, odd and odd, even cases. In this paper
we find the edge-balanced index sets for complete bipartite graphs where both
parts have even cardinality.
