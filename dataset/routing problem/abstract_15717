Many proposed solutions to the hierarchy problem rely on dimensional
transmutation in asymptotically free gauge theories, and these theories often
have dual descriptions in terms of a warped extra dimension. Gravitational
calculations show that the confining phase transition in Randall-Sundrum models
is first-order and parametrically slower than the rate expected in large-N
gauge theories. This is dangerous because it leads to an empty universe
problem. We argue that this rate suppression arises from approximate conformal
symmetry. Though this empty universe problem cannot be solved by using the
radion for low-scale inflation, we argue that if the radion potential is
asymptotically free, another instanton for the RS phase transition can proceed
as $e^{-N^2}$. We also discuss the existence of light magnetic monopoles ($\sim
100$ TeV) as a possible signature of such a phase transition.
