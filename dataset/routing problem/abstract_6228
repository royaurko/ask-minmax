In the first part we summarize the status of the nucleon-nucleon (NN) problem
in the context of Hamiltonian based constituent quark models and present
results for the l=0 phase shifts obtained from the Goldstone-boson exchange
model by applying the resonationg group method. The second part deals with the
construction of local shallow and deep equivalent potentials based on a
Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics approach.
