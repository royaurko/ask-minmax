We prove that for any connected open set $\Omega\subset \R^n$ and for any set
of matrices $K=\{A_1,A_2,A_3\}\subset M^{m\times n}$, with $m\ge n$ and
rank$(A_i-A_j)=n$ for $i\neq j$, there is no non-constant solution $B\in
L^{\infty}(\Omega,M^{m\times n})$, called exact solution, to the problem
  Div B=0 \quad \text{in} D'(\Omega,\R^m) \quad \text{and} \quad B(x)\in K
\text{a.e. in} \Omega.
  In contrast, A. Garroni and V. Nesi \cite{GN} exhibited an example of set $K$
for which the above problem admits the so-called approximate solutions. We give
further examples of this type.
  We also prove non-existence of exact solutions when $K$ is an arbitrary set
of matrices satisfying a certain algebraic condition which is weaker than
simultaneous diagonalizability.
