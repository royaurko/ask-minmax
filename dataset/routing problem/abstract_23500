Membranes holomorphically embedded in flat noncompact space are constructed
in terms of the degrees of freedom of an infinite collection of 0-branes. To
each holomorphic curve we associate infinite-dimensional matrices which are
static solutions to the matrix theory equations of motion, and which can be
interpreted as the matrix theory representation of the holomorphically embedded
membrane. The problem of finding such matrix representations can be phrased as
a problem in geometric quantization, where epsilon -> l_P^3/R plays the role of
the Planck constant and parametrizes families of solutions. The concept of
Bergman projection is used as a basic tool, and a local expansion for the
action of the projection in inverse powers of curvature is derived. This
expansion is then used to compute the required matrices perturbatively in
epsilon. The first two terms in the expansion correspond to the standard
geometric quantization result and to the result obtained using the metaplectic
correction to geometric quantization.
