Global SLS-resolution is a well-known procedural semantics for top-down
computation of queries under the well-founded model. It inherits from
SLDNF-resolution the {\em linearity} property of derivations, which makes it
easy and efficient to implement using a simple stack-based memory structure.
However, like SLDNF-resolution it suffers from the problem of infinite loops
and redundant computations. To resolve this problem, in this paper we develop a
new procedural semantics, called {\em SLTNF-resolution}, by enhancing Global
SLS-resolution with loop cutting and tabling mechanisms. SLTNF-resolution is
sound and complete w.r.t. the well-founded semantics for logic programs with
the bounded-term-size property, and is superior to existing linear tabling
procedural semantics such as SLT-resolution.
