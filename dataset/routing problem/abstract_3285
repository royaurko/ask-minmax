In a transformation method the numerical solution of a given boundary value
problem is obtained by solving one or more related initial value problems. This
paper is concerned with the application of the iterative transformation method
to the Sakiadis problem. This method is an extension of the Toepfer's
non-iterative algorithm developed as a simple way to solve the celebrated
Blasius problem. As shown by this contributor [Appl. Anal., 66 (1997) pp. 89-100]
the method provides a simple numerical test for the existence and uniqueness of
solutions. Here we show how the method can be applied to problems with a
homogeneous boundary conditions at infinity and in particular we solve the
Sakiadis problem of boundary layer theory. Moreover, we show how to couple our
method with Newton's root-finder. The obtained numerical results compare well
with those available in literature. The main aim here is that any method
developed for the Blasius, or the Sakiadis, problem might be extended to more
challenging or interesting problems. In this context, the iterative
transformation method has been recently applied to compute the normal and
reverse flow solutions of Stewartson for the Falkner-Skan model [Comput. &
Fluids, 73 (2013) pp. 202-209].
