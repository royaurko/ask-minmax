The zero forcing number is a graph invariant introduced to study the minimum
rank of the graph. In 2008, Aazami proved the NP-hardness of computing the zero
forcing number of a simple undirected graph. We complete this NP-hardness
result by showing that the non-equivalent problem of computing the zero forcing
number of a directed graph allowing loops is also NP-hard. The rest of the
paper is devoted to the strong controllability of a networked system. This kind
of controllability takes into account only the structure of the interconnection
graph, but not the interconnection strengths along the edges. We provide a
necessary and sufficient condition in terms of zero forcing sets for the strong
controllability of a system whose underlying graph is a directed graph allowing
loops. Moreover, we explain how our result differs from a recent related result
discovered by Monshizadeh et al. Finally, we show how to solve the problem of
finding efficiently a minimum-size input set for the strong controllability of
a self-damped system with a tree-structure.
