In this paper we study the 2-dimension of a finite poset from the topological
point of view. We use homotopy theory of finite topological spaces and the
concept of a beat point to improve the classical results on 2-dimension, giving
a more complete answer to the problem of all possible 2-dimensions of an
n-point poset.
