Thermodynamics (in concert with its sister discipline, statistical physics)
can be regarded as a data reduction scheme based on partitioning a total system
into a subsystem and a bath that weakly interact with each other. The ubiquity
and applicability of the scheme chiefly derives from that of partitioning
protocols in experiments and observations. Whereas conventionally, the systems
investigated require this form of data reduction in order to facilitate
prediction, a different problem also occurs, in the context of communication
networks, markets, etc. Such "empirically accessible" systems typically
overwhelm observers with the sort of information that in the case of (say) a
gas is effectively unobtainable. What is required for such complex interacting
systems is not prediction (this may be impossible when humans besides the
observer are responsible for the interactions) but rather,_description_ as a
route to understanding. Still, the need for a thermodynamical data reduction
scheme remains. In this paper, we show how an empirical temperature can be
computed for finite, empirically accessible systems, and further outline how
this construction allows the age-old science of thermodynamics to be fruitfully
applied to them. The particular example of TCP/IP networks will be briefly
discussed.
