Two planar sets are circularly separable if there exists a circle enclosing
one of the sets and whose open interior disk does not intersect the other set.
 This paper studies two problems related to circular separability. A
linear-time algorithm is proposed to decide if two polygons are circularly
separable. The algorithm outputs the smallest separating circle. The second
problem asks for the largest circle included in a preprocessed, convex polygon,
under some point and/or line constraints. The resulting circle must contain the
query points and it must lie in the halfplanes delimited by the query lines.
