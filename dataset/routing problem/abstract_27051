We present a fully computable a posteriori error estimator for piecewise
linear finite element approximations of reaction-diffusion problems with mixed
boundary conditions and piecewise constant reaction coefficient formulated in
arbitrary dimension. The estimator provides a guaranteed upper bound on the
energy norm of the error and it is robust for all values of the reaction
coefficient, including the singularly perturbed case. The approach is based on
robustly equilibrated boundary flux functions of Ainsworth and Oden (Wiley
2000) and on subsequent robust and explicit flux reconstruction. This paper
simplifies and extends the applicability of the previous result of Ainsworth
and Vejchodsk\'y (Numer. Math. 119 (2011) 219-243) in three aspects: (i)
arbitrary dimension, (ii) mixed boundary conditions, and (iii) non-constant
reaction coefficient. It is the first robust upper bound on the error with
these properties. An auxiliary result that is of independent interest is the
derivation of new explicit constants for two types of trace inequalities on
simplices.
