In this note we focus on three independent problems on Okounkov bodies for
projective varieties. The main goal is to present a geometric version of the
classical Fujita Approximation Theorem, a Jow-type theorem and a cardinality
formulae for Minkowski bases on a certain class of smooth projective surfaces.
