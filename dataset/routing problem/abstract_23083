A single spherical antenna is capable of measuring the direction and
polarization of a gravitational wave. It is possible to solve the inverse
problem using only linear algebra even in the presence of noise. The simplicity
of this solution enables one to explore the error on the solution using
standard techniques. In this paper we derive the error on the direction and
polarization measurements of a gravitational wave. We show that the solid angle
error and the uncertainty on the wave amplitude are direction independent. We
also discuss the possibility of determining the polarization amplitudes with
isotropic sensitivity for any given gravitational wave source.
