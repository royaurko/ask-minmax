A thermodynamically consistent two-phase Stefan problem with
temperature-dependent surface tension and with or without kinetic undercooling
is studied. It is shown that these problems generate local semiflows in
well-defined state manifolds. If a solution does not exhibit singularities, it
is proved that it exists globally in time and converges towards an equilibrium
of the problem. In addition, stability and instability of equilibria is
studied. In particular, it is shown that multiple spheres of the same radius
are unstable if surface heat capacity is small; however, if kinetic
undercooling is absent, they are stable if surface heat capacity is
sufficiently large.
