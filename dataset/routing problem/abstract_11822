We investigate a novel stochastic technique for the global optimization of
complex potential energy surfaces (PES) that avoids the freezing problem of
simulated annealing by allowing the dynamical process to tunnel energetically
inaccessible regions of the PES by way of a dynamically adjusted nonlinear
transformation of the original PES. We demonstrate the success of this
approach, which is characterized by a single adjustable parameter, for three
generic hard minimization problems.
