In this work we consider deformations of Leibniz algebras over a field of
characteristic zero. The main problem in deformation theory is to describe all
non-equivalent deformations of a given object. We give a method to solve this
problem completely, namely work out a construction of a versal deformation for
a given Leibniz algebra, which induces all non-equivalent deformations and is
unique on the infinitesimal level.
