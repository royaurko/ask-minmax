We consider a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with double power
nonlinearity, where one power is focusing and mass critical and the other mass
sub-critical. Classical variational arguments ensure that initial data with
mass less than the mass of the ground state of the mass critical problem lead
to global in time solutions. We are interested by the threshold dynamic and in
particular by the existence of finite time blow up minimal solutions. For the
mass critical problem, such an object exists thanks to the explicit conformal
symmetry, and is in fact unique. For the focusing double power nonlinearity, we
exhibit a new class of minimal blow up solutions with blow up rates deeply
affected by the double power nonlinearity. The analysis adapts the recent
approach developed by Rapha\"el and Szeftel for the construction of minimal
blow up elements.
