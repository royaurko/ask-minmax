A scale invariant, selfsimilar atmospheric eddy continuum exists in the
planetary atmospheric boundary layer spanning several orders of magnitude in
scales and gives rise to the observed fractal geometry for the global cloud
cover pattern. The global weather systems are manifestations of the unified
atmospheric eddy continuum with inherent mutual global-local energy exchange
and therefore local urban energy/pollution sources have long-range global
effects leading to climate change and environmental degradation. It is shown
that the observed scale invariant atmospheric eddy continuum originates from
the turbulence scale by the universal period doubling route to chaos eddy
growth phenomenon in the planetary atmospheric boundary layer. The cloud
dynamical, microphysical and electrical parameters are shown to be simple
unique functions of turbulence scale energy generation.
