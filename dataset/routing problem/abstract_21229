In this paper, we establish universal inequalities for eigenvalues of the
clamped plate problem on compact submanifolds of Euclidean spaces, of spheres
and of real, complex and quaternionic projective spaces. We also prove similar
results for the biharmonic operator on domains of Riemannian manifolds
admitting spherical eigenmaps (this includes the compact homogeneous Riemannian
spaces) and nally on domains of the hyperbolic space.
