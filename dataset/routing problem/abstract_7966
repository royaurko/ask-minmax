We construct linear Hamilton systems without usual dichotomy property.
 The Ljapunov spectra of these systems are unfamiliar and conflicting, the
behaviour of trajectories is very complicated.
 The paper's subject refers to some problems of indefinite inner product
methods in the stability theory of abstract dynamical equation solutions.
