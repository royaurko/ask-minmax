Measuring software complexity plays an important role to meet the demands of
complex software. The cyclomatic complexity is one of most used and renowned
metric among the other three proposed and researched metrics that are namely:
Line of code, Halstead measure and cyclomatic complexity. Although cyclomatic
complexity is very popular but also serves some of the problems which has been
identified and showed in a tabular form in this research work. It lacks the
calculation of coupling between the object classes for object oriented
programming and only calculates the complexity on the basis of the conditional
statements. Thus there is requirement to improve the concept of cyclomatic
complexity based on coupling. Paper includes the proposed algorithm to handle
the above stated problem.
