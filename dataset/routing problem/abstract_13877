On a constraint manifold we give an explicit formula for the Hessian matrix
of a cost function that involves the Hessian matrix of a prolonged function and
the Hessian matrices of the constraint functions. We give an explicit formula
for the case of the orthogonal group ${\bf O}(n)$ by using only Euclidean
coordinates on $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$. An optimization problem on ${\bf SO}(3)$ is
completely carried out. Its applications to nonlinear stability problems are
also analyzed.
