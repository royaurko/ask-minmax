This paper describes the recently developed mixed mimetic spectral element
method for the Stokes problem in the vorticity-velocity-pressure formulation.
This compatible discretization method relies on the construction of a
conforming discrete Hodge decomposition, that is based on a bounded projection
operator that commutes with the exterior derivative. The projection operator is
the composition of a reduction and a reconstruction step. The reconstruction in
terms of mimetic spectral element basis-functions are tensor-based
constructions and therefore hold for curvilinear quadrilateral and hexahedral
meshes. For compatible discretization methods that contain a conforming
discrete Hodge decomposition, we derive optimal a priori error estimates which
are valid for all admissible boundary conditions on both Cartesian and
curvilinear meshes. These theoretical results are confirmed by numerical
experiments. These clearly show that the mimetic spectral elements outperform
the commonly used H(div)-compatible Raviart-Thomas elements.
