This paper is concerned with the square root problem of Kato for the "sum" of
linear operators in a Hilbert space ${\mathbb H}$. Under suitable assumptions,
we show that if $A$ and $B$ are respectively m-scetroial linear operators
satisfying the square root problem of Kato. Then the same conclusion still
holds for their "sum". As application, we consider perturbed Schr\"{o}dinger
operators.
