We investigate the role of the noncompact group of dilations in $\mathbb R^n$
on the difference of the quadratic forms associated to the fractional Dirichlet
and Navier Laplacians. Then we apply our results to study the Brezis--Nirenberg
effect in two families of noncompact boundary value problems involving the
Navier-Laplacian.
