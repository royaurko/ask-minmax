Peer-to-peer (P2P) Data-sharing systems now generate a significant portion of
internet traffic. P2P systems have emerged as a popular way to share huge
volumes of data. Requirements for widely distributed information systems
supporting virtual organizations have given rise to a new category of P2P
systems called schema- based. In such systems each peer is a database
management system in itself, ex-posing its own schema. A fundamental problem
that confronts peer-to-peer applications is the efficient location of the node
that stores a desired data item. In such settings, the main objective is the
efficient search across peer databases by processing each incoming query
without overly consuming bandwidth. The usability of these systems depends on
effective techniques to find and retrieve data; however, efficient and
effective routing of content- based queries is an emerging problem in P2P
networks. In this paper, we propose an architecture, based on super-peers, and
we focus on query routing. Our approach considers that super-Peers having
similar interests are grouped together for an efficient query routing method.
In such groups, called Knowledge-Super-Peers (KSP), super-peers submit queries
that are often processed by members of this group.
