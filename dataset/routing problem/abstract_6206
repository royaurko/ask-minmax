We study the solution to the Polonyi problem where the Polonyi field weighs
as $O(10{\rm TeV})$ and decays just before the primordial nucleosynthesis. It
is shown that in spite of a large entropy production by the Polonyi field
decay, one can naturally explain the present value of the baryon-to-entropy
ratio, $n_B/s \sim (10^{-10}-10^{-11})$ if the Affleck-Dine mechanism for
baryogenesis works. It is pointed out, however, that there is another
cosmological problem related to the abundance of the lightest superparticles
produced by the Polonyi decay.
