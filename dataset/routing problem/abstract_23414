This is a broad-brush review of how string theory addresses several important
questions of gravitational physics. The problem of non-renormalizability is
first reviewed, followed by introduction of string theory as an
ultraviolet-finite theory of gravity. String theory's successes also include
predicting both gauge theory and fermions. The difficulty of extra dimensions
becomes a possible virtue, when one notes that these lead to mechanisms to
explain fermion generations, as well as a means to break the large gauge
symmetries of string theory. Finally, a long standing problem of string theory,
that of fixing the size and shape of the extra dimensions, has recently been
addressed and may shed light on the origin of the cosmological constant, the
ultimate fate of our universe, as well as the question of why gravity_is_ so
weak.
