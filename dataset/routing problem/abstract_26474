We describe an approach to modelling and reasoning about data-centric
business processes and present a form of general model checking. Our technique
extends existing approaches, which explore systems only from concrete initial
states. Specifically, we model business processes in terms of smaller
fragments, whose possible interactions are constrained by first-order logic
formulae. In turn, process fragments are connected graphs annotated with
instructions to modify data. Correctness properties concerning the evolution of
data with respect to processes can be stated in a first-order branching-time
logic over built-in theories, such as linear integer arithmetic, records and
arrays.
  Solving general model checking problems over this logic is considerably
harder than model checking when a concrete initial state is given. To this end,
we present a tableau procedure that reduces these model checking problems to
first-order logic over arithmetic. The resulting proof obligations are passed
on to appropriate "off-the-shelf" theorem provers. We also detail our modelling
approach, describe the reasoning components and report on first experiments.
