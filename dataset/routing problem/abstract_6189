The model of the homogenous and isotropic universe with two spaces is
considered. The background space is a coordinate system of reference and
defines the behaviour of the universe. The other space characterizes the
gravity of the matter of the universe. In the presented model, the first
derivative of the scale factor of the universe with respect to time is equal to
the velocity of light. The density of the matter of the universe changes from
the Planckian value at the Planck time to the modern value at the modern time.
The model under consideration describes the universe from the Planck time to
the modern time and avoids the problems of the Friedman universe such as the
flatness problem and the horizon problem.
