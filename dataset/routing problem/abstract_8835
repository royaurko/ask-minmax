We interpret all Maurer-Cartan elements in the formal Hochschild complex of a
small dg category which is cohomologically bounded above in terms of torsion
Morita deformations. This solves the "curvature problem", i.e. the phenomenon
that such Maurer-Cartan elements naturally parameterize curved A_infinity
deformations. In the infinitesimal setup, we show how (n+1)-th order curved
deformations give rise to n-th order uncurved Morita deformations.
