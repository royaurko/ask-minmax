We consider a variational problem related to the shape of charged liquid
drops at equilibrium. We show that this problem never admits global minimizers
with respect to $L^1$ perturbations preserving the volume. This leads us to
study it in more regular classes of competitors, for which we show existence of
minimizers. We then prove that the ball is the unique solution for sufficiently
small charges.
