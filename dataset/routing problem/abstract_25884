The bipartite boolean quadratic programming problem (BBQP) is a
generalization of the well studied boolean quadratic programming problem. The
model has a variety of real life applications; however, empirical studies of
the model are not available in the literature, except in a few isolated
instances. In this paper, we develop efficient heuristic algorithms based on
tabu search, very large scale neighborhood (VLSN) search, and a hybrid
algorithm that integrates the two. The computational study establishes that
effective integration of simple tabu search with VLSN search results in
superior outcomes, and suggests the value of such an integration in other
settings. Complexity analysis and implementation details are provided along
with conclusions drawn from experimental analysis. In addition, we obtain
solutions better than the best previously known for almost all medium and large
size benchmark instances.
