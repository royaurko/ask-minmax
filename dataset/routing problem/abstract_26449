In this paper we develop hydrodynamic models using spectral differential
operators to investigate the spatial stability of swirling fluid systems.
Including viscosity as a valid parameter of the fluid, the hydrodynamic model
is derived using a nodal Lagrangian basis and the polynomial eigenvalue problem
describing the viscous spatial stability is reduced to a generalized eigenvalue
problem using the companion vector method. For inviscid study the hydrodynamic
model is obtained by means of a class of shifted orthogonal expansion functions
and the spectral differentiation matrix is derived to approximate the discrete
derivatives. The models were applied to a Q-vortex structure, both schemes
providing good results.
