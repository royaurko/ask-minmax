In today's Web, Web Services are created and updated on the fly. For
answering complex needs of users, the construction of new web services based on
existing ones is required. It has received a great attention from different
communities. This problem is known as web services composition. However, it is
one of big challenge problems of recent years in a distributed and dynamic
environment. Web services can be composed manually but it is a time consuming
task. The automatic web service composition is one of the key features for
future the semantic web. The various approaches in field of web service
compositions proposed by the researchers. In this paper, we propose a novel
architecture for semantic web service composition using clustering and Ant
colony algorithm.
