This Thesis concerns a thin fluid shell embedded in its own gravitational
field. The starting point is a work of Hajicek and Kijowski, where the
hamiltonian formalism for shell(s) (with no symmetry) in Einstein gravity is
developed. An open problem at the end of that paper is to show how the
hamiltonian formalism defines a regular constrained system: the hamiltonian and
the constraints must be differentiable functionals on the phase space, so that
their Poisson Brackets are well defined objects. On the contrary, some
constraints at the shell result to be non differentiable functionals on the
phase space. This problem is tackled, in the present thesis, by following the
reduction procedure suggested by Teitelboim and Henneaux: the singular
constraints are solved and the solution is substituted back into the
hamiltonian. The resulting hamiltonian is shown to lead to equivalent dynamics,
without singular constraints. Besides, the final reduced system (hamiltonian
plus canonical constraints) is shown to be fully differentiable on the reduced
phase space.
