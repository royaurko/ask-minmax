In this paper we consider second order elliptic partial differential
equations with highly varying (heterogeneous) coefficients on a two-dimensional
region. The problems are discretized by a composite finite element (FE) and
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Method. The fine grids are in general nonmatching
across the subdomain boundaries, and the subdomain partitioning does not need
to resolve the jumps in the coefficient. A FETI-DP preconditioner is proposed
and analyzed to solve the resulting linear system. Numerical results are
presented to support our theory.
