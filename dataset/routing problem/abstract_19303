We propose and evaluate a number of solutions to the problem of calculating
the cost to serve each location in a single-vehicle transport setting. Such
cost to serve analysis has application both strategically and operationally in
transportation. The problem is formally given by the traveling salesperson game
(TSG), a cooperative total utility game in which agents correspond to locations
in a traveling salesperson problem (TSP). The cost to serve a location is an
allocated portion of the cost of an optimal tour. The Shapley value is one of
the most important normative division schemes in cooperative games, giving a
principled and fair allocation both for the TSG and more generally. We consider
a number of direct and sampling-based procedures for calculating the Shapley
value, and present the first proof that approximating the Shapley value of the
TSG within a constant factor is NP-hard. Treating the Shapley value as an ideal
baseline allocation, we then develop six proxies for that value which are
relatively easy to compute. We perform an experimental evaluation using
Synthetic Euclidean games as well as games derived from real-world tours
calculated for fast-moving consumer goods scenarios. Our experiments show that
several computationally tractable allocation techniques correspond to good
proxies for the Shapley value.
