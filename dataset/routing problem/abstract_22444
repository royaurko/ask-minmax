We study the asymptotic behavior of solutions for the semilinear damped wave
equation with variable coefficients. We prove that if the damping is effective,
and the nonlinearity and other lower order terms can be regarded as
perturbations, then the solution is approximated by the scaled Gaussian of the
corresponding linear parabolic problem. The proof is based on the scaling
variables and energy estimates.
