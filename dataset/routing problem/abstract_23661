This paper reviews many of the known inequalities for the eigenvalues of the
Laplacian and bi-Laplacian on bounded domains in Euclidean space. In
particular, we focus on isoperimetric inequalities for the low eigenvalues of
the Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians and of the vibrating clamped plate problem
(i.e., the biharmonic operator with ``Dirichlet'' boundary conditions). We also
discuss the known universal inequalities for the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet
Laplacian and the vibrating clamped plate and buckling problems and go on to
present some new ones. Some of the names associated with these inequalities are
Rayleigh, Faber-Krahn, Szego-Weinberger, Payne-Polya-Weinberger, Sperner,
Hile-Protter, and H. C. Yang. Occasionally, we will also comment on extensions
of some of our inequalities to bounded domains in other spaces, specifically,
S^n or H^n.
