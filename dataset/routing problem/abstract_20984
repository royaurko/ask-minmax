We give a new lower bound for the essential minimum of subvarieties of
abelian varieties with small codimension, under a conjecture about ordinary
primes in abelian varieties. This lower bound is already known in the toric
case since the work of Amoroso and David. It is the best expected, "up to an
epsilon", in the degree of the subvariety.
