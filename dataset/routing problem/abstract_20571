We consider solutions of a scalar reaction-diffusion equation of the ignition
type with a random, stationary and ergodic reaction rate. We show that
solutions of the Cauchy problem spread with a deterministic rate in the long
time limit. We also establish existence of generalized random traveling waves
and of transition fronts in general heterogeneous media.
