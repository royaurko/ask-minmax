We consider the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation perturbed by a
Dirac potential. Using a fine analysis of the properties of the linear
propagator, we study the well-posedness of the Cauchy Problem in the energy
space of functions with modulus 1 at infinity. Then we show the persistence of
the stationary black soliton of the unperturbed problem as a solution. We also
prove the existence of another branch of non-trivial stationary waves.
Depending on the attractive or repulsive nature of the Dirac perturbation and
of the type of stationary solutions, we prove orbital stability via a
variational approach, or linear instability via a bifurcation argument.
