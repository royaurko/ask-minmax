Imposing a constraint of the sound-speed profile determined from
helioseismology and updating the microphysics, we have revised our seismic
solar model, constructed with the assumption of a homogeneous metal abundance
distribution, and have shown that the theoretically expected neutrino fluxes
are still significantly more than the observations. With the same sound-speed
profile constraint, we also constructed solar models with low metal abundance
in the core, and evaluated the neutrino fluxes of these models to see if
nonstandard solar models with a low metal core can solve the solar neutrino
problem. Some of these models are in agreement with the Homestake data, the
Super-Kamiokande data, and the sound-speed profile simultaneously, but none of
these satisfy both the neutrino flux data, including GALLEX and SAGE, and the
helioseismically determined density profile.
