The multidimensional assignment problem (MAP) (abbreviated s-AP in the case
of s dimensions) is an extension of the well-known assignment problem. The most
studied case of MAP is 3-AP, though the problems with larger values of s have
also a number of applications. In this paper we consider four fast construction
heuristics for MAP. One of the heuristics is new. A modification of the
heuristics is proposed to optimize the access to slow computer memory. The
results of computational experiments for several instance families are provided
and discussed.
