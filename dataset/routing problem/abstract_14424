Quantitative fluorescence photoacoustic tomography (QfPAT) is a variant of
quantitative photoacoustic tomography (PAT) that combines fluorescence optical
tomography with ultrasound tomography to obtain high-resolution imaging of
fluorescence distributions inside heterogeneous media. The objective of this
work is to study inverse problems in QfPAT where we intend to reconstruct
optical coefficients in a coupled system of radiative transport equations using
internal data recovered from photoacoustic measurements. We derive uniqueness
and stability results on the inverse problems and develop some efficient
algorithms for image reconstruction. Numerical simulations based on synthetic
data are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.
