In recent work, we used pseudo-differential theory to establish conditions
that the initial-boundary value problem for second order systems of wave
equations be strongly well-posed in a generalized sense. The applications
included the harmonic version of the Einstein equations. Here we show that
these results can also be obtained via standard energy estimates, thus
establishing strong well-posedness of the harmonic Einstein problem in the
classical sense.
