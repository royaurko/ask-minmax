We derive explicit formulae for a set of constraints for the Einstein
equations on a null hypersurface, in arbitrary dimensions. We solve these
constraints and show that they provide necessary and sufficient conditions so
that a spacetime solution of the Cauchy problem on a characteristic cone for
the hyperbolic system of the reduced Einstein equations in wave-map gauge also
satisfies the full Einstein equations. We prove a geometric uniqueness theorem
for this Cauchy problem in the vacuum case.
