We present the application of the inverse scattering method to the design of
semiconductor heterostructures having a preset dependence of the (conduction)
electrons' reflectance on the energy. The electron dynamics are described by
either the effective mass Schr\"odinger, or by the (variable mass) BenDaniel
and Duke equations. The problem of phase (re)construction for the complex
transmission and reflection coefficients is solved by a combination of Pad\'e
approximant techniques, obtaining reference solutions with simple analytic
properties. Reflectance-preserving transformations allow bound state and
reflection resonance management. The inverse scattering problem for the
Schroedinger equation is solved using an algebraic approach due to Sabatier.
This solution can be mapped unitarily onto a family of BenDaniel and Duke type
equations. The boundary value problem for the nonlinear equation which
determines the mapping is discussed in some detail. The chemical concentration
profile of heterostructures whose self consistent potential yields the desired
reflectance is solved completely in the case of Schroedinger dynamics and
approximately for Ben-Daniel and Duke dynamics. The Appendix contains a brief
digest of results from scattering and inverse scattering theory for the
one-dimensional Schroedinger equation which are used in the paper.
