In the present work we study the well-known Two Capacitor Problem from a new
perspective. Although this problem has been thoroughly investigated, as far as
we know there are no studies of the thermodynamic aspects of the discharge
process. We use the Free Electron Gas Model to describe the electrons' energy
levels in both capacitors in the low temperature regime. We assume that the
capacitors and the resistor can exchange energy freely with a heat reservoir.
We assume that the resistance is large enough to consider an isothermal heat
exchange between the resistor and the heat reservoir. Thereby we obtain a
positive entropy variation due to the discharge process, corroborating its
irreversibility.
