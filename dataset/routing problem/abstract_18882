Explicit non-asymptotic upper bounds on the sizes of multiple-deletion
correcting codes are presented. In particular, the largest single-deletion
correcting code for $q$-ary alphabet and string length $n$ is shown to be of
size at most $\frac{q^n-q}{(q-1)(n-1)}$. An improved bound on the asymptotic
rate function is obtained as a corollary. Upper bounds are also derived on
sizes of codes for a constrained source that does not necessarily comprise of
all strings of a particular length, and this idea is demonstrated by
application to sets of run-length limited strings.
  The problem of finding the largest deletion correcting code is modeled as a
matching problem on a hypergraph. This problem is formulated as an integer
linear program. The upper bound is obtained by the construction of a feasible
point for the dual of the linear programming relaxation of this integer linear
program.
  The non-asymptotic bounds derived imply the known asymptotic bounds of
Levenshtein and Tenengolts and improve on known non-asymptotic bounds.
Numerical results support the conjecture that in the binary case, the
Varshamov-Tenengolts codes are the largest single-deletion correcting codes.
