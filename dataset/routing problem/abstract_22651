Forced advection of passive tracer, $\theta $, in nonlinear relaxational
medium by large scale (Batchelor problem) incompressible velocity field at
scales less than the correlation length of the flow and larger than the
diffusion scale is considered. Effective theory explaining small scale scalar
fluctuations is proven to be linear, asymptotic free (downscales from the scale
of the pumping) and universal. Only three parameters are required to decribe
exhaustively the small scale statistics of scalar difference: two
velocity-dependent ones, average and dispersion ($\bar{\lambda}$ and $\Delta $
respectively) of the exponential stretching rate of a trial line element, and
$\alpha $, standing for average rate of linear damping of small scale scalar
fluctuations. $\alpha $ is an explicit functional of potential chracterized
medium nonlinearity and amplitude of $\theta ^{2}$ flux pumped into the system.
Structure functions show an extremely anomalous, intermittent behavior:
$<|\delta \theta_{r}|^{q}> \sim r^{\xi_{q}}, \xi_{q} = \min {q,\sqrt{[
\frac{\bar{\lambda}}{\Delta}] ^{2} + \frac{2\alpha q}{\Delta}} -
\frac{\bar{\lambda}}{\Delta}}$. No dissipative anomaly is found in the problem.
