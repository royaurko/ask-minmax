I review the Sign Problem hindering lattice QCD simulations of dense baryonic
matter, focussing where possible on its physical relevance. The possibility of
avoiding the Sign Problem via a duality transformation is also briefly
considered. Finally, I review evidence for deconfinement at non-zero quark
density in recent simulations of Two Color QCD.
