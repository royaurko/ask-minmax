Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are powerful computational tools for
analysis of complex statistical problems. However, their computational
efficiency is highly dependent on the chosen proposal distribution, which is
generally difficult to find. One way to solve this problem is to use adaptive
MCMC algorithms which automatically tune the statistics of a proposal
distribution during the MCMC run. A new adaptive MCMC algorithm, called the
variational Bayesian adaptive Metropolis (VBAM) algorithm, is developed. The
VBAM algorithm updates the proposal covariance matrix using the variational
Bayesian adaptive Kalman filter (VB-AKF). A strong law of large numbers for the
VBAM algorithm is proven. The empirical convergence results for three simulated
examples and for two real data examples are also provided.
