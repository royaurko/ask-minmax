We demonstrate that a relativistic constituent quark model can give nucleon
form factors that agree well with recent, accurate measurements. The
relativistic features of the model and the specific form of the wave function
are essential for the result. (Talk given at 14th International Conference on
Few-Body Problems in Physics, Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, May 26-31, 1994)
