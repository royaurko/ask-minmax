Given a generic rigid realisation of a graph in $\real^2$, it is an open
problem to determine the maximum number of pairwise non-congruent realisations
which have the same edge lengths as the given realisation. This problem can be
restated as finding the number of solutions of a related system of quadratic
equations and in this context it is natural to consider the number of solutions
in $\complex^2$. We show that the number of complex solutions, $c(G)$, is the
same for all generic realisations of a rigid graph $G$, characterise the graphs
$G$ for which $c(G)=1$, and show that the problem of determining $c(G)$ can be
reduced to the case when $G$ is 3-connected and has no non-trival 3-edge-cuts.
We also consider the effect of the the so called Henneberg moves on $c(G)$ and
determine $c(G)$ exactly for two important families of graphs.
