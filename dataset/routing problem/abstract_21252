In this paper we study the problem of conformally deforming a metric to a
prescribed symmetric function of the eigenvalues of the Schouten tensor on
compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary. We prove its solvability and the
compactness of the solution set, provided the Ricci tensor is non-negative
definite.
