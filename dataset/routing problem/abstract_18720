Anarchic warped extra dimensional models provide a solution to the hierarchy
problem. They can also account for the observed flavor hierarchies, but only at
the expense of little hierarchy and CP problems, which naturally require a
Kaluza-Klein (KK) scale beyond the LHC reach. We have recently shown that when
flavor issues are decoupled, and assumed to be solved by UV physics, the
framework's parameter space greatly opens. Given the possibility of a lower KK
scale and composite light quarks, this class of flavor triviality models enjoys
a rather exceptional phenomenology, which is the focus of this letter. We also
revisit the anarchic RS EDM problem, which requires m_{KK} > 8 TeV, and show
that it is solved within flavor triviality models. Interestingly, our framework
can induce a sizable differential t \bar{t} forward-backward asymmetry, and
leads to an excess of massive boosted di-jet events, which may be linked to the
recent findings of the CDF collaboration. This feature may be observed by
looking at the corresponding planar flow distribution, which is presented here.
Finally we point out that the celebrated standard model preference towards a
light Higgs is significantly reduced within our framework.
