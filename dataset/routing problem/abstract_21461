Self-adjoint rank two commuting ordinary differential operators are studied
in this paper. Such operators with trigonometric, elliptic and rapid decay
coefficients corresponding to hyperelliptic spectral curves are constructed.
Some problems related to the Lame operator and rank two solutions of soliton
equations are discussed.
