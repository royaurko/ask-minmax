It is shown that the problem of derandomizing Noether's Normalization Lemma
(NNL) for any explicit variety can be brought down from EXPSPACE, where it is
currently, to P assuming a strengthened form of the black-box derandomization
hypothesis (BDH) for polynomial identity testing (PIT), and to quasi-P assuming
that some exponential-time-computable multilinear polynomial cannot be
approximated infinitesimally closely by arithmetic circuits of sub-exponential
size. The converse also holds for a strict form of NNL. This equivalence
between the strengthened BDH for PIT and the problem of derandomizing NNL in a
strict form reveals that the fundamental problems of Geometry and Complexity
Theory share a common root difficulty, namely, the problem of overcoming the
EXPSPACE vs. P gap in the complexity of NNL for explicit varieties. This gap is
called the GCT chasm.
  On the positive side, it is shown that NNL for the ring of invariants for any
finite dimensional representation of the special linear group of fixed
dimension can be brought down from EXPSPACE to quasi-P unconditionally in
characteristic zero.
  On the positive side, it has also been shown recently by Forbes and Shpilka
that a variant of a conditional derandomization result in this article in
conjunction with the quasi-derandomization of ROABP that was known earlier
implies unconditional quasi-derandomization of NNL for the ring of matrix
invariants in characteristic zero.
