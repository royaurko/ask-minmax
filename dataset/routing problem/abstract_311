We prove existence and uniqueness of stochastic equilibria in a class of
incomplete continuous-time financial environments where the market participants
are exponential utility maximizers with heterogeneous risk-aversion
coefficients and general Markovian random endowments. The incompleteness
featured in our setting - the source of which can be thought of as a credit
event or a catastrophe - is genuine in the sense that not only the prices, but
also the family of replicable claims itself is determined as a part of the
equilibrium. Consequently, equilibrium allocations are not necessarily Pareto
optimal and the related representative-agent techniques cannot be used.
Instead, we follow a novel route based on new stability results for a class of
semilinear partial differential equations related to the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for the agents' utility-maximization problems.
This approach leads to a reformulation of the problem where the Banach fixed
point theorem can be used not only to show existence and uniqueness, but also
to provide a simple and efficient numerical procedure for its computation.
