We investigate a model for traffic flow based on the
Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model that consists of a hyperbolic conservation law
with a discontinuous, piecewise-linear flux. A mollifier is used to smooth out
the discontinuity in the flux function over a small distance epsilon << 1 and
then the analytical solution to the corresponding Riemann problem is derived in
the limit as epsilon goes to 0. For certain initial data, the Riemann problem
can give rise to zero waves that propagate with infinite speed but have zero
strength. We propose a Godunov-type numerical scheme that avoids the otherwise
severely restrictive CFL constraint that would arise from waves with infinite
speed by exchanging information between local Riemann problems and thereby
incorporating the effects of zero waves directly into the Riemann solver.
Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the behaviour of zero waves
and their impact on the solution. The effectiveness of our approach is
demonstrated through a careful convergence study and comparisons to
computations using a third-order WENO scheme.
