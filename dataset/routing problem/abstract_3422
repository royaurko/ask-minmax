We design approximate weakly group strategy-proof mechanisms for resource
reallocation problems using Milgrom and Segal's deferred acceptance auction
framework: the radio spectrum and network bandwidth reallocation problems in
the procurement auction setting and the cost minimization problem with set
cover constraints in the selling auction setting. Our deferred acceptance
auctions are derived from simple greedy algorithms for the underlying
optimization problems and guarantee approximately optimal social welfare (cost)
of the agents retaining their rights (contracts). In the reallocation problems,
we design procurement auctions to purchase agents' broadcast/access rights to
free up some of the resources such that the unpurchased rights can still be
exercised with respect to the remaining resources. In the cost minimization
problem, we design a selling auction to sell early termination rights to agents
with existing contracts such that some minimal constraints are still satisfied
with remaining contracts. In these problems, while the "allocated" agents
transact, exchanging rights and payments, the objective and feasibility
constraints are on the "rejected" agents.
