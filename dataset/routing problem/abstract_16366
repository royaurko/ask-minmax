Sequential prediction problems such as imitation learning, where future
observations depend on previous predictions (actions), violate the common
i.i.d. assumptions made in statistical learning. This leads to poor performance
in theory and often in practice. Some recent approaches provide stronger
guarantees in this setting, but remain somewhat unsatisfactory as they train
either non-stationary or stochastic policies and require a large number of
iterations. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm, which trains a
stationary deterministic policy, that can be seen as a no regret algorithm in
an online learning setting. We show that any such no regret algorithm, combined
with additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performance
under the distribution of observations it induces in such sequential settings.
We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms previous approaches on two
challenging imitation learning problems and a benchmark sequence labeling
problem.
