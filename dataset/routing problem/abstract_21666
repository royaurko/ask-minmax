For zero-balanced Gaussian hypergeometric functions $ F(a,b;a+b;x),$ $a,b>0,$
we determine maximal regions of $ab$ plane where well-known Landen identities
for the complete elliptic integral of the first kind turn on respective
inequalities valid for each $x\in (0,1)$. Thereby an exhausting answer is given
to an open problem.
