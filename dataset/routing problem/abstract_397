We take the Bose-Hubbard model to illustrate exact diagonalization techniques
in a pedagogical way. We follow the road of first generating all the basis
vectors, then setting up the Hamiltonian matrix with respect to this basis, and
finally using the Lanczos algorithm to solve low lying eigenstates and
eigenvalues. Emphasis is placed on how to enumerate all the basis vectors and
how to use the hashing trick to set up the Hamiltonian matrix or matrices
corresponding to other quantities. Although our route is not necessarily the
most efficient one in practice, the techniques and ideas introduced are quite
general and may find use in many other problems.
