The multiplicative conservation of both lepton and baryon numbers, i.e. (-)^L
and (-)^{3B}, is connected to an axionic solution of the strong CP problem in a
supersymmetric, unifiable model of quark and lepton interactions. New particles
are predicted at the TeV scale, with verifiable consequences at the Large
Hadron Collider.
