Cosmological data suggest that we live in an interesting period in the
history of the universe when \rho_\Lambda \sim \rho_M \sim \rho_R. The
occurence of any epoch with such a "triple coincidence" is puzzling, while the
question of why we happen to live during this special epoch is the "Why now?"
problem. We introduce a framework which makes the triple coincidence
inevitable; furthermore, the ``Why now?'' problem is transformed and greatly
ameliorated. The framework assumes that the only relevant mass scales are the
electroweak scale, M_{EW}, and the Planck scale, M_{Pl}, and requires
\rho_\Lambda^{1/4} \sim M_{EW}^2/M_{Pl} parametrically. Assuming that the true
vacuum energy vanishes, we present a simple model where a false vacuum energy
yields a cosmological constant of this form.
