We present a new technique for fast computation of the route that maximizes
the probability of on-time arrival in stochastic networks, also known as the
path-based stochastic on-time arrival (SOTA) problem. We utilize the solution
to the policy-based SOTA problem, which is of pseudopolynomial time complexity
in the time budget of the journey, as a heuristic for efficiently computing the
optimal path. We also introduce Arc-Potentials, an extension to the Arc-Flags
pre-processing algorithm, which improves the efficiency of the graph
pre-processing and reduces the computation time. Finally, we present extensive
numerical results demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithm and observe
that its running time when given the policy (which can be efficiently obtained
using pre-processing) is almost always linear in the length of the optimal path
for our test networks.
