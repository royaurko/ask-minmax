We give a survey of contributor's results on the inverse hyperbolic problems with
time-dependent and time-independent coefficients. We consider the case of
hyperbolic equations with Yang-Mills potentials and the case of domains with
obstacles. In particular, we gave a stability estimate for the broken X-ray
transform in the case of one convex obstacle in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
