Given the $n\times n$ matrix polynomial $P(x)=\sum_{i=0}^kP_i x^i$, we
consider the associated polynomial eigenvalue problem. This problem, viewed in
terms of computing the roots of the scalar polynomial $\det P(x)$, is treated
in polynomial form rather than in matrix form by means of the Ehrlich-Aberth
iteration. The main computational issues are discussed, namely, the choice of
the starting approximations needed to start the Ehrlich-Aberth iteration, the
computation of the Newton correction, the halting criterion, and the treatment
of eigenvalues at infinity. We arrive at an effective implementation which
provides more accurate approximations to the eigenvalues with respect to the
methods based on the QZ algorithm. The case of polynomials having special
structures, like palindromic, Hamiltonian, symplectic, etc., where the
eigenvalues have special symmetries in the complex plane, is considered. A
general way to adapt the Ehrlich-Aberth iteration to structured matrix
polynomial is introduced. Numerical experiments which confirm the effectiveness
of this approach are reported.
