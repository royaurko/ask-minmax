A class of diamond networks are studied where the broadcast component is
modelled by two independent bit-pipes. New upper and low bounds are derived on
the capacity which improve previous bounds. The upper bound is in the form of a
max-min problem, where the maximization is over a coding distribution and the
minimization is over an auxiliary channel. The proof technique generalizes
bounding techniques of Ozarow for the Gaussian multiple description problem
(1981), and Kang and Liu for the Gaussian diamond network (2011). The bounds
are evaluated for a Gaussian multiple access channel (MAC) and the binary adder
MAC, and the capacity is found for interesting ranges of the bit-pipe
capacities.
