The gamma -> 3 pi form factor was calculated in a simple-minded constituent
model with a constant quark mass parameter, as well as in the Schwinger-Dyson
approach. The comparison of these and various other theoretical results on this
anomalous process, as well as the scarce already available data (hopefully to
be supplemented by more accurate CEBAF data), seem to favor Schwinger-Dyson
modeling which would yield relatively small low-momentum values of the
constituent (dynamically dressed) quark mass function.
