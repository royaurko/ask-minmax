We construct noncomplete orthogonal systems on the ray $[0,\infty)$ that look
like Jacobi polynomials $P_n(x)$ after a shift of degree $n\mapsto n+a$, where
$a$ is a real constant. These systems are solutions of some exotic
Sturm-Liouville problem for hypergeometric differential operators.
  We obtain the explicit spectral decomposition for these problems.
