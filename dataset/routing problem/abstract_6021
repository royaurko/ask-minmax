We address the problem of determining if a discrete time switched consensus
system converges for any switching sequence and that of determining if it
converges for at least one switching sequence. For these two problems, we
provide necessary and sufficient conditions that can be checked in singly
exponential time. As a side result, we prove the existence of a polynomial time
algorithm for the first problem when the system switches between only two
subsystems whose corresponding graphs are undirected, a problem that had been
suggested to be NP-hard by Blondel and Olshevsky.
