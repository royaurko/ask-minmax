A derivation of the Dirac equation in `3+1' dimensions is presented based on
a master equation approach originally developed for the `1+1' problem by McKeon
and Ord. The method of derivation presented here suggests a mechanism by which
the work of Knuth and Bahrenyi on causal sets may be extended to a derivation
of the Dirac equation in the context of an inference problem.
