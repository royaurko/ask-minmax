We explore how inherent flexibility of a protein molecule influences the
mechanism controlling the kinetics of allosteric transitions using a
variational model inspired from work in protein folding. The striking
differences in the predicted transition mechanism for the opening of the two
domains of calmodulin (CaM) emphasizes that inherent flexibility is key to
understanding the complex conformational changes that occur in proteins. In
particular, the C-terminal domain of CaM (cCaM) which is inherently less
flexible than its N-terminal domain (nCaM) reveals "cracking" or local partial
unfolding during the open/closed transition. This result is in harmony with the
picture that cracking relieves local stresses due to conformational
deformations of a sufficiently rigid protein. We also compare the
conformational transition in a recently studied "even-odd" paired fragment of
CaM. Our results rationalize the different relative binding affinities of the
EF-hands in the engineered fragment compared to the intact "odd-even" paired
EF-hands (nCaM and cCaM) in terms of changes in flexibility along the
transition route. Aside from elucidating general theoretical ideas about the
cracking mechanism, these studies also emphasize how the remarkable intrinsic
plasticity of CaM underlies conformational dynamics essential for its diverse
functions.
