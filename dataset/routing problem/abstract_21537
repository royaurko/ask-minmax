In this paper we obtain a noncommutative multivariable analogue of the
classical Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem for analytic functions with
positive real parts on the open unit disc. As consequences, we deduce some
results concerning operator-valued analytic interpolation on the unit ball on
C^n.
