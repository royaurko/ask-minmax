Maximizing network lifetime is a very challenging issue in routing protocol
design for Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs), since mobile nodes are powered by
limited-capacity batteries. Furthermore, replacing or recharging batteries is
often impossible in critical environments (e.g. battlefields, disaster areas,
etc.). Energy consumption was considered for a long time equivalent to
bandwidth consumption. However, recent works have shown that "energy" and
"bandwidth" are substantially different metrics. Moreover, it was found that
traditional routing policies such as "the shortest path" one can have a
negative impact on energy consumption balance. Therefore, several new
approaches have been proposed addressing energy efficiency explicitly. Our work
is related to energy efficient routing for MANETs' problem. The proposed
MEA-DSR (Multipath Energy-Aware on Demand Source Routing) protocol is based on
a load sharing strategy between mobile nodes in order to maximize network
lifetime. To achieve this goal, we used multipath routing; nodes' residual
energies and paths length were also considered when making routing decisions.
Simulation results have shown the efficiency of the proposed protocol under
difficult scenarios characterised by high mobility, high density and important
traffic load.
