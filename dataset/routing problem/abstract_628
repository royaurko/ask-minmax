EGP and IGP are the key components of the present internet infrastructure.
Routers in a domain forward IP packet within and between domains. Each domain
uses an intra-domain routing protocol known as Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
like IS-IS, OSPF, RIP etc to populate the routing tables of its routers.
Routing information must also be exchanged between domains to ensure that a
host in one domain can reach another host in remote domain. This role is
performed by inter-domain routing protocol called Exterior Gateway Protocol
(EGP). Basically EGP used these days is Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Basic
difference between the both is that BGP has smaller convergence as compared to
the IGP's. And IGP's on the other hand have lesser scalability as compared to
the BGP. So in this paper a proposal to create a new protocol is given which
can act as an IGP when we consider inter-domain transfer of traffic and acts as
BGP when we consider intra-domain transfer of traffic.
