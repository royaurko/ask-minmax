The localization technique from convex geometry is generalized to the setting
of Riemannian manifolds whose Ricci curvature is bounded from below. In a
nutshell, our method is based on the following observation: When the Ricci
curvature is non-negative, log-concave measures are obtained when conditioning
the Riemannian volume measure with respect to an integrable geodesic foliation.
The Monge mass transfer problem plays an important role in our analysis.
