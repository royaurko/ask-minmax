There are at least two serious moduli problems in string cosmology. The first
is the possibility that moduli dominate the energy density at the time of
nucleosynthesis. The second is that they may not find their minima all
together. After reviewing some previously proposed solutions to these problems,
we propose another: all of the moduli but the dilaton sit at points of enhanced
symmetry. The dilaton has a potential similar to those of racetrack models; it
is very massive and its dynamics do not break supersymmetry. The dilaton is
able to find the minimum of its potential because the energy is dominated by
non-zero momentum modes. This energy need not be thermal. The effective
potential for the dilaton is quite different from its flat space form. If
certain conditions are satisfied, the dilaton settles into the desired minimum;
if not, it is forced to weak coupling.
