This paper presents the Nataf-Beta Random Field Classifier, a discriminative
approach that extends the applicability of the Beta conjugate prior to
classification problems. The approach's key feature is to model the probability
of a class conditional on attribute values as a random field whose marginals
are Beta distributed, and where the parameters of marginals are themselves
described by random fields. Although the classification accuracy of the
approach proposed does not statistically outperform the best accuracies
reported in the literature, it ranks among the top tier for the six benchmark
datasets tested. The Nataf-Beta Random Field Classifier is suited as a general
purpose classification approach for real-continuous and real-integer attribute
value problems.
