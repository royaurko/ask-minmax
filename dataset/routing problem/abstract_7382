We start from various shortcomings, errors and dilemmas which arise in
applications of probability. We argue that, together with similar issues in
mechanics, they constitute the core of Hilbert's VI problem. In the paper we
indicate a solution to these problems. This leads to a reformulation of the
axioms of probability and, in the finite case, to algebrization of probability
theory.
  The overall outcome is that while so far in most mathematical theories the
focus is on unburdening general existence results, a shift is needed towards
abstract discriminating existential conditions.
