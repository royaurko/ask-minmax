It has previously been proven that finding the globally minimum energy
configuration of an atomic cluster belongs in the class of NP-hard problems.
However, this proof is limited only to homonuclear clusters. This paper
presents a new proof which shows finding minimum energy configurations for
heteronuclear clusters is also NP-hard.
