A systematic semiclassical expansion of the hydrogen problem about the
classical Kepler problem is shown to yield remarkably accurate results. Ad hoc
changes of the centrifugal term, such as the standard Langer modification where
the factor l(l+1) is replaced by (l+1/2)^2, are avoided. The semiclassical
energy levels are shown to be exact to first order in $\hbar$ with all higher
order contributions vanishing. The wave functions and dipole matrix elements
are also discussed.
