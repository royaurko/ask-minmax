We consider stochastic differential equations in a Hilbert space, perturbed
by the gradient of a convex potential. We investigate the problem of
convergence of a sequence of such processes. We propose applications of this
method to reflecting O.U. processes in infinite dimension, to stochastic
partial differential equations with reflection of Cahn-Hilliard type and to
interface models.
