The spectral properties of a class of band matrices are investigated. The
reconstruction of matrices of this special class from given spectral data is
also studied. Necessary and sufficient conditions for that reconstruction are
found. The obtained results extend some results on the direct and inverse
spectral problems for periodic Jacobi matrices and for some non-self-adjoint
tridiagonal matrices.
