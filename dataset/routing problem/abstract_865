A new paradigm to support the communication among modules dynamically placed
on a reconfigurable device at run-time is presented. Based on the network on
chip (NoC) infrastructure, we developed a dynamic communication infrastructure
as well as routing methodologies capable to handle routing in a NoC with
obstacles created by dynamically placed components. We prove the unrestricted
reachability of components and pins, the deadlock-freeness and we finally show
the feasibility of our approach by means on real life example applications.
