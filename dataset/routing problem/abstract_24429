We prove a result that finishes the study of primitive arithmetic
progressions consisting of squares and fifth powers that was carried out by
Hajdu and Tengely in a recent paper: The only arithmetic progression in coprime
integers of the form (a^2, b^2, c^2, d^5) is (1, 1, 1, 1).
  For the proof, we first reduce the problem to that of determining the sets of
rational points on three specific hyperelliptic curves of genus 4. A 2-cover
descent computation shows that there are no rational points on two of these
curves. We find generators for a subgroup of finite index of the Mordell-Weil
group of the last curve. Applying Chabauty's method, we prove that the only
rational points on this curve are the obvious ones.
