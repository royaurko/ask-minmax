It is shown that polar coding schemes achieve the known achievable rate
regions for several multi-terminal communications problems including lossy
distributed source coding, multiple access channels and multiple descriptions
coding. The results are valid for arbitrary alphabet sizes (binary or
nonbinary) and arbitrary distributions (symmetric or asymmetric).
