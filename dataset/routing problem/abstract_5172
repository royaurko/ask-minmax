In this paper we study the $L^p$ boundary value problems for
$\mathcal{L}(u)=0$ in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}_+$, where
$\mathcal{L}=-\text{div}(A\nabla)$ is a second order elliptic operator with
real and symmetric coefficients. Assume that $A$ is {\it periodic} in $x_{d+1}$
and satisfies some minimal smoothness condition in the $x_{d+1}$ variable, we
show that the $L^p$ Neumann and regularity problems are uniquely solvable for
$1<p<2+\delta$. We also present a new proof of Dahlberg's theorem on the $L^p$
Dirichlet problem for $2-\delta<p< \infty$ (Dahlberg's original unpublished
proof is given in the Appendix). As the periodic and smoothness conditions are
imposed only on the $x_{d+1}$ variable, these results extend directly from
$\mathbb{R}^{d+1}_+$ to regions above Lipschitz graphs. Consequently, by
localization techniques, we obtain uniform $L^p$ estimates for the Dirichlet,
Neumann and regularity problems on bounded Lipschitz domains for a family of
second order elliptic operators arising in the theory of homogenization. The
results on the Neumann and regularity problems are new even for smooth domains.
