This article presents a geometric approach to some similarity problems
involving metric arguments in the non-positively curved space of positive
invertible operators of an operator algebra and the canonical isometric action
by invertible elements on the cone given by $g\cdot a=gag^*$. Through this
approach, we extend and put into a geometric framework results by G. Pisier and
partially answer a question by Andruchow, Corach and Stojanoff about minimality
properties of canonical unitarizers.
