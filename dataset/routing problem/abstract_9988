The convergence of an adaptive mixed finite element method for general second
order linear elliptic problems defined on simply connected bounded polygonal
domains is analyzed in this paper. The main difficulties in the analysis are
posed by the non-symmetric and indefinite form of the problem along with the
lack of the orthogonality property in mixed finite element methods. The
important tools in the analysis are a posteriori error estimators,
quasi-orthogonality property and quasi-discrete reliability established using
representation formula for the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas solution in terms of
the Crouzeix-Raviart solution of the problem. An adaptive marking in each step
for the local refinement is based on the edge residual and volume residual
terms of the a posteriori estimator. Numerical experiments confirm the
theoretical analysis.
