We analyze the convergence behaviour of a recently proposed algorithm for
regularized estimation called Dual Augmented Lagrangian (DAL). Our analysis is
based on a new interpretation of DAL as a proximal minimization algorithm. We
theoretically show under some conditions that DAL converges super-linearly in a
non-asymptotic and global sense. Due to a special modelling of sparse
estimation problems in the context of machine learning, the assumptions we make
are milder and more natural than those made in conventional analysis of
augmented Lagrangian algorithms. In addition, the new interpretation enables us
to generalize DAL to wide varieties of sparse estimation problems. We
experimentally confirm our analysis in a large scale $\ell_1$-regularized
logistic regression problem and extensively compare the efficiency of DAL
algorithm to previously proposed algorithms on both synthetic and benchmark
datasets.
