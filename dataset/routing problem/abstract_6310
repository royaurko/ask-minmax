An overview of the classical Rankin-Selberg problem involving the asymptotic
formula for sums of coefficients of holomorphic cusp forms is given. We also
study the function $\Delta(x;\xi) (0\le\xi\le1)$, the error term in the
Rankin-Selberg problem weighted by $\xi$-th power of the logarithm. Mean square
estimates for $\Delta(x;\xi)$ are proved.
