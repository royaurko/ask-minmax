In this paper, we studied quasi-periodic and almost periodic homogenizations
of integro-differential equations with Levy operators, which contain alpha
stable Levy densities. This is the intermediate stage between the periodic
homogenization and the stochastic homogenization of the non-local problem, and
is the straight forward generalization of the case of partial differential
equations.
