We derive the BBGKY hierarchy for the Fermi and Bose many-particle systems,
using the von Neumann hierarchy for the correlation operators. The solution of
the Cauchy problem of the formulated hierarchy for the case of a n-body
interaction potential is constructed in the space of sequences of trace-class
operators.
