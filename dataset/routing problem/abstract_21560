We present new evaluation of the critical exponents of O(n)- symmetric \phi^4
theory from the field theoretical renormalization group, based on the new
algorithm for summing divergent series. The central values practically coincide
with those by Le Guillou and Zinn-Justin (1980) but their uncertainty is
essentially smaller.
