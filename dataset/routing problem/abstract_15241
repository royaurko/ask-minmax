Nonlinear parametric inverse problems appear in several prominent
applications; one such application is Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) in
medical image reconstruction. Such inverse problems present huge computational
challenges, mostly due to the need for solving a sequence of large-scale
discretized, parametrized, partial differential equations (PDEs) in the forward
model. In this paper, we show how interpolatory parametric model reduction can
significantly reduce the cost of the inversion process in DOT by drastically
reducing the computational cost of solving the forward problems. The key
observation is that function evaluations for the underlying optimization
problem may be viewed as transfer function evaluations along the imaginary
axis; a similar observation holds for Jacobian evaluations as well. This
motivates the use of system-theoretic model order reduction methods. We discuss
the construction and use of interpolatory parametric reduced models as
surrogates for the full forward model. Within the DOT setting, these surrogate
models can approximate both the cost functional and the associated Jacobian
with very little loss of accuracy while significantly reducing the cost of the
overall inversion process. Four numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of
the proposed approach. Although we focus on DOT in this paper, we believe that
our approach is applicable much more generally.
