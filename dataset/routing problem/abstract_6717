In an article [3] published recently in this journal, it was shown that when
k >= 3, the problem of deciding whether the distinguishing chromatic number of
a graph is at most k is NP-hard. We consider the problem when k = 2. In regards
to the issue of solvability in polynomial time, we show that the problem is at
least as hard as graph automorphism but no harder than graph isomorphism.
