Gauge problem of monopole dynamics is studied in SU(2) lattice gauge theory.
We study first abelian and monopole contributions to the static potential in
four smooth gauges, i.e., Laplacian Abelian (LA), Maximally Abelian Wilson Loop
(MAWL) and L-type gauges in comparison with Maximally Abelian (MA) gauge. They
all reproduce the string tension in good agreement with the SU(2) string
tension. MA gauge is not the only choice of the good gauge which is suitable
for the color confinement mechanism. Using an inverse Monte-Carlo method and
the blockspin transformation, we determine effective monopole actions and the
renormalization group (RG) flows of its coupling constants in various abelian
projection schemes. Every RG flow looks to converge to a unique curve which
suggests gauge independence in the infrared region.
