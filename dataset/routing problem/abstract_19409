The reconstruction of a 3D object or a scene is a classical inverse problem
in Computer Vision. In the case of a single image this is called the
Shape-from-Shading (SfS) problem and is known to be ill-posed even in a
simplified version like the vertical light source case. A huge number of works
deals with the orthographic SfS problem based on the Lambertian reflectance
model, the most common and simplest model which leads to an eikonal type
equation when the light source is on the vertical axis. In this paper we want
to overcome this model dealing with non-Lambertian models, more realistic and
suitable whenever one has to deal with different kind of surfaces, rough or
specular. We will present a unique mathematical formulation for these models,
considering oblique light directions. These models lead to more complex
nonlinear partial differential equations of Hamilton-Jacobi type which we are
able to describe in a unified framework. The construction of approximate (weak)
solutions are obtained via semi-Lagrangian schemes for the corresponding
stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Numerical simulations on synthetic and
real images will illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.
