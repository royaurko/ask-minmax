The last few decades, a great deal of attention has been paid to low-voltage
(LV) low-power (LP) integrated circuits design since the power consumption has
become a critical issue. Among many techniques used for the design of LV LP
analog circuits, the Bulk-driven principle offers a promising route towards
this design for many aspects mainly the simplicity and using the conventional
MOS technology to implement these designs. This paper is devoted to the
Bulk-driven (BD) principle and utilizing this principle to design LV LP
building block of Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) in standard CMOS
processes and supply voltage 0.9V. The simulation results have been carried out
by the Spice simulator using the 130nm CMOS technology from TSMC.
