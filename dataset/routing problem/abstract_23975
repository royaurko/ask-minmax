Explosive nuclear burning in astrophysical environments produces unstable
nuclei which again can be targets for subsequent reactions. In addition, it
involves a large number of stable nuclides which are not fully explored by
experiments, yet. Thus, it is necessary to be able to predict reaction cross
sections and thermonuclear rates with the aid of theoretical models. Such
predictions are also of interest for investigations at radioactive ion beam
facilities. An extended library of theoretical cross sections and reaction
rates is presented. The problem of alpha+nucleus potentials is addressed and
new parametrizations presented. The problem of properly predicting cross
sections at low level densities is illustrated by the 62Ni(n,gamma) reaction.
