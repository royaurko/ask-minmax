Though accepted that "team science" is needed to tackle and conquer the
health problems that are plaguing our society significant empirical evidence of
team mechanisms and functional dynamics is still lacking in abundance. Through
grounded methods the relationship between scientific disciplines and team roles
was observed in a United States National Institutes of Health-funded (NIH)
research consortium. Interviews and the Organizational Culture Assessment
Instrument (OCAI) were employed.. Findings show strong role and discipline
idiosyncrasies that when viewed separately provide different insights into team
functioning and change receptivity. When considered simultaneously,
value-latent characteristics emerged showing self-perceived contributions to
the team. This micro/meso analysis suggests that individual participation in
team level interactions can inform the structuration of roles and disciplines
in an attempt to tackle macro level problems.
