The purpose of this paper is to point to the usefulness of applying a linear
mathematical formulation of fuzzy multiple criteria objective decision methods
in organising business activities. In this respect fuzzy parameters of linear
programming are modelled by preference-based membership functions. This paper
begins with an introduction and some related research followed by some
fundamentals of fuzzy set theory and technical concepts of fuzzy multiple
objective decision models. Further a real case study of a manufacturing plant
and the implementation of the proposed technique is presented. Empirical
results clearly show the superiority of the fuzzy technique in optimising
individual objective functions when compared to non-fuzzy approach.
Furthermore, for the problem considered, the optimal solution helps to infer
that by incorporating fuzziness in a linear programming model either in
constraints, or both in objective functions and constraints, provides a similar
(or even better) level of satisfaction for obtained results compared to
non-fuzzy linear programming.
