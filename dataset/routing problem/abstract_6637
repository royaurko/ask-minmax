In this paper we study the Fuchsian Riemann-Hilbert (inverse monodromy)
problem corresponding to Frobenius structures on Hurwitz spaces. We find a
solution to this Riemann-Hilbert problem in terms of integrals of certain
meromorphic differentials over a basis of an appropriate relative homology
space, study the corresponding monodromy group and compute the monodromy
matrices explicitly for various special cases.
