We study the Cauchy problem for a scalar semilinear degenerate parabolic
partial differential equation with stochastic forcing. In particular, we are
concerned with the well-posedness in any space dimension. We adapt the notion
of kinetic solution which is well suited for degenerate parabolic problems and
supplies a good technical framework to prove the comparison principle. The
proof of existence is based on the vanishing viscosity method: the solution is
obtained by a compactness argument as the limit of solutions of nondegenerate
approximations.
