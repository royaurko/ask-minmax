The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) limits the growth of the
Default-Free Zone routing tables by creating a highly aggregatable and
quasi-static Internet core. However, LISP pushes the forwarding state to edge
routers whose timely operation relies on caching of location to identity
bindings. In this paper we develop an analytical model to study the asymptotic
scalability of the LISP cache. Under the assumptions that (i) long-term
popularity can be modeled as a constant Generalized Zipf distribution and (ii)
temporal locality is predominantly determined by long-term popularity, we find
that the scalability of the LISP cache is O(1) with respect to the amount of
prefixes (Internet growth) and users (growth of the LISP site). We validate the
model and discuss the accuracy of our assumptions using several one-day-long
packet traces.
