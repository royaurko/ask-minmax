This paper studies the H2 (Kalman) filtering problem in the situation where a
signal estimate must be constructed based on inputs from individual
participants, whose data must remain private. This problem arises in emerging
applications such as smart grids or intelligent transportation systems, where
users continuously send data to third-party aggregators performing global
monitoring or control tasks, and require guarantees that this data cannot be
used to infer additional personal information. To provide strong formal privacy
guarantees against adversaries with arbitrary side information, we rely on the
notion of differential privacy introduced relatively recently in the database
literature. This notion is extended to dynamic systems with many participants
contributing independent input signals, and mechanisms are then proposed to
solve the H2 filtering problem with a differential privacy constraint. A method
for mitigating the impact of the privacy-inducing mechanism on the estimation
performance is described, which relies on controlling the Hinfinity norm of the
filter. Finally, we discuss an application to a privacy-preserving traffic
monitoring system.
