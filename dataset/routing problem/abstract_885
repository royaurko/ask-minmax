We study oscillation death (OD) in a well-known coupled-oscillator system
that has been used to model cardiovascular phenomena. We derive exact analytic
conditions that allow the prediction of OD through the two known bifurcation
routes, in the same model, and for different numbers of coupled oscillators.
Our exact analytic results enable us to generalize OD as a
multiparameter-sensitive phenomenon. It can be induced, not only by changes in
couplings, but also by changes in the oscillator frequencies or amplitudes. We
observe synchronization transitions as a function of coupling and confirm the
robustness of the phenomena in the presence of noise. Numerical and analogue
simulations are in good agreement with the theory.
