The null-timelike initial-boundary value problem for a hyperbolic system of
equations consists of the evolution of data given on an initial characteristic
surface and on a timelike worldtube to produce a solution in the exterior of
the worldtube. We establish the well-posedness of this problem for the
evolution of a quasilinear scalar wave by means of energy estimates. The
treatment is given in characteristic coordinates and thus provides a guide for
developing stable finite difference algorithms. A new technique underlying the
approach has potential application to other characteristic initial-boundary
value problems.
