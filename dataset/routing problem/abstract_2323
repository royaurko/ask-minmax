The degradation of liquid dispersed titanium (IV) sulphide (TiS$_2$) is
studied from the point of view of oxidisation. TiS$_2$ is a layered
two-dimensional nanomaterial, with potential for energy storage applications.
However, flakes in dispersion were observed to degrade. We examined two
oxidisation routes: deionised water at room temperature and oxygen gas within
the temperature range 150-350{\deg}C. Water was seen to slowly oxidise flakes
inwards from the edge, forming an amorphous oxide, a result comparable to the
state of flakes which degraded within the original dispersion. Oxygen gas was
seen to rapidly oxidise entire flakes to a polycrystalline oxide, when heated
275 {\deg}C and above. Degradation was studied with scanning transmission
electron microscopy (STEM), energy dispersed x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and
electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). Density Functional Theory
calculations have shown oxidisation by both water and gas molecules to be
thermodynamically favourable.
