This is the talk given at ``Gribov-75 Memorial Workshop on Quarks, Hadrons,
and Strong Interactions", May 22-24, 2005, Budapest. Hungary. In this talk we
discuss the BFKL Pomeron Calculus and its interrelation with thecolour dipole
approach. The two key problems we consider are the probabilistic interpretation
of the BFKL Pomeron Calculus and the possiblescenario for the asymptotic
behaviour of the scattering amplitude at high energyin QCD.
