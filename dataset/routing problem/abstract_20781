We show that quasi-minimizers of non-homogeneous energy functionals on metric
measure spaces are locally H\"older continuous and satisfy the Harnack
inequality. We assume that the spaces are doubling and support a Poincar\'e
inequality. The proof is based on the De Giorgi method, combined with the
"expansion of positivity" technique.
