The resonance states of one- and two-particle Hamiltonians are studied using
variational expansions with real basis-set functions. The resonance energies,
$E_r$, and widths, $\Gamma$, are calculated using the density of states and an
${\mathcal L}^2$ golden rule-like formula. We present a recipe to select
adequately some solutions of the variational problem. The set of approximate
energies obtained shows a very regular behaviour with the basis-set size, $N$.
Indeed, these particular variational eigenvalues show a quite simple scaling
behaviour and convergence when $N\rightarrow \infty$. Following the same
prescription to choose particular solutions of the variational problem we
obtain a set of approximate widths. Using the scaling function that
characterizes the behaviour of the approximate energies as a guide, it is
possible to find a very good approximation to the actual value of the resonance
width.
