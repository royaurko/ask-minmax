It is well known that if $G$ admits a f.g. subgroup $H$ with a
weaklyaperiodic SFT (resp. an undecidable domino problem), then $G$itself has a
weakly aperiodic SFT (resp. an undecidable domino problem).We prove that we can
replace the property "$H$ is a subgroup of $G$"by "$H$ acts translation-like on
$G$", provided $H$ is finitely presented.In particular:* If $G\_1$ and $G\_2$
are f.g. infinite groups, then $G\_1 \times G\_2$ has a weakly aperiodic SFT
(and actually a undecidable domino problem). In particular the Grigorchuk group
has an undecidable domino problem. * Every infinite f.g. $p$-group admits a
weakly aperiodic SFT.
