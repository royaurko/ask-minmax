We consider the parameterised complexity of several list problems on graphs,
with parameter treewidth or pathwidth. In particular, we show that List Edge
Chromatic Number and List Total Chromatic Number are fixed parameter tractable,
parameterised by treewidth, whereas List Hamilton Path is W[1]-hard, even
parameterised by pathwidth. These results resolve two open questions of
Fellows, Fomin, Lokshtanov, Rosamond, Saurabh, Szeider and Thomassen (2011).
