Given an $n\times n\times p$ cost array $C$ we consider the problem $p$-P3AP
which consists in finding $p$ pairwise disjoint permutations
$\varphi_1,\varphi_2,\ldots,\varphi_p$ of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that
$\sum_{k=1}^{p}\sum_{i=1}^nc_{i\varphi_k(i)k}$ is minimized. For the case $p=n$
the planar 3-dimensional assignment problem P3AP results.
  Our main result concerns the $p$-P3AP on cost arrays $C$ that are layered
Monge arrays. In a layered Monge array all $n\times n$ matrices that result
from fixing the third index $k$ are Monge matrices. We prove that the $p$-P3AP
and the P3AP remain NP-hard for layered Monge arrays. Furthermore, we show that
in the layered Monge case there always exists an optimal solution of the
$p$-3PAP which can be represented as matrix with bandwidth $\le 4p-3$. This
structural result allows us to provide a dynamic programming algorithm that
solves the $p$-P3AP in polynomial time on layered Monge arrays when $p$ is
fixed.
