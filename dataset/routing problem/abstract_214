In this paper, the contributor explore the challenges with respect to the security
aspect in MANETs and propose a new approach which makes use of a bio-inspired
methodology. This paper elaborates various attacks which can be perpetrated on
MANETs and current solutions to the aforementioned problems, and then it
describes a Bio-Inspired Method which could be a possible solution to security
issues in MANETs.
