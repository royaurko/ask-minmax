Conditions for the existence of at least three positive solutions to the
nonlinear first-order problem with a nonlinear nonlocal boundary condition
given by
  && y'(t) - p(t)y(t) = \sum_{i=1}^m f_i\big(t,y(t)\big), \quad t\in[0,1],
  && \lambda y(0) = y(1) + \sum_{j=1}^n \Phi_j(\tau_j,y(\tau_j)), \quad
\tau_j\in[0,1], are discussed, for sufficiently large $\lambda>1$. The
Leggett-Williams fixed point theorem is utilized.
