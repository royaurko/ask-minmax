We study conformal mappings from the unit disk to circular-arc quadrilaterals
with four right angles. The problem is reduced to a Sturm-Liouville boundary
value problem on a real interval, with a nonlinear boundary condition, in which
the coefficient functions contain the accessory parameters t,lambda of the
mapping problem. The parameter lambda is designed in such a way that for fixed
t, it plays the role of an eigenvalue of the Sturm-Liouville problem. Further,
for each t a particular solution (an elliptic integral) is known a priori, as
well as its corresponding spectral parameter lambda. This leads to insight into
the dependence of the image quadrilateral on the parameters, and permits
application of a recently developed spectral parameter power series (SPPS)
method for numerical solution. Rate of convergence, accuracy, and computational
complexity are presented for the resulting numerical procedure, which in
simplicity and efficiency compares favorably with previously known methods for
this type of problem.
