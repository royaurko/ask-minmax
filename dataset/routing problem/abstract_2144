The discovery of neighbouring nodes in multihop wireless networks has become
a key challenge. Due to tribulations in communication, synchronization loss
between nodes, disparity in transmission power etc, the connectivity of nodes
will always experience disruptions. On the other hand, the energy utilization
by the nodes also became critical . In this paper, we propose a new method for
neighbour discovery in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) which pays an eminent
consideration for energy utilization and QoS parameters like latency,
throughput, error rate etc. In the proposed method, the network routing is
enhanced using AOMDV protocol which can accurately discover the neighbour nodes
and power management with HMAC protocol which reduces the energy utilization
significantly. A complete analysis is being performed to estimate how the Q o S
metrics varies in various scenarios of power consumption in wireless networks.
