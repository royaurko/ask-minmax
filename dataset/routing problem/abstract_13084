We discuss two possible extensions to the standard model in which an inert
singlet scalar state that only interacts with the Higgs boson is added together
with some fermions. In one model the fermions provide for a see-saw mechanism
for the neutrino masses, in the other model for grand unification of the gauge
couplings. Masses and interaction strengths are fixed by the requirement of
controlling the finite one-loop corrections to the Higgs boson mass thus
addressing the little hierarchy problem. The inert scalar could provide a
viable dark matter candidate. Direct detection of this scalar singlet in
nuclear scattering experiments is possible with a cross section within reach of
future experiments.
