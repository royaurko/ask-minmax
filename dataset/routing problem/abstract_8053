In [M. K. Vemuri, Realizations of the canonical representation], it was shown
that the spectral synthesis problem for the Alpha transform is closely related
to the problem of classifying realizations of the canonical representation (of
the Heisenberg group). In this paper, we show that discrete sets are sets of
spectral synthesis for the Alpha transform.
