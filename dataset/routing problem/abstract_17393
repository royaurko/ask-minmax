This paper addresses the problem of evaluating a subset of the range of a
vector-valued function. It is based on a work by Gold- sztejn and Jaulin which
provides methods based on interval analysis to address this problem when the
dimension of the domain and co-domain of the function are equal. This paper
extends this result to vector-valued functions with domain and co-domain of
different dimensions. This ex- tension requires the knowledge of the rank of
the Jacobian function on the whole domain. This leads to the sub-problem of
extracting an in- terval sub-matrix of maximum rank from a given interval
matrix. Three different techniques leading to approximate solutions of this
extraction are proposed and compared.
