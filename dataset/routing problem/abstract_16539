We review several different approaches for computing Casimir forces and
related fluctuation-induced interactions between bodies of arbitrary shapes and
materials. The relationships between this problem and well known computational
techniques from classical electromagnetism are emphasized. We also review the
basic principles of standard computational methods, categorizing them according
to three criteria---choice of problem, basis, and solution technique---that can
be used to classify proposals for the Casimir problem as well. In this way,
mature classical methods can be exploited to model Casimir physics, with a few
important modifications.
