Some time ago, Sorkin (1975) reported investigations of the time evolution
and initial value problems in Regge calculus, for one triangulation each of the
manifolds $R*S^3$ and $R^4$. Here we display the simple, local characteristic
of those triangulations which underlies the structure found by Sorkin, and
emphasise its general applicability, and therefore the general validity of
Sorkin's conclusions. We also make some elementary observations on the
resulting structure of the time evolution and initial value problems in Regge
calculus, and add some comments and speculations.
