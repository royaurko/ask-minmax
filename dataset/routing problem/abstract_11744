We consider a class of Hamiltonians in $L^2(\R^2)$ with attractive
interaction supported by piecewise $C^2$ smooth loops $\Gamma$ of a fixed
length $L$, formally given by $-\Delta-\alpha\delta(x-\Gamma)$ with $\alpha>0$.
It is shown that the ground state of this operator is locally maximized by a
circular $\Gamma$. We also conjecture that this property holds globally and
show that the problem is related to an interesting family of geometric
inequalities concerning mean values of chords of $\Gamma$.
