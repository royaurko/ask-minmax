We present a numerical method to solve the optimal transport problem with a
quadratic cost when the source and target measures are periodic probability
densities. This method is based on a numerical resolution of the corresponding
Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We extend the damped Newton algorithm of Loeper and
Rapetti \cite{LR} to the more general case of a non uniform density which is
relevant to the optimal transport problem, and we show that our algorithm
converges for sufficiently large damping coefficients. The main idea consists
of designing an iterative scheme where the fully nonlinear equation is
approximated by a non-constant coefficient linear elliptic PDE that we solve
numerically. We introduce several improvements and some new techniques for the
numerical resolution of the corresponding linear system. Namely, we use a Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT) method by Strain \cite{St}, which allows to increase
the efficiency of our algorithm against the standard finite difference method.
Moreover, we use a fourth order finite difference scheme to approximate the
partial derivatives involved in the nonlinear terms of the Newton algorithm,
which are evaluated once at each iteration; this leads to a significant
improvement of the accuracy of the method, but does not sacrifice its
efficiency. Finally, we present some numerical experiments which demonstrate
the robustness and efficiency of our method on several examples of image
processing, including an application to multiple sclerosis disease detection.
