We consider the following metric clustering problem. We are given two point
sets $X$ (clients) and $Y$ (servers), and a metric on $Z = X \cup Y$. We would
like to cover the clients by balls centered at the servers. The objective
function to minimize is the sum of the $\alpha$-th power of the radii of the
balls. Here $\alpha \geq 1$ is a parameter of the problem (but not of a problem
instance).
  For any $\eps > 0$, we describe a quasi-polynomial time algorithm that
returns a $(1 + \eps)$ approximation for the problem. Prior to our work, a
$3^{\alpha}$ approximation was achieved by a polynomial-time algorithm. In
contrast, for the variant of the MCC where $\alpha$ is part of the input, we
show under standard assumptions that no polynomial time algorithm can achieve
an approximation factor better than $O(\log |X|)$ for $\alpha \geq \log |X|$.
  In order to achieve the QPTAS, we address the following problem on metric
partitioning: we want to probabilistically partition $Z$ into blocks of at most
half the diameter so that for any ball, the expected number of blocks of the
partition that intersect the ball is appropriately small. We note that this
problem can be of independent interest.
