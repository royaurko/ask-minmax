We prove concentration inequalities for general functions of weakly dependent
random variables satisfying the Dobrushin condition. In particular, we show
Talagrand's convex distance inequality for this type of dependence. We apply
our bounds to a version of the stochastic salesman problem, the Steiner tree
problem, the total magnetisation of the Curie-Weiss model with external field,
and exponential random graph models. Our proof uses the exchangeable pair
method for proving concentration inequalities introduced by Chatterjee (2005).
Another key ingredient of the proof is a subclass of $(a,b)$-self-bounding
functions, introduced by Boucheron, Lugosi and Massart (2009).
