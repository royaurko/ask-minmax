In the application of the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method to the
Riemann-Hilbert problem for orthogonal polynomials, a model Riemann-Hilbert
problem that appears in the multi-cut case is solved with the use of
hyperelliptic theta functions. We present here an alternative approach which
uses meromorphic differentials instead of theta functions to construct the
solution of the model Riemann-Hilbert problem.
