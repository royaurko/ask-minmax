This work is aimed to develop a new class of methods for the BGK model of the
Boltzmann equation. This technique allows to get high order of accuracy both in
space and time, theoretically without CFL stability limitation. It's based on a
Lagrangian formulation of the problem: information is stored on a fixed grid in
space and velocity, and the equation is integrated along the characteristics.
The source term is treated implicitly by using a DIRK (Diagonally Implicit
Runge Kutta) scheme in order to avoid the time step restriction due to the
stiff relaxation. In particular some L-stable schemes are tested by smooth and
Riemann problems, both in rarefied and fully fluid regimes. Numerical results
show good accuracy and efficiency of the method.
