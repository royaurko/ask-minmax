The distant graph $G=G(\mathbb{P}(R), \vartriangle)$ of the projective line
over the ring of integers is considered. The shortest path problem in this
graph is solved. In case the minimal path is non-unique all the possible
splitting are described which allows to give necessary and sufficient
conditions for existence of an unique shortest path.
