A geometric spacetime map of the universe is presented, addressing problems
inherent in deep space observations and cosmology. Implications for the
observer's perspective, the cosmological "horizon" and "flatness" problem,
"inflation", and the recently observed accelerating expansion of the Universe
are discussed.
