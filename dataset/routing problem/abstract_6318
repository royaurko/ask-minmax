We consider the inverse conductivity problem of identifying embedded objects
in unbounded domains. The main tool is a set of special solutions to the
Schroedinger equation, the complex spherical waves, which are constructed by a
Carleman estimate. Using these solutions we can treat the inverse problem in
the unbounded domain like in the bounded case, and it is possible to localize
the boundary measurements to a finite part of the boundary.
