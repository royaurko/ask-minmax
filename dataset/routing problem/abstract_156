Large scale decentralized communication systems have introduced the new trend
towards online routing where routing decisions are performed based on a limited
and localized knowledge of the network. Geometrical greedy routing has been
among the simplest and most common online routing schemes. A perfect
geometrical routing scheme is expected to deliver each packet to the point in
the network that is closest to the packet destination. However greedy routing
fails to guarantee such delivery as the greedy forwarding decision sometimes
leads the packets to localized minimums. This article investigates the
necessary and sufficient properties of the greedy supporting graphs that
provide the guaranteed delivery of packets when acting as a routing substrate.
