We study the problem of partitioning integer sequences in the one-pass data
streaming model. Given is an input stream of integers $X \in \{0, 1, \dots, m
\}^n$ of length $n$ with maximum element $m$, and a parameter $p$. The goal is
to output the positions of separators splitting the input stream into $p$
contiguous blocks such that the maximal weight of a block is minimized. We show
that computing an optimal solution requires linear space, and we design space
efficient $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithms for this problem following
the parametric search framework. We demonstrate that parametric search can be
successfully applied in the streaming model, and we present more space
efficient refinements of the basic method. All discussed algorithms require
space $O( \frac{1}{\epsilon} \mathrm{polylog} (m,n,\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$, and
we prove that the linear dependency on $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ is necessary for
any possibly randomized one-pass streaming algorithm that computes a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation.
