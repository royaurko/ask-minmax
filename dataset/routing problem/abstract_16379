In this paper, we introduce a definition of BV functions in a Gelfand triple
which is an extension of the definition of BV functions in [2] by using
Dirichlet form theory. By this definition, we can consider the stochastic
reflection problem associated with a self-adjoint operator $A$ and a
cylindrical Wiener process on a convex set $\Gamma$ in a Hilbert space $H$. We
prove the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution of this problem when
$\Gamma$ is a regular convex set. The result is also extended to the
non-symmetric case. Finally, we extend our results to the case when
$\Gamma=K_\alpha$, where $K_\alpha={f\in L^2 (0,1)|f\geq -\alpha},\alpha\geq0$.
