In this paper, we give a purely cohomological interpretation of the extension
problem for (super) Lie algebras; that is the problem of extending a Lie
algebra by another Lie algebra. We then give a similar interpretation of
infinitesimal deformations of extensions. In particular, we consider
infinitesimal deformations of representations of a Lie algebra.
