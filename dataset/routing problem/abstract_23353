Models with extra dimensions are often invoked to resolve cosmological
problems. We investigate the possibility of apparent acausality as seen by a
brane-based observer resulting from signal propagation through the extra
dimensions. Null geodesics are first computed in static and cosmological
single-brane models, following which we derive the equations of motion for the
inter-brane distance in a two-brane scenario, which we use to examine possible
acausality in this more complex setup. Despite observing significant effective
acausality in some situations there is no a priori solution to the horizon
problem using this mechanism. In the two-brane scenario there can be
significant late time violation of gravitational Lorentz invariance, resulting
in the gravitational horizon being larger than the particle horizon, leading to
potential signals in gravitational wave detectors.
