In the paper, the contact - boundary value problem with non-classical
conditions not requiring agreement conditions is considered for a
pseudoparabolic equation. The equivalence of these conditions is substantiated
in the case if the solution of the solution of the stated problem is sought in
S.L.Sobolev isotropic space.
