We study a nonlocal boundary value problem for anti-self-dual instantons on
4-manifolds with a space-time splitting of the boundary. The model case is $\R
\times Y$, where $Y$ is a compact oriented 3-manifold with boundary $\Sigma$.
The restriction of the instanton to each time slice ${t}\times\Sigma$ is
required to lie in a fixed (singular) Lagrangian submanifold of the moduli
space of flat connections over $\Sigma$. We establish the basic regularity and
compactness properties (assuming $L^p$-bounds on the curvature) as well as the
Fredholm theory in a compact model case. The motivation for studying this
boundary value problem lies in the construction of instanton Floer homology for
3-manifolds with boundary. The present paper is part of a program proposed by
Salamon for the proof of the Atiyah-Floer conjecture for homology-3-spheres.
