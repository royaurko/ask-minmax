Maximum surjective constraint satisfaction problems (Max-Sur-CSPs) are
computational problems where we are given a set of variables denoting values
from a finite domain B and a set of constraints on the variables. A solution to
such a problem is a surjective mapping from the set of variables to B such that
the number of satisfied constraints is maximized. We study the approximation
performance that can be acccchieved by algorithms for these problems, mainly by
investigating their relation with Max-CSPs (which are the corresponding
problems without the surjectivity requirement). Our work gives a complexity
dichotomy for Max-Sur-CSP(B) between PTAS and APX-complete, under the
assumption that there is a complexity dichotomy for Max-CSP(B) between PO and
APX-complete, which has already been proved on the Boolean domain and 3-element
domains.
