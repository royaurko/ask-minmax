A relatively high critical temperature, Tc, approaching 40 K, places the
recently-discovered superconductor magnesium diboride (MgB2) intermediate
between the families of low- and copper-oxide-based high-temperature
superconductors (HTS). Supercurrent flow in MgB2 is unhindered by grain
boundaries, unlike the HTS materials. Thus, long polycrystalline MgB2
conductors may be easier to fabricate, and so could fill a potentially
important niche of applications in the 20 to 30 K temperature range. However,
one disadvantage of MgB2 is that in bulk material the critical current density,
Jc, appears to drop more rapidly with increasing magnetic field than it does in
the HTS phases. The magnitude and field dependence of Jc are related to the
presence of structural defects that can "pin" the quantised magnetic vortices
that permeate the material, and prevent them from moving under the action of
the Lorentz force. Vortex studies suggest that it is the paucity of suitable
defects in MgB2 that causes the rapid decay of Jc with field. Here we show that
modest levels of atomic disorder, induced by proton irradiation, enhance the
pinning, and so increase Jc significantly at high fields. We anticipate that
chemical doping or mechanical processing should be capable of generating
similar levels of disorder, and so achieve technologically-attractive
performance in MgB2 by economically-viable routes.
