We consider the model Poisson problem $-\Delta u = f \in \Omega$, $u = g$ on
$\pa \Omega$, where $ \Omega $ is a bounded polyhedral domain in $\RR^n$. The
objective of the paper is twofold. The first objective is to review the well
posedness and the regularity of our model problem using appropriate weighted
spaces for the data and the solution. We use these results to derive the domain
of the Laplace operator with zero boundary conditions on a concave domain,
which seems not to have been fully investigated before. We also mention some
extensions of our results to interface problems for the Elasticity equation.
The second objective is to illustrate how anisotropic weighted regularity
results for the Laplace operator in 3D are used in designing efficient finite
element discretizations of elliptic boundary value problems, with the focus on
the efficient discretization of the Poisson problem on polyhedral domains in
$\RR^3$, following {\em Numer. Funct. Anal. Optim.}, 28(7-8):775--824, 2007.
The anisotropic weighted regularity results described and used in the second
part of the paper are a consequence of the well-posedness results in
(isotropically) weighted Sobolev spaces described in the first part of the
paper. The paper is based on the talk by the last named contributor at the Congress
of Romanian Mathematicians, Brasov 2011, and is largely a survey paper.
