Determinant computation is the core procedure in many important geometric
algorithms, such as convex hull computations and point locations. As the
dimension of the computation space grows, a higher percentage of the
computation time is consumed by these predicates. In this paper we study the
sequences of determinants that appear in geometric algorithms. We use dynamic
determinant algorithms to speed-up the computation of each predicate by using
information from previously computed predicates.
  We propose two dynamic determinant algorithms with quadratic complexity when
employed in convex hull computations, and with linear complexity when used in
point location problems. Moreover, we implement them and perform an
experimental analysis. Our implementations outperform the state-of-the-art
determinant and convex hull implementations in most of the tested scenarios, as
well as giving a speed-up of 78 times in point location problems.
