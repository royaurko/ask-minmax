In this paper we further study properties of Magnus embedding, give a precise
reducibility diagram for Dehn problems in groups of the form $F/N^{(d)}$, and
provide a detailed answer to Problem 12.98 in Kourovka notebook. We also show
that most of the reductions are polynomial time reductions and can be used in
practical computation.
