We determine all continuous solutions $g\colon I\to I$ of the polynomial-like
iterative equation $g^3(x)=3g(x)-2x$, where $I\subset\mathbb R$ is an interval.
In particular, we obtain an answer to a problem posed by Zolt\'{a}n Boros
(during the Fiftieth International Symposium on Functional Equations, 2012) of
determining all continuous functions $f\colon (0,+\infty)\to (0,+\infty)$
satisfying $f^3(x)=\frac{[f(x)]^3}{x^2}$.
