A free boundary problem for the incompressible neo-Hookean elastodynamics is
studied in two and three spatial dimensions. The a priori estimates in Sobolev
norms of solutions with the physical vacuum condition are established through a
geometrical point of view. Some estimates on the second fundamental form and
velocity of the free surface are also obtained.
