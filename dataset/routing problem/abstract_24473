We consider a porous medium equation with nonlocal diffusion effects given by
an inverse fractional Laplacian operator. In a previous paper we have found
mass-preserving, nonnegative weak solutions of the equation satisfying energy
estimates. The equation is posed in the whole space R^n. Here we establish the
large-time behaviour. We first find selfsimilar nonnegative solutions by
solving an elliptic obstacle problem with fractional Laplacian for the pair
pressure-density, which we call obstacle Barenblatt solutions. The theory for
elliptic fractional problems with obstacles has been recently established. We
then use entropy methods to show that the asymptotic behavior of general
finite-mass solutions is described after renormalization by these special
solutions.
