We remark that the conjugacy problem for pairs of hyperbolic automorphisms of
a finitely presented group (typically a free group) is decidable. The solution
that we propose uses the isomorphism problem for the suspensions, and the study
of their automorphism group. In the last part of the paper we attempt to extend
our strategy to some cases of relatively hyperbolic automorphisms of a free
group.
