These notes build an introduction to Convolution Quadrature techniques
applied to linear convolutions and convolution equations with a bias to
problems related to wave propagation. The notes are self-contained and
emphasize algorithmic aspects. They include introductory material on
vector-valued distributions, convolution operators, and Dunford calculus.
