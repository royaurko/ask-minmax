In this note we briefly describe our Cholesky modification algorithm for
streaming multiprocessor architectures. Our implementation is available in C++
with Matlab binding, using CUDA to utilise the graphics processing unit (GPU).
Limited speed ups are possible due to the bandwidth bound nature of the
problem. Furthermore, a complex dependency pattern must be obeyed, requiring
multiple kernels to be launched. Nonetheless, this makes for an interesting
problem, and our approach can reduce the computation time by a factor of around
7 for matrices of size 5000 by 5000 and k=16, in comparison with the LINPACK
suite running on a CPU of comparable vintage. Much larger problems can be
handled however due to the O(n) scaling in required GPU memory of our method.
