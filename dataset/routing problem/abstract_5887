In this paper we consider the problem of radiation from a vertical short
dipole above flat ground with losses, which represents the well known in the
literature Sommerfeld radiation problem. We end up with a closed form
analytical solution to the above problem for the received electric and magnetic
field vectors above the ground in the far field area. The method of solution is
formulated in the spectral domain, and by inverse three dimensional Fourier
transformation and subsequent application of the Stationary Phase Method the
final solutions in the physical space are derived. To our knowledge, the above
closed form solutions are novel in the literature for the Sommerfeld radiation
problem. Finally, the physical interpretation for the received fields formulae
derived this paper are provided.
