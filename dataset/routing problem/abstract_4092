We prove existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions to the degenerate
parabolic problem $u_t = \Delta_\infty^h u$ where $\Delta_\infty^h$ is the
$h$-homogeneous operator associated with the infinity-Laplacian,
$\Delta_\infty^h u = |Du|^{h-3} < D^2uDu,Du>$. We also derive the asymptotic
behavior of $u$ for the problem posed in the whole space and for the Dirichlet
problem with zero boundary conditions.
