The technology problems of fabricating different, nanometers sized gold
particles in the layered composites like light-sensitive chalcogenide
glass/gold nanoparticles/transparent substrate or titanium/titanium oxide/gold
nanoparticles were investigated in our work. Combination of ion implantation,
plasma deposition with annealing processes results physical routes for creation
of gold nanoparticles in the mentioned structures, which possess plasmon
effects. These functionalized structures are planned to use for investigations
of optical recording processes, biocompatibility of titanium implants.
