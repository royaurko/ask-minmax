A general analytical method is developed for describing crossover phenomena
of arbitrary nature. The method is based on the algebraic self-similar
renormalization of asymptotic series, with control functions defined by
crossover conditions. The method can be employed for such difficult problems
for which only a few terms of asymptotic expansions are available, and no other
techniques are applicable. As an illustration, analytical solutions for several
important physical problems are presented.
