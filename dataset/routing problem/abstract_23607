This note deals with the following problem, the case $p=1$, $q=2$ of which
was introduced to us by Vitali Milman: What is the volume left in the $L_p^n$
ball after removing a t-multiple of the $L_q^n$ ball? Recall that the $L_r^n$
ball is the set $\{(t_1,t_2,\dots,t_n);\ t_i\in{\bf R},\
n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n|t_i|^r\le 1\}$ and note that for $0<p<q<\infty$ the $L_q^n$
ball is contained in the $L_p^n$ ball.
  In Corollary 4 we show that, after normalizing Lebesgue measure so that the
volume of the $L_p^n$ ball is one, the answer to the problem above is of order
$e^{-ct^pn^{p/q}}$ for $T<t<{1\over 2}n^ {{1\over p}-{1\over q}}$, where $c$
and $T$ depend on $p$ and $q$ but not on $n$.
  The main theorem, Theorem 3, deals with the corresponding question for the
surface measure of the $L_p^n$ sphere.
