We study the Cauchy problem for a system of two coupled nonlinear focusing
Schroedinger equations arising in nonlinear optics. We discuss when the
solutions are global in time or blow-up in finite time. Some results, in
dependence of the data of the problem, are proved; in particular we give a
bound, depending on the coupling parameter, for the blow-up threshold.
