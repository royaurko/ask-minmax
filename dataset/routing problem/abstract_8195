We study a new variant of colored orthogonal range searching problem: given a
query rectangle $Q$ all colors $c$, such that at least a fraction $\tau$ of all
points in $Q$ are of color $c$, must be reported. We describe several data
structures for that problem that use pseudo-linear space and answer queries in
poly-logarithmic time.
