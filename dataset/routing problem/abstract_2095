The saddle-node bifurcation on an invariant circle (SNIC) is one of the
codimension-one routes to creation or destruction of a periodic orbit in a
continuous-time dynamical system. It governs the transition from resting
behaviour to periodic spiking in many class I neurons, for example. Here, as a
first step towards theory of networks of such units the effect of weak coupling
between two systems with a SNIC is analysed. Two crucial parameters of the
coupling are identified, which we call \delta_1 and \delta_2. Global
bifurcation diagrams are obtained here for the "mutualistic" case \delta_1
\delta_2 > 0. According to the parameter regime, there may coexist resting and
periodic attractors, and there can be quasiperiodic attractors of torus or
cantorus type, making the behaviour of even such a simple system quite
non-trivial. In a second paper we will analyse the mixed case \delta_1 \delta_2
< 0 and summarise the conclusions of this study.
