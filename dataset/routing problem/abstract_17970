We investigate the multi-dimensional Super Resolution problem on closed
semi-algebraic domains for various sampling schemes such as Fourier or moments.
We present a new semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation of the 1
-minimization in the space of Radon measures in the multi-dimensional frame on
semi-algebraic sets. While standard approaches have focused on SDP relaxations
of the dual program (a popular approach is based on Gram matrix
representations), this paper introduces an exact formulation of the primal 1
-minimization exact recovery problem of Super Resolution that unleashes
standard techniques (such as moment-sum-of-squares hier-archies) to overcome
intrinsic limitations of previous works in the literature. Notably, we show
that one can exactly solve the Super Resolution problem in dimension greater
than 2 and for a large family of domains described by semi-algebraic sets.
