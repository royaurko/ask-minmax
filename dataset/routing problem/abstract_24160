(abridged) In this paper, we present the issues we consider as essential as
far as the statistical mechanics of finite systems is concerned. In particular,
we emphasis our present understanding of phase transitions in the framework of
information theory. Information theory provides a thermodynamically-consistent
treatment of finite, open, transient and expanding systems which are difficult
problems in approaches using standard statistical ensembles. As an example, we
analyze is the problem of boundary conditions, which in the framework of
information theory must also be treated statistically. We recall that out of
the thermodynamical limit the different ensembles are not equivalent and in
particular they may lead to dramatically different equation of states, in the
region of a first order phase transition. We recall the recent progresses
achieved in the understanding of first-order phase transition in finite
systems: the equivalence between the Yang-Lee theorem and the occurrence of
bimodalities in the intensive ensemble and the presence of inverted curvatures
of the thermodynamic potential of the associated extensive ensemble.
