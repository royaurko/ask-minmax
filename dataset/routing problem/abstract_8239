A metallic film of arbitrary thickness is considered. We show that the
problem of description of surface plasma oscillations (surface plasmons) with
reflection boundary conditions allows analytic solution. Besides, this problem
allows generalization for more general case of conducting matter (in
particular, and for semiconductors).
