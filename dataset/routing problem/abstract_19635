We describe how the fermionic functional renormalization group (fRG) flow of
a Cooper+forward scattering problem can be continued into the superconducting
state. This allows us to reproduce from the fRG flow the fundamental equations
of the Eliashberg theory for superconductivity at all temperatures including
the symmetry-broken phase. We discuss possible extensions of this approach like
the inclusion of vertex corrections.
