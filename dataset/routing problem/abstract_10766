This work addresses the inverse problem of electrocardiography from a new
perspective, by combining electrical and mechanical measurements. Our strategy
relies on the defini-tion of a model of the electromechanical contraction which
is registered on ECG data but also on measured mechanical displacements of the
heart tissue typically extracted from medical images. In this respect, we
establish in this work the convergence of a sequential estimator which combines
for such coupled problems various state of the art sequential data assimilation
methods in a unified consistent and efficient framework. Indeed we ag-gregate a
Luenberger observer for the mechanical state and a Reduced Order Unscented
Kalman Filter applied on the parameters to be identified and a POD projection
of the electrical state. Then using synthetic data we show the benefits of our
approach for the estimation of the electrical state of the ventricles along the
heart beat compared with more classical strategies which only consider an
electrophysiological model with ECG measurements. Our numerical results
actually show that the mechanical measurements improve the identifiability of
the electrical problem allowing to reconstruct the electrical state of the
coupled system more precisely. Therefore, this work is intended to be a first
proof of concept, with theoretical justifications and numerical investigations,
of the ad-vantage of using available multi-modal observations for the
estimation and identification of an electromechanical model of the heart.
