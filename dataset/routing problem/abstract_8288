We solve the currently smallest open case in the 1976 problem of Molluzzo on
$\Z{m}$, namely the case $m=4$. This amounts to constructing, for all positive
integer $n$ congruent to 0 or 7 mod 8, a sequence of integers modulo 4 of
length $n$ generating, by Pascal's rule, a Steinhaus triangle containing
0,1,2,3 with equal multiplicities.
