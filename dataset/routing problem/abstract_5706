We consider the problem of reconstruction of planar domains from their
moments. Specifically, we consider domains with boundary which can be
represented by a union of a finite number of pieces whose graphs are solutions
of a linear differential equation with polynomial coefficients. This includes
domains with piecewise-algebraic and, in particular, piecewise-polynomial
boundaries. Our approach is based on one-dimensional reconstruction method of
[Bat]* and a kind of "separation of variables" which reduces the planar problem
to two one-dimensional problems, one of them parametric. Several explicit
examples of reconstruction are given.
  Another main topic of the paper concerns "invisible sets" for various types
of incomplete moment measurements. We suggest a certain point of view which
stresses remarkable similarity between several apparently unrelated problems.
In particular, we discuss zero quadrature domains (invisible for harmonic
polynomials), invisibility for powers of a given polynomial, and invisibility
for complex moments (Wermer's theorem and further developments). The common
property we would like to stress is a "rigidity" and symmetry of the invisible
objects.
