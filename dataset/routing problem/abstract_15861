In this paper we have studied non-linear stability of triangular equilibrium
points. We have performed first order normalization in the generalized
photogravitational restricted three body problem with Poynting-Robertson drag.
In this problem we have taken bigger primary as source of radiation and smaller
primary is an oblate spheroid. At first we have expanded the Lagrangian
function in power series of x and y, where (x, y) are the coordinates of the
triangular equilibrium points. Then the relation between the roots of the
characteristic equation for the linearised system is obtained.
