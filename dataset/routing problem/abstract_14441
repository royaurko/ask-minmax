The restricted planar elliptic three body problem models the motion of a
massless body under the Newtonian gravitational force of the two other bodies,
the primaries, which evolve in Keplerian ellipses.
  A trajectory is called oscillatory if it leaves every bounded region but
returns infinitely often to some fixed bounded region. We prove the existence
of such type of trajectories for any values for the masses of the primaries
provided they make almost circular orbits.
