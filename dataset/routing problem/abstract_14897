We give a number of algorithms for constructing unitary matrices and tight
frames with specialized properties. These were produced at the request of
researchers at the Frame Research Center (www.framerc.org) to help with their
research on fusion frames, the Kadison-Singer Problem and equiangular tight
frames.
