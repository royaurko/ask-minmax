We consider the problem of existence of entropy weak solutions to scalar
balance laws with a dissipative source term. The flux function may be
discontinuous with respect both to the space variable x and the unknown
quantity u. The problem is formulated in the framework of multi-valued
mappings. We use the notion of entropy-measure valued solutions to prove the
so-called contraction principle and comparison principle.
