MultiDendrograms is a Java-written application that computes agglomerative
hierarchical clusterings of data. Starting from a distances (or weights)
matrix, MultiDendrograms is able to calculate its dendrograms using the most
common agglomerative hierarchical clustering methods. The application
implements a variable-group algorithm that solves the non-uniqueness problem
found in the standard pair-group algorithm. This problem arises when two or
more minimum distances between different clusters are equal during the
agglomerative process, because then different output clusterings are possible
depending on the criterion used to break ties between distances.
MultiDendrograms solves this problem implementing a variable-group algorithm
that groups more than two clusters at the same time when ties occur.
