The problem of model-checking hybrid systems is a long-time challenge in the
scientific community. Most of the existing approaches and tools are either
limited on the properties that they can verify, or restricted to simplified
classes of systems. To overcome those limitations, a temporal logic called
HyLTL has been recently proposed. The model checking problem for this logic has
been solved by translating the formula into an equivalent hybrid automaton,
that can be analized using existing tools. The original construction employs a
declarative procedure that generates exponentially many states upfront, and can
be very inefficient when complex formulas are involved. In this paper we solve
a technical issue in the construction that was not considered in previous
works, and propose a new algorithm to translate HyLTL into hybrid automata,
that exploits optimized techniques coming from the discrete LTL community to
build smaller automata.
