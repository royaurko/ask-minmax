In this work we are interested in the central configurations of the planar
1+4 body problem where the satellites have different infinitesimal masses and
two of them are diametrically opposite in a circle. We can think this problem
as a stacked central configuration too. We show that the configuration are
necessarily symmetric and the other sattelites has the same mass. Moreover we
proved that the number of central configuration in this case is in general one,
two or three and in the special case where the satellites diametrically
opposite have the same mass we proved that the number of central configuration
is one or two saying the exact value of the ratio of the masses that provides
this bifurcation.
