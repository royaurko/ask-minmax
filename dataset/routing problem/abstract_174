This paper critically examines some propositions and arguments of
cs.NI/0508021 regarding applicability of hierarchical routing and perspectives
of compact routing. Arguments against the former are found to be inaccurate
while the latter is found to be equivalent to well-known deployed solutions.
Also, multiple (stacked) application of compact-routing solutions is found to
be equivalent to hierarchical routing.
