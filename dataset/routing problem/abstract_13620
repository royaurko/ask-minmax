This paper is concerned with the quasi-linear reflected backward stochastic
partial differential equation (RBSPDE for short). Basing on the theory of
backward stochastic partial differential equation and the parabolic capacity
and potential, we first associate the RBSPDE to a variational problem, and via
the penalization method, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution
for linear RBSPDE with Lapalacian leading coefficients. With the continuity
approach, we further obtain the well-posedness of general quasi-linear RBSPDEs.
Related results, including It\^o formulas for backward stochastic partial
differential equations with random measures, the comparison principle for
solutions of RBSPDEs and the connections with reflected backward stochastic
differential equations and optimal stopping problems, are addressed as well.
