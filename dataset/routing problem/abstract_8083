The fourth-order quasilinear reaction-diffusion equation with a p-Laplacian
operator is shown to admit three types of blow-up. Self-similar patterns are
first constructed for the regional blow-up case, where the rescaled problem
admits a variational setting. Next, these were extended via a branching
approach to non-variational problems.
