We generalize the Randall Sundrum warped braneworld model in six and higher
dimension and propose a resolution to the mass hierarchy among the standard
model fermions. The fine tuning problem in connection with the scalar mass
however is shown to reappear in a new guise in five dimensional warped model
when the two form antisymmetric tensor fields, a massless string mode,
propagates in the bulk. Finally the issue of modulus stabilization is
re-examined in presence of a bulk scalar by considering it's back-reaction on
the background geometry. The role of higher derivative term of the bulk scalar
is shown to be crucial to achieve modulus stabilization.
