The twin primes conjecture is a very old problem. Tacitly it is supposed that
the primes it deals with are finite. In the present paper we consider three
problems that are not related to finite primes but deal with infinite integers.
The main tool of our investigation is a numeral system proposed recently that
allows one to express various infinities and infinitesimals easily and by a
finite number of symbols. The problems under consideration are the following
and for all of them we give affermative answers: (i) do infinite primes exist?
(ii) do infinite twin primes exist? (ii) is the set of infinite twin primes
infinite? Examples of these three kinds of objects are given.
