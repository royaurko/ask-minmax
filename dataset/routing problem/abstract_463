Redistribution of the intelligence and management in the software defined
networks (SDNs) is a potential approach to address the bottlenecks of
scalability and integrity of these networks. We propose to revisit the routing
concept based on the notion of regions. Using basic and consistent definition
of regions, a region-based packet routing called SmartRegion Routing is
presented. The flexibility of regions in terms of naming and addressing is then
leveraged in the form of a region stack among other features placed in the
associated packet header. In this way, most of complexity and dynamicity of a
network is absorbed, and therefore highly fast and simplified routing at the
inter-region level along with semi-autonomous intra-region routing will be
feasible. In addition, multipath planning can be naturally realized at both
inter and intra levels. A basic form of SmartRegion routing mechanism is
provided. Simplicity, scalability, and manageability of the proposed approach
would also bring future potentials to reduce energy consumption and
environmental footprint associated to the SDNs. Finally, various applications,
such as enabling seamless broadband access, providing beyond IP addressing
mechanisms, and also address-equivalent naming mechanisms, are considered and
discussed.
