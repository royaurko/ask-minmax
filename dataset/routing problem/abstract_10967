We apply the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to a
non-equilibrium problem: the asymmetric exclusion process in one dimension. We
study the stationary state of the process to calculate the particle density
profile (one-point function). We show that, even with a small number of
retained bases, the DMRG calculation is in excellent agreement with the exact
solution obtained by the matrix-product-ansatz approach.
