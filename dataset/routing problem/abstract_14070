Restricted Boltzman Machines (RBMs) have been successfully used in
recommender systems. However, as with most of other collaborative filtering
techniques, it cannot solve cold start problems for there is no rating for a
new item. In this paper, we first apply conditional RBM (CRBM) which could take
extra information into account and show that CRBM could solve cold start
problem very well, especially for rating prediction task. CRBM naturally
combine the content and collaborative data under a single framework which could
be fitted effectively. Experiments show that CRBM can be compared favourably
with matrix factorization models, while hidden features learned from the former
models are more easy to be interpreted.
