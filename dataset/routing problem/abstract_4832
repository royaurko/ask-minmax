In this work, we consider a variant of the classical Longest Common
Subsequence problem called Doubly-Constrained Longest Common Subsequence
(DC-LCS). Given two strings s1 and s2 over an alphabet A, a set C_s of strings,
and a function Co from A to N, the DC-LCS problem consists in finding the
longest subsequence s of s1 and s2 such that s is a supersequence of all the
strings in Cs and such that the number of occurrences in s of each symbol a in
A is upper bounded by Co(a). The DC-LCS problem provides a clear mathematical
formulation of a sequence comparison problem in Computational Biology and
generalizes two other constrained variants of the LCS problem: the Constrained
LCS and the Repetition-Free LCS. We present two results for the DC-LCS problem.
First, we illustrate a fixed-parameter algorithm where the parameter is the
length of the solution. Secondly, we prove a parameterized hardness result for
the Constrained LCS problem when the parameter is the number of the constraint
strings and the size of the alphabet A. This hardness result also implies the
parameterized hardness of the DC-LCS problem (with the same parameters) and its
NP-hardness when the size of the alphabet is constant.
