In the world of multivariate extremes, estimation of the dependence structure
still presents a challenge and an interesting problem. A procedure for the
bivariate case is presented that opens the road to a similar way of handling
the problem in a truly multivariate setting. We consider a semi-parametric
model in which the stable tail dependence function is parametrically modeled.
Given a random sample from a bivariate distribution function, the problem is to
estimate the unknown parameter. A method of moments estimator is proposed where
a certain integral of a nonparametric, rank-based estimator of the stable tail
dependence function is matched with the corresponding parametric version. Under
very weak conditions, the estimator is shown to be consistent and
asymptotically normal. Moreover, a comparison between the parametric and
nonparametric estimators leads to a goodness-of-fit test for the semiparametric
model. The performance of the estimator is illustrated for a discrete spectral
measure that arises in a factor-type model and for which likelihood-based
methods break down. A second example is that of a family of stable tail
dependence functions of certain meta-elliptical distributions.
