We demonstrate how niche theory and Hubbell's original formulation of neutral
theory can be blended together into a general framework modeling the combined
effects of selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal on community dynamics.
This framework connects many seemingly unrelated ecological population models,
and allows for quantitative predictions to be made about the impact of niche
stabilizing and destabilizing forces on population extinction times and
abundance distributions. In particular, the existence of niche stabilizing
forces in our blended framework can simultaneously resolve two major problems
with the dynamics of neutral theory, namely predictions of species lifetimes
that are too short and species ages that are too long.
