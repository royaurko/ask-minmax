We consider the mixed problem for $L$ the Lam\'e system of elasticity in a
bounded Lipschitz domain $ \Omega\subset\reals ^2$. We suppose that the
boundary is written as the union of two disjoint sets, $\partial\Omega =D\cup
N$. We take traction data from the space $L^p(N)$ and Dirichlet data from a
Sobolev space $ W^{1,p}(D)$ and look for a solution $u$ of $Lu =0$ with the
given boundary conditions. We give a scale invariant condition on $D$ and find
an exponent $ p_0 >1$ so that for $1<p<p_0$, we have a unique solution of this
boundary value problem with the non-tangential maximal function of the gradient
of the solution in $L^ p(\partial\Omega)$. We also establish the existence of a
unique solution when the data is taken from Hardy spaces and Hardy-Sobolev
spaces with $ p$ in $(p_1,1]$ for some $p_1 <1$.
