Physicists have been interested in accelerated observers for quite some time.
Since the advent of special relativity, many contributors have tried to understand
these observers in the framework of Minkowski spacetime. One of the most
important issues related to these observers is the problematic definition of
rigid motion. In this paper, I write the metric in terms of the Frenet-Serret
curvatures and the proper coordinate system of a general accelerated observer.
Then, I use this approach to create a systematic way to construct a rigid
motion in Minkowski spacetime. Finally, I exemplify the benefits of this
procedure by applying it to two well-known observers, namely, the Rindler and
the rotating ones, and also by creating a set of observers that, perhaps, may
be interpreted as a rigid cylinder which rotates while accelerating along the
axis of rotation.
