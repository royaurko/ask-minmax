In this note we address various algorithmic problems that arise in the
computation of the operator norm in unitary representations of a group on
Hilbert space. We show that the operator norm in the universal unitary
representation is computable if the group is residually finite-dimensional or
amenable with decidable word problem. Moreover, we relate the computability of
the operator norm on the product of non-abelian free groups to Kirchberg's QWEP
Conjecture, a fundamental open problem in the theory of operator algebras.
