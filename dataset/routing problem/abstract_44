We investigate whether it is possible to dynamically generate from classical
transport theory the observed surprising Rout ~ Rside in Au+Au at s^1/2 = 130A
GeV at RHIC. We obtained covariant solutions to the Boltzmann transport
equation via the MPC technique, for a wide range of partonic initial conditions
and opacities. We demonstrate that there exist transport solutions that yield a
freezeout distribution with Rout < Rside for Kperp > ~ 1.5 GeV. These solutions
correspond to continuous evaporation-like freezeout, where the emission
duration is comparable to the source size. Naively this would mean Rout >
Rside. Nevertheless, our sources exhibit Rout < Rside because they are narrower
in the 'out' than in the 'side' direction and, in addition, a positive x_out-t
correlation develops reducing Rout further.
