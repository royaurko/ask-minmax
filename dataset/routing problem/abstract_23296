The nonsupersymmetric as well as the supersymmetric hybrid inflationary model
is reviewed. The scenario of baryogenesis via a primordial leptogenesis is
discussed and the role of the nonperturbative electroweak sphaleron effects is
analyzed. A supersymmetric model based on a left-right symmetric gauge group,
which `naturally' leads to hybrid inflation, is presented. The mu problem is
solved, in this model, and the baryon asymmetry of the universe is produced
through leptogenesis. For masses of nu_mu, nu_tau from the small angle MSW
resolution of the solar neutrino problem and SuperKamiokande, maximal
nu_mu-nu_tau mixing can be achieved. The required values of the relevant
parameters are, however, quite small.
