In image classification, merging the opinion of several human experts is very
important for different tasks such as the evaluation or the training. Indeed,
the ground truth is rarely known before the scene imaging. We propose here
different models in order to fuse the informations given by two or more
experts. The considered unit for the classification, a small tile of the image,
can contain one or more kind of the considered classes given by the experts. A
second problem that we have to take into account, is the amount of certainty of
the expert has for each pixel of the tile. In order to solve these problems we
define five models in the context of the Dempster-Shafer Theory and in the
context of the Dezert-Smarandache Theory and we study the possible decisions
with these models.
