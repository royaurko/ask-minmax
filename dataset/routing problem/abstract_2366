Location awareness in wireless networks may enable many applications such as
emergency services, autonomous driving and geographic routing. Although there
are many available positioning techniques, none of them is adapted to work with
massive multiple-in-multiple-out (MIMO) systems, which represent a leading 5G
technology candidate. In this paper, we discuss possible solutions for
positioning of mobile stations using a vector of signals at the base station,
equipped with many antennas distributed over deployment area. Our main proposal
is to use fingerprinting techniques based on a vector of received signal
strengths. This kind of methods are able to work in highly-cluttered multipath
environments, and require just one base station, in contrast to standard
range-based and angle-based techniques. We also provide a solution for
fingerprinting-based positioning based on Gaussian process regression, and
discuss main applications and challenges.
