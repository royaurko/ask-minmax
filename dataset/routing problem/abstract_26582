It is shown that there are nonlinear sigma models which are Darboux
integrable and possess a solvable Vessiot group in addition to those whose
Vessiot groups are central extensions of semi-simple Lie groups. They govern
harmonic maps between Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{1,1}$ and certain complete,
non-constant curvature 2-metrics. The solvability of the Vessiot group permits
a reduction of the general Cauchy problem to quadrature. We treat the specific
case of harmonic maps from Minkowski space into a non-constant curvature
Lorentzian 2-metric, $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$. Despite the completeness of
$\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ we exhibit a Cauchy problem with real analytic initial
data which blows up in finite time. We also derive a hyperbolic Weierstrass
representation formula for all harmonic maps from $\mathbb{R}^{1,1}$ into
$\boldsymbol{\lambda}$.
