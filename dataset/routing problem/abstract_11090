Our previous results [J.Phys.: Condens. Matter 14 (2002) 13777] dealing with
the analytical solution of the two-dimensional (2-D) Anderson localization
problem due to disorder is generalized for anisotropic systems (two different
hopping matrix elements in transverse directions). We discuss the mathematical
nature of the metal-insulator phase transition which occurs in the 2-D case, in
contrast to the 1-D case, where such a phase transition does not occur. In
anisotropic systems two localization lengths arise instead of one length only.
