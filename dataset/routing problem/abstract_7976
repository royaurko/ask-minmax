The computer simulation of quasistationary Stefan problem has been realized.
Different representations of the Laplacian growth model are considered. The
main attention has been paid for the interface dynamics represented by integro
differential equations. Numerical approach has been realized by use of
interpolating polynomials and exact quadrature formulae. As a result system of
ordinary differential equations has been simulated.
