Low-energy electrons (30-250 eV) have been successfully employed for imaging
individual biomolecules. The most simple and elegant design of a low-energy
electron microscope for imaging biomolecules is a lensless setup that operates
in the holographic mode. In this work we address the problem associated with
the reconstruction from the recorded holograms. We discuss the twin image
problem intrinsic to inline holography and the problem of the so-called
biprism-like effect specific to low-energy electrons. We demonstrate how the
presence of the biprism-like effect can be efficiently identified and
circumvented. The presented sideband filtering reconstruction method eliminates
the twin image and allows for reconstruction despite the biprism-like effect,
which we demonstrate on both, simulated and experimental examples.
