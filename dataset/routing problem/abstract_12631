This paper revisits the problem of determinacy inference addressing the
problem of how to uniformly handle cut. To this end a new semantics is
introduced for cut, which is abstracted to systematically derive a backward
analysis that derives conditions sufficient for a goal to succeed at most once.
The method is conceptionally simpler and easier to implement than existing
techniques, whilst improving the latter's handling of cut. Formal arguments
substantiate correctness and experimental work, and a tool called 'RedAlert'
demonstrates the method's generality and applicability.
