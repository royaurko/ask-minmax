Answering a question of Haugland, we show that the pooling problem with one
pool and a bounded number of inputs can be solved in polynomial time by solving
a polynomial number of linear programs of polynomial size. We also give an
overview of known complexity results and remaining open problems to further
characterize the border between (strongly) NP-hard and polynomially solvable
cases of the pooling problem.
