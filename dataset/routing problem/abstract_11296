Motivated by a recent analysis which presents explicitly the general
solution, we consider the eigenvalue problem of the spinless Salpeter equation
with a ("hard-core amended") Coulomb potential in one dimension. We prove the
existence of a critical coupling constant (which contradicts the assertions of
the previous analysis) and give analytic upper bounds on the energy
eigenvalues. These upper bounds seem to disprove the previous explicit
solution.
