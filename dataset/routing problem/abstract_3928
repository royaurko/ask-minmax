In this paper the asymptotic distributions are exactly solved for linearly
independent solutions considering problems of the second order and for the
coefficients of asymptotic destribution the recurent formulas are obtained.
Further, using obtained recurent formulas the neccessary and sufficient
conditions almost regularity of spectral problem for the equation of the second
order is proved.
