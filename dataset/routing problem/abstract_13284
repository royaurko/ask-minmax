Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) are more and more frequently used for
lattice QCD calculations. Lattice studies often require computing the quark
propagators for several masses. These systems can be solved using multi-shift
inverters but these algorithms are memory intensive which limits the size of
the problem that can be solved using GPUs. In this paper, we show how to
efficiently use a memory-lean single-mass inverter to solve multi-mass
problems. We focus on the BiCGstab algorithm for Wilson fermions and show that
the single-mass inverter not only requires less memory but also outperforms the
multi-shift variant by a factor of two.
