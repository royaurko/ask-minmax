We consider an inverse problem associated with $n$-dimensional asymptotically
hyperbolic orbifolds $(n \geq 2)$ having a finite number of cusps and regular
ends. By observing solutions of the Helmholtz equation at the cusp, we
introduce a generalized $S$-matrix, and then show that it determines the
manifolds with its Riemannian metric and the orbifold structure.
