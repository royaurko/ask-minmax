In this note we compute the non-planar one loop anomalous dimension of
restricted Schur polynomials that belong to the sl(2) sector of N=4 super
Yang-Mills theory and have a bare dimension of order N. Although the details
are rather different, ultimately the problem of diagonalizing the dilatation
operator in the sl(2) sector can be reduced to the su(2) sector problem. In
this way we establish the expected dynamical emergence of the Gauss Law for
giant gravitons and further show that the dilatation operator reduces to a set
of decoupled harmonic oscillators.
