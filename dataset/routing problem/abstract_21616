We prove global in time dynamical stability of steady transonic shock
solutions in divergent quasi-one-dimensional nozzles. We assume neither the
smallness of the relative slope of the nozzle nor the weakness of the shock.
Key ingredients of the proof are an exponentially decaying energy estimate for
a linearized problem together with methods from \cite{LRXX}.
