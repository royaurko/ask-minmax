We show that not all $(2+1)$ dimensional toric phases are Seiberg-like duals.
Particularly, we work out superconformal indices for the toric phases of Fanos
${\cal{C}}_3$, ${\cal{C}}_5$ and ${\cal{B}}_2$. We find that the indices for
the two toric phases of Fano ${\cal{B}}_2$ do not match, which implies that
they are not Seiberg-like duals. We also take the route of acting Seiberg-like
duality transformation on toric quiver Chern-Simons theories to obtain dual
quivers. We study two examples and show that Seiberg-like dual quivers are not
always toric quivers.
