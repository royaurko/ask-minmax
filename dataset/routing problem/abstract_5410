Given an arrangement of lines in the plane, what is the minimum number $c$ of
colors required to color the lines so that no cell of the arrangement is
monochromatic? In this paper we give bounds on the number c both for the above
question, as well as some of its variations. We redefine these problems as
geometric hypergraph coloring problems. If we define $\Hlinecell$ as the
hypergraph where vertices are lines and edges represent cells of the
arrangement, the answer to the above question is equal to the chromatic number
of this hypergraph. We prove that this chromatic number is between $\Omega
(\log n / \log\log n)$. and $O(\sqrt{n})$.
  Similarly, we give bounds on the minimum size of a subset $S$ of the
intersections of the lines in $\mathcal{A}$ such that every cell is bounded by
at least one of the vertices in $S$. This may be seen as a problem on guarding
cells with vertices when the lines act as obstacles. The problem can also be
defined as the minimum vertex cover problem in the hypergraph $\Hvertexcell$,
the vertices of which are the line intersections, and the hyperedges are
vertices of a cell. Analogously, we consider the problem of touching the lines
with a minimum subset of the cells of the arrangement, which we identify as the
minimum vertex cover problem in the $\Hcellzone$ hypergraph.
