We discuss some of the issues that arise in attempts to classify
automorphisms of compact abelian groups from a dynamical point of view. In the
particular case of automorphisms of one-dimensional solenoids, a complete
description is given and the problem of determining the range of certain
invariants of topological conjugacy is discussed. Several new results and old
and new open problems are described.
