Black holes pose a serious problem in the cyclic or oscillating cosmology. It
is speculated that, in the cyclic universe with phantom turnarounds, black
holes will be torn apart by the phantom energy before turnaround before they
can create any problems. In this paper, using the mechanism of the phantom
accretion onto black holes, we find that black holes do not disappear before
the phantom turnaround. But the remanent black holes will not cause any
problems due to the Hawking evaporation.
