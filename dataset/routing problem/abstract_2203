A standard method for picoammeter calibrations is the capacitor charging
technique, which allows generating traceable currents in the sub-nA range.
However, its accuracy is limited by the ac-dc differences of the capacitances
involved. The Ultrastable Low-noise Current Amplifier (ULCA) is a novel
high-precision amperemeter for direct current measurements in the pA range,
developed at PTB. Its amplifier stages, based on resistor networks and op-amps,
can be calibrated traceably with a cryogenic current comparator (CCC) system.
We compare the results from both independent calibration routes for two
different ULCA prototypes. We find agreement between both methods at an
uncertainty level below 10 microA/A, limited by the uncertainty of the currents
generated with the capacitor charging method. The investigations confirm the
superior performance of the new ULCA picoammeter.
