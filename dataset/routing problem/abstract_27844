In any tactical scenario, the successful quantification and triangulation of
potential hostile elements is instrumental to minimize any casualties which
might be incurred. The most commonly deployed infrastructures to cater to this
have mostly been surveillance systems which only extract some data pertaining
to the targets of interest in the area of observation and convey the
information to the human operators. Accordingly, with the ever increasing rate
at which warfare tactics are evolving, there has been a growing need for
smarter solutions to this problem of hostile intent enumeration. Recently, a
number of developments have been made to ameliorate the efficacy and the
certitude with which this task is performed. This paper discusses two of the
most prominent approaches which address this problem and posits the outline of
a novel solution which seeks to address the shortcomings faced by the existing
approaches.
