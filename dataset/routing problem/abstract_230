Efficient channel selection is essential in 802.11 mesh deployments, for
minimizing contention and interference among co-channel devices and thereby
supporting a plurality of QoS-sensitive applications. A few protocols have been
proposed for frequency allocation in such networks, however they do not address
the problem end-to-end. In this paper, we present a general formulation of the
channel selection problem taking into account the performance of both
mesh-access and mesh-backhaul. Moreover, we propose ARACHNE, a routing-aware
channel selection protocol for wireless mesh networks. ARACHNE is distributed
in nature, and motivated by our measurements on a wireless testbed. The main
novelty of our protocol comes from adopting a metric that captures the
end-to-end link loads across different routes in the network. ARACHNE
prioritizes the assignment of low-interference channels to links that (a) need
to serve high-load aggregate traffic and/or (b) already suffer significant
levels of contention and interference. Our protocol takes into account the
number of potential interfaces (radios) per device, and allocates these
interfaces in a manner that efficiently utilizes the available channel
capacity. We evaluate ARACHNE through extensive, tracedriven simulations and we
show that approaches the optimal channel selection. We observe that our
protocol improves the total network throughput, as compared to three other
representative channel allocation approaches in literature.
