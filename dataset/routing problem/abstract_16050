We investigate a state estimation problem for the dynamical system described
by uncertain linear operator equation in Hilbert space. The uncertainty is
supposed to admit a set-membership description. We present explicit expressions
for linear minimax estimation and error provided that any pair of uncertain
parameters belongs to the quadratic bounding set. We introduce a new notion of
minimax directional observability and index of non-causality for linear
noncausal DAEs. Application of these notions to the state estimation problem
for linear uncertain noncausal DAEs allows to derive new minimax recursive
estimator for both continuous and discrete time. We illustrate the benefits of
non-causality of the plant applying our approach to scalar nonlinear
set-membership state estimation problem. Numerical example is presented.
