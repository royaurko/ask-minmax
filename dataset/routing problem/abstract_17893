The transformed $l_1$ penalty (TL1) functions are a one parameter family of
bilinear transformations composed with the absolute value function. When acting
on vectors, the TL1 penalty interpolates $l_0$ and $l_1$ similar to $l_p$ norm
($p \in (0,1)$). In our companion paper, we showed that TL1 is a robust
sparsity promoting penalty in compressed sensing (CS) problems for a broad
range of incoherent and coherent sensing matrices. Here we develop an explicit
fixed point representation for the TL1 regularized minimization problem. The
TL1 thresholding functions are in closed form for all parameter values. In
contrast, the $l_p$ thresholding functions ($p \in [0,1]$) are in closed form
only for $p=0,1,1/2,2/3$, known as hard, soft, half, and 2/3 thresholding
respectively. The TL1 threshold values differ in subcritical (supercritical)
parameter regime where the TL1 threshold functions are continuous
(discontinuous) similar to soft-thresholding (half-thresholding) functions. We
propose TL1 iterative thresholding algorithms and compare them with hard and
half thresholding algorithms in CS test problems. For both incoherent and
coherent sensing matrices, a proposed TL1 iterative thresholding algorithm with
adaptive subcritical and supercritical thresholds consistently performs the
best in sparse signal recovery with and without measurement noise.
