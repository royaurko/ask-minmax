We suggest a mathematical definition of the notion of master integrals and
present a brief review of algorithmic methods to solve reduction problems for
Feynman integrals based on integration by parts relations. In particular, we
discuss a recently suggested reduction algorithm which uses Groebner bases. New
results obtained with its help for a family of three-loop Feynman integrals are
outlined.
