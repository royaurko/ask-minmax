We introduce the problem of reconstructing a sequence of multidimensional
real vectors where some of the data are missing. This problem contains
regression and mapping inversion as particular cases where the pattern of
missing data is independent of the sequence index. The problem is hard because
it involves possibly multivalued mappings at each vector in the sequence, where
the missing variables can take more than one value given the present variables;
and the set of missing variables can vary from one vector to the next. To solve
this problem, we propose an algorithm based on two redundancy assumptions:
vector redundancy (the data live in a low-dimensional manifold), so that the
present variables constrain the missing ones; and sequence redundancy (e.g.
continuity), so that consecutive vectors constrain each other. We capture the
low-dimensional nature of the data in a probabilistic way with a joint density
model, here the generative topographic mapping, which results in a Gaussian
mixture. Candidate reconstructions at each vector are obtained as all the modes
of the conditional distribution of missing variables given present variables.
The reconstructed sequence is obtained by minimising a global constraint, here
the sequence length, by dynamic programming. We present experimental results
for a toy problem and for inverse kinematics of a robot arm.
