Recently it was argued that it might be possible treat the conventional
nuclear structure problem -- nonrelativistic point nucleons interacting through
a static and rather singular potential -- as an effective theory in a
shell-model basis. In the first half of this talk we describe how such a
program can be carried out for the simplest nuclei, the deuteron and 3He,
exploiting a new numerical technique for solving the self-consistent
Bloch-Horowitz equation. Some of the properties of proper effective theories
are thus illustrated and contrasted with the shell model. In the second half of
the talk we use these examples to return to a problem that frustrated the field
three decades ago, the possibility of reducing the effective interactions
problem to perturbation theory. We show, by exploiting the Talmi integral
expansion, that hard-core potentials can be systematically softened by the
introduction of a series of contact operators familiar from effective field
theory. The coefficients of these operators can be run analytically by a
renormalization group method in a scheme-independent way, with the introduction
of suitable counterterms. Once these coefficients are run to the shell model
scale, we show that the renormalized coefficients contain all of the
information needed to evaluate perturbative insertions of the remaining soft
potential. The resulting perturbative expansion is shown to converge in lowest
order for the simplest nucleus, the deuteron.
