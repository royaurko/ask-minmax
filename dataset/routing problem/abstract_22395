For a large class of random matrices $A$ and vectors $b$, we show that linear
systems formed from the pair $(A,b)$ are controllable with high probability.
Despite the fact that minimal controllability problems are, in general,
NP-hard, we establish universality results for the minimal controllability of
random systems. Our proof relies on the recent developments of Nguyen-Tao-Vu
concerning gaps between eigenvalues of random matrices.
