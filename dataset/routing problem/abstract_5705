The restricted (equilateral) four-body problem consists of three bodies of
masses m1, m2 and m3 (called primaries) lying in a Lagrangian configuration of
the three-body problem i.e., they remain fixed at the apices of an equilateral
triangle in a rotating coordinate system. A massless fourth body moves under
the Newtonian gravitational law due to the three primaries, as in the
Restricted three-body problem (R3BP), the fourth mass does not affect the
motion of the three primaries. In this paper we explore symmetric periodic
orbits of the restricted four-body problem (R4BP) for the case of two equal
masses where they satisfy approximately the Routh's critical value.
