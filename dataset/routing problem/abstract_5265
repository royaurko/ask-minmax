In this paper we consider the problem of radiation from a vertical short
Hertzian dipole above flat lossy ground, which represents the well known in the
literature Sommerfeld radiation problem. The problem is formulated in a novel
spectral domain approach, and by inverse three dimensional Fourier
transformation the expressions for the received electric and magnetic field in
the physical space are derived as one dimensional integrals over the radial
component of wavevector, in cylindrical coordinates. Subsequent use of the
Stationary Phase Method in the high frequency regime yields closed form
analytical solutions for the received EM field vectors, which coincide with the
corresponding reflected EM field originating from the image point. In this way,
we conclude that the so called in the literature space wave, i.e. line of sight
plus reflected EM field, represents the total solution of the Sommerfeld
problem in the high frequency regime, in which case the surface wave can be
ignored. Finally, numerical results in the high frequency regime are presented
in this paper, in comparison with corresponding numerical results based on
Norton solution of the problem, i.e. space and surface waves.
