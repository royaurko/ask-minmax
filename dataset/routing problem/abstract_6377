We report logarithmically slow expansion of hot bubbles in gases in the
process of cooling. A model problem first solved, when the temperature has
compact support. Then temperature profile decaying exponentially at large
distances is considered. The periphery of the bubble is shown to remain
essentially static ("glassy") in the process of cooling until it is taken over
by a logarithmically slowly expanding "core". An analytical solution to the
problem is obtained by matched asymptotic expansion. This problem gives an
example of how logarithmic corrections enter dynamic scaling.
