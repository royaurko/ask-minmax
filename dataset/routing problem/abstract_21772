The Cauchy problem to the Fokker-Planck-Boltzmann equation under Grad's
angular cut-off assumption is investigated. When the initial data is a small
perturbation of an equilibrium state, global existence and optimal temporal
decay estimates of classical solutions are established. Our analysis is based
on the coercivity of the Fokker-Planck operator and an elementary weighted
energy method.
