We discuss a number of illuminating results for tight binding models
supporting a band with variable Chern number, and illustrate them explicitly
for a simple class of two-banded models. First, for models with a fixed number
of bands, we show that the minimal hopping range needed to achieve a given
Chern number $C$ is increasing with $C$, and that the band flattening requires
an exponential tail of long-range processes. We further verify that the
entanglement spectrum corresponding to a real-space partitioning contains $C$
chiral modes and thereby complies with the archetypal correspondence between
the bulk entanglement and the edge energetics. Finally, we address the issue of
interactions and study the problem of two interacting particles projected to
the flattened band as a function of the Chern number. Our results provide
valuable insights for the full interacting problem of a partially filled Chern
band at variable filling fractions and Chern numbers.
