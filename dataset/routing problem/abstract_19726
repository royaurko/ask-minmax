A covariant and invariant theory of navigation in curved space-time with
respect to electromagnetic beacons is written in terms of J. L. Synge's
two-point invariant world function. Explicit equations are given for navigation
in space-time in the vicinity of the Earth in Schwarzschild coordinates and in
rotating coordinates. The restricted problem of determining an observer's
coordinate time when their spatial position is known is also considered.
