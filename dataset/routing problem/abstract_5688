In this paper we present a new approach to modeling finite set domain
constraint problems using Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (ROBDDs). We
show that it is possible to construct an efficient set domain propagator which
compactly represents many set domains and set constraints using ROBDDs. We
demonstrate that the ROBDD-based approach provides unprecedented flexibility in
modeling constraint satisfaction problems, leading to performance improvements.
We also show that the ROBDD-based modeling approach can be extended to the
modeling of integer and multiset constraint problems in a straightforward
manner. Since domain propagation is not always practical, we also show how to
incorporate less strict consistency notions into the ROBDD framework, such as
set bounds, cardinality bounds and lexicographic bounds consistency. Finally,
we present experimental results that demonstrate the ROBDD-based solver
performs better than various more conventional constraint solvers on several
standard set constraint problems.
