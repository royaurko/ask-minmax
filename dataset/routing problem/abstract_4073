In this work we establish log-type stability estimates for the inverse
potential and conductivity problems with partial Dirichlet-to-Neumann map,
where the Dirichlet data is homogeneous on the inaccessible part. This result,
to some extent, improves our former result on the partial data problem in which
log-log-type estimates were derived.
