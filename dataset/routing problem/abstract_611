We identify a novel route to the birth of a strange nonchaotic attractor
(SNA) in a quasiperiodically forced electronic circuit with a nonsinusoidal
(square wave) force as one of the quasiperiodic forces through numerical and
experimental studies. We find that bubbles appear in the strands of the
quasiperiodic attractor due to the instability induced by the additional square
wave type force. The bubbles then enlarge and get increasingly wrinkled as a
function of the control parameter. Finally, the bubbles get extremely wrinkled
(while the remaining parts of the strands of the torus remain largely
unaffected) resulting in the birth of the SNA which we term as the
\emph{bubbling route to SNA}. We characterize and confirm this birth from both
experimental and numerical data by maximal Lyapunov exponents and their
variance, Poincar\'e maps, Fourier amplitude spectra and spectral distribution
function. We also strongly confirm the birth of SNA via the bubbling route by
the distribution of the finite-time Lyapunov exponents.
