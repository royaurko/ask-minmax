We discuss a cosmological scenario in which inflation is driven by a
potential which is motivated by an effective Lagrangian approach to gravity. We
exploit the recent arguments \cite{ARZ} that an effective Lagrangian $L_{eff}$
which, by definition, contains operators of arbitrary dimensionality is in
general not a convergent but rather an asymptotic series with factorially
growing coefficients. This behavior of the effective Lagrangian might be
responsible for the resolution of the cosmological constant problem. We argue
that the same behavior of the potential gives a natural realization of the
inflationary scenario.
