It was shown in the recent experiments that the hybrid organic/inorganic
resonant structures can provide a flexible materials platform aimed at the
design of novel light emitting devices. The applications of hybrid structures
for photovoltaic solar cell can also be useful. We pay attention in this note
that the resonant energy transfer in hybrid structure from the organic thin
layer to the semiconductor nanostructures can drastically increase the
intensity of the free carrier generation. To demonstrate this idea we use the
results of recently published paper by Zhang et al., Nature Nanotechnology 2,
555 (2007), demonstrating the highly efficient resonance energy transfer from
J-aggregates layer to semiconductor nanocrystals. It is known that the
semiconductor nanocrystals with small energy gap represent a promising route to
increased solar conversion in single--junction photovoltaic cells. We argue
that the using of nanocrystals with small energy gap in the hybrid
organic/inorganic structures similar to created by Zhang et al. can increase
tens times the total intensity of carrier multiplication. The organic part in
such hybrid structures will play a role of the peculiar organic concentrator of
the light energy.
