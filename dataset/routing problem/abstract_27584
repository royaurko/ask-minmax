For the strictly positive case (the suboptimal case) the maximum entropy
solution $X$ to the Leech problem $G(z)X(z)=K(z)$ and
$\|X\|_\infty=\sup_{|z|\leq 1}\|X(z)\|\leq 1$, with $G$ and $K$ stable rational
matrix functions, is proved to be a stable rational matrix function. An
explicit state space realization for $X$ is given, and $\|X\|_\infty$ turns out
to be strictly less than one. The matrices involved in this realization are
computed from the matrices appearing in a state space realization of the data
functions $G$ and $K$. A formula for the entropy of $X$ is also given.
