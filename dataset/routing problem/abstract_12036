When it is viewed at the scale of a base pair, DNA appears as a nonlinear
lattice. Modelling its properties is a fascinating goal. The detailed
experiments that can be performed on this system impose constraints on the
models and can be used as a guide to improve them. There are nevertheless many
open problems, particularly to describe DNA at the scale of a few tens of base
pairs, which is relevant for many biological phenomena.
