This article is concerned with the mathematical analysis of a class of a
nonlinear fractional Schrodinger equations with a general Hartree-type
integrand. We prove existence and uniqueness of global-in-time solutions to the
associated Cauchy problem. Under suitable assumptions, we also prove the
existence of standing waves using the method of concentration-compactness by
studying the associated constrained minimization problem. Finally we show the
orbital stability of standing waves which are the minimizers of the associate
variational problem.
