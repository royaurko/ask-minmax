We prove that the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm for the metric
Traveling Salesman Problem is $\Theta(\log n)$. Moreover, we prove that the
same result also holds for graphic, Euclidean, and rectilinear instances of the
Traveling Salesman Problem. Finally we show that the approximation ratio of the
Clarke-Wright savings heuristic for the metric Traveling Salesman Problem is
$\Theta(\log n)$.
