Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a widely used tool for the
analysis of high-dimensional data as it automatically extracts sparse and
meaningful features from a set of nonnegative data vectors. We first illustrate
this property of NMF on three applications, in image processing, text mining
and hyperspectral imaging --this is the why. Then we address the problem of
solving NMF, which is NP-hard in general. We review some standard NMF
algorithms, and also present a recent subclass of NMF problems, referred to as
near-separable NMF, that can be solved efficiently (that is, in polynomial
time), even in the presence of noise --this is the how. Finally, we briefly
describe some problems in mathematics and computer science closely related to
NMF via the nonnegative rank.
