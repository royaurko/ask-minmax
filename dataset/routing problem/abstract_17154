We present decentralized rollout sampling policy iteration (DecRSPI) - a new
algorithm for multi-agent decision problems formalized as DEC-POMDPs. DecRSPI
is designed to improve scalability and tackle problems that lack an explicit
model. The algorithm uses Monte- Carlo methods to generate a sample of
reachable belief states. Then it computes a joint policy for each belief state
based on the rollout estimations. A new policy representation allows us to
represent solutions compactly. The key benefits of the algorithm are its linear
time complexity over the number of agents, its bounded memory usage and good
solution quality. It can solve larger problems that are intractable for
existing planning algorithms. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness
and scalability of the approach.
