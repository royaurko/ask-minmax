The problem of solving tropical linear systems, a natural problem of tropical
mathematics, has already proven to be very interesting from the algorithmic
point of view: it is known to be in $NP\cap coNP$ but no polynomial time
algorithm is known, although counterexamples for existing pseudopolynomial
algorithms are (and have to be) very complex.
  In this work, we continue the study of algorithms for solving tropical linear
systems. First, we present a new reformulation of Grigoriev's algorithm that
brings it closer to the algorithm of Akian, Gaubert, and Guterman; this lets us
formulate a whole family of new algorithms, and we present algorithms from this
family for which no known superpolynomial counterexamples work. Second, we
present a family of algorithms for solving overdetermined tropical systems. We
show that for weakly overdetermined systems, there are polynomial algorithms in
this family. We also present a concrete algorithm from this family that can
solve a tropical linear system defined by an $m\times n$ matrix with maximal
element $M$ in time $\Theta\left({m \choose n} \mathrm{poly}\left(m, n, \log
M\right)\right)$, and this time matches the complexity of the best of
previously known algorithms for feasibility testing.
