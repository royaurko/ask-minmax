We propose Minimal Gaugino Mediation as the simplest known solution to the
supersymmetric flavor and CP problems. The framework predicts a very minimal
structure for the soft parameters at ultra-high energies: gaugino masses are
unified and non-vanishing whereas all other soft supersymmetry breaking
parameters vanish. We show that this boundary condition naturally arises from a
small extra dimension and present a complete model which includes a new
extra-dimensional solution to the mu problem. We briefly discuss the predicted
superpartner spectrum as a function of the two parameters of the model. The
commonly ignored renormalization group evolution above the GUT scale is crucial
to the viability of Minimal Gaugino Mediation but does not introduce new model
dependence.
