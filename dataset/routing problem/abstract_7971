The well known Duhamel's principle allows to reduce the Cauchy problem for
linear inhomogeneous partial differential equations to the Cauchy problem for
the corresponding homogeneous equation. In the paper one of the possible
generalizations of the classical Duhamel's principle to the time-fractional
pseudo-differential equations is established.
