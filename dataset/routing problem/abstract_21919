We consider the Dirac equation with a generalized uncertainty principle in
the presence of the Harmonic interaction and an external magnetic field. By
doing the study in the momentum space, the problem solved in an exact
analytical manner and the eigenfucntions reported in terms of the
hypergeometric functions.
