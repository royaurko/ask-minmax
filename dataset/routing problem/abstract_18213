We numerically investigate the case of the planar circular restricted
three-body problem where the more massive primary is an oblate spheroid. A
thorough numerical analysis takes place in the configuration $(x,y)$ and the
$(x,E)$ space in which we classify initial conditions of orbits into three
categories: (i) bounded, (ii) escaping and (iii) collisional. Our results
reveal that the oblateness coefficient has a huge impact on the character of
orbits. Interpreting the collisional motion as leaking in the phase space we
related our results to both chaotic scattering and the theory of leaking
Hamiltonian systems. We successfully located the escape as well as the
collisional basins and we managed to correlate them with the corresponding
escape and collision times. We hope our contribution to be useful for a further
understanding of the escape and collision properties of motion in this
interesting version of the restricted three-body problem.
