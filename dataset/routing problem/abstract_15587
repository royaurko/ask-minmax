The problem of noninteracting electrons in the presence of annealed magnetic
disorder, in addition to nonmagnetic quenched disorder, is considered. It is
shown that the proper physical interpretation of this model is one of electrons
interacting via a potential that is long-ranged in time, and that its technical
analysis by means of renormalization group techniques must also be done in
analogy to the interacting problem. As a result, and contrary to previous
claims, the model does not simply describe a metal-insulator transition in
$d=2+\epsilon$ ($\epsilon\ll 1$) dimensions. Rather, it describes a transition
to a ferromagnetic state that, as a function of the disorder, precedes the
metal-insulator transition close to $d=2$. In $d=3$, a transition from a
paramagnetic metal to a paramagnetic insulator is possible.
