We consider a robust switching control problem. The controller only observes
the evolution of the state process, and thus uses feedback (closed-loop)
switching strategies, a non standard class of switching controls introduced in
this paper. The adverse player (nature) chooses open-loop controls that
represent the so-called Knightian uncertainty, i.e., misspecifications of the
model. The (half) game switcher versus nature is then formulated as a two-step
(robust) optimization problem. We develop the stochastic Perron method in this
framework, and prove that it produces a viscosity sub and supersolution to a
system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) variational inequalities, which
envelope the value function. Together with a comparison principle, this
characterizes the value function of the game as the unique viscosity solution
to the HJB equation, and shows as a byproduct the dynamic programming principle
for robust feedback switching control problem.
