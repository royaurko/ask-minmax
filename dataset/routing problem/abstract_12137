When we talk about databases there have always been problems concerning data
synchronization. The latter is a technique for maintaining consistency among
different copies of data (often called replicas). In general, there is no
universal solution to this problem and often a particular situation requires a
particular approach driven by specific conditions. This paper presents an
approach tackling the issue of data synchronization in a distributed
multi-branch enterprise database. The proposed solution is based on MSMQ
(Microsoft Message Queue), a mechanism for asynchronous messaging.
