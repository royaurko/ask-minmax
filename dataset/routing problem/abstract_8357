We consider existence of periodic boundary value problems of nonlinear second
order ordinary differential equations. Under certain half Lipschitzian type
conditions several existence results are obtained. As applications positive
periodic solutions of some $\phi$-Laplacian type equations and Duffing type
equations are investigated.
