Identifiers (IDs) are pervasive throughout our modern life. We suggest that
these IDs would be easier to manage and remember if they were easily readable,
spellable, and pronounceable. As a solution to this problem we propose using
PRO-nouncable QUINT-uplets of alternating unambiguous consonants and vowels:
_proquints_.
