Recently, a variety of constraint programming and Boolean satisfiability
approaches to scheduling problems have been introduced. They have in common the
use of relatively simple propagation mechanisms and an adaptive way to focus on
the most constrained part of the problem. In some cases, these methods compare
favorably to more classical constraint programming methods relying on
propagation algorithms for global unary or cumulative resource constraints and
dedicated search heuristics. In particular, we described an approach that
combines restarting, with a generic adaptive heuristic and solution guided
branching on a simple model based on a decomposition of disjunctive
constraints. In this paper, we introduce an adaptation of this technique for an
important subclass of job shop scheduling problems (JSPs), where the objective
function involves minimization of earliness/tardiness costs. We further show
that our technique can be improved by adding domain specific information for
one variant of the JSP (involving time lag constraints). In particular we
introduce a dedicated greedy heuristic, and an improved model for the case
where the maximal time lag is 0 (also referred to as no-wait JSPs).
