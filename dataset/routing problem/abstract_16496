We study the interior H\"older regularity problem for weak solutions of the
porous medium equation with external forces. Since the porous medium equation
is the typical example of degenerate parabolic equations, H\"older regularity
is a delicate matter and does not follow by classical methods.
Caffrelli-Friedman, and Caffarelli-Vazquez-Wolansky showed H\"older regularity
for the model equation without external forces. DiBenedetto and Friedman showed
the H\"older continuity of weak solutions with some integrability conditions of
the external forces but they did not obtain the quantitative estimates. The
quantitative estimates are important for studying the perturbation problem of
the porous medium equation. We obtain the scale invariant H\"older estimates
for weak solutions of the porous medium equations with the external forces. As
a particular case, we recover the well known H\"older estimates for the linear
heat equation.
