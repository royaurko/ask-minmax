Following a short discussion of some unresolved issues in the standard model
of cosmology (considered to be a generic $\Lambda$CDM model with flat geometry
and an early period of inflation), we describe the current state of research on
the problem of negative action. Arguments are then given to the effect that
traditional assumptions concerning the behavior of negative action matter give
rise to violations of both the principle of relativity and the principle of
inertia. We propose an alternative set of axioms that would govern the behavior
of negative action matter if it is to be considered a viable element of
physical theories upon which cosmological models are build. We then elaborate a
simple framework, based on general relativity and the proposed axioms, which
enables the formulation of quantitative predictions concerning the interaction
between positive and negative action bodies. Based on those developments, a
solution is proposed to the problem of the discrepancy between current
experimental and theoretical values of vacuum energy density (in any
cosmological model), which is at once also a solution to the problem of the
unexplained coincidence between the (model dependent) experimental values of
vacuum energy density and present day average matter energy density. We also
show how irreversibility naturally arises in cosmological models derived in
this context.
