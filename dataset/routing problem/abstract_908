In VANET high speed is the real characteristics which leads frequent
breakdown, interference etc. In this paper we studied various Ad hoc routing
protocols, Reactive, Proactive & Hybrid, taking into consideration various
VANET parameters like speed, altitude etc in real traffic scenario and
evaluated them for various battery models for energy conservation.. The AODV
and DYMO (Reactive), OLSR (Proactive) and ZRP (hybrid) protocols are compared
for battery models Duracell AA(MX- 1500),Duracell AAA(MN-2400),Duracell
AAA(MX-2400), Duracell C-MN(MN-1400),Panasonic AA standard using Qualnet as a
Simulation tool. Since Energy conservation is main focus area nowadays. Hence
performance of the protocols with various battery models counts and helps to
make a right selection. Varying parameters of VANET shows that in the real
traffic scenarios proactive protocol performs more efficiently for energy
conservation.
