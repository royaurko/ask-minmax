Coevolutionary minimal substrates are simple and abstract models that allow
studying the relationships and codynamics between objective and subjective
fitness. Using these models an approach is presented for defining and analyzing
fitness landscapes of coevolutionary problems. We devise similarity measures of
codynamic fitness landscapes and experimentally study minimal substrates of
test--based and compositional problems for both cooperative and competitive
interaction.
