It is shown that isotropic cosmology in the Riemann-Cartan spacetime allows
to solve the problem of cosmological singularity as well as the problems of
invisible matter components - dark energy and dark matter. All cosmological
models filled with usual gravitating matter satisfying energy dominance
conditions are regular with respect to energy density, spacetime metrics and
the Hubble parameter. At asymptotics cosmological solutions of spatially flat
models describe accelerating Universe without dark energy and dark matter, and
quantitatively their behaviour is identical to that of standard cosmological
\Lambda CDM-model.
