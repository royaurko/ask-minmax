Demand outstrips available resources in most situations, which gives rise to
competition, interaction and learning. In this article, we review a broad
spectrum of multi-agent models of competition (El Farol Bar problem, Minority
Game, Kolkata Paise Restaurant problem, Stable marriage problem, Parking space
problem and others) and the methods used to understand them analytically. We
emphasize the power of concepts and tools from statistical mechanics to
understand and explain fully collective phenomena such as phase transitions and
long memory, and the mapping between agent heterogeneity and physical disorder.
As these methods can be applied to any large-scale model of competitive
resource allocation made up of heterogeneous adaptive agent with non-linear
interaction, they provide a prospective unifying paradigm for many scientific
disciplines.
