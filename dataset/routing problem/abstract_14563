A recent heuristic argument based on basic concepts in spectral analysis
showed that the twin prime conjecture and a few other related primes counting
problems are valid. A rigorous version of the spectral method, and a proof of
the more general dePolignac conjecture on the existence of infinitely many
primes pairs p and p + 2k, k => 1, is proposed in this note.
