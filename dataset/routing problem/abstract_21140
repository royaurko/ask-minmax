In this note we develop tools to study the Cauchy problem for the system of
thermo-elasticity in higher dimensions. The theory is developed for general
homogeneous anisotropic media under non-degeneracy conditions.
  For degenerate cases a method of treatment is sketched and for the cases of
cubic media and hexagonal media detailed studies are provided.
