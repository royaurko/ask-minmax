To improve photometric precision by removing blending effect, a newly
developed technique of difference image analysis (DIA) is adopted by several
gravitational microlensing experiment groups. However, the principal problem of
the DIA method is that, by its nature, it has difficulties in measuring the
baseline flux $F_0$ of a source star, causing degeneracy problem in determining
the lensing parameters of an event. Therefore, it is often believed that the
DIA method is not as powerful as the classical method based on the PSF
photometry in determining the Einstein time scales $t_{\rm E}$ of events.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that the degeneracy problem in microlensing
events detectable from the searches by using the DIA method will not be as
serious as it is often worried about. This is because a substantial fraction of
events will be high amplification events for which the deviations of the
amplification curves constructed with the wrong baseline fluxes from their
corresponding best-fit standard amplification curves will be considerable even
for a small amount of the fractional baseline flux deviation $\Delta F_0/F_0$.
With a model luminosity function of source stars and under realistic
observational conditions, we find that $\sim 30%$ of detectable Galactic bulge
events are expected to have high amplifications and their baseline fluxes can
be determined with uncertainties $\Delta F_0/F_0\leq 0.5$.
