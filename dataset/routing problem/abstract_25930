The Pentagon Model is an explicit supersymmetric extension of the Standard
Model, which involves a new strongly-interacting SU(5) gauge theory at
TeV-scale energies. We show that the Pentagon can be embedded into an SU(5) x
SU(5) x SU(5) gauge group at the GUT scale. The doublet-triplet splitting
problem, and proton decay compatible with experimental bounds, can be
successfully addressed in this context. The simplest approach fails to provide
masses for the lighter two generations of quarks and leptons; however, this
problem can be solved by the addition of a pair of antisymmetric tensor fields
and an axion.
