The problem of entropy S and baryon number N_B conservation in phase
transitions from deconfined phases (QGP and Q) to hadronic matter H is
considered. It is shown that standard construction of both first order phase
transitions, H-Q as well as Q-QGP implies a discontinuous structure of entropy
per baryon S/N_B when crossing phase boundary; this results in impossibility of
equilibrium transition from QGP to hadron gas.
  We follow the way suggested recently by H. Satz et al. for the same problem
concerning direct transition H-QGP. They proposed a modification of bag
pressure parameter B_{QGP} by making it dependent on system temperature T and
baryon chemical potential mu; this modification has been demonstrated to be
sufficient to provide S/N_B conservation.
  Here we show that within DPTM such a modification turns out to be necessary
and sufficient for bag pressure B_Q in the Q phase only. The DPTM modified in
such a way is shown to satisfy equilibrium Gibbs criteria for phase
transitions. Location of phase boundaries in $\mu -T$ plane has been
demonstrated to be changed but slightly; the modification tells mainly on
baryon number density within Q phase. Two alternative descriptions of
nucleon-nucleon interaction - the Hard Core Model and the Mean Field
Approximation - have been tested; the results for both cases appeared to be
similar. All the results are shown to be stable against rather broad variations
of model parameters.
