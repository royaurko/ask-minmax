In this paper we prove uniqueness for an inverse boundary value problem
(IBVP) arising in electrodynamics. We assume that the electromagnetic
properties of the medium, namely the magnetic permeability, the electric
permittivity and the conductivity, are described by continuously differentiable
functions.
