We construct 2x2-matrix linear problems with a spectral parameter for the
Painleve equations I-V by means of the degeneration processes from the elliptic
linear problem for the Painleve VI equation. These processes supplement the
known degeneration relations between the Painleve equations with the
degeneration scheme for the associated linear problems. The degeneration
relations constructed in this paper are based on the trigonometric, rational,
and Inozemtsev limits.
