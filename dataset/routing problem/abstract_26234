The problem of the interaction between the precessing mildly relativistic
radio jets of SS433 and an ambient medium has been often invoked in
interpretations of the jets behaviour. The dynamical interaction could be
responsible for disagreements between the kinematic model and observations of
the jets. To estimate the relative ram pressure of the jet and impinging matter
we used the profile along the radio jets of brightness of synchrotron
radiation. From this we estimated magnitude of possible deceleration and
twisting of the jets, and compare model locus of the jets with observations.
The magnitude is enough big to be observed, that addresses an applicability of
the kinematic model, based mostly on the optical observations, to the radio
jets and a problem of the kinematic distance to the object in particular.
