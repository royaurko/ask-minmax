We point out that the recent WMAP findings of a suppressed large scale power
in the Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropy power spectrum, if of
cosmological origin, make the case for a new cosmic coincidence problem.The
observed suppression of anisotropies at large angles requires an explanation
for why this suppression is occuring {\it only} for perturbation wavelengths of
the order of our present Hubble horizon. This is a very challenging task since
a consistent model for the emerging picture of the universe has to address any
cosmic coincidence and thus may reveal a deeper inter-relation with the dark
energy problem.
