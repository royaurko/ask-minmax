In the framework of the effective field theory for interacting BFKL pomerons,
applied to nucleus-nucleus scattering, boundary conditions for the classical
field equations are discussed. Correspondence with the QCD diagrams at the
boundary rapidities requires pomeron interaction with the participating nuclei
to be exponential and non-local. Commonly used 'eikonal' boundary conditions,
local and linear in fields, follow in the limit of small QCD pomeron-nucleon
coupling. Numerical solution of the classical field equations, which sum all
tree diagrams for central gold-gold scattering, demonstrates that corrected
boundary conditions lead to substantially different results, as compared to the
eikonal conditions studied in earlier publications. A breakdown of
projectile-target symmetry for particular solutions discovered earlier in
  \cite{bom} is found to occur at roughly twice lower rapidity. Most important,
due to a high non-linearity of the problem, the found asymmetric solutions are
not unique but form a family growing in number with rapidity. The minimal value
for the action turns out to be much lower than with the eikonal boundary
conditions and saturates at rapidities around 10.
