We study the problem of transforming one list (vertex) coloring of a graph
into another list coloring by changing only one vertex color assignment at a
time, while at all times maintaining a list coloring, given a list of allowed
colors for each vertex. This problem is known to be PSPACE-complete for
bipartite planar graphs. In this paper, we first show that the problem remains
PSPACE-complete even for bipartite series-parallel graphs, which form a proper
subclass of bipartite planar graphs. We note that our reduction indeed shows
the PSPACE-completeness for graphs with pathwidth two, and it can be extended
for threshold graphs. In contrast, we give a polynomial-time algorithm to solve
the problem for graphs with pathwidth one. Thus, this paper gives precise
analyses of the problem with respect to pathwidth.
