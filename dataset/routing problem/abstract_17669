Pride (1994, Phys. Rev. B 50 15678-96) derived the governing model of
electroseismic conversion, in which Maxwell's equations are coupled with Biot's
equations through an electrokinetic mobility parameter. The inverse problem of
electroseismic conversion was first studied by Chen and Yang (2013, Inverse
Problem 29 115006). By following the construction of Complex Geometrical Optics
(CGO) solutions to a matrix \Schrodinger equation introduced by Ola and
Somersalo (1996, SIAM J. Appl. Math. 56 No. 4 1129-1145), we analyze the
reconstruction of conductivity, permittivity and the electrokinetic mobility
parameter in Maxwell's equations with internal measurements, while allowing the
magnetic permeability $\mu$ to be a variable function. We show that knowledge
of two internal data sets associated with well-chosen boundary electric sources
uniquely determines these parameters. Moreover, a Lipschitz-type stability is
obtained based on the same set.
