We prove a Wiener energy estimate for relaxed Dirichlet problems $Lu + \mu u
=\nu$ in $\Omega$, with $L$ an uniformly elliptic operator with bounded
coefficients, $\mu$ a measure of ${\cal M}_0(\Omega)$, $\nu$ a Kato measure and
$\Omega$ a bounded open set of ${\bf R}^N$, $N \geq 2$. Choosing a particular
$\mu$, we obtain an energy estimate also for classical variational Dirichlet
problems.
