In this paper, we consider the following graph partitioning problem: The
input is an undirected graph $G=(V,E),$ a balance parameter $b \in (0,1/2]$ and
a target conductance value $\gamma \in (0,1).$ The output is a cut which, if
non-empty, is of conductance at most $O(f),$ for some function $f(G, \gamma),$
and which is either balanced or well correlated with all cuts of conductance at
most $\gamma.$ Spielman and Teng gave an $\tilde{O}(|E|/\gamma^{2})$-time
algorithm for $f= \sqrt{\gamma \log^{3}|V|}$ and used it to decompose graphs
into a collection of near-expanders. We present a new spectral algorithm for
this problem which runs in time $\tilde{O}(|E|/\gamma)$ for $f=\sqrt{\gamma}.$
Our result yields the first nearly-linear time algorithm for the classic
Balanced Separator problem that achieves the asymptotically optimal
approximation guarantee for spectral methods. Our method has the advantage of
being conceptually simple and relies on a primal-dual semidefinite-programming
SDP approach. We first consider a natural SDP relaxation for the Balanced
Separator problem. While it is easy to obtain from this SDP a certificate of
the fact that the graph has no balanced cut of conductance less than $\gamma,$
somewhat surprisingly, we can obtain a certificate for the stronger correlation
condition. This is achieved via a novel separation oracle for our SDP and by
appealing to Arora and Kale's framework to bound the running time. Our result
contains technical ingredients that may be of independent interest.
