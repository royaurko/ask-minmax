We show that the procedure of regularizing the real part of the euclidean
action, while leaving the imaginary part unregularized, leads to a non-analytic
and highly singular functional of the fields. It is customary to work with an
imaginary time component of the vector field, in order to avoid regularization
of the anomalous processes. We show that this procedure is flawed by the fact
that a stationary point of the action occurs for a real, not imaginary, time
component of the vector field. Furthermore the action in the vicinity of the
stationary point is singular. The regularized action is thus not suitable for
an evaluation of the partition function using a saddle point method. We discuss
proposed solutions to this problem, as well as other regularizations. They all
lead to practical problems.
