The optimal fluctuation approach is applied to study the most distant
(non-universal) tails of the free-energy distribution function P(F) for an
elastic string (of a large but finite length L) interacting with a quenched
random potential. A further modification of this approach is proposed which
takes into account the renormalization effects and allows one to study the most
close (universal) parts of the tails. The problem is analyzed for different
dimensions of a space in which the polymer is imbedded. In terms the stochastic
growth problem, the same distribution function describes the distribution of
heights in the regime of a non-stationary growth in a situation when an
interface starts to grow from a flat configuration.
