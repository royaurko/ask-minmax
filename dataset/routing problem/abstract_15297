When reasoning about the strategic capabilities of an agent, it is important
to consider the nature of its adversaries. In the particular context of
controller synthesis for quantitative specifications, the usual problem is to
devise a strategy for a reactive system which yields some desired performance,
taking into account the possible impact of the environment of the system. There
are at least two ways to look at this environment. In the classical analysis of
two-player quantitative games, the environment is purely antagonistic and the
problem is to provide strict performance guarantees. In Markov decision
processes, the environment is seen as purely stochastic: the aim is then to
optimize the expected payoff, with no guarantee on individual outcomes.
  In this expository work, we report on recent results introducing the beyond
worst-case synthesis problem, which is to construct strategies that guarantee
some quantitative requirement in the worst-case while providing an higher
expected value against a particular stochastic model of the environment given
as input. This problem is relevant to produce system controllers that provide
nice expected performance in the everyday situation while ensuring a strict
(but relaxed) performance threshold even in the event of very bad (while
unlikely) circumstances. It has been studied for both the mean-payoff and the
shortest path quantitative measures.
