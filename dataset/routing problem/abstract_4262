We calculate the WKB series for the angular momentum and the
non--relativistic 3-dim Kepler problem. This is the first semiclassical
treatment of the angular momentum for terms beyond the leading WKB
approximation. We explain why the torus quantization (the leading WKB term) of
the full problem is exact, even if the individual torus quantization of the
angular momentum and of the radial Kepler problem separately is not exact.
