This paper presents a comparison of cluster-based position and non
position-based routing protocols for mobile wireless sensor networks to outline
design considerations of protocols for mobile environments. The selected
protocols are compared on the basis of multiple parameters, which include
packet delivery ratio, packet loss, network lifetime, and control overhead
using variable number of nodes and speeds. The extensive simulation and
analysis of results show that position-based routing protocols incur less
packet loss as compared to the non position based protocols. However,
position-based protocols require localization mechanism or a GPS for the
location information, which consumes energy and affects the network lifetime.
Alternatively, non position-based protocols are more energy efficient and
provide extended network lifetime.
