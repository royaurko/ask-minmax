Spatial search problems abound in the real world, from locating hidden
nuclear or chemical sources to finding skiers after an avalanche. We exemplify
the formalism and solution for spatial searches involving two agents that may
or may not choose to share information during a search. For certain classes of
tasks, sharing information between multiple searchers makes cooperative
searching advantageous. In some examples, agents are able to realize synergy by
aggregating information and moving based on local judgments about maximal
information gathering expectations. We also explore one- and two-dimensional
simplified situations analytically and numerically to provide a framework for
analyzing more complex problems. These general considerations provide a guide
for designing optimal algorithms for real-world search problems.
