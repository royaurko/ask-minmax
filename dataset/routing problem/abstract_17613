One-Counter nets (OCN) consist of a nondeterministic finite control and a
single integer counter that cannot be fully tested for zero. They form a
natural subclass of both One-Counter Automata, which allow zero-tests and Petri
Nets/VASS, which allow multiple such weak counters.
  The trace inclusion problem has recently been shown to be undecidable for
OCN. In this paper, we contrast the complexity of two natural restrictions
which imply decidability.
  First, we show that trace inclusion between an OCN and a deterministic OCN is
NL-complete, even with arbitrary binary-encoded initial counter-values as part
of the input. Secondly, we show Ackermannian completeness of for the trace
universality problem of nondeterministic OCN. This problem is equivalent to
checking trace inclusion between a finite and a OCN-process.
