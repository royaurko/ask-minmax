We show that hyperbolicity is a necessary condition for the well posedness of
the noncharacteristic Cauchy problem for nonlinear partial differential
equations. We give conditions on the initial data which are necessary for the
existence of solutions and we analyze Hadamard's instabilities in Sobolev
spaces. We also show that genuinely nonlinear equations raise new interesting
problems.
