We consider the free boundary problem for the plasma-vacuum interface in
ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In the plasma region the flow is
governed by the usual compressible MHD equations, while in the vacuum region we
consider the pre-Maxwell dynamics for the magnetic field. At the free-interface
we assume that the total pressure is continuous and that the magnetic field is
tangent to the boundary. The plasma density does not go to zero continuously at
the interface, but has a jump, meaning that it is bounded away from zero in the
plasma region and it is identically zero in the vacuum region. Under a suitable
stability condition satisfied at each point of the plasma-vacuum interface, we
prove the well-posedness of the linearized problem in conormal Sobolev spaces.
