The paper deals with the homogenization of reaction-diffusion equations with
large reaction terms in a multi-scale porous medium. We assume that the
fractures and pores are equidistributed and that the coefficients of the
equations are periodic. Using the multi-scale convergence method, we derive a
homogenization result whose limit problem is defined on a fixed domain and is
of convection-diffusion-reaction type.
