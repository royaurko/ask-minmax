This Ph.D. thesis, prepared under the supervision of Prof. Alexander
Olevskii, is concerned with some problems in two areas of Fourier Analysis:
uniqueness theory of trigonometric expansions, and the theory of translation
invariant subspaces in function spaces. Our main result in the first area
extends to $\ell_q$ spaces ($q > 2$) a deep phenomenon found by
Piatetski-Shapiro in 1954 for the space $c_0$. The approach we developed also
enabled us to get a result in the second mentioned area, which a priori does
not look connected with the first one. The result (maybe, a bit surprising) is:
one cannot characterize the functions in $\ell_p(\Z)$ or $L^p(\R)$, $1 < p <
2$, whose translates span the whole space, by the zero set of their Fourier
transform. This should be contrasted against the classical Wiener theorems
related to the cases $p=1,2$.
