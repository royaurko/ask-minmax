Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA) and Genetic Local Search (GLS) are two
optimization algorithms that have been successfully applied to the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP). In this paper we define new crossover operator then
redefine ACAs ants as operate according to defined crossover operator then put
forward our GLS that uses these ants to solve Symmetric TSP (STSP) instances.
