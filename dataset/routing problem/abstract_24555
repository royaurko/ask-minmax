The present paper constructs three new systems of clarithmetic (arithmetic
based on computability logic --- see http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html):
CLA8, CLA9 and CLA10. System CLA8 is shown to be sound and extensionally
complete with respect to PA-provably recursive time computability. This is in
the sense that an arithmetical problem A has a t-time solution for some
PA-provably recursive function t iff A is represented by some theorem of CLA8.
System CLA9 is shown to be sound and intensionally complete with respect to
constructively PA-provable computability. This is in the sense that a sentence
X is a theorem of CLA9 iff, for some particular machine M, PA proves that M
computes (the problem represented by) X. And system CLA10 is shown to be sound
and intensionally complete with respect to not-necessarily-constructively
PA-provable computability. This means that a sentence X is a theorem of CLA10
iff PA proves that X is computable, even if PA does not "know" of any
particular machine M that computes X.
