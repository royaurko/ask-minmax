We study algorithmic aspects of bending wires and sheet metal into a
specified structure. Problems of this type are closely related to the question
of deciding whether a simple non-self-intersecting wire structure (a
carpenter's ruler) can be straightened, a problem that was open for several
years and has only recently been solved in the affirmative.
  If we impose some of the constraints that are imposed by the manufacturing
process, we obtain quite different results. In particular, we study the variant
of the carpenter's ruler problem in which there is a restriction that only one
joint can be modified at a time. For a linkage that does not self-intersect or
self-touch, the recent results of Connelly et al. and Streinu imply that it can
always be straightened, modifying one joint at a time. However, we show that
for a linkage with even a single vertex degeneracy, it becomes NP-hard to
decide if it can be straightened while altering only one joint at a time. If we
add the restriction that each joint can be altered at most once, we show that
the problem is NP-complete even without vertex degeneracies.
  In the special case, arising in wire forming manufacturing, that each joint
can be altered at most once, and must be done sequentially from one or both
ends of the linkage, we give an efficient algorithm to determine if a linkage
can be straightened.
