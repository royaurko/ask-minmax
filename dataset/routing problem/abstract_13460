The mixed problem for the implicit degenerating nonlinear parabolic equation
is considered, and the solvability and behavior of solutions of this problem
are studied. Furthermore, some classes of function spaces and their relations
with Sobolev spaces are investigated, embedding and compactness theorems for
these spaces are proved
