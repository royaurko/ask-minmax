Let $(M^n,g),~n\ge 3$ be a noncompact complete Riemannian manifold with
compact boundary and $f$ a smooth function on $\partial M$. In this paper we
show that for a large class of such manifolds, there exists a metric within the
conformal class of $g$ that is complete, has zero scalar curvature on $M$ and
has mean curvature $f$ on the boundary. The problem is equivalent to finding a
positive solution to an elliptic equation with a non-linear boundary condition
with critical Sobolev exponent.
