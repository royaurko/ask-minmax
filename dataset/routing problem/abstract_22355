This paper is devoted to the convergence analysis of the Adini element scheme
for the fourth order problem in arbitrary dimension. We prove that, the Adini
element scheme is $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ order convergent in energy norm provided
the exact solution is in $H^4$, and the convergence rate in $L^2$ norm can not
be nontrivially higher than $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ order. Numerical verifications
are presented.
