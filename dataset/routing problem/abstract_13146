Simple models of irreversible dynamical processes such as Bootstrap
Percolation have been successfully applied to describe cascade processes in a
large variety of different contexts. However, the problem of analyzing
non-typical trajectories, which can be crucial for the understanding of the
out-of-equilibrium phenomena, is still considered to be intractable in most
cases. Here we introduce an efficient method to find and analyze optimized
trajectories of cascade processes. We show that for a wide class of
irreversible dynamical rules, this problem can be solved efficiently on
large-scale systems.
