For an elliptic complex of first order differential operators on a smooth
manifold, we define a system of two equations which can be thought of as
abstract Maxwell equations. The formal theory of this system proves to be very
similar to that of classical Maxwell's equations. The paper focuses on boundary
value problems for the abstract Maxwell equations, especially on the Cauchy
problem.
