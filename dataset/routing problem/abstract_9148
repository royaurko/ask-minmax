The inflow problem of full compressible Navier-Stokes equations is considered
on the half line $(0,+\infty)$. Firstly, we give the existence (or
non-existence) of the boundary layer solution to the inflow problem when the
right end state $(\rho_+,u_+,\theta_+)$ belongs to the subsonic, transonic and
supersonic regions respectively. Then the asymptotic stability of not only the
single contact wave but also the superposition of the boundary layer solution,
the contact wave and the rarefaction wave to the inflow problem are
investigated under some smallness conditions. Note that the amplitude of the
rarefaction wave can be arbitrarily large. The proofs are given by the
elementary energy method.
