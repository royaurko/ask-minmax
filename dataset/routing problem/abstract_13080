The Humbert-Bessel are multi-index functions with various applications in
electromagnetism. New families of functions sharing some similarities with
Bessel functions are often introduced in the mathematical literature, but at a
closer analysis they are not new, in the strict sense of the word, and are
shown to be expressible in terms of already discussed forms. This is indeed the
case of the re-modified Bessel functions, whose properties have been analyzed
within the context of coincidence problems in probability theory. In this paper
we show that these functions are particular cases of the Humbert-Bessel ones.
