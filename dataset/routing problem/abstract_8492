We consider inverse scattering problems for the three-dimensional Hartree
equation. We prove that if the unknown interaction potential $V(x)$ of the
equation satisfies some rapid decay condition, then we can uniquely determine
the exact value of $\partial_\xi^\alpha \hat{V}(0)$ for any multi-index
$\alpha$ by the knowledge of the scattering operator for the equation.
Furthermore, we show some stability estimate for identifying
$\partial_\xi^\alpha \hat{V}(0)$.
