Lattice fermions with suppressed high momentum modes solve the ultraviolet
slowing down problem in lattice QCD. This paper describes a stochastic
evaluation of the effective action of such fermions. The method is a based on
the Lanczos algorithm and it is shown to have the same complexity as in the
case of standard fermions.
