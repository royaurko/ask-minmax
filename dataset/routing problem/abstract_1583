This paper presents a digital VLSI design flow to create secure, side-channel
attack (SCA) resistant integrated circuits. The design flow starts from a
normal design in a hardware description language such as VHDL or Verilog and
provides a direct path to a SCA resistant layout. Instead of a full custom
layout or an iterative design process with extensive simulations, a few key
modifications are incorporated in a regular synchronous CMOS standard cell
design flow. We discuss the basis for side-channel attack resistance and adjust
the library databases and constraints files of the synthesis and place & route
procedures accordingly. Experimental results show that a DPA attack on a
regular single ended CMOS standard cell implementation of a module of the DES
algorithm discloses the secret key after 200 measurements. The same attack on a
secure version still does not disclose the secret key after more than 2000
measurements.
