A pseudo-Newtonian Hill problem based on a potential proposed by Artemova et
al. [Astroph. J. 461 (1996) 565] is presented. This potential reproduces some
of the general relativistic effects due to the spin angular momentum of the
bodies, like the dragging of inertial frames. Poincare maps, Lyapunov exponents
and fractal escape techniques are employed to study the stability of bounded
and unbounded orbits for different spins of the central body.
