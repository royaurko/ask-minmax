In Bender and Dokuchaev (2013), we studied a control problem related to swing
option pricing in a general non-Markovian setting. The main result there shows
that the value process of this control problem can be uniquely characterized in
terms of a first order backward SPDE and a pathwise differential inclusion. In
the present paper we additionally assume that the cashflow process of the swing
option is left-continuous in expectation (LCE). Under this assumption we show
that the value process is continuously differentiable in the space variable
that represents the volume which the holder of the option can still exercise
until maturity. This gives rise to an existence and uniqueness result for the
corresponding backward SPDE in a classical sense. We also explicitly represent
the space derivative of the value process in terms of a nonstandard optimal
stopping problem over a subset of predictable stopping times. This
representation can be applied to derive a dual minimization problem in terms of
martingales.
