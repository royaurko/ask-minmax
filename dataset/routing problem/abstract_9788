We propose the Assembly Line Worker Integration and Balancing Problem
(ALWIBP), a new assembly line balancing problem arising in lines with
conventional and disabled workers. The goal of this problem is to maintain high
productivity levels by minimizing the number of workstations needed to reach a
given output, while integrating in the assembly line a number of disabled
workers. Being able to efficiently manage a heterogeneous workforce is
especially important in the current social context where companies are urged to
integrate disabled workers. In this paper we present mathematical models and
heuristics that can help assembly line managers to cope with this additional
complexity; demonstrating by means of a robust benchmark how this integration
can be done with losses of productivity that are much lower than expected.
