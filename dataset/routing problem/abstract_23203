Monte Carlo simulations of systems with a complex action are known to be
extremely difficult. A new approach to this problem based on a factorization
property of distribution functions of observables has been proposed recently.
The method can be applied to any system with a complex action, and it
eliminates the so-called overlap problem completely. We test the new approach
in a Random Matrix Theory for finite density QCD, where we are able to
reproduce the exact results for the quark number density. The achieved system
size is large enough to extract the thermodynamic limit. Our results provide a
clear understanding of how the expected first order phase transition is induced
by the imaginary part of the action.
