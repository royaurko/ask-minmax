An exact, number-conserving solution to the generalized, orbit-dependent
pairing problem is derived by introducing an infinite-dimensional algebra. A
method for obtaining eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the corresponding
Hamiltonian is also given. The relevance of the orbit-dependent pairing
solution is demonstrated by comparing predictions of the model with shell-model
calculations.
