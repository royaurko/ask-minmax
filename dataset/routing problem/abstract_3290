In this paper we study the truncated operator trigonometric moment problem.
All solutions of the moment problem are described by a Nevanlinna-type
parameterization. In the case of moments acting in a separable Hilbert space,
the matrices of the operator coefficients in the Nevanlinna-type formula are
calculated by the prescribed moments. Conditions for the determinacy of the
moment problem are given, as well.
