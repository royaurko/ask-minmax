The phenomenon of a partial 2H\rightarrow1T phase transition within
multiwalled WS2 nanotubes under substitutional Rhenium doping is discovered by
means of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Using
density-functional calculations for the related MoS2 compound we consider a
possible origin of this phase transition, which was known formerly only for WS2
and MoS2 intercalated by alkali metals. An interplay between the stability of
layered or nanotubular forms of 2H and 1T allotropes is found to be intimately
related with their electronic structures and electro-donating ability of an
impurity.
