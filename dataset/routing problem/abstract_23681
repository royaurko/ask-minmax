We study the question of well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for
Schr\"odinger maps from $\rone \times \rtwo$ to the sphere $\stwo$ or to
${\mathbb H^2}$, the hyperbolic space. The idea is to choose an appropriate
gauge change so that the derivatives of the map will satisfy a certain
nonlinear Schr\"odinger system of equations and then study this modified
Schr\"odinger map system (MSM). We then prove local well posedness of the
Cauchy problem for the MSM with minimal regularity assumptions on the data and
outline a method to derive well posedness of the Schr\"odinger map itself from
it. In proving well posedness of the MSM, the heart of the matter is resolved
by considering truly quatrilinear forms of weighted $L^2$ functions.
