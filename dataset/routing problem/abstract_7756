Recent developments of the resonant neutrino spin-flavor precession scenario
and its applications to the solar neutrino problem are reviewed. We discuss in
particular the possibilities of reconciliation of strong time variations of the
solar neutrino flux observed in the Homestake ${}^{37}\$Cl experiment with
little or no time variation seen in the Kamiokande II experiment.
