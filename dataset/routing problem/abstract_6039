In this paper, we study a class of approximation problems, appearing in data
approximation and signal processing. The approximations are constructed as
combinations of polynomial splines (piecewise polynomials), whose parameters
are subject to optimisation, and so called prototype functions, whose choice is
based on the application, rather than optimisation. The corresponding
optimisation problems can be formulated as Linear Least Squares Problems
(LLSPs). If the system matrix is non-singular, then the corresponding problem
can be solved using the normal equations method, while for singular cases
slower (but more robust) methods have to be used. In this paper we develop
sufficient conditions for non-singularity. These conditions can be verified
much faster than the direct singularity verification of the system matrices.
Therefore, the algorithm efficiency can be improved by choosing a better suited
method for solving the corresponding LLSPs.
