We address the problem of the gauge fixing versus Gribov copies in lattice
gauge theories. For the Landau gauge, results show that a suitable combination
of evolutionary algorithms with traditional steepest descent methods identifies
the global maximum of the optimisation function. We discuss the performance of
the combined algorithm on small cubic lattices for SU(2) and SU(3).
