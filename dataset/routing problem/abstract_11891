Binary decision theory has been applied to the general interferometric
problem. Optimal detection scheme-according to the Neyman-Pearson
criterion-has been considered for different phase-enhanced states of
radiation field, and the corresponding bounds on minimum detectable phase shift
has been evaluated. A general bound on interferometric precision has been also
obtained in terms of photon number fluctuations of the signal mode carrying the
phase information.
