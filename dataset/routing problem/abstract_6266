We adapt a technique of nonsmooth critical point theory developed by
Degiovanni-Zani for a semilinear problem involving the Laplacian to the the
case of the $p$-Laplacian. We suppose only coercivity conditions on the
potential and impose no growth condition of the nonlinearity. The coercivity is
obtained using similar nonresonance conditions to [Mawhin-Ward-Willem] and to
[Landesman-Lazer] in two different results and using some comparison functions
and comparison spaces in a third one. It is also shown that neither of the
three theorems implies the two others.
