We demonstrate that solving the classical problems mentioned in the title on
quadrature domains when the given boundary data is rational is as simple as the
method of partial fractions. A by-product of our considerations will be a
simple proof that the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on a double quadrature domain
sends rational functions on the boundary to rational functions on the boundary.
The results extend to more general domains if rational functions are replaced
by the class of functions on the boundary that extend meromorphically to the
double.
