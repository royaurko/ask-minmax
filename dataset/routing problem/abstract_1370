We describe the arrival time measurements and timing modeling of the periodic
radio flares and optical brightness variations of the M9 ultracool dwarf, TVLM
513-46546. We confirm the stability of the observed period and determine its
best-fit value to be 7054.468(+/-)0.007 s over the last 7 years, based on both
the new and archival radio observations and the archival optical data. The
period, when measured separately for the radio flare and the optical
periodicities, is the same to within (+/-)0.02 s. We show that the radio flares
are out of phase with respect to the optical brightness maxima by 0.41(+/-)0.02
of the period. Our analysis also reveals that, on shorter timescales, the
period varies with the amplitude of (+/-)1-2 s about its long-term average and
that these variations are correlated between the radio and the optical
wavelengths. These results provide further evidence that TVLM 513-46546 is
equipped with a stable, approximately dipolar magnetic field which powers the
activity of the star observed over a wide wavelength range, and that the active
area has been maintaining its identity and positional stability over no less
than 7 years. A stepwise decline of the apparent radio flaring period of TVLM
513-46546 deduced from timing observations with the Arecibo radio telescope in
late 2012 and early 2013 suggests that this effect may be the manifestation of
differential rotation of the star.
