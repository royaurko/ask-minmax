We obtain a series of new results on the problem of irreducibility of
commuting varieties associated with symmetric pairs or, in other words,
$Z_2$-graded simple Lie algebras. In particular, we present many examples of
reducible commuting varieties and show that the number of irreducible
components can be arbitrarily large.
