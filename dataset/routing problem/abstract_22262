A wheel is a graph that consists of a chordless cycle of length at least 4
plus a vertex with at least three neighbors on the cycle. It was shown recently
that detecting induced wheels is an NP-complete problem. In contrast, it is
shown here that graphs that contain no wheel and no antiwheel have a very
simple structure and consequently can be recognized in polynomial time.
