A Schur ring (S-ring) over a group $G$ is called separable if every of its
similaritities is induced by isomorphism. We establish a criterion for an
S-ring to be separable in the case when the group $G$ is cyclic. Using this
criterion, we prove that any S-ring over a cyclic $p$-group is separable and
that the class of separable circulant S-rings is closed with respect to
duality.
