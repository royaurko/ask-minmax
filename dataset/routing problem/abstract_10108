It is known that the unified transform method may be used to solve any
well-posed initial-boundary value problem for a linear constant-coefficient
evolution equation on the finite interval or the half-line. In contrast,
classical methods such as Fourier series and transform techniques may only be
used to solve certain problems. The solution representation obtained by such a
classical method is known to be an expansion in the eigenfunctions or
generalised eigenfunctions of the self-adjoint ordinary differential operator
associated with the spatial part of the initial-boundary value problem. In this
work, we emphasise that the unified transform method may be viewed as the
natural extension of Fourier transform techniques for non-self-adjoint
operators. Moreover, we investigate the spectral meaning of the transform pair
used in the new method; we discuss the recent definition of a new class of
spectral functionals and show how it permits the diagonalisation of certain
non-self-adjoint spatial differential operators.
