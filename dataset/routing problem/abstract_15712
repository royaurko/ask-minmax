We show that the vacuum expectation value of the inflaton at the Peccei-Quinn
axion scale can generate the supersymmetric Higgs mass $\mu$ term. This
provides an inflationary simultaneous solution to the strong CP problem and the
$\mu$ problem of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, and gives a
testable prediction for the $\mu$ parameter: $\mu^2 \approx (0.25-0.5)m_0^2$,
where $m_0$ is the soft Higgs scalar mass. Our model involves a very small
Yukawa coupling of order $10^{-10}$, which could originate from an
extra-dimensional scenario or type I string theory.
