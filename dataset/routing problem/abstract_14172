In this paper we define and study the billiard problem on bounded regions on
surfaces of constant curvature. We show that this problem defines a
2-dimensional conservative and reversible dynamical system, defined by a Twist
diffeomorphism, if the boundary of the region is an oval. Using these
properties and defining good perturbations for billiards, we show that having
only a finite number of nondegenerate periodic orbits for each fixed period is
an open and dense property. We finish this paper by studying the stability of
these nondegenerate orbits.
