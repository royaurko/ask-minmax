We give a precise definition of ``generic-case complexity'' and show that for
a very large class of finitely generated groups the classical decision problems
of group theory - the word, conjugacy and membership problems - all have
linear-time generic-case complexity. We prove such theorems by using the theory
of random walks on regular graphs.
