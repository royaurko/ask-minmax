In recent years, there has been a growing interest in geometric evolution in
heterogeneous media. Here we consider curvature driven fows of planar curves,
with an additional space-dependent forcing term. Motivated by a homogenization
problem, we look for estimates which depend only on the uniform norm of the
forcing term. By means of an asymptotic analysis, we discuss the properties of
the limit solutions of the homogenization problem, which we can rigorously
solve in some special cases: that is, when the initial curve is a graph, and
the forcing term does not depend on the vertical direction. As a by-product, in
such cases we are able to define a soluton of the geometric evolution when the
forcing term is just a bounded, not necessarily continuous, function.
