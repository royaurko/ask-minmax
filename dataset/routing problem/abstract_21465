Landau's theory of electron motion in stationary magnetic fields is extended
to the inclusion of bouncing along the field between mirror points in an
inhomogeneous field. The problem can be treated perturbation theoretically. As
expected, bouncing is quantized, causes a weak shift in Landau levels, reduces
parallel degeneracy, but does not contribute to diamagnetism.
