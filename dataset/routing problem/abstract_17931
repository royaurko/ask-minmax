This paper defines a new problem, The Dead Cryptographers Society Problem -
DCS (where several great cryptographers created many polynomial-time
Deterministic Turing Machines (DTMs), ran them on their proper descriptions
concatenated with some arbitrary strings, deleted them and leaved only the
results from those running, after they dyed: if those DTMs only permute the
bits on input, is it possible to decide the language formed by such resulting
strings within polynomial time?), proves some facts about its computational
complexity, and discusses some possible uses on Cryptography, such as into
distance keys distribution, online reverse auction and secure communication.
