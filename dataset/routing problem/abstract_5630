We settle a long-standing open question in algorithmic game theory. We prove
that Bimatrix, the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium in a two-player game,
is complete for the complexity class PPAD Polynomial Parity Argument, Directed
version) introduced by Papadimitriou in 1991.
  This is the first of a series of results concerning the complexity of Nash
equilibria. In particular, we prove the following theorems:
  Bimatrix does not have a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme unless
every problem in PPAD is solvable in polynomial time. The smoothed complexity
of the classic Lemke-Howson algorithm and, in fact, of any algorithm for
Bimatrix is not polynomial unless every problem in PPAD is solvable in
randomized polynomial time. Our results demonstrate that, even in the simplest
form of non-cooperative games, equilibrium computation and approximation are
polynomial-time equivalent to fixed point computation. Our results also have
two broad complexity implications in mathematical economics and operations
research: Arrow-Debreu market equilibria are PPAD-hard to compute. The P-Matrix
Linear Complementary Problem is computationally harder than convex programming
unless every problem in PPAD is solvable in polynomial time.
