We study the reverse mathematics and computability of countable graph theory,
obtaining the following results. The principle that every countable graph has a
connected component is equivalent to $\mathsf{ACA}_0$ over $\mathsf{RCA}_0$.
The problem of decomposing a countable graph into connected components is
strongly Weihrauch equivalent to the problem of finding a single component, and
each is equivalent to its infinite parallelization. For graphs with finitely
many connected components, the existence of a connected component is either
provable in $\mathsf{RCA}_0$ or is equivalent to induction for $\Sigma^0_2$
formulas, depending on the formulation of the bound on the number of
components.
