We investigate the equivalence of different operator-splitting schemes for
the integration of the Langevin equation. We consider a specific problem, so
called the directed percolation process, which can be extended to a wider class
of problems. We first give a compact mathematical description of the
operator-splitting method and introduce two typical splitting schemes that will
be useful in numerical studies. We show that the two schemes are essentially
equivalent through the map that turns out to be an automorphism. An associated
equivalent class of operator-splitting integrations is also defined by
generalizing the specified equivalence.
