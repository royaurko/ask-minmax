We prove that general correlation functions of both ratios and products of
characteristic polynomials of Hermitian random matrices are governed by
integrable kernels of three different types: a) those constructed from
orthogonal polynomials; b) constructed from Cauchy transforms of the same
orthogonal polynomials and finally c) those constructed from both orthogonal
polynomials and their Cauchy transforms. These kernels are related with the
Riemann-Hilbert problem for orthogonal polynomials. For the correlation
functions we obtain exact expressions in the form of determinants of these
kernels. Derived representations enable us to study asymptotics of correlation
functions of characteristic polynomials via Deift-Zhou
steepest-descent/stationary phase method for Riemann-Hilbert problems, and in
particular to find negative moments of characteristic polynomials. This reveals
the universal parts of the correlation functions and moments of characteristic
polynomials for arbitrary invariant ensemble of $\beta=2$ symmetry class.
