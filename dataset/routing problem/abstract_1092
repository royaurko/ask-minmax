As the formation of spatial optical solitons in photorefractive media is
governed by modification of the refractive index every single solitons in
complex configurations of solitons can act as a single waveguide for other
light beams. In this article we demonstrate guiding of amplitude modulated
beams in complex configurations of photorefractive solitons carrying
information and we analyze the received signal in the kHz frequency range. The
possibility of data transmission combined with waveguide couplers opens the
route to all-optical networks.
