Recently, several researchers have found that cost-based satisficing search
with A* often runs into problems. Although some "work arounds" have been
proposed to ameliorate the problem, there has been little concerted effort to
pinpoint its origin. In this paper, we argue that the origins of this problem
can be traced back to the fact that most planners that try to optimize cost
also use cost-based evaluation functions (i.e., f(n) is a cost estimate). We
show that cost-based evaluation functions become ill-behaved whenever there is
a wide variance in action costs; something that is all too common in planning
domains. The general solution to this malady is what we call a surrogatesearch,
where a surrogate evaluation function that doesn't directly track the cost
objective, and is resistant to cost-variance, is used. We will discuss some
compelling choices for surrogate evaluation functions that are based on size
rather that cost. Of particular practical interest is a cost-sensitive version
of size-based evaluation function -- where the heuristic estimates the size of
cheap paths, as it provides attractive quality vs. speed tradeoffs
