We solve the problem of finding optimal entire approximations of prescribed
exponential type (unrestricted, majorant and minorant) for a class of truncated
and odd functions with a shifted exponential subordination, minimizing the
$L^1(\R)$-error. The class considered here includes new examples such as the
truncated logarithm and truncated shifted power functions. This paper is the
counterpart of the works of Carneiro and Vaaler (Some extremal functions in
Fourier analysis, Part II in Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 362 (2010), 5803-5843;
Part III in Constr. Approx. 31, No. 2 (2010), 259--288), where the analogous
problem for even functions was treated.
