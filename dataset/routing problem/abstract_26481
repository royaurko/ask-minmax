In this work, we show the convergence of adaptive lowest-order FEM (AFEM) for
an elliptic obstacle problem with non-homogeneous Dirichlet data, where the
obstacle \chi\ is restricted only by \chi\ in H^2(\Omega). The adaptive loop is
steered by some residual based error estimator introduced in Braess, Carstensen
& Hoppe (2007) that is extended to control oscillations of the Dirichlet data,
as well. In the spirit of Cascon et al. (2008), we show that a weighted sum of
energy error, estimator, and Dirichlet oscillations satisfies a contraction
property up to certain vanishing energy contributions. This result extends the
analysis of Braess, Carstensen & Hoppe (2007) and Page & Praetorius (2010) to
the case of non-homogeneous Dirichlet data as well as certain non-affine
obstacles and introduces some energy estimates to overcome the lack of
nestedness of the discrete spaces.
