The Memento aggregator currently polls every known public web archive when
serving a request for an archived web page, even though some web archives focus
on only specific domains and ignore the others. Similar to query routing in
distributed search, we investigate the impact on aggregated Memento TimeMaps
(lists of when and where a web page was archived) by only sending queries to
archives likely to hold the archived page. We profile twelve public web
archives using data from a variety of sources (the web, archives' access logs,
and full-text queries to archives) and discover that only sending queries to
the top three web archives (i.e., a 75% reduction in the number of queries) for
any request produces the full TimeMaps on 84% of the cases.
