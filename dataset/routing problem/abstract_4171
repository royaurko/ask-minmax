In a singular potential setting, we generalize a method which allows to show
that minimizers under topological constraints of the action functional (or of
the Maupertuis') are collision-free. This methods applies to $3$-dimensional
problems of celestial mechanics exhibiting a particular cylindrical symmetry,
as well as to planar problems of $N$-centre type, where it gives optimal
results.
