Astronomical instruments generally possess spatially variant point-spread
functions, which determine the amount by which an image pixel is blurred as a
function of position. Several techniques have been devised to handle this
variability in the context of the standard image deconvolution problem. We have
developed an iterative gravitational lens modeling code called Mirage that
determines the parameters of pixelated source intensity distributions for a
given lens model. We are able to include the effects of spatially variant
point-spread functions using the iterative procedures in this lensing code. In
this paper, we discuss the methods to include spatially variant blurring
effects and test the results of the algorithm in the context of gravitational
lens modeling problems.
