A formalism is given to count integer and rational solutions to polynomial
equations with rational coefficients. These polynomials $P(x)$ are
parameterized by three integers, labeling an elliptic curve. The counting of
the rational solutions to $y^2=P(x)$ is facilitated by another elliptic curve
with integral coefficients. The problem of counting is described by two
elliptic curves and a map between them.
