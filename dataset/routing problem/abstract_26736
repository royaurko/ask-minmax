An important problem in analytic and geometric combinatorics is estimating
the number of lattice points in a compact convex set in a Euclidean space. Such
estimates have numerous applications throughout mathematics. In this note, we
exhibit applications of a particular estimate of this sort to several counting
problems in number theory: counting integral points and units of bounded height
over number fields, counting points of bounded height over positive definite
quaternion algebras, and counting points of bounded height with a fixed support
over global function fields. Our arguments use a collection of height
comparison inequalities for heights over a number field and over a quaternion
algebra. We also show how these inequalities can be used to obtain existence
results for points of bounded height over a quaternion algebra, which
constitute non-commutative analogues of variations of the classical Siegel's
lemma and Cassels' theorem on small zeros of quadratic forms.
