We present a fast multiscale approach for the network minimum logarithmic
arrangement problem. This type of arrangement plays an important role in a
network compression and fast node/link access operations. The algorithm is of
linear complexity and exhibits good scalability which makes it practical and
attractive for using on large-scale instances. Its effectiveness is
demonstrated on a large set of real-life networks. These networks with
corresponding best-known minimization results are suggested as an open
benchmark for a research community to evaluate new methods for this problem.
