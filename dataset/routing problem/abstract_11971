The proper support of generalized parton distributions from relativistic
constituent quark models with pointlike constituents is studied. The correct
support is guaranteed when the vertex function does not depend on the relative
minus-momentum. We show that including quark interactions in models with
pointlike constituent quarks might lead to a support problem. A computation of
the magnitude of the support problem in the Bonn relativistic constituent quark
model is presented.
