A wide range of multi-agent coordination problems including reference
tracking and disturbance rejection requirements can be formulated as a
cooperative output regulation problem. The general framework captures typical
problems such as output synchronization, leader-follower synchronization, and
many more. In the present paper, we propose a novel distributed regulator for
groups of identical and non-identical linear agents. We consider global
external signals affecting all agents and local external signals affecting only
individual agents in the group. Both signal types may contain references and
disturbances. Our main contribution is a novel coupling among the agents based
on their transient state components or estimates thereof in the output feedback
case. This coupling achieves transient synchronization in order to improve the
cooperative behavior of the group in transient phases and guarantee a desired
decay rate of the synchronization error. This leads to a cooperative reaction
of the group on local disturbances acting on individual agents. The
effectiveness of the proposed distributed regulator is illustrated by a vehicle
platooning example and a coordination example for a group of four non-identical
3-DoF helicopter models.
