The mathematical model describing the natural textrm{pH}-gradient arising
under the action of an electric field in an aqueous solution of ampholytes
(amino acids) is constructed and investigated. This paper is the second part of
the series papers \cite{Part1,Part3,Part4} that are devoted to pH-gradient
creation problem. We present the numerical solution of the stationary problem.
The equations system has a small parameter at higher derivatives and the
turning points, so called stiff problem. To solve this problem numerically we
use the shooting method: transformation of the boundary value problem to the
Cauchy problem. At large voltage or electric current density we compare the
numerical solution with weak solution presented in Part 1.
