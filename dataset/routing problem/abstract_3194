The reader-writer-problem is a standard problem in concurrent programming. A
resource is shared by several processes which need either inclusive reading or
exclusive writing access. The known solutions to this problem typically involve
a number of global counters and queues. Here a very simple algorithm is
presented which needs only two semaphores for synchronisation and no other
global objects. The approach yields a fair solution without starving.
