In the literature, the definition of product in a Software Product Line (SPL)
is based upon the notion of consistency of the constraints, imposed by
variability and traceability relations on the elements of the SPL. In this
paper, we contend that consistency does not model the natural semantics of the
implementability relation between problem and solution spaces correctly.
Therefore, we define when a feature can be {\em derived} from a set of
components . Using this, we define a product of the SPL by a <specification,
architecture> pair, where all the features in the specification are derived
from the components in the architecture. This notion of derivability is
formulated in a simple yet expressive, abstract model of a productline with
traceability relation. We then define a set of SPL analysis problems and show
that these problems can be encoded as Quantified Boolean Formulas. Then, QSAT
solvers like QUBE can be used to solve the analysis problems. We illustrate the
methodology on a small fragment of a realistic productline.
