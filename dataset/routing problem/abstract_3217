The inverse problem for the Sturm- Liouville operator with complex periodic
potential and positive discontinuous coefficients on the axis is studied. Main
characteristics of the fundamental solutions are investigated, the spectrum of
the operator is studied. We give formulation of the inverse problem, prove a
uniqueness theorem and provide a constructive procedure for the solution of the
inverse problem
