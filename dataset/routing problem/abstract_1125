LuFe2O4 exhibits multiferroicity due to charge order on a frustrated
triangular lattice. We find that the magnetization of LuFe2O4 in the
multiferroic state can be electrically controlled by applying voltage pulses.
Depending on with or without magnetic fields, the magnetization can be
electrically switched up or down. We have excluded thermal heating effect and
attributed this electrical control of magnetization to an intrinsic
magnetoelectric coupling in response to the electrical breakdown of charge
ordering. Our findings open up a new route toward electrical control of
magnetization.
