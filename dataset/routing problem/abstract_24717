The present work deals with the two-dimensional incompressible,laminar,
steady-state boundary layer equations. First, we determinea family of velocity
distributions outside the boundary layer suchthat these problems may have
similarity solutions. Then, we examenin detail new exact solutions, called
Pseudo--similarity, where the external velocity varies inversely-linear with
the distance along the surface $ (U_e(x) = U_\infty x^{-1}). The present work
deals with the two-dimensional incompressible, laminar, steady-state boundary
layer equations. First, we determine a family of velocity distributions outside
the boundary layer such that these problems may have similarity solutions.
Then, we examenin detail new exact solutions. The analysis shows that solutions
exist only for a lateral suction. For specified conditions, we establish the
existence of an infinite number of solutions, including monotonic solutions and
solutions which oscillate an infinite number of times and tend to a certain
limit. The properties of solutions depend onthe suction parameter. Furthermore,
making use of the fourth--order Runge--Kutta scheme together with the shooting
method, numerical solutions are obtained.
