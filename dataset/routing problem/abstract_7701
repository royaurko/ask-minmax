We study numerically the ground state properties of the Cooper problem in the
three-dimensional Anderson model. It is shown that attractive interaction
creates localized pairs in the metallic noninteracting phase. This localization
is destroyed at sufficiently weak disorder. The phase diagram for the
delocalization transition in the presence of disorder and interaction is
determined.
