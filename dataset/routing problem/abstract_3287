The orbit problem is at the heart of symmetry reduction methods for model
checking concurrent systems. It asks whether two given configurations in a
concurrent system (represented as finite strings over some finite alphabet) are
in the same orbit with respect to a given finite permutation group (represented
by their generators) acting on this set of configurations by permuting indices.
It is known that the problem is in general as hard as the graph isomorphism
problem, which is widely believed to be not solvable in polynomial time. In
this paper, we consider the restriction of the orbit problem when the
permutation group is cyclic (i.e. generated by a single permutation), an
important restriction of the problem. Our main result is a linear-time
algorithm for this subproblem. Our result can also be construed as a
substantial improvement of Kannan-Lipton's polynomial-time solution to the
orbit problem over rational matrices when restricted to permutation matrices.
To complement this result, we delineate the boundary of tractability by showing
that permutation groups generated by two permutations already suffice to make
the orbit problem as hard as the graph isomorphism problem.
