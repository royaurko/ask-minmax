Although recovering an Euclidean distance matrix from noisy observations is a
common problem in practice, how well this could be done remains largely
unknown. To fill in this void, we study a simple distance matrix estimate based
upon the so-called regularized kernel estimate. We show that such an estimate
can be characterized as simply applying a constant amount of shrinkage to all
observed pairwise distances. This fact allows us to establish risk bounds for
the estimate implying that the true distances can be estimated consistently in
an average sense as the number of objects increases. In addition, such a
characterization suggests an efficient algorithm to compute the distance matrix
estimator, as an alternative to the usual second order cone programming known
not to scale well for large problems. Numerical experiments and an application
in visualizing the diversity of Vpu protein sequences from a recent HIV-1 study
further demonstrate the practical merits of the proposed method.
