We consider linear and quadratic integrals of motion for general variable
quadratic Hamiltonians. Fundamental relations between the eigenvalue problem
for linear dynamical invariants and solutions of the corresponding Cauchy
initial value problems for the time-dependent Schroedinger equation are
emphasized. An eigenfunction expansionof the solution of the initial value
problem is also found. A nonlinear superposition principle for the generalized
Ermakov systems is established as a result of decomposition of the general
quadratic invariant in terms of the linear ones.
