We give a proper fractional extension of the classical calculus of
variations. Necessary optimality conditions of Euler-Lagrange type for
variational problems containing both classical and fractional derivatives are
proved. The fundamental problem of the calculus of variations with mixed
integer and fractional order derivatives as well as isoperimetric problems are
considered.
