We introduce a toy model, which represents a simplified version of the
problem of the depinning transition in the limit of strong disorder. This toy
model can be formulated as a simple renormalization transformation for the
probability distribution of a single real variable. For this toy model, {the
critical line is known exactly in one particular case} and it can be calculated
perturbatively in the general case. One can also show that, at the transition,
there is no strong disorder fixed distribution accessible by renormalization.
Instead, both our numerical and analytic approaches indicate a transition of
infinite order (of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type). We give numerical
evidence that this infinite order transition persists for the problem of the
depinning transition with disorder on the hierarchical lattice.
