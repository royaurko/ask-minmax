We consider the problem of characterizing finite sets which tile the integers
by translations. Coven and Meyerowitz (J. Algebra 1999) found necessary and
sufficient conditions for a finite set A to tile the integers under the
assumption that |A| has at most 2 distinct prime factors. The purpose of this
article is to settle, for the first time, certain three-prime cases.
