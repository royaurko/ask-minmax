The aim of this paper is to study the obstacle problem with an elliptic
operator having degenerate coercivity. We prove the existence of an entropy
solution to the obstacle problem under the assumption of $L^{1}-$summability on
the data. Meanwhile, we prove that every entropy solution belongs to some
Sobolev space $W^{1,q}(\Omega)$.
