An asymptotic stability result for parabolic semilinear problems in
$L_2(\Omega)$ and interpolation spaces is shown. Some known results about
stability in $W^{1,2}(\Omega)$ are improved for semilinear parabolic mixed
boundary value problems. The approach is based on Amann's power extrapolation
scales. In a Hilbert space setting, a better understanding of this approach is
provided for operators satisfying Kato's square root problem; as a side result
some equivalent characterizations of these operators are obtained.
