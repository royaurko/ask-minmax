Steady-state and transient antiplane dynamic processes in a structured solids
consisting of uniform periodic square-cell lattices connected by a lattice
layer of different bond stiffnesses and point masses are analyzed. A
semi-infinite lattice covered by a layer is also considered. Localization
phenomena that are characterized by a waveguide-like propagation along the
layer direction and exponential attenuation along its normal are studied.
Waveguide pass-bands and attenuation factors are obtained analytically, while
transient processes developed under the action of a monochromatic local source
are numerically simulated. As a result, it is shown how a two-dimensional
problem is transformed with time into a quasi-one-dimensional one and how a
layer traps the source energy. Special attention is paid to revealing
particularities of transient waves in cases where steady-state solutions are
absent: resonant waves with frequencies demarcating pass- and stop-bands at the
ends of the Brillouin zone and wave transition in the vicinities of transition
points in dispersion curves. In the latter case, a simultaneous onset of
different localization phenomena - a spatial star-like beaming and a
one-dimensional waveguide-like localization - is shown.
