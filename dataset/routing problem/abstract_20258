The study of embedded minimal surfaces in $\RR^3$ is a classical problem,
dating to the mid 1700's, and many people have made key contributions. We will
survey a few recent advances, focusing on joint work with Tobias H. Colding of
MIT and Courant, and taking the opportunity to focus on results that have not
been highlighted elsewhere.
