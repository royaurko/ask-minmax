*** Note the comment above ***
  This is a special issue dedicated to the announcement of Shelah's recent
solution of the Minimal Tower problem, one of the oldest and most important
problems in infinite combinatorics which also motivated some new studies in SPM
(see fourth issue of this bulletin). We give some background and personal
perspectives on the problem and its solution.
  We decided not to include additional research announcements in this issue, so
to let them draw the attention they deserve in the coming issue.
  This issue also contains an interesting new problem which is related to the
Minimal Tower problem (but still open).
