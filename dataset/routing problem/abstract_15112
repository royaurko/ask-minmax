A complete classification of the computational complexity of the fixed-point
existence problem for boolean dynamical systems, i.e., finite discrete
dynamical systems over the domain {0, 1}, is presented. For function classes F
and graph classes G, an (F, G)-system is a boolean dynamical system such that
all local transition functions lie in F and the underlying graph lies in G. Let
F be a class of boolean functions which is closed under composition and let G
be a class of graphs which is closed under taking minors. The following
dichotomy theorems are shown: (1) If F contains the self-dual functions and G
contains the planar graphs then the fixed-point existence problem for (F,
G)-systems with local transition function given by truth-tables is NP-complete;
otherwise, it is decidable in polynomial time. (2) If F contains the self-dual
functions and G contains the graphs having vertex covers of size one then the
fixed-point existence problem for (F, G)-systems with local transition function
given by formulas or circuits is NP-complete; otherwise, it is decidable in
polynomial time.
