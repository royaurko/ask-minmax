The warm inflation paradigm considers the continuous production of radiation
during inflation due to dissipative effects. In its strong dissipation limit,
warm inflation gives way to a radiation dominated Universe. High scale
inflation then yields a high reheating temperature, which then poses a severe
gravitino overproduction problem for the supersymmetric realisations of warm
inflation. In this paper we show that in certain class of supersymmetric models
the dissipative dynamics of the inflaton is such that the field can avoid its
complete decay after inflation. In some cases, the residual energy density
stored in the field oscillations may come to dominate over the radiation bath
at a later epoch. If the inflaton field finally decays much later than the
onset of the matter dominated phase, the entropy produced in its decay may be
sufficient to counteract the excess of gravitinos produced during the last
stages of warm inflation.
