Two cubic equations and three auxiliary equations for edges and face
diagonals of a rational perfect cuboid have been recently derived. They
constitute a background for two inverse problems. The coefficients of cubic
equations and the right hand sides of auxiliary equations are rational
functions of two rational parameters, i. e. they have denominators. Hence the
inverse problems have singular points. These singular points are studied in the
present paper.
