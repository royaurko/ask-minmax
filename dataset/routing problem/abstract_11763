The dispersionless limit of the scalar nonlocal dbar-problem is derived. It
is given by a special class of nonlinear first-order equations. A
quasi-classical version of the dbar-dressing method is presented. It is shown
that the algebraic formulation of dispersionless hierarchies can be expressed
in terms of properties of Beltrami tupe equations. The universal Whitham
hierarchy and, in particular, the dispersionless KP hierarchy turn out to be
rings of symmetries for the quasi-classical dbar-problem.
