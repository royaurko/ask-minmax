We report on the development of a test-particle based kinetic Monte Carlo
code for large systems and its application to simulate matter in the continuum
regime. Our code combines advantages of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo and
the Point-of-Closest-Approach methods to solve the collision integral of the
Boltzmann equation. With that, we achieve a high spatial accuracy in
simulations while maintaining computational feasibility when applying a large
number of test-particles. The hybrid setup of our approach allows us to study
systems which move in and out of the hydrodynamic regime, with low and high
particle densities. To demonstrate our code's ability to reproduce hydrodynamic
behavior we perform shock wave simulations and focus here on the Sedov blast
wave test. The blast wave problem describes the evolution of a spherical
expanding shock front and is an important verification problem for codes which
are applied in astrophysical simulation, especially for approaches which aim to
study core-collapse supernovae.
