We consider the problem of the persistence of invariant curves for analytical
fibered holomorphic transformations. We define a fibered rotation number
associated to an invariant curve. We show that an invariant curve with a
prescribed fibered rotation number persists under small perturbations on the
dynamics provided that the pair of rotation numbers verifies a Brjuno type
arithmetical condition.
