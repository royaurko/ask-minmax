Hawking ``thermal'' radiation could be a means to detect black holes of
micron sizes, which may be hovering through the universe. We consider these
micro-black holes to be distorted by the presence of some distribution of
matter representing a convolution factor for their Hawking radiation. One may
hope to determine from their Hawking signals the temperature distribution of
their material shells by the inverse black body problem. In 1990, Nan-xian Chen
has used a so-called modified M\"{o}bius transform to solve the inverse black
body problem. We discuss and apply this technique to Hawking radiation of
distorted micro-black holes. Some comments on supersymmetric applications of
M\"{o}bius function and transform are also added.
