The problem of target localization with ideal binary detectors is considered
in one dimensional space. The problem is investigated in both a censored and
non-censored scheme. In the censored setting, the problem is equivalent to
estimating the center of a uniform distribution by knowing samples of data. It
does not admit an MVU estimator according to the previous results of
Lehmann-Sheffe. However, it is proven that if the radius of detection is known
and sensor deployment region is very large, both censored and non-censored
cases will have an MVU estimator among the functions that are invariant to
Euclidean motion. In addition, it is shown that when the radius of detection is
not known, the censored case still has an MVU estimator whereas in the
non-censored case, an MVU estimator does not exist, even under the assumption
that the estimators are invariant to Euclidean motion.
