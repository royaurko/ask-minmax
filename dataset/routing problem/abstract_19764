The supposed information paradox for black holes is based on the fundamental
misunderstanding that black holes are usefully defined by event horizons.
Understood in terms of locally defined trapping horizons, the paradox
disappears: information will escape from an evaporating black hole. According
to classical properties of trapping horizons, a general scenario is outlined
whereby a black hole evaporates completely without singularity, event horizon
or loss of energy or information.
