In [1], Theorem 3, the contributors proved, in one dimension, a generalization of
the Hopf Lemma, and the question arose if it could be extended to higher
dimensions. In this paper we present two conjectures as possible extensions,
and give a very partial answer. We write this paper to call attention to the
problem.
