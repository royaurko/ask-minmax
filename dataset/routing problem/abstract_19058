We consider the interference management problem in a multicell MIMO
heterogenous network. Within each cell there are a large number of distributed
micro/pico base stations (BSs) that can be potentially coordinated for joint
transmission. To reduce coordination overhead, we consider user-centric BS
clustering so that each user is served by only a small number of (potentially
overlapping) BSs. Thus, given the channel state information, our objective is
to jointly design the BS clustering and the linear beamformers for all BSs in
the network. In this paper, we formulate this problem from a {sparse
optimization} perspective, and propose an efficient algorithm that is based on
iteratively solving a sequence of group LASSO problems. A novel feature of the
proposed algorithm is that it performs BS clustering and beamformer design
jointly rather than separately as is done in the existing approaches for
partial coordinated transmission. Moreover, the cluster size can be controlled
by adjusting a single penalty parameter in the nonsmooth regularized utility
function. The convergence of the proposed algorithm (to a local optimal
solution) is guaranteed, and its effectiveness is demonstrated via extensive
simulation.
