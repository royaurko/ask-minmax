The process of un-reduction, a sort of reversal of reduction by the Lie group
symmetries of a variational problem, is explored in the setting of field
theories. This process is applied to the problem of curve matching in the
plane, when the curves depend on more than one independent variable. This
situation occurs in a variety of instances such as matching of surfaces or
comparison of evolution between species. A discussion of the appropriate
Lagrangian involved in the variational principle is given, as well as some
initial numerical investigations.
