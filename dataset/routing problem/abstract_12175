Certain complex-contour (a.k.a. quantum-toboggan) generalizations of
Schroedinger's bound-state problem are reviewed and studied in detail. Our key
message is that the practical numerical solution of these atypical eigenvalue
problems may perceivably be facilitated via an appropriate complex change of
variables which maps their multi-sheeted complex domain of definition to a
suitable single-sheeted complex plane.
