We study threshold properties of random constraint satisfaction problems
under a probabilistic model due to Molloy. We give a sufficient condition for
the existence of a sharp threshold that leads (for boolean constraints) to a
necessary and sufficient for the existence of a sharp threshold in the case
where constraint templates are applied with equal probability, solving thus an
open problem of Creignou and Daude.
