Relativistic radiative transfer problems require the calculation of photon
trajectories in curved spacetime. We present a novel technique for rapid and
accurate calculation of null geodesics in the Kerr metric. The equations of
motion from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation are reduced directly to Carlson's
elliptic integrals, simplifying algebraic manipulations and allowing all
coordinates to be computed semi-analytically for the first time. We discuss the
method, its implementation in a freely available FORTRAN code, and its
application to toy problems from the literature.
