In this paper, we propose a new notion of Forward--Backward Martingale
Problem (FBMP), and study its relationship with the weak solution to the
forward--backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). The FBMP extends
the idea of the well-known (forward) martingale problem of Stroock and
Varadhan, but it is structured specifically to fit the nature of an FBSDE. We
first prove a general sufficient condition for the existence of the solution to
the FBMP. In the Markovian case with uniformly continuous coefficients, we show
that the weak solution to the FBSDE (or equivalently, the solution to the FBMP)
does exist. Moreover, we prove that the uniqueness of the FBMP (whence the
uniqueness of the weak solution) is determined by the uniqueness of the
viscosity solution of the corresponding quasilinear PDE.
