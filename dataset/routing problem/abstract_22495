The origin of the chemical composition of the intracluster medium (ICM) is
discussed in this paper. In particular, the contribution from Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) to the ICM enrichment is shown to exist by adopting the
fitting formulas which have been used in the analysis of the solar system
abundances. Our analysis means that we can use the frequency of SNe Ia relative
to SNe II as the better measure than $M_{Fe, SN Ia}/M_{Fe, total}$ for
estimating the contribution of SNe Ia. Moreover, the chemical compositions of
ICMs are shown to be similar to that of the solar system abundances. We can
also reproduce the sulfur/iron abundance ratio within a factor of 2, which
means that the abundance problem of sulfur needs not to be emphasized too
strongly. We need more precise observations to conclude whether ICMs really
suffer the shortage problem of sulfur or not.
