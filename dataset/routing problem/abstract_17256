Data fusion allows the elaboration and the evaluation of a situation
synthesized from low level informations provided by different kinds of sensors.
The fusion of the collected data will result in fewer and higher level
informations more easily assessed by a human operator and that will assist him
effectively in his decision process. In this paper we present the suitability
and the advantages of using a Possibilistic Assumption based Truth Maintenance
System (n-ATMS) in a data fusion military application. We first describe the
problem, the needed knowledge representation formalisms and problem solving
paradigms. Then we remind the reader of the basic concepts of ATMSs,
Possibilistic Logic and 11-ATMSs. Finally we detail the solution to the given
data fusion problem and conclude with the results and comparison with a
non-possibilistic solution.
