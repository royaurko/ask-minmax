The cardinal concept of TCP development was to carry data within the network
where network congestion plays a vital role to cause packet loss. On the other
hand, there are several other reasons to lose packets in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks
due to fading, interfaces, multi-path routing, malicious node, and black hole.
Along with throughput, fairness of TCP protocols is important to establish a
good communication. In this paper, an empirical study has been done by
simulation and analysis of TCP variations under AODV routing protocol. In our
simulation, we studied multiple variations of TCP, such as Reno, New-Reno,
Vegas, and Tahoe. The simulation work has been done in NS2 environment. Based
on the analysis simulation result of we carried out our observations with
respect to the behavior of AODV routing protocol for different TCP packets
under several QoS metrics such as drop, throughput, delay, and jitter.
