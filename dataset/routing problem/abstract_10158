We formalize and analyze a new automata-theoretic problem termed control
improvisation. Given an automaton, the problem is to produce an improviser, a
probabilistic algorithm that randomly generates words in its language, subject
to two additional constraints: the satisfaction of an admissibility predicate,
and the exhibition of a specified amount of randomness. This problem has proved
useful, for example, in generating musical improvisations that satisfy rhythmic
and melodic constraints, where admissibility is determined by some bounded
divergence from a reference melody. We analyze the complexity of the control
improvisation problem, giving cases where it is efficiently solvable and cases
where it is #P-hard or undecidable. We also show how symbolic techniques based
on SAT solvers can be used to approximately solve some of the intractable
cases.
