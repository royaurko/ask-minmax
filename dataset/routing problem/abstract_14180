We investigate elementary properties of successive radii in generalized
Minkowski spaces (that is, with respect to gauges), i.e., we measure the "size"
of a given convex set in a finite-dimensional real vector space with respect to
another convex set. This is done via formulating some kind of minimal
containment problems, where intersections or Minkowski sums of the latter set
and affine flats of a certain dimension are incorporated. Since this is
strongly related to minimax location problems and to the notions of diametrical
completeness and constant width, we also have a look at ball intersections and
ball hulls.
