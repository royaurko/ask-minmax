We propose a tomographic method to reconstruct the optical properties of a
highly-scattering medium from incoherent acousto-optic measurements. The method
is based on the solution to an inverse problem for the diffusion equation and
makes use of the principle of interior control of boundary measurements by an
external wave field.
