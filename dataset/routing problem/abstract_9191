Many decision procedures for SMT problems rely more or less implicitly on an
instantiation of the axioms of the theories under consideration, and differ by
making use of the additional properties of each theory, in order to increase
efficiency. We present a new technique for devising complete instantiation
schemes on SMT problems over a combination of linear arithmetic with another
theory T. The method consists in first instantiating the arithmetic part of the
formula, and then getting rid of the remaining variables in the problem by
using an instantiation strategy which is complete for T. We provide examples
evidencing that not only is this technique generic (in the sense that it
applies to a wide range of theories) but it is also efficient, even compared to
state-of-the-art instantiation schemes for specific theories.
