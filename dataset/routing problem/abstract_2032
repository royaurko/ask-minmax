In this paper, we propose a mechanism for packet marking called Probabilistic
Congestion Notification (PCN). This scheme makes use of the 1-bit Explicit
Congestion Notification (ECN) field in the Internet Protocol (IP) header. It
allows the source to estimate the exact level of congestion at each
intermediate queue. By knowing this, the source could take avoiding action
either by adapting its sending rate or by using alternate routes. The
estimation mechanism makes use of time series analysis both to improve the
quality of the congestion estimation and to predict, ahead of time, the
congestion level which subsequent packets will encounter.
  The proposed protocol is tested in ns-2 simulator using a background of real
Internet traffic traces. Results show that the methods can successfully
calculate the congestion at any queue along the path with low error levels.
