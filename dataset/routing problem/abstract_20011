We write the Hamiltonian for a gravitational spherically symmetric scalar
field collapse with massive scalar field source, and we discuss the application
of Wheeler De Witt equation as well as the appearence of time in this context.
Using an Ansatz for Wheeler De Witt equation, solutions are discussed including
the appearence of time evolution.
