Recently, Kane and Lubensky proposed a mapping between bosonic phonon
problems on isostatic lattices to chiral fermion systems based on factorization
of the dynamical matrix [Nat. Phys. 10, 39 (2014)]. The existence of
topologically protected zero modes in such mechanical problems is related to
their presence in the fermionic system and is dictated by a local index
theorem. Here we adopt the proposed mapping to construct a two-dimensional
mechanical analogue of a fermionic topological nodal semimetal that hosts a
robust bulk node in its linearized phonon spectrum. Such topologically
protected soft modes with tunable wavevector may be useful in designing
mechanical structures with fault-tolerant properties.
