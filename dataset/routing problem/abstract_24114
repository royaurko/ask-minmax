Canonical matrices are given for
  (a) bilinear forms over an algebraically closed or real closed field;
  (b) sesquilinear forms over an algebraically closed field and over real
quaternions with any nonidentity involution; and
  (c) sesquilinear forms over a field F of characteristic different from 2 with
involution (possibly, the identity) up to classification of Hermitian forms
over finite extensions of F.
  A method for reducing the problem of classifying systems of forms and linear
mappings to the problem of classifying systems of linear mappings is used to
construct the canonical matrices. This method has its origins in representation
theory and was devised in [V.V. Sergeichuk, Math. USSR-Izv. 31 (1988) 481-501].
