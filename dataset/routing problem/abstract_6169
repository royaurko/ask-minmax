We study the problem of computing a preemptive schedule of equal-length jobs
with given release times, deadlines and weights. Our goal is to maximize the
weighted throughput, which is the total weight of completed jobs. In Graham's
notation this problem is described as (1 | r_j;p_j=p;pmtn | sum w_j U_j). We
provide an O(n^4)-time algorithm for this problem, improving the previous bound
of O(n^{10}) by Baptiste.
