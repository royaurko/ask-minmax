The problem of formulating self-consistent local and global stability
exponents is shown to require global separation of variables. Posing the
separation of variable problem, we see that many such separations are possible,
but only one is consistent with both Hamiltonian dynamics and the boundedness
requirement for a Lyapunov transform: the determinant of the modal matrix must
be constant. Such stability exponents are invariant to any linear
transformation of variables, and both the local stability exponents and modal
matrix appear to be point functions in the original space, and introduce a true
coordinate frame. Methods are presented to perform this separation at
equlibrium points, about periodic orbits, and along general trajectories.
Results of numerical experiments are given.
