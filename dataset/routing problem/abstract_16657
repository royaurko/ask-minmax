Distributed denial-of-service attacks on public servers have recently become
a serious problem. To assure that network services will not be interrupted and
more effective defense mechanisms to protect against malicious traffic,
especially SYN floods. One problem in detecting SYN flood traffic is that
server nodes or firewalls cannot distinguish the SYN packets of normal TCP
connections from those of a SYN flood attack. Another problem is single-point
defenses (e.g. firewalls) lack the scalability needed to handle an increase in
the attack traffic. We have designed a new defense mechanism to detect the SYN
flood attacks. First, we introduce a mechanism for detecting SYN flood traffic
more accurately by taking into consideration the time variation of arrival
traffic. We investigate the statistics regarding the arrival rates of both
normal TCP SYN packets and SYN flood attack packets. We then describe a new
detection mechanism based on these statistics. Through the trace driven
approach defense nodes which receive the alert messages can identify legitimate
traffic and block malicious traffic by delegating SYN/ACK packets.
