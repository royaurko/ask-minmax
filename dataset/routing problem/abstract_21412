In this note we consider site percolation on a two dimensional sandwich of
thickness two, the graph Z^2 x {0,1}. We prove that there is no percolation at
the critical point. The same arguments are valid for a sandwich of thickness
three with periodic boundary conditions. It remains an open problem to extend
this result to other sandwiches.
