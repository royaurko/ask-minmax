In this paper, we study the resource allocation and user scheduling algorithm
for minimizing the energy cost of data transmission in the context of OFDMA
collaborative mobile cloud (CMC) with simultaneous wireless information and
power transfer (SWIPT) receivers. The CMC, which consists of several
collaborating MTs offers one potential solution for downlink content
distribution and for the energy consumption reduction at the terminal side.
Meanwhile, as RF signal can carry both information and energy simultaneously,
the induced SWIPT has gained much attention for energy efficiency design of
mobile nodes. Previous work on the design of CMC system mainly focused on the
cloud formulation or energy efficiency investigation, while how to allocate the
radio resource and schedule user transmission lacks attention. With the
objective to minimize the system energy consumption, an optimization problem
which jointly considers subchannel assignment, power allocation and user
scheduling for a group of SWIPT receivers has been presented. The formulated
problem is addressed through the convex optimization technique. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed user scheduling and resource allocation
algorithms can achieve significant energy saving performance.
