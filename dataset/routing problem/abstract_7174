This work provides a complete characterization of the solutions of a linear
interpolation problem for vector polynomials. The interpolation problem
consists in finding n scalar polynomials such that an equation involving a
linear combination of them is satisfied for each one of the N interpolation
nodes. The results of this work generalize previous results on the so-called
rational interpolation and have applications to direct and inverse spectral
analysis of band matrices.
