We consider the application of stable marginally outer trapped surfaces to
problems concerning the size of material bodies and the area of black holes.
The results presented extend to general initial data sets (V,g,K) previous
results assuming either maximal (tr K = 0) or time-symmetric (K = 0) initial
data.
