Let D be a strongly connected digraph and A(D) be the adjacency matrix of D.
Let diag(D) be the diagonal matrix with outdegrees of the vertices of D and
Q(D) = diag(D) + A(D) be the signless Laplacian matrix of D. The spectral
radius of Q(D) is called the signless Laplacian spectral radius of D, denoted
by q(D). In this paper, we give sharp bound on q(D) with outdegree sequence and
compare the bound with some known bounds, establish some sharp upper or lower
bound on q(D) with some given parameter such as clique number, girth or vertex
connectivity, and characterize the corresponding extremal digraph or proposed
open problem. In addition, we also determine the unique digraph which achieves
the minimum (or maximum), the second minimum (or maximum), the third minimum,
the fourth minimum spectral radius and signless Laplacian spectral radius among
all strongly connected digraphs, and answer the open problem proposed by
Lin-Shu [H.Q. Lin, J.L. Shu, A note on the spectral characterization of
strongly connected bicyclic digraphs, Linear Algebra Appl. 436 (2012)
