The problem of localized states in 1D systems with the relativistic spectrum,
namely, graphene stripes and carbon nanotubes, has been analytically studied.
The bound state as a superposition of two chiral states is completely described
by their relative phase. The criteria of bound states appearance have been
obtained based on the variable phase method (VPM) and the relativistic Levinson
theorem developed via the VPM. The problem of bound states is reduced to the
analysis of singularities of some vector field where the Levinson theorem
appears as the Poincare indices theorem for closed trajectories of this field.
The reduction of the VPM equation to the non-relativistic and semi-classical
limits has been done. The limit of the small momentum p_y of the transverse
quantization is applicable to arbitrary integrable potential. In this case the
only confined mode is predicted.
