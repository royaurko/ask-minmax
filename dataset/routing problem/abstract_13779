Regular variation of distributional tails is known to be preserved by various
linear transformations of some random structures. An inverse problem for
regular variation aims at understanding whether the regular variation of a
transformed random object is caused by regular variation of components of the
original random structure. In this paper we build up on previous work and
derive results in the multivariate case and in situations where regular
variation is not restricted to one particular direction or quadrant.
