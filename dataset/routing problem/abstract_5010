In this paper we survey a number of recent results concerning the existence
and moduli spaces of solutions of various geometric problems on noncompact
manifolds. The three problems which we discuss in detail are:
  I. Complete properly immersed minimal surfaces in $\RR^3$ with finite total
curvature.
  II. Complete embedded surfaces of constant mean curvature in $\RR^3$ with
finite topology.
  III. Complete conformal metrics of constant positive scalar curvature on $M^n
\setminus \Lambda$, where $M^n$ is a compact Riemannian manifold, $n\geq3$ and
$\Lam \subset M$ is closed.
  The existence results we discuss for each of these problems are ones whereby
known solutions (sometimes satisfying certain nondegeneracy hypotheses) are
glued together to produce new solutions. Although this sort of procedure is
quite well-known, there have been some recent advances on which we wish to
report here. We also discuss what has been established about the moduli spaces
of all solutions to these problems, and report on some work in progress
concerning global aspects of these moduli spaces. In the final section we
present a new compactness result for the `unmarked moduli spaces' for problem
III.
