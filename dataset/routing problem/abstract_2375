This is a survey of some problems in geometric group theory which I find
interesting. The problems are from different areas of group theory. Each
section is devoted to problems in one area. It contains an introduction where I
give some necessary definitions and motivations, problems and some discussions
of them. For each problem, I try to mention the contributor. If the contributor is not
given, the problem, to the best of my knowledge, was formulated by me first.
