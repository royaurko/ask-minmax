The paper is an overview of the main contributions of a Bulgarian team of
researchers to the problem of finding the possible structures and waves in the
open nonlinear heat conducting medium, described by a reaction-diffusion
equation. Being posed and actively worked out by the Russian school of A. A.
Samarskii and S.P. Kurdyumov since the seventies of the last century, this
problem still contains open and challenging questions.
