We study the notion of twisted conjugacy separability (essentially introduced
in our previous paper for a proof of twisted version of Burnside-Frobenius
theorem) and some related properties. We give examples of groups with and
without this property and study its behavior under some extensions. An
affirmative answer to the twisted Dehn conjugacy problem for
polycyclic-by-finite group is obtained. Some problems for the further study are
indicated.
