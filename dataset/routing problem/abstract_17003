In this paper we present novel algorithms for several multidimensional data
processing problems. We consider problems related to the computation of
restricted clusters and of the diameter of a set of points using a new distance
function. We also consider two string (1D data) processing problems, regarding
an optimal encoding method and the computation of the number of occurrences of
a substring within a string generated by a grammar. The algorithms have been
thoroughly analyzed from a theoretical point of view and some of them have also
been evaluated experimentally.
