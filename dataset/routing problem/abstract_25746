We study constrained generalized Killing spinors over the metric cone and
cylinder of a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, developing a toolkit which can be
used to investigate certain problems arising in supersymmetric flux
compactifications of supergravity theories. Using geometric algebra techniques,
we give conceptually clear and computationally effective methods for
translating supersymmetry conditions for the metric and fluxes of the unit
section of such cylinders and cones into differential and algebraic constraints
on collections of differential forms defined on the cylinder or cone. In
particular, we give a synthetic description of Fierz identities, which are an
important ingredient of such problems. As a non-trivial application, we
consider the most general N=2 compactification of eleven-dimensional
supergravity on eight-manifolds.
