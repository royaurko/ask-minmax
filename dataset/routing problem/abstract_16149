A semilinear reaction-diffusion two-point boundary value problem, whose
second-order derivative is multiplied by a small positive parameter $\eps^2$,
is considered. It can have multiple solutions. An asymptotic expansion is
constructed for a solution that has an interior layer. Further properties are
then established for a perturbation of this expansion. These are used
in\cite{KoStMain} to obtain discrete sub-solutions and super-solutions for
certain finite difference methods described there, and in this way yield
convergence results for those methods.
