The degree of a CSP instance is the maximum number of times that any variable
appears in the scopes of constraints. We consider the approximate counting
problem for Boolean CSP with bounded-degree instances, for constraint languages
containing the two unary constant relations {0} and {1}. When the maximum
allowed degree is large enough (at least 6) we obtain a complete classification
of the complexity of this problem. It is exactly solvable in polynomial-time if
every relation in the constraint language is affine. It is equivalent to the
problem of approximately counting independent sets in bipartite graphs if every
relation can be expressed as conjunctions of {0}, {1} and binary implication.
Otherwise, there is no FPRAS unless NP=RP. For lower degree bounds, additional
cases arise, where the complexity is related to the complexity of approximately
counting independent sets in hypergraphs.
