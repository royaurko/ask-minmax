As science technology grows, medical application is becoming more complex to
solve the physiological problems within expected time. Workflow management
systems (WMS) in Grid computing are promising solution to solve the
sophisticated problem such as genomic analysis, drug discovery, disease
identification, etc. Although existing WMS can provide basic management
functionality in Grid environment, consideration of user requirements such as
performance, reliability and interaction with user is missing. In this paper,
we propose hybrid workflow management system for heart disease identification
and discuss how to guarantee different user requirements according to user SLA.
The proposed system is applied to Physio-Grid e-health platform to identify
human heart disease with ECG analysis and Virtual Heart Simulation (VHS)
workflow applications.
