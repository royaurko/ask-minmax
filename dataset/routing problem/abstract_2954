We show that (1) the Minimal False QCNF search-problem (MF-search) and the
Minimal Unsatisfiable LTL formula search problem (MU-search) are FPSPACE
complete because of the very expressive power of QBF/LTL, (2) we extend the
PSPACE-hardness of the MF decision problem to the MU decision problem. As a
consequence, we deduce a positive answer to the open question of PSPACE
hardness of the inherent Vacuity Checking problem. We even show that the
Inherent Non Vacuous formula search problem is also FPSPACE-complete.
