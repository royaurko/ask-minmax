We show that the exact solution of the two_superbody problem in N=2 Chern
Simons Supergravity in 2+1 dimensions leads to a supermultiplet of space-times.
This supersymmetric space-time is characterized by the two gauge invariant
observables of the super Poincare' group, which may be viewed as the Casimir
invariants of an equivalent one-superbody state. The metric of this space-time
supermultiplet can be cast into the form of the metric for a spinning cone in
which the coordinates do not commute or for a spinning cone with an additional
finite discrete dimension. Some of the interesting features of this universe
and their possible physical implications are discussed in the light of a
corresponding observation by Witten.
