We will classify all rational transformations which change the confluent
hypergeometric equations to linear equations of the Painleve type from the
first to the fifth. We show such rational transformations correspond to almost
all of algebraic solutions of the Painleve equations from the first to fifth up
to the Backlund transformations.
