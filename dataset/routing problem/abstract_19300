In this paper, we initiate the study of networked stabilization via a MIMO
communication scheme between the controller and the plant. Specifically, the
communication system is modeled as a MIMO transceiver, which consists of three
parts: an encoder, a MIMO channel, and a decoder. In the spirit of MIMO
communication, the number of SISO subchannels in the transceiver is often
greater than the number of data streams to be transmitted. Moreover, the
subchannel capacities are assumed to be fixed a priori. In this case, the
encoder/decoder pair gives an additional design freedom on top of the
controller, leading to a stabilization problem via coding/control co-design. It
turns out that how to take the best advantage of the coding mechanism is quite
crucial. From a demand/supply perspective, the design of the coding mechanism
boils down to reshaping the demands for communication resource from different
control inputs to match the given supplies. We study the problem for the case
of AWGN subchannels and fading subchannels, respectively. In both cases, we
arrive at a unified necessary and sufficient condition on the capacities of the
subchannels under which the coding/control co-design problem is solvable. The
condition is given in terms of a majorization type relation. As we go along,
systematic procedures are also put forward to implement the coding/control
co-design. A numerical example is presented to illustrate our results.
