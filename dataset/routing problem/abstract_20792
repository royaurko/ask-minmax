We show that the tensor product of two unital C*-algebras, one of which is
nuclear and admits a unital *-homomorphism from (the building blocks of) the
Jiang-Su algebra, has Kadison's similarity property. As a consequence, we
obtain that a unital C*-algebra which absorbs the Jiang-Su algebra tensorially
also has this property.
