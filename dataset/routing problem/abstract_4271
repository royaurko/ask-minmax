For both the edge deletion heuristic and the maximum-degree greedy heuristic,
we study the problem of recognizing those graphs for which that heuristic can
approximate the size of a minimum vertex cover within a constant factor of r,
where r is a fixed rational number. Our main results are that these problems
are complete for the class of problems solvable via parallel access to NP. To
achieve these main results, we also show that the restriction of the vertex
cover problem to those graphs for which either of these heuristics can find an
optimal solution remains NP-hard.
