We investigate two coupled properties of Levy stable random motions: The
first passage times (FPTs) and the first passage leapovers (FPLs). While, in
general, the FPT problem has been studied quite extensively, the FPL problem
has hardly attracted any attention. Considering a particle that starts at the
origin and performs random jumps with independent increments chosen from a Levy
stable probability law $\lambda_(alpha,beta)(x)$, the FPT measures how long it
takes the particle to arrive at or cross a target. The FPL addresses a
different question: Given that the first passage jump crosses the target, then
how far does it get beyond the target? These two properties are investigated
for three subclasses of Levy stable motions: (i) symmetric Levy motions
characterized by Levy index $\alpha$ ($0<\alpha<2$) and skewness parameter
$\beta=0$, (ii) one-sided Levy motions with $0<\alpha<1$, $\beta=1$, and (iii)
two-sided skewed Levy motions, the extreme case, $1<\alpha<2$, $\beta=-1$.
