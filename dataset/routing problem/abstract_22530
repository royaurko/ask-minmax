The Solar Neutrino Problems (SNP's) are analysed in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
model of light nuclei. In this model a possible clue to the solution of the
SNP's is in the reduction of the solar neutrino fluxes relative to the
predicted by the Standard Solar Model through the decrease of the solar core
temperature. The former can be realized through the enhancement of the
astrophysical factor for the solar proton burning. The enhancement the upper
bound of which is restricted by the helioseismological data goes dynamically
via the contribution of the nucleon tensor current coupled to the deuteron. The
agreement of the reduced solar neutrino fluxes with the experimental data can
be reached within a scenario of vacuum two-flavour neutrino oscillations
without a fine tuning of the neutrino-flavour oscillation parameters. In the
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model of light nuclei an enhancement of the astrophysical
factor for the solar proton burning entails a change of the cross sections for
neutrino and anti-neutrino disintegration of the deuteron at low energies. This
provides a theoretical foundation for a new check of a value of the
astrophysical factor in terrestrial laboratories.
