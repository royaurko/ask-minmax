In this paper a mode of using the Dynamic Renormalization Group (DRG) method
is suggested in order to cope with inconsistent results obtained when applying
it to a continuous family of one-dimensional nonlocal models. The key
observation is that the correct fixed-point dynamical system has to be
identified during the analysis in order to account for all the relevant terms
that are generated under renormalization. This is well established for static
problems, however poorly implemented in dynamical ones. An application of this
approach to a nonlocal extension of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation resolves
certain problems in one-dimension. Namely, obviously problematic predictions
are eliminated and the existing exact analytic results are recovered.
