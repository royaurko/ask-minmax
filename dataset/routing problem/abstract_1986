Opportunistic scheduling and routing can in principle greatly increase the
throughput of decentralized wireless networks, but to be practical they must do
so with small amounts of timely side information. In this paper, we propose
three techniques for low-overhead distributed opportunistic scheduling (DOS)
and precisely determine their affect on the overall network outage probability
and transmission capacity (TC). The first is distributed channel-aware
scheduling (DCAS), the second is distributed interferer-aware scheduling
(DIAS), and the third generalizes and combines those two and is called
distributed interferer-channel-aware scheduling (DICAS). One contribution is
determining the optimum channel and interference thresholds that a given
isolated transmitter should estimate and apply when scheduling their own
transmissions. Using this threshold, the precise network-wide gain of each
technique is quantified and compared. We conclude by considering interference
cancellation at the receivers, and finding how much it improves the outage
probability.
