In 1992, motivated by Riemann mapping theorem, Escobar considered a version
of Yamabe problem on manifolds of dimension n greater than 2 with boundary. The
problem consists in finding a conformal metric such that the scalar curvature
is zero and the mean curvature is constant on the boundary. By using a local
test function construction, we are able to seattle the most cases left by
Escobar's and Marques's works. Moreover, we reduce the remaining case to the
positive mass theorem. In this proof, we use the method developed in previous
works by Brendle and by Brendle and the contributor.
