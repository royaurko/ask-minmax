A problem on propagation of waves in deformable shells with flowing liquid is
very urgent in connection with wide use of liquid transportation systems in
living organisms and technology. It is necessary to consider shell motion
equations for influence of moving liquid in cavity on the dynamics of a shell
by solving such kind problems.
  Nowadays a totality of such problems is a widely developed field of
hydrodynamics. However, a number of peculiarities connected with taking into
account viscous-elastic properties of the liquid and inhomogeneity of the shell
material generates considerable mathematical difficulties connected with
integration of boundary value problems with variable coefficients.
  In the paper we consider wave flow of the liquid enclosed in deformable tube.
The used mathematical model is described by the equation of motion of
incompressible viscous elastic liquid combined with equation of continuity and
dynamics equation for a tube inhomogeneous in length. It is accepted that the
tube is cylindric, semi-infinite and rigidly fastened to the environment. At
the infinity the tube is homogeneous. As a final result, the problem is reduced
to the solution of Volterra type integral equation that is solved by sequential
approximations method. Pulsating pressure is given at the end of the tube to
determine the desired hydrodynamic functions.}
