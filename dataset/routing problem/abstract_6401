I consider the problem of the optimal limit order price of a financial asset
in the framework of the maximization of the utility function of the investor.
The analytical solution of the problem gives insight on the origin of the
recently empirically observed power law distribution of limit order prices. In
the framework of the model, the most likely proximate cause of this power law
is a power law heterogeneity of traders' investment time horizons .
