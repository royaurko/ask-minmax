We are presenting a simple and numerical stable algorithm for the solution of
the cone projection problem which is suitable for relative small data sets and
for simulation purposes needed for convexity tests. Not even one pseudo-inverse
matrix is computed because of a proper Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process
that is used.
