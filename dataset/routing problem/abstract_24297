We consider electronic transport accross one-dimensional heterostructures
described by the Dirac equation. We discuss the cases where both the velocity
and the mass are position dependent. We show how to generalize the Dirac
Hamiltonian in order to obtain a Hermitian problem for spatial dependent
velocity. We solve exactly the case where the position dependence of both
velocity and mass is linear. In the case of velocity profiles, it is shown that
there is no backscattering of Dirac electrons. In the case of the mass profile
backscattering exists. In this case, it is shown that the linear mass profile
induces less backscattering than the abrupt step-like profile. Our results are
a first step to the study of similar problems in graphene.
