We demonstrate that a $d_{x^2-y^2}$ superconducting pairing is naturally
associated with the screened Coulomb interaction $V_{eff}({\bf q},\omega)$
within the $CuO_2$ plane of high $T_c$ superconductors. This pairing
instability arises (via the dielectric constant) from wave-vector structure in
$V_{eff}({\bf q},\omega )$ at ${\bf q}=(\pi,\pi)$, which is associated with 2D
Van Hove and local field effects. Our results, which are independent of the
bandstructure, suggest that direct Coulomb intereactions are significant (when
compared to the spin channel) and will, at the least, enhance any other
underlying mechanism for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave pairing.
