This note outlines the realizable extension problem for weighted graphs and
provides results of a detailed analysis of this problem for the weighted graph
$(K_{3,3},l)$. This analysis is then utilized to provide a result relating to
the connectedness of the moduli space of planar realizations of $(K_{3,3},l)$.
The note culminates with two examples which show that in general, realizability
and connectedness results relating to the moduli spaces of weighted cycles
which are contained in a larger weighted graph cannot be extended to similar
results regarding the moduli space of the larger weighted graph.
