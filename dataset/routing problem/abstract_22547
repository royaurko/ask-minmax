We revisit the cloud-in-cloud problem for non-Gaussian density fluctuations.
We show that the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism for non-Gaussian
fluctuations has a flaw in describing mass functions regardless of type of
filtering. As an example, we consider non-Gaussian models in which density
fluctuations at a point obeys a \chi^2 distribution with \nu degrees of
freedom. We find that mass functions predicted by using an integral formula
proposed by Jedamzik, and Yano, Nagashima and Gouda, properly taking into
account correlation between objects at different scales, deviate from those
predicted by using the EPS formalism, especially for strongly non-Gaussian
fluctuations. Our results for the mass function at large mass scales are
consistent with those by Avelino and Viana obtained from numerical simulations.
