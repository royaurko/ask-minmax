This paper deals with the parallel simulation of delamination problems at the
meso-scale by means of multi-scale methods, the aim being the Virtual
Delamination Testing of Composite parts. In the non-linear context, Domain
Decomposition Methods are mainly used as a solver for the tangent problem to be
solved at each iteration of a Newton-Raphson algorithm. In case of strongly
nonlinear and heterogeneous problems, this procedure may lead to severe
difficulties. The paper focuses on methods to circumvent these problems, which
can now be expressed using a relatively general framework, even though the
different ingredients of the strategy have emerged separately. We rely here on
the micro-macro framework proposed in (Ladev\`eze, Loiseau, and Dureisseix,
2001). The method proposed in this paper introduces three additional features:
(i) the adaptation of the macro-basis to situations where classical
homogenization does not provide a good preconditioner, (ii) the use of
non-linear relocalization to decrease the number of global problems to be
solved in the case of unevenly distributed non-linearities, (iii) the
adaptation of the approximation of the local Schur complement which governs the
convergence of the proposed iterative technique. Computations of delamination
and delamination-buckling interaction with contact on potentially large
delaminated areas are used to illustrate those aspects.
