In the study of random access machines (RAMs) it has been shown that the
availability of an extra input integer, having no special properties other than
being sufficiently large, is enough to reduce the computational complexity of
some problems. However, this has only been shown so far for specific problems.
We provide a characterization of the power of such extra inputs for general
problems. To do so, we first correct a classical result by Simon and Szegedy
(1992) as well as one by Simon (1981). In the former we show mistakes in the
proof and correct these by an entirely new construction, with no great change
to the results. In the latter, the original proof direction stands with only
minor modifications, but the new results are far stronger than those of Simon
(1981). In both cases, the new constructions provide the theoretical tools
required to characterize the power of arbitrary large numbers.
