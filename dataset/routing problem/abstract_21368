We treat the problem of N interacting, axisymmetric black holes and obtain
two relations among physical parameters of the system including the force
between the black holes. The first relation involves the total mass, the
angular momenta, the distances and the forces between the black holes. The
second one relates the angular momentum and area of each black hole with the
forces acting on it.
