The stability of equilibrium configurations of galaxies or stars are time
honored problems in astrophysics. We present mathematical results on these
problems which have in recent years been obtained by Yan Guo and the contributor in
the context of the Vlasov-Poisson and the Euler-Poisson model. Based on a
careful analysis of the minimization properties of conserved quantities--the
total energy and so-called Casimir functionals--non-linear stability results
are obtained for a wide class of equilibria.
