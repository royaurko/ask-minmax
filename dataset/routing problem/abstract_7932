We settle an open problem, raised by Y. Peres and D. Revelle, concerning the
$L^2$ mixing time of the random walk on the lamplighter graph. We also provide
general bounds relating the entropy decay of a Markov chain to the separation
distance of the chain, and show that the lamplighter graphs once again provide
examples of tightness of our results.
