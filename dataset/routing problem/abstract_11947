The reduction of Feynman integrals to master integrals is an algebraic
problem that requires algorithmic approaches at the modern level of
calculations. Straightforward applications of the classical Buchberger
algorithm to construct Groebner bases seem to be inefficient. An essential
modification designed especially for this problem has been worked out. It has
been already applied in two- and three-loop calculations. We are also
suggesting to combine our method with the Laporta's algorithm.
