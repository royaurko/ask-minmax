High-velocity streams of high-dimensional data pose significant ``big data''
analysis challenges across a range of applications and settings. Online
learning and online convex programming play a significant role in the rapid
recovery of important or anomalous information from these large datastreams.
While recent advances in online learning have led to novel and rapidly
converging algorithms, these methods are unable to adapt to nonstationary
environments arising in real-world problems. This paper describes a dynamic
mirror descent framework which addresses this challenge, yielding low
theoretical regrets bounds and accurate, adaptive, and computationally
efficient algorithms which are applicable to broad classes of problems. The
methods are capable of learning and adapting to an underlying and possibly
time-varying dynamical model. Empirical results in the context of dynamic
texture analysis, sequential compressed sensing of a dynamic scene, and
tracking self-exciting point processes support the core theoretical findings.
