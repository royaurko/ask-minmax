The nucleus of 208Pb -- a system that is 18 order of magnitudes smaller and
55 orders of magnitude lighter than a neutron star -- may be used as a
miniature surrogate to establish important correlations between its neutron
skin and several neutron-star properties. Indeed, a nearly model-independent
correlation develops between the neutron skin of 208Pb and the liquid-to-solid
transition density in a neutron star. Further, we illustrate how a measurement
of the neutron skin in 208Pb may be used to place important constraints on the
cooling mechanism operating in neutron stars and may help elucidate the
existence of quarks stars.
