In this paper, we examine the problem of a single provider offering multiple
types of service level agreements, and the implications thereof. In doing so,
we propose a simple model for machine-readable service level agreements (SLAs)
and outline specifically how these machine-readable SLAs can be constructed and
injected into cloud infrastructures - important for next-generation cloud
systems as well as customers. We then computationally characterize the problem,
establishing the importance of both verification and solution, showing that in
the general case injecting policies into cloud infrastructure is NP-Complete,
though the problem can be made more tractable by further constraining SLA
representations and using approximation techniques.
