In classical scheduling problems, we are given jobs and machines, and have to
schedule all the jobs to minimize some objective function. What if each job has
a specified profit, and we are no longer required to process all jobs -- we can
schedule any subset of jobs whose total profit is at least a (hard) target
profit requirement, while still approximately minimizing the objective
function?
  We refer to this class of problems as scheduling with outliers. This model
was initiated by Charikar and Khuller (SODA'06) on the minimum max-response
time in broadcast scheduling. We consider three other well-studied scheduling
objectives: the generalized assignment problem, average weighted completion
time, and average flow time, and provide LP-based approximation algorithms for
them. For the minimum average flow time problem on identical machines, we give
a logarithmic approximation algorithm for the case of unit profits based on
rounding an LP relaxation; we also show a matching integrality gap. For the
average weighted completion time problem on unrelated machines, we give a
constant factor approximation. The algorithm is based on randomized rounding of
the time-indexed LP relaxation strengthened by the knapsack-cover inequalities.
For the generalized assignment problem with outliers, we give a simple
reduction to GAP without outliers to obtain an algorithm whose makespan is
within 3 times the optimum makespan, and whose cost is at most (1 + \epsilon)
times the optimal cost.
