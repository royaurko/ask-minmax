In this paper we will prove that the vorticity belongs to
$L^{\infty}(0,T;L^2(\Omega))$ for 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with
periodic initial-boundary value conditions, then the existence of a global
smooth solution is obtained. Our approach is to construct a set of auxiliary
problems to approximate the original one for vorticity equation.
