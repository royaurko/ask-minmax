Lie symmetry method is applied to find analytic solutions of
initial-boundary-value problems of transient conduction in semi-infinite solid
with constant surface temperature or constant heat flux condition. The
solutions are obtained in a manner highlighting the systematic procedure of
extending the symmetry method for a PDE to investigate BVPs of the PDE. A
comparative analysis of numerical and closed form solutions is carried out for
a physical problem of heat conduction in a semi-infinite solid bar made of AISI
304 stainless steel.
