The Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) evolution equation is known to be
``unstable'' with respect to fluctuations in gluon virtuality, transverse
momentum and energy requiring to go beyond the leading order BFKL. Still, these
instabilities point to fruitful improvements of our deep understanding of QCD.
Recent applications to next-leading order and to saturation problems are
outlined.
