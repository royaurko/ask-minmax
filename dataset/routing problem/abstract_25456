Most biological systems are formed by component parts that to some degree are
inter-related. Groups of parts that are more associated among themselves and
are relatively autonomous from others are called modules. One of the
consequences of modularity is that biological systems usually present an
unequal distribution of the genetic variation among variables. Estimating the
covariance matrix that describes these systems is a difficult problem due to a
number of factors such as poor sample sizes and measurement errors. We show
that this problem will be exacerbated whenever matrix inversion is required, as
in directional selection reconstruction analysis. We explore the consequences
of varying degrees of modularity and signal-to-noise ratio on selection
reconstruction. We then present and test the efficiency of available methods
for controlling noise in matrix estimates. In our simulations, controlling
matrices for noise vastly improves the reconstruction of selection gradients.
We also perform an analysis of selection gradients reconstruction over a New
World Monkeys skull database in order to illustrate the impact of noise on such
analyses. Noise- controlled estimates render far more plausible interpretations
that are in full agreement with previous results.
