Consider an urn model where at each step one of $q$ colors is sampled
according to some probability distribution and a ball of that color is placed
in an urn. The distribution of assigning balls to urns may depend on the color
of the ball. Collisions occur when a ball is placed in an urn which already
contains a ball of different color. Equivalently, this can be viewed as
sequentially coloring a complete $q$-partite graph wherein a collision
corresponds to the appearance of a monochromatic edge. Using a Poisson
embedding technique, the limiting distribution of the first collision time is
determined and the possible limits are explicitly described. Joint distribution
of successive collision times and multi-fold collision times are also derived.
The results can be used to obtain the limiting distributions of running times
in various birthday problem based algorithms for solving the discrete logarithm
problem, and to generalize previous results which only consider expected
running times. Asymptotic distributions of the time of appearance of a
monochromatic edge are also obtained for preferential attachment graphs and the
infinite path.
