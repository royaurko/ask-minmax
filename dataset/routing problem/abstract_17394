We begin by introducing the Computer Science branch of Natural Language
Processing, then narrowing the attention on its subbranch of Information
Extraction and particularly on Named Entity Recognition, discussing briefly its
main methodological approaches. It follows an introduction to state-of-the-art
Conditional Random Fields under the form of linear chains. Subsequently, the
idea of constrained inference as a way to model long-distance relationships in
a text is presented, based on an Integer Linear Programming representation of
the problem. Adding such relationships to the problem as automatically inferred
logical formulas, translatable into linear conditions, we propose to solve the
resulting more complex problem with the aid of Lagrangian relaxation, of which
some technical details are explained. Lastly, we give some experimental
results.
