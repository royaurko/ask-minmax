Two-person bargaining problem is considered as to allocate a number of goods
between two players. This paper suggests that any non-trivial division of goods
cause a non-zero change on the solution of bargaining. So, a axiom of sharing
division is presented, as an alternative axiom to Nash axiom of independence of
irrelevant alternatives and Kalai-Smorodinsky axiom of monotonicity. This
solution is targeted at the partialities of Nash and Kalai-Smorodinsky solution
on some specific issues, but not to say it is better than others.
