The Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) has generated significant
interest over the last decade due to its occurrence in several civil and
military surveillance applications. Currently, there is no algorithm that can
find an optimal solution to the problem. In addition, relaxing the motion
constraints and solving the resulting Euclidean TSP (ETSP) provides the only
lower bound available for the problem. However, in many problem instances, the
lower bound computed by solving the ETSP is far below the cost of the feasible
solutions obtained by some well-known algorithms for the DTSP. This article
addresses this fundamental issue and presents the first systematic procedure
for developing tight lower bounds for the DTSP.
