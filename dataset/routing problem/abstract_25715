A didactical exposition of the classical problem of the trajectory
determination of a body, subject to the gravity in a resistant medium, is
proposed. Our revisitation is aimed at showing a derivation of the problem
solution which should be as simple as possible from a technical point of view,
in order to be grasped even by first-year undergraduates. A central role in our
analysis is played by the so-called "chain rule" for derivatives, which is
systematically used to remove the temporal variable from Newton's law to derive
the differential equation of the Cartesian representation of the trajectory,
with a considerable reduction of the overall mathematical complexity. In
particular, for a resistant medium exerting a force quadratic with respect to
the velocity our approach leads, in an elementary way, to the differential
equation of the trajectory, which is subsequently solved by series expansion. A
comparison of the polynomial approximants obtained by truncating such series
with the solution recently proposed through a homotopy analysis is also
presented.
