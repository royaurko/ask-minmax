This paper proposes an assessment model, based on a new taxonomy, which
comprises an evaluation guideline with performance metrics and experimental
setup to aid designers in evaluating solutions through fair comparisons.
Simulation results are provided based on the proposed model considering
Epidemic, PROPHET, Bubble Rap, and Spray and Wait, and showing how they perform
under the same set of metrics and scenario
