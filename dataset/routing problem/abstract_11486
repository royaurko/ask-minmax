In group testing, the task is to determine the distinguished members of a set
of objects L by asking subset queries of the form ``does the subset Q of L
contain a distinguished object?'' The primary biological application of group
testing is for screening libraries of clones with hybridization probes. This is
a crucial step in constructing physical maps and for finding genes. Group
testing has also been considered for sequencing by hybridization. Another
important application includes screening libraries of reagents for useful
chemically active zones. This preliminary report discusses some of the
constrained group testing problems which arise in biology.
