This Artificial left ventricle is based on a simple conic assumption shape
for left ventricle where its motion is made by attached compressed elastic
tubes to its walls which are regarded to electrical points at each nodal .This
compressed tubes are playing the role of myofibers in the myocardium of the
left ventricle. These elastic tubes have helical shapes and are transacting on
these helical bands dynamically. At this invention we give an algorithm of this
artificial left ventricle construction that of course the effect of the blood
flow in LV is observed with making beneficiary used of sensors to obtain this
effecting, something like to lifegates problem. The main problem is to evaluate
powers that are interacted between elastic body (left ventricle) and fluid
(blood). The main goal of this invention is to show that artificial heart is
not just a pump, but mechanical modeling of LV wall and its interaction with
blood in it (blood movement modeling) can introduce an artificial heart closed
to natural heart.
