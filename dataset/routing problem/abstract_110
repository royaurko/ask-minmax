Recently, there has been an explosion of work on network routing in hostile
environments. Hostile environments tend to be dynamic, and the motivation for
this work stems from the scenario of IED placements by insurgents in a
logistical network. For discussion, we consider here a sub-network abstracted
from a real network, and propose a framework for route selection. What
distinguishes our work from related work is its decision theoretic foundation,
and statistical considerations pertaining to probability assessments. The
latter entails the fusion of data from diverse sources, modeling the
socio-psychological behavior of adversaries, and likelihood functions that are
induced by simulation. This paper demonstrates the role of statistical
inference and data analysis on problems that have traditionally belonged in the
domain of computer science, communications, transportation science, and
operations research.
