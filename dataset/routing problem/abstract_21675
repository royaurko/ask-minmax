We introduce a division formula on a possibly singular projective subvariety
$X$ of complex projective space $\P^N$, which, e.g., provides explicit
representations of solutions to various polynomial division problems on the
affine part of $X$. Especially we consider a global effective version of the
Brian\c con-Skoda-Huneke theorem.
