In a granular material, a macroscopically homogeneous deformation does not
correspond to a homogeneous displacement field when looking at the individual
grains. The deviation of a grain displacement from the value dictated by the
continuum field (referred to as fluctuation) is likely to hold valuable
information about the characteristic length(s) involved in grains'
rearrangement, which is the principal mechanism of irreversible deformation for
granular materials. This paper shows a selection of results from a series of
shear tests on a 2D analogue granular material. We have followed the route
opened by the pioneering work of Radja\"i and Roux (2002), and used the same
framework to analyze our experimental data on displacement fluctuations.
Digital Image Correlation has been used to measure and characterize the
displacement fluctuations. The analysis of their spatial organization reveals
the emergence of a minimum length scale that is in the order of 10 times the
mean particle size.
