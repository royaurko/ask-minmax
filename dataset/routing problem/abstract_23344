We discuss the proton decay problem in theories with low gravity and/or GUT
scales. We pointed out that the gravity induced proton decay can be indeed
suppressed up to a desired level, while the GUT origin of the proton
instability is rather problematic. To solve this problem we suggest the GUT
model where the proton is stable in all orders of perturbation theory. This can
be simply achieved by the replication of quark-lepton families with ordinary
quarks and leptons residing in different GUT representations and by an
appropriate dimensional reduction. The model predicts extra mirror states which
along with the GUT particles and the excitations of extra dimensions could be
observable at high-energy colliders providing the unification scale is in the
TeV range.
