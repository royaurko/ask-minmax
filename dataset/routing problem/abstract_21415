The Schwinger-Dyson Bethe-Salpeter approach to the bound state problem is
applied to the spin zero glueball spectrum. Although a moderately successful
description of the two point functions and the glueball spectrum can be
obtained, further work is required to reduce sensitivity to model truncations.
