The paper investigates various $p$-adic versions of Littlewood's conjecture,
generalizing a set-up considered recently by de Mathan and Teulie. In many
cases it is shown that the sets of exceptions to these conjectures have
Hausdorff dimension zero. The proof follows the measure ridigity approach of
Einsiedler, Katok and Lindenstrauss.
