We consider the problem of checking whether an elliptic curve defined over a
given number field has complex multiplication. We study two polynomial time
algorithms for this problem, one randomized and the other deterministic. The
randomized algorithm can be adapted to yield the discriminant of the
endomorphism ring of the curve.
