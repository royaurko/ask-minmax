In this article, we prove that solutions to a problem in nonlinear elasticity
corresponding to small initial displacements exist globally in the exterior of
a nontrapping obstacle. The medium is assumed to be homogeneous, isotropic, and
hyperelastic, and the nonlinearity is assumed to satisfy a null condition. The
techniques contained herein would allow for more complicated geometries
provided that there is a sufficient decay of local energy for the linearized
problem.
