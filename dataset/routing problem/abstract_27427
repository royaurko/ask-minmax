Dependent rounding is a useful technique for optimization problems with hard
budget constraints. This framework naturally leads to \emph{negative
correlation} properties. However, what if an application naturally calls for
dependent rounding on the one hand, and desires \emph{positive} correlation on
the other? More generally, we develop algorithms that guarantee the known
properties of dependent rounding, but also have nearly best-possible behavior -
near-independence, which generalizes positive correlation - on "small" subsets
of the variables. The recent breakthrough of Li & Svensson for the classical
$k$-median problem has to handle positive correlation in certain
dependent-rounding settings, and does so implicitly. We improve upon
Li-Svensson's approximation ratio for $k$-median from $2.732 + \epsilon$ to
$2.611 + \epsilon$ by developing an algorithm that improves upon various
aspects of their work. Our dependent-rounding approach helps us improve the
dependence of the runtime on the parameter $\epsilon$ from Li-Svensson's
$N^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$ to $N^{O((1/\epsilon) \log(1/\epsilon))}$.
