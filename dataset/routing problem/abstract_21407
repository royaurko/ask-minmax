Let A be a commutative associative integrally closed k-algebra without zero
divisors effectively graded by a lattice. We obtain a criterion of local
nilpotency of the sum of two homogeneous locally nilpotent derivations (LNDs)
of fiber type on A in terms of their degrees. The same problem is solved for
commutators of two homogeneous LNDs.
