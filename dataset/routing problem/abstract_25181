The qualitative and quantitative understanding of near-horizon gravitational
dynamics in the strong-field regime represents a challenge both at a
fundamental level and in astrophysical applications. Recent advances in
numerical relativity and in the geometric characterization of black hole
horizons open new conceptual and technical avenues into the problem. We discuss
here a research methodology in which spacetime dynamics is probed through the
cross-correlation of geometric quantities constructed on the black hole horizon
and on null infinity. These two hypersurfaces respond to evolving gravitational
fields in the bulk, providing canonical "test screens" in a "scattering"-like
perspective onto spacetime dynamics. More specifically, we adopt a 3+1 Initial
Value Problem approach to the construction of generic spacetimes and discuss
the role and properties of dynamical trapping horizons as canonical inner
"screens" in this context. We apply these ideas and techniques to the study of
the recoil dynamics in post-merger binary black holes, an important issue in
supermassive galactic black hole mergers.
