Ptychography promises diffraction limited resolution without the need for
high resolution lenses. To achieve high resolution one has to solve the phase
problem for many partially overlapping frames. Here we review some of the
existing methods for solving ptychographic phase retrieval problem from a
numerical analysis point of view, and propose alternative methods based on
numerical optimization.
