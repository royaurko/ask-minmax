The WKB and instanton answers for the tunnel splitting of the ground state in
a symmetric double well potential are both reduced to an expression involving
only the functionals of the potential, without the need for solving any
auxilliary problems. This formula is applied to simple model problems. The
prefactor for the splitting in the text book by Landau and Lifshitz is amended
so as to apply to the ground and low lying excited states.
