We propose a primal-dual splitting algorithm for solving monotone inclusions
involving a mixture of sums, linear compositions, and parallel sums of
set-valued and Lipschitzian operators. An important feature of the algorithm is
that the Lipschitzian operators present in the formulation can be processed
individually via explicit steps, while the set-valued operators are processed
individually via their resolvents. In addition, the algorithm is highly
parallel in that most of its steps can be executed simultaneously. This work
brings together and notably extends various types of structured monotone
inclusion problems and their solution methods. The application to convex
minimization problems is given special attention.
