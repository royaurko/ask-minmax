In parameter determination for the heteroskedastic probit model, both in
simulated data and in actual data, we observe a failure of traditional local
search methods to converge consistently to a single parameter vector, in
contrast to the typical situation for the regular probit model. We identify
features of the heteroskedastic probit log likelihood function that we argue
tend to lead to this failure, and suggest ways to amend the local search
methods to remedy the problem.
