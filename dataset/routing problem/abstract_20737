The vibrational frequencies of a plate under tension are given by the
eigenvalues $\omega$ of the equation $\Delta^2u-\tau\Delta u=\omega u$. This
paper determines the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of this bi-Laplace problem
on the ball under natural (free) boundary conditions. In particular, the
fundamental modes --- the eigenfunctions of the lowest nonzero eigenvalue ---
are identified and found to have simple angular dependence.
