In the paper we present a functional-discrete method for solving
Sturm-Liouville problems with potential including function from L_{1}(0,1) and
\delta-function. For both, linear and nonlinear cases the sufficient conditions
providing superexponential convergence rate of the method are obtained. The
question of possible software implementation of the method is discussed in
detail. The theoretical results are successfully confirmed by the numerical
example included in the paper.
