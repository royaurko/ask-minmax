In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the covariance kernel
and its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions from sparse, irregularly observed, noise
corrupted and (possibly) correlated functional data. We present a method based
on pre-smoothing of individual sample curves through an appropriate kernel. We
show that the naive empirical covariance of the pre-smoothed sample curves
gives highly biased estimator of the covariance kernel along its diagonal. We
attend to this problem by estimating the diagonal and off-diagonal parts of the
covariance kernel separately. We then present a practical and efficient method
for choosing the bandwidth for the kernel by using an approximation to the
leave-one-curve-out cross validation score. We prove that under standard
regularity conditions on the covariance kernel and assuming i.i.d. samples, the
risk of our estimator, under $L^2$ loss, achieves the optimal nonparametric
rate when the number of measurements per curve is bounded. We also show that
even when the sample curves are correlated in such a way that the noiseless
data has a separable covariance structure, the proposed method is still
consistent and we quantify the role of this correlation in the risk of the
estimator.
