The Supersymmetric Standard Model is a benchmark theoretical framework for
particle physics, yet it suffers from a number of deficiencies, chief among
which is the strong CP problem. Solving this with an axion in the context of
selected new particles, it is shown in three examples that other problems go
away automatically as well, resulting in (-)^L and (-)^{3B} conservation,
viable combination of two dark-matter candidates, successful baryogenesis,
seesaw neutrino masses, and verifiable experimental consequences at the TeV
energy scale.
