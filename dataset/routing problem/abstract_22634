The problem of determination of the electron temperature t_2 in the OII zone
of high-metallicity HII region was examined. It was shown that the ratio of
nebular to auroral nitrogen line intensities, which is an indicator of the
electron temperature t_2, can be expressed in terms of the nebular line
intensities of oxygen. This solves the problem of the determination of the
electron temperature t_2, since the oxygen nebular lines are strong and,
consequently, are readily observable. A relation between electron temperatures
in the OII and OIII zones in high-metallicity HII regions was studied. It was
found that there is no one-to-one correspondance between t_2 and t_3
temperatures. Instead the t_2 - t_3 relation is dependent on excitation
parameter.
