We propose a scheme for multi-layer representation of images. The problem is
first treated from an information-theoretic viewpoint where we analyze the
behavior of different sources of information under a multi-layer data
compression framework and compare it with a single-stage (shallow) structure.
We then consider the image data as the source of information and link the
proposed representation scheme to the problem of multi-layer dictionary
learning for visual data. For the current work we focus on the problem of image
compression for a special class of images where we report a considerable
performance boost in terms of PSNR at high compression ratios in comparison
with the JPEG2000 codec.
