Gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking scenarios with an ultra-light gravitino
of mass m_{3/2}=1-10 eV are very interesting, since there is no cosmological
gravitino problem. We propose a new experimental determination of the gravitino
mass for such an ultra-light gravitino, by measuring a branching ratio of two
decay modes of sleptons.
