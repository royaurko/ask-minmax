The two-dimensional (2D) incompressible Euler equations have been thoroughly
investigated and the resolution of the global (in time) existence and
uniqueness issue is currently in a satisfactory status. In contrast, the global
regularity problem concerning the 2D inviscid Boussinesq equations remains
widely open. In an attempt to understand this problem, we examine the damped 2D
Boussinesq equations and study how damping affects the regularity of solutions.
Since the damping effect is insufficient in overcoming the difficulty due to
the "vortex stretching", we seek unique global small solutions and the efforts
have been mainly devoted to minimizing the smallness assumption. By positioning
the solutions in a suitable functional setting (more precisely the homogeneous
Besov space $\mathring{B}^1_{\infty,1}$), we are able to obtain a unique global
solution under a minimal smallness assumption.
