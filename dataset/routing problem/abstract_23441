In this letter we explore the dependence on the gauge fixing condition of
several quantities in the U(1) Higgs model at finite temperature and chemical
potential. We compute the effective potential at the one loop level, using a
gauge fixing condition that depends on $\mu$ and which allows to decouple the
contributions of the different fields in the model. In this way we get the mass
spectrum and the characterization of the phase transition, pointing out in each
case how these quantities depend on the gauge fixing parameter $\xi$. When
$\mu$ vanishes, we agree with previous results if $\xi=0$. The gauge dependence
problem is also analyzed from the perspective of the Nielsen identities.
