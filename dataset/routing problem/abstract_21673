The problem is a power-law asymptotics of the probability that a self-similar
process does not exceed a fixed level during long time. The exponent in such
asymptotics is estimated for some Gaussian processes, including the fractional
Brownian motion (FBM) in (-T1,T),T>T1>>1 and the integrated FBM in(0,T), T>>1 .
