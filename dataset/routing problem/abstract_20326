The connection between symmetries and linearizations of discrete-time
dynamical systems is being inverstigated. It is shown, that existence of
semigroup structures related to the vector field and having linear
representations enables reduction of linearization problem to a system of first
order partial differential equations. By means of inverse of the Poincare map
one can relate symmetries in such linearizable systems to continuous and
discrete ones of the corresponding differential equations.
