The gossip problem (telephone problem) is an information dissemination
problem in which each of $n$ nodes of a communication network has a unique
piece of information that must be transmitted to all the other nodes using
two-way communications (telephone calls) between the pairs of nodes.
  During a call between the given two nodes, they exchange the whole
information known to them at that moment.
  In this paper we investigate the $k$-fault-tolerant gossip problem, which is
a generalization of the gossip problem, where at most $k$ arbitrary faults of
calls are allowed.
  The problem is to find the minimal number of calls $\tau(n,k)$ needed to
guarantee the $k$-fault-tolerance.
  We construct two classes of $k$-fault-tolerant gossip schemes (sequences of
calls) and found two upper bounds of $\tau(n,k)$, which improve the previously
known results.
  The first upper bound for general even $n$ is $\tau(n,k) \leq 1/2 n
\lceil\log_2 n\rceil + 1/2 n k$.
  This result is used to obtain the upper bound for general odd $n$.
  From the expressions for the second upper bound it follows that $\tau(n,k)
\leq 2/3 n k + O(n)$ for large $n$.
  Assuming that the calls can take place simultaneously, it is also of interest
to find $k$-fault-tolerant gossip schemes, which can spread the full
information in minimal time. For even $n$ we showed that the minimal time is
$T(n,k)=\lceil\log_2 n\rceil + k$.
