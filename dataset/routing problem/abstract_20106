One of the basic problems in studying topological structures of deformation
spaces for Kleinian groups is to find a criterion to distinguish convergent
sequences from divergent sequences. In this paper, we shall give a sufficient
condition for sequences of Kleinian groups isomorphic to surface groups to
diverge in the deformation spaces.
