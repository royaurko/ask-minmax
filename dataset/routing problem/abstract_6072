We consider time-harmonic linear elasticity equations in domains containing
two-dimensional semi-infinite strips. Since for such problems there exist modes
with different signs of group and phase velocity, standard perfectly matched
layer (PML) as well as standard Hardy space infinite element methods fail.
  We apply a recently developed infinite element method for a physically
correct discretization of such waveguide problems which is based on a Laplace
transform in propagation direction. In the Laplace domain the space of
transformed solutions can be separated into a sum of a space of incoming and a
space of outgoing functions where both function spaces are certain Hardy
spaces. The Hardy space is chosen such that the construction of a simple
infinite element is possible.
  The method does not use a modal separation and works on intervals of
frequencies. On those intervals the involved operators are frequency
independent and hence lead to linear eigenvalue problems when computing
resonances. Numerical experiments containing convergence tests and resonance
problems are included.
