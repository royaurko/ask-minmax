Recently, the so-called Elko spinor field has been proposed to be a candidate
of dark energy. It is a non-standard spinor and has unusual properties. When
the Elko spinor field is used in cosmology, its unusual properties could bring
some interesting consequences. In the present work, we discuss the cosmological
coincidence problem in the spinor dark energy models by using the dynamical
system method. Our results show that the cosmological coincidence problem
should be taken to heart in the investigations of spinor dark energy models.
