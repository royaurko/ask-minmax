A non-classical Weyl theory is developed for skew-self-adjoint Dirac systems
with rectangular matrix potentials. The notion of the Weyl function is
introduced and direct and inverse problems are solved. A Borg-Marchenko type
uniqueness result and the evolution of the Weyl function for the corresponding
focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation are also derived.
