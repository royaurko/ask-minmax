We investigate a new oriented variant of the Firefighter Problem. In the
traditional Firefighter Problem, a fire breaks out at a given vertex of a
graph, and at each time interval spreads to neighbouring vertices that have not
been protected, while a constant number of vertices are protected at each time
interval. In the version of the problem considered here, the firefighters are
able to orient the edges of the graph before the fire breaks out, but the fire
could start at any vertex. We consider this problem when played on a graph in
one of several graph classes, and give upper and lower bounds on the number of
vertices that can be saved. In particular, when one firefighter is available at
each time interval, and the given graph is a complete graph, or a complete
bipartite graph, we present firefighting strategies that are provably optimal.
We also provide lower bounds on the number of vertices that can be saved as a
function of the chromatic number, of the maximum degree, and of the treewidth
of a graph. For a subcubic graph, we show that the firefighters can save all
but two vertices, and this is best possible.
