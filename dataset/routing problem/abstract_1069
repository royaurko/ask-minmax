Due to the transient nature of peers, any Peer-to-Peer network is in peril to
falling apart if peers do not receive routing table updates periodically. To
this end, maintenance, which affects every peer, ensures connectedness and
sustained data operation performance. However, a high rate of change in peer
population usually incurs lots of network maintenance messages and can severely
degrade overall performance. We discuss three methods how to tackle and
mitigate the effect of peer fluctuation on a tree-based distributed hash table.
