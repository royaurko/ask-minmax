The problem of finding a minimizer of the sum of two convex functions - or,
more generally, that of finding a zero of the sum of two maximally monotone
operators - is of central importance in variational analysis. Perhaps the most
popular method of solving this problem is the Douglas-Rachford splitting
method. Surprisingly, little is known about the range of the Douglas-Rachford
operator.
  In this paper, we set out to study this range systematically. We prove that
for 3* monotone operators a very pleasing formula can be found that reveals the
range to be nearly equal to a simple set involving the domains and ranges of
the underlying operators. A similar formula holds for the range of the
corresponding displacement mapping. We discuss applications to subdifferential
operators, to the infimal displacement vector, and to firmly nonexpansive
mappings. Various examples and counter-examples are presented, including some
concerning the celebrated Brezis-Haraux theorem.
