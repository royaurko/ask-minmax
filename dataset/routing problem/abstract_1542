The scope of this teaching package is to make a brief introduction to some
notions and properties of chaotic systems. We first make a brief introduction
to chaos in general and then we show some important properties of chaotic
systems using the logistic map and its bifurcation diagram. We also show the
universality found in "the route to chaos". The user is only required to have
notions of algebra, so it is quite accessible. The formal basis of chaos theory
are not covered in this introduction, but are pointed out for the reader
interested in them. Therefore, this package is also useful for people who are
interested in going deep into the mathematical theories, because it is a simple
introduction of the terminology, and because it points out which are the
original sources of information (so there is no danger in falling in the trap
of "Learn Chaos in 48 hours" or "Bifurcation Diagrams for Dummies"). The
included exercises are suggested for consolidating the covered topics. The
on-line resources are highly recommended for extending this brief induction.
