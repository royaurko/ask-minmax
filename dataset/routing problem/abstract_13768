The work provides an upper estimate of the best accuracy for the problem of
reconstructing derivatives based on function values at a given number of points
for the functions of Besov classes meeting the mixed Hoelder conditions. In
some cases this estimate appears to be stronger than the earlier respective
estimate obtained by the contributor in the problem being considered.
