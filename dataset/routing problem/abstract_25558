The problem of communication and state estimation is considered in the
context of channels with actiondependent states. Given the message to be
communicated, the transmitter chooses an action sequence that affects the
formation of the channel states, and then creates the channel input sequence
based on the state sequence. The decoder estimates the channel to some
distortion as well as decodes the message. The capacity-distortion tradeoff of
such a channel is characterized for the case when the state information is
available strictly causally at the channel encoder. The problem setting extends
the action dependent framework of [1] and as a special case recovers the
results of few previously considered joint communication and estimation
scenarios in [2], [3], [4]. The scenario when the action is also allowed to
depend on the past observed states (adaptive action) is also considered. It is
shown that such adaptive action yields an improved capacity-distortion
function.
