We show that a general purpose clusterization algorithm, Deterministic
Annealing, can be adapted to the problem of jet identification in particle
production by high energy collisions. In particular we consider the problem of
jet searching in events generated at hadronic colliders. Deterministic
Annealing is able to reproduce the results obtained by traditional jet
algorithms and to exhibit a higher degree of flexibility.
