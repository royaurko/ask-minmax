The attempts to prove the Four Color Problem last for long years. A little
hope arises that the properties of the minimal partial triangulations will be
very useful for the solution of the Four Color Problem. That is why the
material of this paper is devoted to the examination of the specific partial
graphs and their properties. Such graphs will have all the elements of the
planar triangulation, but will have the minimal size. And it will be quite
interesting to found out their properties in order to search in the sequel for
the possibility to prove the Four Color Problem on the base of their
characteristics.
