In this paper we consider the so-called Toda system of equations on a compact
surface. In particular, we discuss the parity of the Leray-Schauder degree of
that problem. Our main tool is a theorem of Krasnoselskii and Zabreiko on the
degree of maps symmetric with respect to a subspace. This result yields new
existence results as well as a new proof of previous results in literature.
