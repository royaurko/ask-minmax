We revisit the traveling salesman problem with neighborhoods (TSPN) and
present the first constant-ratio approximation for disks in the plane: Given a
set of $n$ disks in the plane, a TSP tour whose length is at most $O(1)$ times
the optimal with high probability can be computed in time that is polynomial in
$n$. Our result is the first constant-ratio approximation for a class of planar
convex bodies of arbitrary size and arbitrarily overlaps.
  In order to achieve a $O(1)$-approximation, we reduce the traveling salesman
problem with with disks, up to constant factors, to a minimum weight hitting
set problem in a geometric hypergraph. The connection between TSPN and hitting
sets in geometric hypergraphs, established here, is likely to have future
applications.
