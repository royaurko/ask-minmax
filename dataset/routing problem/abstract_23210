Some spontaneously broken gauge theories with left couplings to fermions,
like the abelian model that we propose here, can be endowed with a composite
scalar sector and Wess-Zumino field ; their quantization in the functionnal
integral formalism accordingly requires the introduction of constraints that,
together with the breaking of the gauge symmetry by the scalars, and among
other consequences, give the Higgs field and the fermions (quarks) infinite
masses; this makes them unobservable. Gauge invariance and unitarity are
achieved through a derivative coupling of the W-Z field to the fermionic
current; the anomaly gets cancelled in the above infinite fermion mass limit.
We show how the problems of renormalizability are evaded at the one-loop level
by resumming diagrams at the ladder approximation and reshuffling the
perturbative series, and because the fermionic current is conserved. The
Wess-Zumino field can be "gauged away" to become the 3rd polarization of the
massive gauge field; the pseudoscalar partner of the Higgs, tightly linked to
the W-Z field, behaves like an abelian pion. In particular, no extra scale of
interaction has to be introduced, unlike in "technicolour" theories. Problems
concerning the leptonic sector are only mentionned.
