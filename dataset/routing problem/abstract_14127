What is the effectiveness of local search algorithms for geometric problems
in the plane? We prove that local search with neighborhoods of magnitude
$1/\epsilon^c$ is an approximation scheme for the following problems in the
Euclidian plane: TSP with random inputs, Steiner tree with random inputs,
facility location (with worst case inputs), and bicriteria $k$-median (also
with worst case inputs). The randomness assumption is necessary for TSP.
