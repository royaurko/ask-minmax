There are many existing well known cost models for the list accessing
problem. The standard cost model developed by Sleator and Tarjan is most widely
used. In this paper, we have made a comprehensive study of the existing cost
models and proposed a new cost model for the list accessing problem. In our
proposed cost model, for calculating the processing cost of request sequence
using a singly linked list, we consider the access cost, matching cost and
replacement cost. The cost of processing a request sequence is the sum of
access cost, matching cost and replacement cost. We have proposed a novel
method for processing the request sequence which does not consider the
rearrangement of the list and uses the concept of buffering, matching, look
ahead and flag bit.
