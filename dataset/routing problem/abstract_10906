Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics is reformulated in terms of the convolution
of the original hydrodynamics equations, and the new evolution equations for
the particles are derived. The same evolution equation of motion is also
derived using a new action principle. The force acting on each particle is
determined by solving the Riemann problem. The use of the Riemann Solver
strengthens the method, making it accurate for the study of phenomena with
strong shocks. The prescription for the variable smoothing length is shown.
These techniques are implemented in strict conservation form. The results of a
few test problems are also shown.
