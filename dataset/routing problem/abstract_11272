Techniques of zero-temperature field theory that have found application in
the analysis of field theory at finite temperature are revisited. Specifically,
several of the results that are discussed are relevant to the study of
symmetry-changing phase transitions and high temperature QCD, which today are
among the most actively investigated problems in finite temperature field
theory.
