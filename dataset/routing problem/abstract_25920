We present a new algorithm, the Time Dependent Phase Space Filter (TDPSF)
which is used to solve time dependent Nonlinear Schrodinger Equations (NLS).
The algorithm consists of solving the NLS on a box with periodic boundary
conditions (by any algorithm). Periodically in time we decompose the solution
into a family of coherent states. Coherent states which are outgoing are
deleted, while those which are not are kept, reducing the problem of reflected
(wrapped) waves. Numerical results are given, and rigorous error estimates are
described.
  The TDPSF is compatible with spectral methods for solving the interior
problem. The TDPSF also fails gracefully, in the sense that the algorithm
notifies the user when the result is incorrect. We are aware of no other method
with this capability.
