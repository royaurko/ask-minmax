The leptonic bound states positronium and muonium are used to constrain
galileon contributions to the Lamb shift of muonic hydrogen. Through the
application of a variety of bounds on lepton compositeness, it is shown that
either the assumption of equating the charge radius of a particle with its
galileon scale radius is incompatible with experiments or the scale of
galileons must be $M>1.33$ GeV, too large to solve the muon problem. The
possibility of stronger constraints in the future from true muonium are
discussed.
