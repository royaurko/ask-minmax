Finding the most probable (MAP) model in SRL frameworks such as Markov logic
and Problog can, in principle, be solved by encoding the problem as a
`grounded-out' mixed integer program (MIP). However, useful first-order
structure disappears in this process motivating the development of first-order
MIP approaches. Here we present mfoilp, one such approach. Since the syntax and
semantics of mfoilp is essentially the same as existing approaches we focus
here mainly on implementation and algorithmic issues. We start with the
(conceptually) simple problem of using a logic program to generate a MIP
instance before considering more ambitious exploitation of first-order
representations.
