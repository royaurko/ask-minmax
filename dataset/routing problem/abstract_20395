The physical idea of the natural origin of diseases and deaths has been
presented. The fundamental microscopical reason is the destruction of any
metastable state by thermal activation of a nucleus of a nonreversable change.
On the basis of this idea the quantitative theory of age dependence of death
probability has been constructed. The obtained simple Death Laws are very
accurately fulfilled almost for all known diseases.
