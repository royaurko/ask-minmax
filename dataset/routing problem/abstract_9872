The naturalness problem might be studied on the complex two dimensional plane
with the technique of dimensional regularization(DREG). The Renormalization
group equation(RGE) of the Higgs mass on the plane suggests the Higgs mass
approaches zero at ultraviolate (UV) scale, the scale can be Planck scale when
the top quark pole mass $M_{t}=168$ GeV. The real issue of the naturalness
problem in the sense of Wilsonian renormalization group method is not about
quadratic divergences but the rescaling effect. The Higgs mass can be
considered to be one composed mass. All terms in the lagrangian in this
scenario are marginal terms and no relevant terms are left, thus no rescaling
effect to cause the naturalness problem anymore. RGE of the vacuum expectation
value (VEV) in the Landau gauge up to two-loop order is studied.
Scale-dependent behavior of the composed Higgs mass shows that we can have one
tiny Higgs mass at high energy scale, even around the Planck scale, when
$M_{t}\leq170.7$ GeV.
