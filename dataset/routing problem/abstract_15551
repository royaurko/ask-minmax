In the theoretical biology framework one fundamental problem is the so-called
error catastrophe in Darwinian evolution models. We reexamine Eigen's
fundamental equations by mapping them into a polymer depinning transition
problem in a ``genotype'' space represented by a unitary hypercubic lattice.
The exact solution of the model shows that error catastrophe arises as a direct
consequence of the equations involved and confirms some previous qualitative
results. The physically relevant consequence is that such equations are not
adequate to properly describe evolution of complex life on the Earth.
