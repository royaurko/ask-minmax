Voting problems are central in the area of social choice. In this article, we
investigate various voting systems and types of control of elections. We
present integer linear programming (ILP) formulations for a wide range of
NP-hard control problems. Our ILP formulations are flexible in the sense that
they can work with an arbitrary number of candidates and voters. Using the
off-the-shelf solver Cplex, we show that our approaches can manipulate
elections with a large number of voters and candidates efficiently.
