We introduce the confluent version of the quantum-mechanical supersymmetry
(SUSY) formalism for the Dirac equation with a pseudoscalar potential.
Application of the formalism to spectral problems is discussed, regularity
conditions for the transformed potentials are derived, and normalizability of
the transformed solutions is established. Our findings extend and complement
former results.
