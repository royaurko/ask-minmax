In this article we study convex integer maximization problems with composite
objective functions of the form $f(Wx)$, where $f$ is a convex function on
$\R^d$ and $W$ is a $d\times n$ matrix with small or binary entries, over
finite sets $S\subset \Z^n$ of integer points presented by an oracle or by
linear inequalities.
  Continuing the line of research advanced by Uri Rothblum and his colleagues
on edge-directions, we introduce here the notion of {\em edge complexity} of
$S$, and use it to establish polynomial and constant upper bounds on the number
of vertices of the projection $\conv(WS)$ and on the number of linear
optimization counterparts needed to solve the above convex problem.
  Two typical consequences are the following. First, for any $d$, there is a
constant $m(d)$ such that the maximum number of vertices of the projection of
any matroid $S\subset\{0,1\}^n$ by any binary $d\times n$ matrix $W$ is $m(d)$
regardless of $n$ and $S$; and the convex matroid problem reduces to $m(d)$
greedily solvable linear counterparts. In particular, $m(2)=8$. Second, for any
$d,l,m$, there is a constant $t(d;l,m)$ such that the maximum number of
vertices of the projection of any three-index $l\times m\times n$
transportation polytope for any $n$ by any binary $d\times(l\times m\times n)$
matrix $W$ is $t(d;l,m)$; and the convex three-index transportation problem
reduces to $t(d;l,m)$ linear counterparts solvable in polynomial time.
