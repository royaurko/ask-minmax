In the paper we prove the existence results for initial-value boundary value
problems for compressible isothermal Navier-Stokes equations. We restrict
ourselves to 2D case of a problem with no-slip condition for nonstationary
motion of viscous compressible isothermal fluid. However, the technique of
modeling and analysis presented here is general and can be used for 3D
problems.
