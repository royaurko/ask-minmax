We give in this paper a convergence result concerning parallel asynchronous
algorithm with bounded delays to solve a nonlinear fixed point problems. This
result is applied to calculate the solution of a strongly monotone operator.
Special cases of these operators are used to solve some problems related to
convex analysis like minimization of functionals, calculus of saddle point and
variational inequality problem.
