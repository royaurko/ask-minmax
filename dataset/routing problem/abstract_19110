We consider the following document ranking problem: We have a collection of
documents, each containing some topics (e.g. sports, politics, economics). We
also have a set of users with diverse interests. Assume that user u is
interested in a subset I_u of topics. Each user u is also associated with a
positive integer K_u, which indicates that u can be satisfied by any K_u topics
in I_u. Each document s contains information for a subset C_s of topics. The
objective is to pick one document at a time such that the average satisfying
time is minimized, where a user's satisfying time is the first time that at
least K_u topics in I_u are covered in the documents selected so far. Our main
result is an O({\rho})-approximation algorithm for the problem, where {\rho} is
the algorithmic integrality gap of the linear programming relaxation of the set
cover instance defined by the documents and topics. This result generalizes the
constant approximations for generalized min-sum set cover and ranking with
unrelated intents and the logarithmic approximation for the problem of ranking
with submodular valuations (when the submodular function is the coverage
function), and can be seen as an interpolation between these results. We
further extend our model to the case when each user may interest in more than
one sets of topics and when the user's valuation function is XOS, and obtain
similar results for these models.
