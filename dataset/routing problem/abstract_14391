In the context of using norms for controlling multi-agent systems, a vitally
important question that has not yet been addressed in the literature is the
development of mechanisms for monitoring norm compliance under partial action
observability. This paper proposes the reconstruction of unobserved actions to
tackle this problem. In particular, we formalise the problem of reconstructing
unobserved actions, and propose an information model and algorithms for
monitoring norms under partial action observability using two different
processes for reconstructing unobserved actions. Our evaluation shows that
reconstructing unobserved actions increases significantly the number of norm
violations and fulfilments detected.
