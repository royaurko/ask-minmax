In greedy geometric routing, messages are passed in a network embedded in a
metric space according to the greedy strategy of always forwarding messages to
nodes that are closer to the destination. We show that greedy geometric routing
schemes exist for the Euclidean metric in R^2, for 3-connected planar graphs,
with coordinates that can be represented succinctly, that is, with O(log n)
bits, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. Moreover, our embedding
strategy introduces a coordinate system for R^2 that supports distance
comparisons using our succinct coordinates. Thus, our scheme can be used to
significantly reduce bandwidth, space, and header size over other recently
discovered greedy geometric routing implementations for R^2.
