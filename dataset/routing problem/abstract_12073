In this paper, we consider Problem 14.44 in the Kourovka notebook, which is a
conjecture about the number of conjugacy classes of a finite group. While
elementary, this conjecture is still open and appears to elude any
straightforward proof, even in the soluble case. However, we do prove that a
minimal soluble counterexample must have certain properties, in particular that
it must have Fitting height at least 3 and order at least 2000.
