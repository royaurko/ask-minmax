A new effective solution to the problem of Hermite $G^1$ interpolation with a
clothoid curve is here proposed, that is a clothoid that interpolates two given
points in a plane with assigned unit tangent vectors. The interpolation problem
is a system of three nonlinear equations with multiple solutions which is
difficult to solve also numerically. Here the solution of this system is
reduced to the computation of the zeros of one single function in one variable.
The location of the zero associated to the relevant solution is studied
analytically: the interval containing the zero where the solution is proved to
exists and to be unique is provided. A simple guess function allows to find
that zero with very few iterations in all possible configurations.
  The computation of the clothoid curves and the solution algorithm call for
the evaluation of Fresnel related integrals. Such integrals need asymptotic
expansions near critical values to avoid loss of precision. This is necessary
when, for example, the solution of the interpolation problem is close to a
straight line or an arc of circle. A simple algorithm is presented for
efficient computation of the asymptotic expansion.
  The reduction of the problem to a single nonlinear function in one variable
and the use of asymptotic expansions make the present solution algorithm fast
and robust. In particular a comparison with algorithms present in literature
shows that the present algorithm requires less iterations. Moreover accuracy is
maintained in all possible configurations while other algorithms have a loss of
accuracy near the transition zones.
