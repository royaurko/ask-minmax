In this paper we show, in a systematic way, how to relate the Kepler problem
to the isotropic harmonic oscillator. Unlike previous approaches, our
constructions are carried over in the Lagrangian formalism dealing with second
order vector fields. We therefore provide a tangent bundle version of the
Kustaahneimo-Stiefel map.
