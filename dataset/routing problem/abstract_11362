Mirage mediation reduces the fine-tuning in the minimal supersymmetric
standard model by dynamically arranging a cancellation between anomaly-mediated
and modulus-mediated supersymmetry breaking. We explore the conditions under
which a mirage "messenger scale" is generated near the weak scale and the
little hierarchy problem is solved. We do this by explicitly including the
dynamics of the SUSY-breaking sector needed to cancel the cosmological
constant. The most plausible scenario for generating a low mirage scale does
not readily admit an extra-dimensional interpretation. We also review the
possibilities for solving the mu/Bmu problem in such theories, a potential
hidden source of fine-tuning.
