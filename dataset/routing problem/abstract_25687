Let $k$ be a number field, let $\theta$ be a nonzero algebraic number, and
let $H(\cdot)$ be the Weil height on the algebraic numbers. In response to a
question by T. Loher and D. W. Masser, we prove an asymptotic formula for the
number of $\alpha \in k$ with $H(\alpha \theta)\leq X$.
  We also prove an asymptotic counting result for a new class of height
functions defined via extension fields of $k$. This provides a conceptual
framework for Loher and Masser's problem and generalizations thereof.
  Moreover, we analyze the leading constant in our asymptotic formula for Loher
and Masser's problem. In particular, we prove a sharp upper bound in terms of
the classical Schanuel constant.
