High harmonic generation (HHG) enables extreme ultraviolet radiation with
table-top setups. Its exceptional properties, such as coherence and
(sub)-femtosecond pulse durations, have led to a diversity of applications.
Some of these require a high photon flux and megahertz repetition rates, e.g.
to avoid space charge effects in photoelectron spectroscopy. To date this has
only been achieved with enhancement cavities. Here, we establish a novel route
towards powerful HHG sources. By achieving phase-matched HHG of a megahertz
fibre laser we generate a broad plateau (25 eV - 40 eV) of strong harmonics,
each containing more than $10^{12}$ photons/s, which constitutes an increase by
more than one order of magnitude in that wavelength range. The strongest
harmonic (H25, 30 eV) has an average power of 143 $\mu$W ($3\cdot10^{13}$
photons/s). This concept will greatly advance and facilitate applications in
photoelectron or coincidence spectroscopy, coherent diffractive imaging or
(multidimensional) surface science.
