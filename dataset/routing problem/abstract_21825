A method for an evaluation of the error between an unknown parameter and its
estimator is developed. Its application enables us to preserve the asymptotic
power of a constructed test. Testing problems in AR(1) and ARCH models are
studied with a derivation of the asymptotic power function. Also the results
are extended to AR(m) time series model.
