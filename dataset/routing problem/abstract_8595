A \emph{wheel} is a graph made of a cycle of length at least~4 together with
a vertex that has at least three neighbors in the cycle. We prove that the
problem whose instance is a graph $G$ and whose question is "does $G$ contains
a wheel as an induced subgraph" is NP-complete. We also settle the complexity
of several similar problems.
