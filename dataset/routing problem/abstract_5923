We present a subset method that solves the sign problem for QCD at nonzero
quark chemical potential in 0+1 dimensions. The subsets of gauge configurations
are constructed using the center symmetry of the SU(3) group. These subsets
completely solve the sign problem for up to five flavors. For a larger number
of flavors the sign problem slowly reappears, and we propose an extension of
the subsets that also solves the sign problem for these cases. The subset
method allows for numerical simulations of the model at nonzero chemical
potential. We also present some preliminary results on subsets for QCD in two,
three, and four dimensions.
