We address in this paper a new computational biology problem that aims at
understanding a mechanism that could potentially be used to genetically
manipulate natural insect populations infected by inherited, intra-cellular
parasitic bacteria. In this problem, that we denote by \textsc{Mod/Resc
Parsimony Inference}, we are given a boolean matrix and the goal is to find two
other boolean matrices with a minimum number of columns such that an
appropriately defined operation on these matrices gives back the input. We show
that this is formally equivalent to the \textsc{Bipartite Biclique Edge Cover}
problem and derive some complexity results for our problem using this
equivalence. We provide a new, fixed-parameter tractability approach for
solving both that slightly improves upon a previously published algorithm for
the \textsc{Bipartite Biclique Edge Cover}. Finally, we present experimental
results where we applied some of our techniques to a real-life data set.
