We introduce a framework for proving lower bounds on computational problems
over distributions, for a class of algorithms called statistical algorithms.
For such algorithms, access to the input distribution is limited to obtaining
an estimate of the expectation of any given function on a sample drawn randomly
from the input distribution, rather than directly accessing samples. Most
natural algorithms of interest in theory and in practice, e.g., moments-based
methods, local search, standard iterative methods for convex optimization, MCMC
and simulated annealing rely only on such estimates and can be viewed as
statistical algorithms.
  Our framework is inspired by and generalizes the statistical query model in
learning theory (Kearns, 1998). Our main application is a nearly optimal lower
bound on the complexity of any statistical algorithm for detecting planted
bipartite clique distributions (or planted dense subgraph distributions) when
the planted clique has size $O(n^{1/2-\delta})$ for any constant $\delta > 0$.
Variants of this problem have been assumed to be hard for applications in
cryptography and to prove hardness of other problems; our lower bounds provide
concrete evidence of hardness.
