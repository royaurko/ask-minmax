We define a new Hurwitz problem which is essentially a small core of the
simple Hurwitz problem. The corresponding Hurwitz numbers have simpler
formulae, satisfy effective recursion relations and determine the simple
Hurwitz numbers. We also apply this idea of finding a smaller simpler
enumerative problem to orbifold Hurwitz numbers and Belyi Hurwitz numbers.
