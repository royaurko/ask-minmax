We determine the location $\lambda_c$ of the mobility edge in the spectrum of
the hermitian Wilson operator on quenched ensembles. We confirm a theoretical
picture of localization proposed for the Aoki phase diagram. When $\lambda_c>0$
we also determine some key properties of the localized eigenmodes with
eigenvalues $|\lambda|<\lambda_c$. Our results lead to simple tests for the
validity of simulations with overlap and domain-wall fermions.
