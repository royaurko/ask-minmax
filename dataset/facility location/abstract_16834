The goal of the paper is to present new results on light echoes from young
stellar objects. Broad band CCD images were obtained over three months at
one-to-two week intervals for the field of NGC 6726, using the large
field-of-view remotely-operated telescope on top of Cerro Burek. We detected
scattered light echoes around two young, low-amplitude, irregular variable
stars. Observations revealed not just one, but multiple light echoes from
brightness pulses of the T Tauri star S CrA and the Herbig Ae/Be star R CrA.
Analysis of S CrA's recurring echoes suggests that the star is located 138 +/-
16 pc from Earth, making these the closest echoes ever detected. The
environment that scatters the stellar light from S CrA is compatible with an
incomplete dust shell or an inclined torus some 10,000 AU in radius and
containing $\sim$ $2 \times 10^{-3}$ $M_{\sun}$ of dust. The cause of such
concentration at $\sim$ 10,000AU from the star is unknown. It could be the
remnant of the envelope from which the star formed, but the distance of the
cloud is remarkably similar to the nominal distance of the Oort cloud to the
Sun, leading us to also speculate that the dust (or ice) seen around S CrA
might have the same origin as the Solar System Oort cloud.
