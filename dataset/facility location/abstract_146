We present here mid-infrared images of seven sites of water maser emission
thought to be associated with the hot molecular core (HMC) phase of massive
star formation. Observations were obtained at the NASA InfraRed Telescope
Facility 3-m, the Gemini 8-m, and Keck II 10-m telescopes. We have detected
mid-infrared sources at the locations of two HMC candidates, G11.94-0.62 and
G45.07-0.13. We observed G19.61-0.23 and G34.26+0.15, each of which have HMCs
previously detected in the mid-infrared. We did not detect mid-infrared
emission from either HMC source, and we place new upper limits on the
mid-infrared flux densities for these HMCs that are much lower than their
previously reported flux densities. We were able to obtain extremely accurate
astrometry for our mid-infrared images of G9.62+0.19, and conclude that the
mid-infrared emission thought to be coming from the HMC in this field is in
fact coming from a different source altogether.
