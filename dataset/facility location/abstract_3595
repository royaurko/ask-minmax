We explore a scenario that allows for a strong first order phase-transition
of QCD at non-negligible baryon number in the early universe and its possible
cosmological observable consequences. The main assumption is a quasi-stable
QCD-vacuum state that leads to a short period of inflation, consequently
diluting the net baryon to photon ratio to it's today observed value. A strong
mechanism for baryogenesis is needed to start out with a baryon asymmetry of
order unity, e.g. as provided by Affleck-Dine baryogenesis. The cosmological
implications are direct effects on primordial density fluctuations up to dark
matter mass scales of 1 - 10 solar masses, change in the spectral slope up to
mass scales of 10^6 - 10^8 solar masses, production of primordial magnetic
fields with initial strength up to 10^12 Gauss and a gravitational wave
spectrum with present day peak strain amplitude of at most h_c = 5 * 10^-15
around a frequency of 4*10^-8 Hz. The little QCD inflation scenario could be
probed with the upcoming heavy ion research facility FAIR at GSI, Darmstadt.
