We present surface spot maps of the K2V primary star in the pre-cataclysmic
variable binary system, V471 Tau. The spot maps show the presence of large high
latitude spots located at the sub-white dwarf longitude region. By tracking the
relative movement of spot groups over the course of four nights (eight rotation
cycles), we measure the surface differential rotation rate of the system.Our
results reveal that the star is rotating rigidly with a surface shear rate,
dOmega = 1.6 +/- 6 mrad/d. The single active star AB Dor has a similar spectral
type, rotation period, and activity level as the K star in V471 Tau but
displays much stronger surface shear (46 < dOmega < 58 mrad/d). Our results
suggest that tidal locking may inhibit differential rotation; this reduced
shear, however, does not affect the overall magnetic activity levels in active
K dwarfs.
