We report the detection of a new low-mass stellar companion to the white
dwarf HIP 3678 A, the central star of the planetary nebula NGC 246. The newly
found companion is located about 1 arcsec (at projected separation of about 500
au) north-east of HIP 3678 A, and shares a common proper motion with the white
dwarf and its known comoving companion HIP 3678 B. The hypothesis that the
newly detected companion is a non-moving background object can be rejected on a
significance level of more than 8 $\sigma$, by combining astrometric
measurements from the literature with follow-up astrometry, obtained with Wild
Field Planetary Camera 2/\textit{Hubble Space Telescope} and NACO/Very Large
Telescope. From our deep NACO imaging data, we can rule out additional stellar
companions of the white dwarf with projected separations between 130 up to 5500
au. In the deepest high-contrast NACO observation, we achieve a detection limit
in the \textit{Ks} band of about 20 mag, which allows the detection of brown
dwarf companions with masses down to 36$\,\rmn{M_{jup}}$ at an assumed age of
the system of 260 Myr. To approximate the masses of the companions HIP 3678 B
and C, we use the evolutionary Baraffe et al. models and obtain about
0.85\,M$_{\sun}$ for HIP 3678 B and about 0.1 M$_{\sun}$ for HIP 3678 C.
According to the derived absolute photometry, HIP 3678 B should be a early to
mid-K dwarf (K2--K5), while HIP 3678 C should be a mid-M dwarf with a spectral
type in the range between M5 and M6.
