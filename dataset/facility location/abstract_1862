Multiple scattering of radio waves by artificial random irregularities
HF-induced in the ionosphere F region may cause significant attenuation of both
ordinary and extraordinary waves together with common anomalous absorption of
ordinary waves due to their non-linear conversion into plasma waves. To
demonstrate existence and strength of this effect, direct measurements of
attenuation of both powerful pump wave and weak probing waves of extraordinary
polarization have been carried out during an experimental campaign on September
6, 7 and 9, 1999 at the Sura heating facility. The attenuation magnitude of
extraordinary waves reaches of 1-10 dB over a background attenuation caused by
natural irregularities. It is interpreted in the paper on the base of the
theory of multiple scattering from the artificial random irregularities with
characteristic scale lengths of 0.1-1 km. Simple procedure for determining of
irregularity spectrum parameters from the measured attenuation of extraordinary
waves has been implemented and some conclusions about the artificial
irregularity formation have been obtained.
