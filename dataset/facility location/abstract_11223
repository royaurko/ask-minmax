Design of new cheap aerial pipelines, a large flexible tube deployed at high
altitude, for delivery of natural (fuel) gas, water and other payload over a
long distance is delineated. The main component of the natural gas is methane
which has a specific weight less than air. A lift force of one cubic meter of
methane equals approximately 0.5 kg (1 pound). The lightweight film flexible
pipeline can be located in air at high altitude and, as such, does not damage
the environment. Using the lift force of this pipeline and wing devices
payloads of oil, water, or other fluids, or even solids such as coal, cargo,
passengers can be delivered cheaply at long distance. This aerial pipeline
dramatically decreases the cost and the time of construction relative to
conventional pipelines of steel which saves energy and greatly lowers the
capital cost of construction. The article contains a computed project for
delivery 24 billion cubic meters of gas and tens of million tons of oil, water
or other payload per year.
