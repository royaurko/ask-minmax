The discovery of the second equatorial ionized stellar wind from a massive
young stellar object is reported. High resolution radio continuum maps of S140
IRS 1 reveal a highly elongated source that is perpendicular to the larger
scale bipolar molecular outflow. This picture is confirmed by location of a
small scale monopolar near-IR reflection nebula at the base of the blueshifted
lobe. A second epoch of observations over a five year baseline show little
ordered outward proper motion of clumps as would have been expected for a jet.
A third epoch, taken only 50 days after the second, did show significant
changes in the radio morphology. These radio properties can all be understood
in the context of an equatorial wind driven by radiation pressure from the
central star and inner disc acting on the gas in the surface layers of the disc
as proposed by Drew et al. (1998). This equatorial wind system is briefly
compared with the one in S106IR, and contrasted with other massive young
stellar objects that drive ionized jets.
