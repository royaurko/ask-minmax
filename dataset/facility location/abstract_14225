Light harvesting by photosystem II (PSII) in plants is highly efficient and
acclimates to rapid changes in the intensity of sunlight. However, the
mechanisms of PSII light harvesting have remained experimentally inaccessible.
Using a structure-based model of excitation energy flow in 200 nanometer (nm) x
200 nm patches of the grana membrane, where PSII is located, we accurately
simulated chlorophyll fluorescence decay data with no free parameters.
Excitation movement through the light harvesting antenna is diffusive, but
becomes subdiffusive in the presence of charge separation at reaction centers.
The influence of membrane morphology on light harvesting efficiency is
determined by the excitation diffusion length of 50 nm in the antenna. Our
model provides the basis for understanding how nonphotochemical quenching
mechanisms affect PSII light harvesting in grana membranes.
