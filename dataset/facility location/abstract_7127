The debate about how antimatter or different antimatter systems behave
gravitationally will be ultimately decided by experiments measuring directly
the acceleration of various antimatter probes in the gravitational field of the
Earth or perhaps redshift effects in antimatter atoms caused by the annual
variation of the Sun's gravitational potential at the location of the Earth.
Muonium atoms may be used to probe the gravitational interaction of leptonic,
second generation antimatter. We discuss the progress of our work towards
enabling such experiments with muonium.
