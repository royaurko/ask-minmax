Bulk properties of ionic liquid crystals are investigated using density
functional theory. The liquid crystal molecules are represented by ellipsoidal
particles with charges located in their center or at their tails. Attractive
interactions are taken into account in terms of the Gay-Berne pair potential.
Rich phase diagrams involving vapor, isotropic and nematic liquid, as well as
smectic phases are found. The dependence of the phase behavior on various
parameters such as the length of the particles and the location of charges on
the particles is studied.
