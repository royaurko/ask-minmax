We provide a new kriging procedure of processes on graphs. Based on the
construction of Gaussian random processes indexed by graphs, we extend to this
framework the usual linear prediction method for spatial random fields, known
as kriging. We provide the expression of the estimator of such a random field
at unobserved locations as well as a control for the prediction error.
