We consider Fe-based superconductors with s^{+-} gap with accidental nodes on
electron pockets. We analyze how the gap structure changes if we include into
the consideration the hybridization between the two electron pockets (the
inter-pocket hopping term with momentum (pi,pi,pi). We derive the hybridization
term and relate it to the absence of inversion symmetry in the Fe-plane because
of two non-equivalent locations of pnictogen (chalcogen) above and below the
plane. We find that the hybridization tends to eliminate the nodes -- as it
increases, the pairs of neighboring nodes approach each other, merge and
disappear once the hybridization exceeds a certain threshold. The nodes
disappear first around k_z =pi/2, and vertical line nodes split into two
vertical loops centered at k_z =0 and k_z = pi. We also show that the
hybridization moves the nodes along the loops away from the normal state Fermi
surfaces. This creates a subset of k-points at which the peak in the spectral
function does not shift as the system enters into a superconducting state
("no-shift" lines). These "no-shift" lines evolve with increasing hybridization
in highly non-trivial manner and eventually form horizontal loops in (k_x, k_y)
plane, surrounding the nodes. Both vertical line nodes and horizontal
"no-shift" loops surrounding them should be detectable in photoemission
experiments.
