We report our attempts to locate the progenitor of the type Ic SN 2004gt in
NGC 4038. We use high resolution HST ACS images of SN 2004gt and have compared
them with deep pre-explosion HST WFPC2 F336W, F439W, F555W and F814W images. We
identify the SN location on the pre-explosion frames with an accuracy of 5mas.
We show that the progenitor is below the detection thresholds of all the
pre-explosion images. These detection limits are used to place luminosity and
mass limits on the progenitor, by comparing them with stellar evolution tracks
on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The progenitor of SN 2004gt seems to be
restricted to a low-luminosity high-temperature star, either a single WC star
with initial mass $>40M_{\odot}$ or a low mass star in a binary. The
pre-explosion data cannot distinguish between the two scenarios.
