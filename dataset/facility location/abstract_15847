Pinpointing the progenitors of long duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) remains
an extremely important question, although it is now clear that at least a
fraction of LGRBs originate in the core collapse of massive stars in type Ic
supernovae, the pathways to the production of these stars, and their initial
masses, remain uncertain. Rotation is thought to be vital in the creation of
LGRBs, and it is likely that black hole creation is also necessary. We suggest
that these two constraints can be met if the GRB progenitors are very massive
stars (>20 solar masses) and are formed in tight binary systems. Using simple
models we compare the predictions of this scenario with observations and find
that the location of GRBs on their host galaxies are suggestive of
main-sequence masses in excess of 20 solar masses, while 50% of the known
compact binary systems may have been sufficiently close to have had the
necessary rotation rates for GRB creation. Thus, massive stars in compact
binaries are a likely channel for at least some fraction of LGRBs.
