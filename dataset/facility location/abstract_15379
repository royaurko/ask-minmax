We studied the distribution of dust clouds around the central engine of NGC
1068 based on shifted-and-added 8.8 - 12.3 micron (MIR) multi-filter images and
3.0 - 3.9 micron (L-band) spectra obtained with the Subaru Telescope. In a
region of 100 pc (1.4") around the central peak, we successfully constructed
maps of color temperatures and emissivities of the MIR and L-band continua as
well as the 9.7 micron and 3.4 micron dust features with spatial resolutions of
26 pc (0.37") in the MIR and 22 pc (0.3") in the L-band. Our main results are:
1) color temperature of the MIR continuum scatters around the thermal
equilibrium temperature with the central engine as the heat source while that
of the L-band continuum is higher and independent upon distance from the
central engine; 2) the peak of the 9.7 micron silicate absorption feature is
shifted to a longer wavelength at some locations; 3) the ratio of the optical
depths of the dust features is different from the Galactic values and show
complicated spatial distribution; and 4) there is a pie shaped warm dust cloud
as an enhancement in the emissivity of the MIR continuum extending about 50 pc
to the north from the central engine. We speculate that material falls into the
central engine through this cloud.
