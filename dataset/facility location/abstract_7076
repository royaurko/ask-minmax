The requirements on the Final Focusing System (FFS) for a new linear collider
has lead to lattice designs where chromaticity is corrected either locally or
non-locally. Here, we present the status of an alternative lattice design
developed for the current CLIC 500GeV beam parameters where chromaticity is
corrected upstream the Final Doublet (FD) and the geometrical components in the
vertical plane are corrected locally. The diagnose of this design showed to
possible variations two the lattice : the second order dispersion and its
derivative with respect to $s$ must be cancelled before the FD, or some
dispersion must be tolerated at the sextupole located inside the FD.
