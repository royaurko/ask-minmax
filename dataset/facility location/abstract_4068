We present Bolocam observations of two galaxy cluster candidates reported as
unconfirmed in the Planck early Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (eSZ) sample, PLCKESZ
G115.71+17.52 and PLCKESZ G189.84-37.24. We observed each of these candidates
with Bolocam at 140 GHz from the Caltech Submm Observatory in October 2011. The
resulting images have white noise levels of ~30 {\mu}KCMB-arcmin in their
central regions. We find a significant SZ decrement towards PLCKESZ G115.71.
This decrement has a false detection probability of 5.3\times10-5, and we
therefore confirm PLCKESZ G115.71 as a cluster. The maximum SZ decrement
towards PLCKESZ G189.84 corresponds to a false detection probability of 0.027,
and it therefore remains as an unconfirmed cluster candidate. In order to make
our SZ-derived results more robust, we have also analyzed data from the
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) at the location of each cluster
candidate. We find an overdensity of WISE sources consistent with other
clusters in the eSZ at the location of PLCKESZ G115.71, providing further
evidence that it is a cluster. We do not find a significant overdensity of WISE
sources at the location of PLCKESZ G189.84.
