We present a near-infrared (K'-band) survey of 0.7 square degree area in the
Alpha Persei open cluster (age = 90 Myr, distance = 182 pc) carried out with
the Omega-Prime camera on the Calar Alto 3.5-m telescope. Combining optical
data (Rc and Ic) obtained with the KPNO/MOSA detector and presented in Stauffer
et al. (1999) with the K' observations, a sample of new candidate members has
been extracted from the optical-infrared colour-magnitude diagram. The location
of these candidates in the colour-colour diagram suggests that two-thirds of
them are actually reddened background giants. About 20 new candidate members
with masses between 0.3 and 0.04 Msun are added to the 400 known Alpha Per
cluster members. If they are indeed Alpha Per members, four of the new
candidates would be brown dwarfs. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of
the near-infrared survey as compared to the optical selection method. We also
describe the outcome of optical spectroscopy obtained with the Twin
spectrograph on the Calar Alto 3.5-m telescope for about 30 candidates,
including selected members from the optical sample presented in Barrado y
Navascues et al. (2002) and from our joint optical/infrared catalogue. These
results argue in favour of the optical selection method for this particular
cluster.
