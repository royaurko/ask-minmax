The process by which new ideas, innovations, and behaviors spread through a
large social network can be thought of as a networked interaction game: Each
agent obtains information from certain number of agents in his friendship
neighborhood, and adapts his idea or behavior to increase his benefit. In this
paper, we are interested in how opinions, about a certain topic, form in social
networks. We model opinions as continuous scalars ranging from 0 to 1 with 1(0)
representing extremely positive(negative) opinion. Each agent has an initial
opinion and incurs some cost depending on the opinions of his neighbors, his
initial opinion, and his stubbornness about his initial opinion. Agents
iteratively update their opinions based on their own initial opinions and
observing the opinions of their neighbors. The iterative update of an agent can
be viewed as a myopic cost-minimization response (i.e., the so-called best
response) to the others' actions. We study whether an equilibrium can emerge as
a result of such local interactions and how such equilibrium possibly depends
on the network structure, initial opinions of the agents, and the location of
stubborn agents and the extent of their stubbornness. We also study the
convergence speed to such equilibrium and characterize the convergence time as
a function of aforementioned factors. We also discuss the implications of such
results in a few well-known graphs such as Erdos-Renyi random graphs and
small-world graphs.
