A coaxial microwave plasma setup was designed for investigation by optical
and laser diagnostics. The plasma is sustained by two microwave power sources
located at both ends of a coaxial line. This allows generating an axially
homogeneous glow discharge at low pressure. For increasing pressures, this
glow-like mode is found to be unstable and various self-organized patterns are
observed including finger-like structures which can be sustained after the
visible end of the plasma column.
