Extensive Monte Carlo data analysis gives clear evidence that collapsed
linear polymers in two dimensions fall in the universality class of athermal,
dense self-avoiding walks, as conjectured by B.Duplantier [Phys.Rev.Lett. 71,
4274 (1993)]. However, the boundary of the globule has self affine roughness
and does not determine the anticipated nonzero topological boundary
contribution to entropic exponents. Scaling corrections are due to subleading
contributions to the partition function corresponding to polymer configurations
with one end located on the globule-solvent interface.
