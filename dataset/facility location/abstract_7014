We find out the smearing/ transfer functions that relate a local bulk
operator with its boundary values at a cut-off surface located at $z=z_0$ of
the AdS Poincar\'{e} patch. We compare these results with de Sitter
counterparts and comment on their connections with corresponding construction
for dS/ CFT. As the boundary values can help define the required field theory
at $z=z_0$ and encode bulk locality in terms of it, our work can provide key
information about holographic RG in the context of AdS/ CFT.
