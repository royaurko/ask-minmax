Observations of hot stars belonging to the young cluster LMC-NGC2004 and its
surrounding region have been obtained with the VLT-GIRAFFE facilities in MEDUSA
mode. 25 Be stars were discovered; the proportion of Be stars compared to
B-type stars is found to be of the same order in the LMC and in the Galaxy
fields. 23 hot stars were discovered as spectroscopic binaries (SB1 and SB2), 5
of these are found to be eclipsing systems from the MACHO database, with
periods of a few days. About 75% of the spectra in our sample are polluted by
hydrogen (Halpha and Hgamma), [SII] and [NII] nebular lines. These lines are
typical of HII regions. They could be associated with patchy nebulosities with
a bi-modal distribution in radial velocity, with higher values (+335 kms^{-1})
preferentially seen inside the southern part of the known bubble LMC4 observed
in HI at 21 cm.
