We propose the Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect for four entangled spin-half
particles carrying magnetic moments in the presence of impenetrable line
charge. The four particle state undergoes AC phase shift in two causually
disconnected region which can show up in the correlations between different
spin states of distant particles. This correlation can violate Bell's
inequality, thus displaying the non-locality for four particle entangled states
in an objective way. Also, we have suggested how to control the AC phase shift
locally at two distant locations to test Bell's inequality. We belive that
although the single particle AC effect may not be non-local but the entangled
state AC effect is a non-local one.
