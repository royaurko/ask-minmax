The catalogue of close neighbors of Markarian galaxies located inside of
circles with radii 60 kpc from the centers of Markarian objects is presented,
which combines extensive new measurements of their optical parameters with a
literature and database search. The measurements were made using images
extracted from the Digitized Sky Survey (DSS) Jpg (blue), Fpg (red) and Ipg
(near-infrared) band photographic plates. We provide names, accurate
coordinates, redshifts, morphological types, blue, red and near-infrared
apparent magnitudes, apparent blue major diameters, axial ratios, as well as
position angles for the neighbor galaxies. We also include their 2MASS infrared
magnitudes. The total number of Markarian galaxies in the database is 274 and
number of their neighbors is 359. The physical parameters of the systems of
Markarian galaxies and their neighbors are determined and presented.
