A model-independent experimental signature for flavor oscillations in the
neutrino signal from the next Galactic supernova (SN) would be the observation
of Earth matter effects. We calculate the probability for observing a Galactic
SN shadowed by the Earth as a function of the detector's geographic latitude.
This probability depends only mildly on details of the Galactic SN
distribution. A location at the North Pole would be optimal with a shadowing
probability of about 60%, but a far-northern location such as Pyhasalmi in
Finland, the proposed site for a large-volume scintillator detector, is almost
equivalent (58%). We also consider several pairs of detector locations and
calculate the probability that only one of them is shadowed, allowing a
comparison between a shadowed and a direct signal. For the South Pole combined
with Kamioka this probability is almost 75%, for the South Pole combined with
Pyhasalmi it is almost 90%. One particular scenario consists of a large-volume
scintillator detector located in Pyhasalmi to measure the geo-neutrino flux in
a continental location and another such detector in Hawaii to measure it in an
oceanic location. The probability that only one of them is shadowed exceeds 50%
whereas the probability that at least one is shadowed is about 80%. We provide
an online tool to calculate different shadowing probabilities for the one- and
two-detector cases.
