This paper describes a new technique for the alignment of crystal radiators
used to produce high energy, linearly polarized photons via coherent
bremsstrahlung scattering at electron beam facilities. In these experiments the
crystal is mounted on a goniometer which is used to adjust its orientation
relative to the electron beam. The angles and equations which relate the
crystal lattice, goniometer and electron beam direction are presented here, and
the method of alignment is illustrated with data taken at MAMI (the Mainz
microtron). A practical guide to setting up a coherent bremsstrahlung facility
and installing new crystals using this technique is also included.
