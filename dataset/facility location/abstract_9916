Numerical solutions of the standard electrokinetic model provide a basis for
interpreting a variety of electrokinetic phenomena involving `bare' colloids.
However, the model rests on the classical notion of a shear or slipping plane,
whose location is unknown when surfaces are coated with permeable polymer.
Consequently, an electrokinetic model for `soft', `hairy' or `fuzzy' colloids
has been developed, but until recently solutions were available only for
several restricted cases, most notably for particles with thin, uniform layers,
and without polarization and relaxation. Here we present numerically exact
solutions of the full model for a variety of soft colloids, including
PEG-coated liposomes, PEO-coated latices, human erythrocytes, and
polyelectrolyte micelles. Particular attention is given to linking the
thickness, density and permeability of the coatings, which are key parameters
in the model, to ``physical'' quantities, such as the polymer molecular weight,
adsorbed amount, and hydrodynamic layer thickness. This paper also identifies
limits--on the ionic strength, particle size, layer thickness and
permeability--beyond which earlier theories breakdown. In short, polarization
and relaxation are as influential on the mobility of soft colloids as they are
for `bare' particles.
