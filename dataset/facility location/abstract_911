Beta-beams is a new concept for the production of intense and pure neutrino
beams. It is at the basis of a proposed neutrino facility, whose main goal is
to explore the possible existence of CP violation in the lepton sector. Here we
briefly review the original scenario and the low energy beta-beam. This option
would offer a unique opportunity to perform neutrino interaction studies of
interest for particle physics, astrophysics and nuclear physics. Other proposed
scenarios for the search of CP violation are mentioned.
