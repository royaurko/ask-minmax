The atomic surface and interface structure of bare and metal-coated ZnO(0001)
Zn-polar wafers were investigated via surface x-ray diffraction. All bare
samples showed the presence of a (1x1) overlayer of oxygen atoms located at the
on-top position above the terminating Zn atom, a structure predicted to be
unstable by several density functional theory calculations. The same oxygen
overlayer is clearly seen at the interface of ZnO with both elemental and
oxidized metal contact layers. No significant atomic relaxations are observed
at surfaces and interfaces processed under typical device fabrication
conditions.
