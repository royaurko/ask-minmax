We performed an experiment on elementary hydrodynamics. The basic system is a
cylindrical bottle from which water flows through a pin-hole located at the
bottom of its lateral surface. We measured the speed of the water leaving the
pin-hole, as a function of both the time and the current level of water still
inside the bottle. The experimental results are compared with the theory. The
theoretical treatment is a very simple one based on mass and energy
conservation, corresponding to a widespread exercise usually adopted in
university basic disciplines of Physics.
  We extended the previous experiment to another similar system using two equal
bottles with equal pin-holes. The water flowing from the first bottle feeds the
second one located below it. The same concepts of mass and energy conservation
now lead to a non-trivial differential equation for the lowest bottle dynamics.
We solved this equation both numerically and analytically, comparing the
results with the experimental data.
