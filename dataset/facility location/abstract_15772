We consider the parabolic Anderson problem $\partial_tu=\Delta u+\xi(x)u$ on
$\mathbb{R}_+\times\mathbb{Z}^d$ with localized initial condition
$u(0,x)=\delta_0(x)$ and random i.i.d. potential $\xi$. Under the assumption
that the distribution of $\xi(0)$ has a double-exponential, or slightly
heavier, tail, we prove the following geometric characterization of
intermittency: with probability one, as $t\to\infty$, the overwhelming
contribution to the total mass $\sum_xu(t,x)$ comes from a slowly increasing
number of ``islands'' which are located far from each other. These ``islands''
are local regions of those high exceedances of the field $\xi$ in a box of side
length $2t\log^2t$ for which the (local) principal Dirichlet eigenvalue of the
random operator $\Delta+\xi$ is close to the top of the spectrum in the box. We
also prove that the shape of $\xi$ in these regions is nonrandom and that
$u(t,\cdot)$ is close to the corresponding positive eigenfunction. This is the
geometric picture suggested by localization theory for the Anderson
Hamiltonian.
