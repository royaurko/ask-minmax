We report on spectropolarimetric observations of a near-IR line of Mn I
located at 15262.702 A whose intensity and polarization profiles are very
sensitive to the presence of hyperfine structure. A theoretical investigation
of the magnetic sensitivity of this line to the magnetic field uncovers several
interesting properties. The most important one is that the presence of strong
Paschen-Back perturbations due to the hyperfine structure produces an intensity
line profile whose shape changes according to the absolute value of the
magnetic field strength. A line ratio technique is developed from the intrinsic
variations of the line profile. This line ratio technique is applied to
spectropolarimetric observations of the quiet solar photosphere in order to
explore the probability distribution function of the magnetic field strength.
Particular attention is given to the quietest area of the observed field of
view, which was encircled by an enhanced network region. A detailed theoretical
investigation shows that the inferred distribution yields information on the
average magnetic field strength and the spatial scale at which the magnetic
field is organized. A first estimation gives ~250 G for the mean field strength
and a tentative value of ~0.45" for the spatial scale at which the observed
magnetic field is horizontally organized.
