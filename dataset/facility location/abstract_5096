Chimera states consisting of domains of coherently and incoherently
oscillating nonlocally-coupled phase oscillators in systems with spatial
inhomogeneity are studied. The inhomogeneity is introduced through the
dependence of the oscillator frequency on its location. Two types of spatial
inhomogeneity, localized and spatially periodic, are considered and their
effects on the existence and properties of multi-cluster and traveling chimera
states are explored. The inhomogeneity is found to break up splay states, to
pin the chimera states to specific locations and to trap traveling chimeras.
Many of these states can be studied by constructing an evolution equation for a
complex order parameter. Solutions of this equation are in good agreement with
the results of numerical simulations.
