Deep Web databases contain more than 90% of pertinent information of the Web.
Despite their importance, users don't profit of this treasury. Many deep web
services are offering competitive services in term of prices, quality of
service, and facilities. As the number of services is growing rapidly, users
have difficulty to ask many web services in the same time. In this paper, we
imagine a system where users have the possibility to formulate one query using
one query interface and then the system translates query to the rest of query
interfaces. However, interfaces are created by designers in order to be
interpreted visually by users, machines can not interpret query from a given
interface. We propose a new approach which emulates capacity of interpretation
of users and extracts query from deep web query interfaces. Our approach has
proved good performances on two standard datasets.
