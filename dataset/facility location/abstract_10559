Wigner-type distributions have shown their effectiveness in classification
problems of sonar and radar. We present an overview of applications where
resonance features in echoes scattered from targets insonified or illuminated
with short pulses are studied in the joint time-frequency domain. We first show
the acoustic case of an elastic shell with a few filler materials submerged in
water and insonified by the "clicks" dolphins generate when they are
echo-locating the targets to classify them. The second example deals with a
ground-penetrating radar used to identify buried land mines. We have compared
the performance of various time-frequency distributions as well as a technique
to combine these with a "fuzzy-cluster" representation of the subsurface target
signatures.
