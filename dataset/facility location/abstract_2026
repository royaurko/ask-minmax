Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are relativistic cosmological beacons of transient
high energy radiation whose afterglows span the electromagnetic spectrum.
Theoretical expectations of correlated neutrino emission position GRBs at an
astrophysical nexus for a metamorphosis in our understanding of the Cosmos.
This new dawn in the era of experimental (particle) astrophysics and cosmology
is afforded by current facilities enabling the novel astronomy of high energy
neutrinos, in concert with unprecedented electromagnetic coverage. In that
regard, GRBs represent a compelling scientific theme that may facilitate
fundamental breakthroughs in the context of Swift, Fermi and IceCube.
Scientific synergy will be achieved by leveraging the combined sensitivity of
contemporaneous ground-based and satellite observatories, thus optimizing their
collective discovery potential. Hence, the advent of GRB multi-messenger
astronomy may cement an explicit connection to fundamental physics, via nascent
cosmic windows, throughout the next decade.
