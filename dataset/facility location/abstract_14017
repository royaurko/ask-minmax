At the 17th J-PARC PAC, which was held on September 2013, we proposed the
sterile neutrino search at J-PARC MLF. After reviewing the proposal, PAC
recommended to have a background measurement at the detector's candidate site
location in their report to investigate whether the background rates can be
manageable for the real experiment or not. Therefore, we have performed the
background measurements (MLF; 2013BU1301 test experiment) during the summer of
2014, also following the 18th J-PARC PAC recommendations, and the measurements
results are described here.
