Low values of the fusion cross sections and very short half-lives of nuclei
with Z$>$120 put obstacles in synthesis of new elements. Different nuclear
reactions (fusion of stable and radioactive nuclei, multi-nucleon transfers and
neutron capture), which could be used for the production of new isotopes of
superheavy (SH) elements, are discussed in the paper. The gap of unknown SH
nuclei, located between the isotopes which were produced earlier in the cold
and hot fusion reactions, can be filled in fusion reactions of $^{48}$Ca with
available lighter isotopes of Pu, Am, and Cm. Cross sections for the production
of these nuclei are predicted to be rather large, and the corresponding
experiments can be easily performed at existing facilities. For the first time,
a narrow pathway is found to the middle of the island of stability owing to
possible $\beta^+$-decay of SH isotopes which can be formed in ordinary fusion
reactions of stable nuclei. Multi-nucleon transfer processes at near barrier
collisions of heavy (and very heavy, U-like) ions are shown to be quite
realistic reaction mechanism allowing us to produce new neutron enriched heavy
nuclei located in the unexplored upper part of the nuclear map. Neutron capture
reactions can be also used for the production of the long-living neutron rich
SH nuclei. Strong neutron fluxes might be provided by pulsed nuclear reactors
and by nuclear explosions in laboratory conditions and by supernova explosions
in nature. All these possibilities are discussed in the paper.
