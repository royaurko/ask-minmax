Stimulated Raman backscatter (SRS) is used as a remote sensor to quantify the
instantaneous laser power after transfer from outer to inner cones that cross
in a National Ignition Facility (NIF) gas-filled hohlraum plasma. By matching
SRS between a shot reducing outer vs a shot reducing inner power we infer that
~half of the incident outer-cone power is transferred to inner cones, for the
specific time and wavelength configuration studied. This is the first
instantaneous non-disruptive measure of power transfer in an indirect drive NIF
experiment using optical measurements.
