We study numerically domain growth and interface fluctuations in one- and
two-dimensional lattice systems composed of four species that interact in a
cyclic way. Particle mobility is implemented through exchanges of particles
located on neighboring lattice sites. For the chain we find that domain growth
strongly depends on the mobility, with a higher mobility yielding a larger
domain growth exponent. In two space dimensions, when also exchanges between
mutually neutral particles are possible, both domain growth and interface
fluctuations display universal regimes that are independent of the predation
and exchange rates.
