Dating apps for mobile devices, one popular GeoSocial app category, are
growing increasingly popular. These apps encourage the sharing of more personal
information than conventional social media apps, including continuous location
data. However, recent high profile incidents have highlighted the privacy risks
inherent in using these apps. In this paper, we present a case study utilizing
forensic techniques on nine popular proximity-based dating apps in order to
determine the types of data that can be recovered from user devices. We recover
a number of data types from these apps that raise concerns about user privacy.
For example, we determine that chat messages could be recovered in at least
half of the apps examined and, in some cases, the details of any users that had
been discovered nearby could also be extracted.
