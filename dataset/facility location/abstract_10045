We present a method to accelerate global illumination computation in dynamic
environments by taking advantage of limitations of the human visual system. A
model of visual attention is used to locate regions of interest in a scene and
to modulate spatiotemporal sensitivity. The method is applied in the form of a
spatiotemporal error tolerance map. Perceptual acceleration combined with good
sampling protocols provide a global illumination solution feasible for use in
animation. Results indicate an order of magnitude improvement in computational
speed. The method is adaptable and can also be used in image-based rendering,
geometry level of detail selection, realistic image synthesis, video telephony
and video compression.
