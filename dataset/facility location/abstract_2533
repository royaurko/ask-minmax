Large sensor-based infrastructures for radio astronomy will be among the most
intensive data-driven projects in the world, facing very high power demands.
The geographically wide distribution of these infrastructures and their
associated processing High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities require Green
Information and Communications Technologies (ICT). A combination is needed of
low power computing, efficient data storage, local data services, Smart Grid
power management, and inclusion of Renewable Energies. Here we outline the
major characteristics and innovation approaches to address power efficiency and
long-term power sustainability for radio astronomy projects, focusing on Green
ICT for science.
