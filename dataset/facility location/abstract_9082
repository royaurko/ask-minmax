Deep Chandra X-ray exposures provide an efficient route for locating
optically faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshifts. We use deep
multicolor optical data to search for z>5 AGN in the 2 Ms X-ray exposure of the
Chandra Deep Field-North. Of the 423 X-ray sources bright enough (z'<25.2) for
a color-color analysis, at most one lies at z=5-6 and none at z>6. The z>5
object is spectroscopically confirmed at z=5.19. Only 31 of the 77 sources with
z'>25.2 are undetected in the B or V bands at the 2-sigma level and could lie
at z>5. There are too few moderate luminosity AGN at z=5-6.5 to ionize the
intergalactic medium.
