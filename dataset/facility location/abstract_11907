We present 3D hydrodynamical simulations of the superbubble M17, also known
as the Omega nebula, carried out with the adaptive grid code yguazu'-a, which
includes radiative cooling. The superbubble is modelled considering the winds
of 11 individual stars from the open cluster inside the nebula (NGC 6618), for
which there are estimates of the mass loss rates and terminal velocities based
on their spectral types. These stars are located inside a dense interstellar
medium, and they are bounded by two dense molecular clouds.
  We carried out three numerical models of this scenario, considering different
line of sight positions of the stars (the position in the plane of the sky is
known, thus fixed). Synthetic thermal X-ray emission maps are calculated from
the numerical models and compared with ROSAT observations of this astrophysical
object. Our models reproduce successfully both the observed X-ray morphology
and the total X-ray luminosity, without taking into account thermal conduction
effects.
