In this paper we study some mathematical models describing evolution of
population density and spread of epidemics in population systems in which
spatial movement of individuals depends only on the departure and arrival
locations and does not have apparent connection with the population density. We
call such models as population migration models and migration epidemics models,
respectively. We first apply the theories of positive operators and positive
semigroups to make systematic investigation to asymptotic behavior of solutions
of the population migration models as time goes to infinity, and next use such
results to study asymptotic behavior of solutions of the migration epidemics
models as time goes to infinity. Some interesting properties of solutions of
these models are obtained.
