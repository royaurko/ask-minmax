In order to carry out inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) experiment at BL15U1
beamline of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), the data
acquisition and control system based on SPEC software has been developed. The
IXS experimental method needs linkage control of monochromator, silicon drift
detector (SDD) and ionization chamber on continuous segment-scan mode with
variable step size, and gains the data of energy, spectrum and light intensity
synchronously. A method is presented for achieving this function which was not
realized only by using SSCAN of Experimental Physics and Industrial Control
System (EPICS). This paper shows work details including control system
description, SPEC configurations for EPICS devices, macro definitions and
applications in the BL15U1. An IXS experiment was executed by using the SPEC
control system, its results prove that the method is feasible to perform the
experiment.
