Two Galactic isolated strong X-ray pulsars seem to be in the densest
environments compared to other types of Galactic pulsar. X-ray pulsar
J1846-0258 can be in an early phase of anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft gamma
repeaters if its average braking index is ~1.8-2.0. X-ray pulsar J1811-1925
must have a very large average braking index (n~11) if this pulsar was formed
by SN 386AD. This X-ray pulsar can be in an early phase of evolution of the
radio pulsars located in the region P~50-150 ms and \.{P}~10$^{-14}-10^{-16}$
s/s of the P-\.{P} diagram. X-ray/radio pulsar J0540-69 seems to be evolving in
the direction to the dim isolated thermal neutron star region on the P-\.{P}
diagram. Possible progenitors of different types of neutron star are also
discussed.
