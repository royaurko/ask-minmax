The Hawking radiation of Dirac particles in an arbitrarily rectilinearly
accelerating Kinnersley black hole is studied by using a method of the
generalized tortoise coordinate transformation. Both the location and the
temperature of the event horizon depend on the time and polar angle. The
Hawking thermal radiation spectrum of Dirac particles is also derived.
