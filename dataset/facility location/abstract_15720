The LVD detector, located in the INFN Gran Sasso National Laboratory (Italy),
studies supernova neutrinos through the interactions with protons and carbon
nuclei in the liquid scintillator and interactions with the iron nuclei of the
support structure. We investigate the effect of neutrino oscillations in the
signal expected in the LVD detector. The MSW effect has been studied in detail
for neutrinos travelling through the collapsing star and the Earth. We show
that the expected number of events and their energy spectrum are sensitive to
the oscillation parameters, in particular to the mass hierarchy and the value
of $\theta_{13}$, presently unknown. Finally we discuss the astrophysical
uncertainties, showing their importance and comparing it with the effect of
neutrino oscillations on the expected signal.
