It has been argued that if multiple spin wave modes are competing for the
same centrally located energy source, as in a nanocontact spin torque
oscillator, that only one mode should survive in the steady state. Here, the
experimental conditions necessary for mode coexistence are explored. Mode
coexistence is facilitated by the local field asymmetries induced by the
spatially inhomogeneous Oersted field, which leads to a physical separation of
the modes, and is further promoted by spin wave localization at reduced applied
field angles. Finally, both simulation and experiment reveal a low frequency
signal consistent with the intermodulation of two coexistent modes.
