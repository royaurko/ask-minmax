This paper extends the work done by Titchmarsh on Gram's Law (an attempt to
locate the zeroes of the zeta-function on the critical line). Herewith it is
shown that a positive proportion of Gram intervals violate Gram's Law; and also
that a weaker notion of Gram's Law is valid over a positive proportion of
intervals.
