We introduce optically tunable surfaces based upon metallic gold
nanoparticles trapped in open, water-filled gold cavities. The optical
properties of the surfaces change dramatically with the presence and location
of the particles inside the cavities. The precise position of the particles is
shown to be controllable through optical forces exerted by external
illumination, thus leading to all-optical tunability, whereby the optical
response of the surfaces is tuned through externally applied light. We discuss
the performance of the cavity-particle complex in detail and provide
theoretical support for its application as a novel concept of large-scale
optically tunable system.
