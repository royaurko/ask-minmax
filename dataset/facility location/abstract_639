Microbunching instability usually exists in the linear accelerator (linac) of
a free electron laser (FEL) facility. If it is not controlled effectively, the
beam quality will be damaged seriously and the machine will not operate
properly. In the electron linac of a soft X-Ray FEL device, because the
electron energy is not very high, the problem can become even more serious. As
a typical example, the microbunching instability in the linac of the proposed
Shanghai Soft X-ray Free Electron Laser facility (SXFEL) is investigated in
detail by means of both analytical formulae and simulation tools. In the study,
a new mechanism of introducing random noise into the beam current profile as
the beam passes through a chicane-type bunch compressor is proposed. The
higher-order modes that appear in the simulations suggest that further
improvement of the current theoretical model of the instability is needed.
