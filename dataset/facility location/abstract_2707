Beam measurement is very important for accelerators. With the development of
analog-to-digital conversion techniques, digital beam measurement becomes a
research hot spot. IQ (In-phase & Quadrature-phase) analysis based method is an
important beam measurement approach, the principle of which is presented and
discussed in this paper. The State Key Laboratory of Particle Detection and
Electronics in University of Science and Technology of China has devoted
efforts to the research of digital beam measurement based on high-speed
high-resolution analog-to-digital conversion, and a series of beam measurement
instruments were designed for China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS), Shanghai
Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), and Accelerator Driven Sub-critical
system (ADS).
