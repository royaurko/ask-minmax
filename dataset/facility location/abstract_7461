Thanks to a novel modelling programme to detect anomalies in the membranous
semi circular canals (SSC) of idiopathic scoliosis (IS) we found severe
anomalies mainly located in lateral SCC devoted to trunk rotation and lateral
deviations. We also found a specific communication between the lateral and
posterior canal involving the utricular chamber which is also highly suspected
in scoliosis. Key points: - Membranous semi circular canals (SCC) modelling
based on MRI revealed significant anomalies in IS patients compared to normal
subjects. - Frequent aplasias located in the lateral canal were found in IS. -
We also discovered a, never described, abnormal communication between lateral
and posterior canal. - Lateral SCC is involved in trunk rotation and lateral
deviation: these movements are frequently abnormal in IS. Supports: Fondation
