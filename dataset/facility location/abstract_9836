We investigate the critical behavior of the one-dimensional q-state Potts
model with long-range (LR) interaction $1/r^{d+\sigma}$, using a multicanonical
algorithm. The recursion scheme initially proposed by Berg is improved so as to
make it suitable for a large class of LR models with unequally spaced energy
levels. The choice of an efficient predictor and a reliable convergence
criterion is discussed. We obtain transition temperatures in the first-order
regime which are in far better agreement with mean-field predictions than in
previous Monte Carlo studies. By relying on the location of spinodal points and
resorting to scaling arguments, we determine the threshold value $\sigma_c(q)$
separating the first- and second-order regimes to two-digit precision within
the range $3 \leq q \leq 9$. We offer convincing numerical evidence supporting
$\sigma_c(q)
