Strontium iodide doped with europium is a new scintillator material being
developed as an alternative to lanthanum bromide doped with cerium for use in
high energy astrophysical detectors. As with all scintillators, the issue of
nonproportionality is important because it affects the energy resolution of the
detector. In this study, we investigate how the nonproportionality of strontium
iodide doped with europium changes as a function of temperature 16 deg. C to 60
deg. C by heating the strontium iodide doped with europium scintillator
separate from the photomultiplier tube. In a separate experiment, we also
investigate the nonproportionality at high energies (up to 6 MeV) of strontium
iodide doped with europium at a testing facility located at NASA Goddard Space
Flight Center. We find that the nonproportionality increases nearly
monotonically as the temperature of the strontium iodide doped with europium
scintillator is increased, although there is evidence of non-monotonic behavior
near 40 deg. C, perhaps due to electric charge carriers trapping in the
material. We also find that within the energy range of 662 keV to 6.1 MeV, the
change in the nonproportionality of the strontium iodide doped with europium is
about 1.5 to 2 percent.
