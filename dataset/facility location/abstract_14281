Making use of a recently proposed formalism, we analyze the composite nature
of the $P_c(4450)$ resonance observed by LHCb. We show that the present data
suggest that this state is almost entirely made of a $\chi_{c1}$ and a proton,
due to the close proximity to this threshold. This also suppresses the decay
modes into other, lighter channels, in our study represented by $J/\Psi p$. We
further argue that this is very similar to the case of the scalar meson
$f_0(980)$ which is located closely to the $K\bar K$ threshold and has a
suppressed decay into the lighter $\pi\pi$ channel.
