We study the $\bar{\nu}_e-e$ scattering from low to ultrahigh energy in the
framework of Higgs Triplet Model (HTM). We add the contribution of charged
Higgs boson exchange to the total cross section of the scattering. We obtain
the upper bound $h_{ee}/M_{H^\pm}\lesssim2.8\times10^{-3}GeV^{-1}$ in this
process from low energy experiment. We show that by using the upper bound
obtained, the charged Higgs contribution can give enhancements to the total
cross section with respect to the SM prediction up to 5.16% at $E\leq10^{14}$
eV and maximum at $s\approx M_{H^\pm}^2$ and would help to determine the
feasibility experiments to discriminate between SM and HTM at current available
facilities.
