We have begun a survey of the molecular gas surrounding 31 young clusters in
order to investigate the link between environment and the resulting cluster. We
present here a preliminary comparison of two clusters in our sample: GGD12-15
and Mon R2. Since both clusters are located in the MonR2 molecular cloud at a
distance of 830 pc, observational biases due to differing sensitivities and
angular resolutions are avoided.
