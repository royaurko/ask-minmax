Atomic masses play a crucial role in many nuclear astrophysics calculations.
The lack of experimental values for relevant exotic nuclides triggered a rapid
development of new mass measurement devices around the world. The
Time-of-Flight (TOF) mass measurements offer a complementary technique to the
most precise one, Penning trap measurements, the latter being limited by the
rate and half-lives of the ions of interest. The NSCL facility provides a
well-suited infrastructure for TOF mass measurements of very exotic nuclei. At
this facility, we have recently implemented a TOF-Brho technique and performed
mass measurements of neutron-rich nuclides in the Fe region, important for
r-process calculations and for calculations of processes occurring in the crust
of accreting neutron stars.
