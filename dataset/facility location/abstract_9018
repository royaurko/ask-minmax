Long-baseline optical interferometers can now detect and resolve hot dust
emission thought to arise at the inner edge of circumstellar disks around young
stellar objects (YSOs). We argue that the near-infrared sizes being measured
are closely related to the radius at which dust is sublimated by the stellar
radiation field. We consider how realistic dust optical properties and gas
opacity dramatically affect the predicted location of this dust destruction
radius, an exercise routinely done in other contexts but so far neglected in
the analysis of near-infrared sizes of YSOs. We also present the accumulated
literature of near-infrared YSO sizes in the form of a ``size-luminosity
diagram'' and compare with theoretical expectations. We find evidence that
large (>~ 1 micron) dust grains predominate in the inner disks of T Tauri and
Herbig Ae/Be stars, under the assumption that the inner-most gaseous disks are
optically-thin at visible wavelengths.
