In this talk, we examine the existing calculations of QCD evolution kernels
for the scale dependence of two sets of twist-3 quark-gluon correlation
functions, $T_{q,F}(x,x)$ and $T^{(\sigma)}_{q,F}(x,x)$, which are the first
transverse-momentum-moment of the naive-time-reversal-odd Sivers and
Boer-Mulders function, respectively. The evolution kernels at the leading order
in strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ were derived by several groups with
apparent differences. We identify the sources of discrepancies and are able to
reconcile the results from various groups.
