In this paper, we study the possible connections among different Spinor
Quintom Dark Energy (DE) models by the aid of duality. Then we apply the
statefinder diagnostic to these models. By this diagnostic pair {$\{r,s\}$}, we
differentiate one Quintom DE model from the others in a model independent
manner. A class of evolutionary trajectories of these Spinor Quintom models are
presented in the statefinder parameter planes. We also obtain the current
locations of the parameters $r$ and $s$, and these locations correspond to
different models in statefinder parameter planes theoretically.
