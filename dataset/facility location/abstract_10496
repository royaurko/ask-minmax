Charge partitions and distributions of fragments emitted in
multifragmentation of fused systems produced in central collisions are studied
over the incident energy range 32-50 MeV per nucleon. Most of the charged
products are well identified thanks to the high performances of the INDRA 4pi
array. Supported by dynamical calculations, charge correlations are used t$
evidence, or not, spinodal instabilities and consequently the liquid-gas
coexistence region over the considered incident energy range. It was claimed in
the last few years that mass/charge distributions should follow a power law
behavior in the coexistence region. The Z distributions measured are discussed.
A first attempt is made to derive in which Z region the border between liquid
and gas parts is located.
