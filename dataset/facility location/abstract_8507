We present observations at 1.7 and 8.4 GHz of two Compact Steep Spectrum
(CSS) sources from a complete sample of low-intermediate power radio galaxies.
3C346 shows an asymmetric structure with a one-sided ``jet'' and ``hot spot''.
Present observations suggest that the classification of this source as a CSS is
inappropriate, and that it is a common radio galaxy at a small angle to the
line of sight. Its properties are in agreement with the predictions of unified
schemes models. 4C31.04 shows more complex structure with the possibility of a
centrally located flat spectrum core in between two close lobes. We suggest
that this source could be a low redshift Compact Symmetric Object.
