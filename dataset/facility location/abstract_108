A comprehensive coverage is crucial for communication, supply and
transportation networks, yet it is limited by the requirement of extensive
infrastructure and heavy energy consumption. Here we draw an analogy between
spins in antiferromagnet and outlets in supply networks, and apply techniques
from the studies of disordered systems to elucidate the effects of balancing
the coverage and supply costs on the network behavior. A readily applicable,
coverage optimization algorithm is derived. Simulation results show that
magnetized and antiferromagnetic domains emerge and coexist to balance the need
for coverage and energy saving. The scaling of parameters with system size
agrees with the continuum approximation in two dimensions and the tree
approximation in random graphs. Due to frustration caused by the competition
between coverage and supply cost, a transition between easy and hard
computation regimes is observed. We further suggest a local expansion approach
to greatly simplify the message updates which shed light on simplifications in
other problems.
