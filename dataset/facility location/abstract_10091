This article gives the construction and complete classification of all
three-dimensional spherical manifolds, and orders them by decreasing volume, in
the context of multiconnected universe models with positive spatial curvature.
It discusses which spherical topologies are likely to be detectable by
crystallographic methods using three-dimensional catalogs of cosmic objects.
The expected form of the pair separation histogram is predicted (including the
location and height of the spikes) and is compared to computer simulations,
showing that this method is stable with respect to observational uncertainties
and is well suited for detecting spherical topologies.
