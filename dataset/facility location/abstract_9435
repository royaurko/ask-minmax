We describe the software requirement and design specifications for all-sky
panoramic astronomical pipelines. The described software aims to meet the
specific needs of super-wide angle optics, and includes cosmic-ray hit
rejection, image compression, star recognition, sky opacity analysis, transient
detection and a web server allowing access to real-time and archived data. The
presented software is being regularly used for the pipeline processing of 11
all-sky cameras located in some of the world's premier observatories. We
encourage all-sky camera operators to use our software and/or our hosting
services and become part of the global Night Sky Live network.
