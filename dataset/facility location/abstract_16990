The Andromeda galaxy was observed by the Guoshoujing Telescope (GSJT, formly
named the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope -- LAMOST)
during the 2009 commissioning phase. Due to the absence of standard stars for
flux calibration, we use the photometric data of 15 intermediate bands in the
Beijing-Arizona-Taipei-Connecticut (BATC) survey to calibrate the spectra.
Total 59 spectra located in the bulge and disk of the galaxy are obtained.
Kinematic and stellar population properties of the stellar content are derived
with these spectra. We obtain the global velocity field and calculate
corresponding rotation velocities outer to about 7 kpc along the major axis.
These rotation velocity measurements complement those of the gas content, such
as the H {\sc i} and CO. The radial velocity dispersion presents that the stars
in the bulge are more dynamically thermal and the disk is more
rotation-supported. The age distribution shows that the bulge was formed about
12 Gyr ago, the disk is relatively younger, and the ages of some regions along
the spiral arms can reach as young as about 1 Gyr. These young stellar
populations have relatively richer abundance and larger reddening. The overall
average metallicity of the galaxy approximates the solar metallicity and a very
weak abundance gradient is gained. The reddening map gives a picture of a
dust-free bulge and a distinct dusty ring in the disk.
