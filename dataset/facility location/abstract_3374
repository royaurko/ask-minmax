113 residual product nuclide yields in a 1.0 GeV proton-irradiated thin
monoisotopic 208-Pb sample and 107 residual product nuclide yields in a 2.6 GeV
proton-irradiated nat-W sample have been measured and simulated by 8 different
codes. The irradiations were made using proton beams extracted from the ITEP
synchrotron. The nuclide yields were gamma-spectrometered directly using a
high-resolution Ge-detector. The gamma-spectra were processed by the GENIE-2000
code. The ITEP-developed SIGMA code was used together with the PCNUDAT nuclear
decay database to identify the gamma-lines and to determine the cross-sections.
The 27-Al(p,x)Na-22 reaction was used to monitor the proton flux. The measured
yields are compared with calculation the LAHET (with ISABEL and Bertini
options), CEM95, CEM2k, CASCADE, CASCADE/INPE, INUCL, and YIELDX codes.
Estimates of the mean deviation factor are used to demonstrate the predictive
power of the codes. The results obtained may be of interest in studying the
parameters of the Pb and W target modules of the hybrid Accelerator-Driven
System (ADS) facilities.
