A search for neutrino oscillations of the type nu_bar_mu to nu_bar_e has been
conducted at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility using nu_bar_mu from muon
decay at rest. Evidence for this transition has been reported previously. This
paper discusses in detail the experimental setup, detector operation and
neutrino source, including aspects relevant to oscillation searches in the muon
decay-at-rest and pion decay in flight channels.
