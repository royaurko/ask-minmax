In this work we study Herbig-Haro objects located in the region around the
head of the cometary globule CG 30. Two sets of optical images are presented.
The first set was obtained with the 3.5 m New Technology Telescope in 1995 in
three emission lines: Halpha, [SII]6731,6716 A and [OII]3729 A. The second set
is an Halpha image of the CG 30/31/38 complex obtained in 2006 with the 8 m
Subaru telescope. A proper motion study of the HH objects in the region was
performed using the Halpha images from both epochs. Due to the high resolution
of our images we were able to, for the first time, resolve the HH 120 object
into ten knots and measure proper motions for some of them. We discover several
new HH objects and a large bipolar jet, HH 950, emerging from the head of CG
30. We suggest that two previously known submillimeter sources are the driving
sources for the HH 120 and HH 950 flows.
