CalcHEP is a package for computation of Feynman diagrams and integration over
multi-particle phase space. The main idea prescribed into CalcHEP is to make
available passing on from Lagrangians to the final distributions effectively
with a high level of automation. This article presents new options of CalcHEP
available in version 2.3. They are a) MSSM model with different SUGRA
scenarios, b) interface with PDFLIB and implementation of new MRST/CTEQ
structure functions, c) realization of approach to structure functions for
models with diagonal CKM, d) generation of events and interface with PYTHIA, e)
calculations in non-interactive (batch) regime, f)generation of code of
different matrix elements for other programs, g) many new interface facilities.
