The scalar glueball is investigated in a soft-wall model of AdS/QCD.
Constraints of the mass of the scalar glueball are given through an analysis of
a relation between the bulk mass and the anomalous dimension. The mass of the
ground scalar glueball is located at $0.96^{+0.04}_{-0.07}
\rm{GeV}<m_G<1.36^{+0.05}_{-0.10}\rm{GeV}$. In terms of a background dilaton
field $\Phi(z)=cz^2$, the two-point correlation function for the scalar gluon
operator is obtained. The two-point correlation function at $\Delta=4$ gives a
different behavior compared with the one in QCD.
