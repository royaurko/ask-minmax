Geographical location solutions have a wide diversity of applications,
ranging from emergency services to access to tourist and entertainment
services. GPS (Global Positioning System) is the most widely used system for
outdoor areas. Since it requires a direct line of sight with the satellites, it
cannot be used indoors. For indoor positioning, the most commonly used
technology to calculate the position of mobile devices is Wi-Fi. In this
article, we present a positioning tool called WiFiPos based on Wi-Fi signal
processing. This tool uses different variations of the Fingerprint technique to
analyze the performance and accuracy of the system both indoors and outdoors.
