RAT0455+1305 was discovered during the Rapid Temporal Survey which aims in
finding any variability on timescales of a few minutes to several hours. The
star was found to be another sdBV star with one high amplitude mode and
relatively long period. These features along with estimation of T_eff and log g
makes this star very similar to Balloon 090100001. Encouraged by prominent
results obtained for the latter star we have decided to perform white light
photometry on RAT0455+1305. In 2009 we used the 1.5m telescope located in San
Pedro Martir Observatory in Mexico. Fourier analysis confirmed the dominant
mode found in the discovery data, uncovered another peak close to the dominant
one, and three peaks in the low frequency region. This shows that RAT0455+1305
is another hybrid sdBV star pulsating in both p- and g-modes.
