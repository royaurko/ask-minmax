The extrapolation of self-consistent nuclear mean-field models to the region
of superheavy elements is discussed with emphasis on the extrapolating power of
the models. The predictions of modern mean-field models are confronted with
recent experimental data. It is shown that a final conclusion about the
location of the expected island of spherical doubly-magic superheavy nuclei
cannot be drawn on the basis of the available data.
