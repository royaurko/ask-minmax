The zodiacal foreground for a highly sensitive space infrared interferometer
is predicted for various observing locations. For the predictions we use a
model that was derived from measurements of the Cosmic Background Explorer
(COBE). We find that at a wavelength of $10{\rm \mu m}$ 96% of the sky is
darker than $1{MJy}{\rm sr}^{-1}$ for observations in the ecliptic plane at
$5{\rm AU}$, and 83% is darker than $0.1{\rm MJy}{\rm sr}^{-1}$. At $1{\rm
AU}$, however, always more than 50% of the sky are brighter than $1{\rm
MJy}{\rm sr}^{-1}$, even if the observations are made from $30^\circ$ or
$60^\circ$ of latitude above the ecliptic plane, at 10 or $20{\rm \mu m}$.
Thus, according to the employed model, the foreground reduction by increasing
the heliocentric distance of the observing location is more effective than by
increasing the latitude.
