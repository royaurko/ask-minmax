Some attempts to predict the very distant future of Radio Astronomy are
given. It is not easy to predict a list of the first priority problems which
may appear, but the facilities potential is more predictable. It is suggested,
that in addition to the "dedicated for Radio Astronomy", facilities may be
extended greatly by integration with the next generation living standards
facilities, connected with People-to-People communications through the global
networks and by incorporating of the "Natural facilities", such as grav.
lensing, maser amplification in the ISM etc. As an examples of the extreme
cases of the $10^9 m^2$ class of the new generation Radio Telescopes,
utilization of the personal dipole size communication facilities by SKA type
instrument, and array from the asteroids first "Frehnel zones" will be
mentioned. Radio Astronomy from the secondary to optical facilities tool will
be the only tool in the exploration of the $z>10$ Universe. The reality of all
predictions depend mostly on the way, the Civilization will prefer : "Ahead, to
HOMO SAPIENCE" or "BACK TO PRIMATES".
