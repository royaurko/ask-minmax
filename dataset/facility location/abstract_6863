This paper describes a new model for local messaging based on the network
proximity. We present a novelty mobile mashup which combines Wi-Fi proximity
measurements with Cloud Messaging. Our mobile mashup combines passive
monitoring for smart phones and cloud based messaging for mobile operational
systems. Passive monitoring can determine the location of mobile subscribers
(mobile phones, actually) without the active participation of mobile users.
This paper describes how to combine the passive monitoring and notifications.
