Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a transmission technique for
cellular systems that uses many antennas to support not-as-many users. Thus
far, the performance of massive MIMO has only been examined in finite cellular
networks. In this letter, we analyze its performance in random cellular
networks with Poisson distributed base station locations. Specifically, we
provide analytical expressions for the asymptotic coverage probability and rate
in both downlink and uplink when each base station has a large number of
antennas. The results show that, though limited by pilot contamination, massive
MIMO can provide significantly higher asymptotic data rate per user than the
single-antenna network.
