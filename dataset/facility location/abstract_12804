The Sparse Distributed Memory proposed by Pentii Kanerva (SDM in short) was
thought to be a model of human long term memory. The architecture of the SDM
permits to store binary patterns and to retrieve them using partially matching
patterns. However Kanerva's model is especially efficient only in handling
random data. The purpose of this article is to introduce a new approach of
training Kanerva's SDM that can handle efficiently non-random data, and to
provide it the capability to recognize inverted patterns. This approach uses a
signal model which is different from the one proposed for different purposes by
Hely, Willshaw and Hayes in [4]. This article additionally suggests a different
way of creating hard locations in the memory despite the Kanerva's static
model.
