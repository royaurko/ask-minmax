Recent inelastic-neutron-scattering measurements of a low-energy phonon in
Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8 provide enough information to place a lower bound on the
energy gap magnitude at precise locations on the Fermi surface. Measurements of
a few low-energy phonons should indicate whether the gap symmetry is
d_{x^2-y^2}. Further measurements could map out the angle-resolved gap
magnitude on the entire Fermi surface.
