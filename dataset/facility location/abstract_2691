Collinear high-gradient ${\cal O} (GV/m)$ beam-driven wakefield methods for
charged-particle acceleration could be critical to the realization of compact,
cost-efficient, accelerators, e.g., in support of TeV-scale lepton colliders or
multiple-user free-electron laser facilities. To make these options viable, the
high accelerating fields need to be complemented with large transformer ratios
$>2$, a parameter characterizing the efficiency of the energy transfer between
a wakefield-exciting "drive" bunch to an accelerated "witness" bunch. While
several potential current distributions have been discussed, their practical
realization appears challenging due to their often discontinuous nature. In
this paper we propose several alternative current profiles which are smooth
which also lead to enhanced transformer ratios. We especially explore a
laser-shaping method capable of generating one the suggested distributions
directly out of a photoinjector and discuss a linac concept that could possible
drive a dielectric accelerator.
