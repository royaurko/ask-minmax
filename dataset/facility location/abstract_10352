We find the minimal energy solution describing a folded closed string located
at the center of AdS_5 and rotating simultaneously in two planes in S^5 with
two arbitrary SO(6) angular momenta J_1 and J_2. In the case when J_1=J_2=J' we
observe the precise agreement between the leading coefficient in the large J'
expansion of the energy of this solution and the minimal eigen-value of the
1-loop anomalous dimension matrix of the corresponding [J',0,J'] SYM operators
obtained by Beisert, Minahan, Staudacher and Zarembo in hep-th/0306139. We find
also perfect agreement between string and SYM results in cases of states with
unequal spins J_1 and J_2 dual to [J_2,J_1-J_2,J_2] operators. This represents
a remarkable quantitative test of the AdS/CFT duality in a non-supersymmetric
(and non-near-BPS) sector.
