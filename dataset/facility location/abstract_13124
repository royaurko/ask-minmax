Social Media offer a vast amount of geo-located and time-stamped textual
content directly generated by people. This information can be analysed to
obtain insights about the general state of a large population of users and to
address scientific questions from a diversity of disciplines. In this work, we
estimate temporal patterns of mood variation through the use of emotionally
loaded words contained in Twitter messages, possibly reflecting underlying
circadian and seasonal rhythms in the mood of the users. We present a method
for computing mood scores from text using affective word taxonomies, and apply
it to millions of tweets collected in the United Kingdom during the seasons of
summer and winter. Our analysis results in the detection of strong and
statistically significant circadian patterns for all the investigated mood
types. Seasonal variation does not seem to register any important divergence in
the signals, but a periodic oscillation within a 24-hour period is identified
for each mood type. The main common characteristic for all emotions is their
mid-morning peak, however their mood score patterns differ in the evenings.
