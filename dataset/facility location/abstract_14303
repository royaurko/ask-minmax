We investigate the effect of SiC stacking on the 4H-SiC/SiO$_2$ interface,
both in the presence and absence of O defects, which appear during thermal
oxidation, via first principles calculations. It is known that 4H-SiC(0001) has
two different surface types, depending on which of the two lattice sites, $h$
or $k$, is at the surface [K. Arima \textit{et al}., Appl. Phys. Lett.
\textbf{90}, 202106 (2007)]. We find interlayer states along the conduction
band edge of SiC, whose location changes depending on the interface type, and
thus too the effect of defects. When $h$ sites are directly at the interface, O
defects remove interfacial conduction band edge states. On the other hand, when
$k$ sites are at the interface, the conduction band edge is insensitive to the
presence of O defects. These differences will impact on the operation of SiC
devices because the most commonly used SiC based metal-oxide-semiconductor
field-effect transistors rely on the electronic structure of the conduction
band.
