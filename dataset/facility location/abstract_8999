I argue that cool giant companions in most symbiotic binary systems possess
magnetic activity on a much higher level than isolated, or in wide binary
systems, cool giants. Based on the behavior of main sequence stars, I assume
that magnetic activity and X-ray luminosity increase with rotation velocity. I
then show that the cool companions in symbiotic systems are likely to rotate
much faster than isolated, or in wide binary systems, cool giants. The magnetic
activity of the cool giant may be observed as a global axisymmetrical mass loss
geometry from the cool giant (before the hot companion influences the outflow),
a stochastic mass loss process, i.e., variation of mass loss rate with time and
location on the giant's surface, and in relatively strong X-ray emission. The
variation in the mass loss process from the cool giant may cause variation in
the properties of jets blown by the hot compact companion. I conclude that
symbiotic systems should be high-priority X-ray targets.
