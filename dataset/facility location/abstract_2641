The electron-neutrino charged-current quasi-elastic (CCQE) cross-section on
nuclei is an important input parameter to appearance-type neutrino oscillation
experiments. Current experiments typically work from the muon neutrino
cross-section and apply corrections from theoretical arguments to obtain a
prediction for the electron neutrino cross-section, but to date there has been
no experimental verification of the estimates for this channel at an energy
scale appropriate to such experiments. We present a preliminary result from the
MINERvA experiment on the first measurement of an exclusive reaction in few-GeV
electron neutrino interactions, namely, the cross-section for a CCQE-like
process. The result is given both as differential cross-sections vs. the
electron energy, electron angle, and $Q^{2}$, as well as a total cross-section
vs. neutrino energy.
