Recent surveys have identified sub-stellar objects down to planetary masses
in nearby star-forming regions. Reliable determination of the disk frequency in
young brown dwarfs is of paramount importance to understanding their origin.
Here we report the results of a systematic study of infrared L'-band
(3.8-micron) disk excess in ~50 spectroscopically confirmed objects near and
below the sub-stellar boundary in several young clusters. Our observations,
using the ESO Very Large Telescope, Keck I and the NASA Infrared Telescope
Facility, reveal that a significant fraction of brown dwarfs harbor disks at a
very young age. Their inner disk lifetimes do not appear to be vastly different
from those of disks around T Tauri stars. Our findings are consistent with the
hypothesis that sub-stellar objects form via a mechanism similar to solar-mass
stars.
