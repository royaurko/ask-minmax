We are investigated possible correlations between the calculated arrival
times of the first relativistic ions at Earth and GLE start times registered by
surface monitors. The analysis is based on the arrival times and energies of
the first solar ions, registered by the Solar Isotope Spectrometer (SIS) on
board of the ACE satellite, and protons, registered by GOES satellites. We
consider both cases when the interplanetary propagation of the first high
energy ions is essentially scatter-free and the diffusion of high energy ions
during propagation in the interplanetary magnetic field. We extrapolate the
time-velocity and time-rigidity relationships to calculate the expected arrival
times of the relativistic ions that are energetic enough to enter the
atmosphere at the Aragats geographical location and produce secondary fluxes
that reach the monitors.
