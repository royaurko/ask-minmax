We study the anisotropy in the arrival directions of PAO UHECRs, using the
point source correlational angular distance distribution. The result shows that
the anisotropy is characterized by one prominent excess region and one void
region. The excess region is located near the Centaurus A direction, supporting
that the Centaurus A is a promising UHECR source. The void region near the
south pole direction may be used to limit the diffuse isotropic background
contribution.
