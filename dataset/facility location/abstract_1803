Our goal is to carry out high-precision nuclear structure calculations in
connection with Radioactive Ion Beam Facilities. The main challenge for the
theory of drip line nuclei is that the outermost nucleons are weakly bound
(implying a large spatial distribution) and that these states are strongly
coupled to the particle continuum. For these reasons, the traditional basis
expansion methods fail to converge. We overcome these problems by representing
the nuclear Hamiltonian on a lattice utilizing the Galerkin method with
Basis-Spline test functions. We discuss tests of the numerical method and
applications to the deformed shell model, HF+BCS and HFB mean field theories.
