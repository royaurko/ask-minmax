LHA 115-S 18 is a very peculiar emission-line star exhibiting the B[e]
phenomenon. Located in the Small Magellanic Cloud, its spectrum shows features
of an extremely wide range of excitation and ionization stages, extending from
highly ionized atomic lines (Si IV, C IV, He II) in the UV and optical regions
to molecular emission bands of CO and TiO in the optical and IR regions. The
most distinguishing spectral characteristic of LHA 115-S 18 is the high
variability detected in the He II {\lambda}4686 emission line, which can be a
very conspicuous or completely invisible feature.
  In this work, we report on another peculiarity of LHA 115-S 18. From
high-resolution optical spectra taken between 2000 and 2008, we discovered the
appearance and strengthening of two emission features at {\lambda}6825 \AA, and
{\lambda}7082 \AA,, which we identified as Raman-scattered lines. This is the
first time these lines have been detected in the spectrum of a massive luminous
B[e] star. As the classification of LHA 115-S 18 is highly controversial, we
discuss how the discovery of the appearance of Raman-scattered lines in this
peculiar star might help us to solve this puzzle.
