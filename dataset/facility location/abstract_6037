The present results on the $\numtonut$ oscillation search by the CHORUS
experiment at CERN are summarised. A fraction of the neutrino interactions
collected in 1994-1995-1996 by the CHORUS experiment has been analysed,
searching for $\nu_{\tau}$ charged current interactions followed by the $\tau$
lepton decay into a negative hadron or into a muon. A sample of 68,156 events
with an identified final state muon and 7,206 events without an identified muon
in the final state have been located in the emulsion target. Within the applied
cuts, no $\nu_{\tau}$ candidate has been found. This result leads to a 90% C.L.
limit $P(\numtonut)< 6.0\cdot 10^{-4}$ on the mixing probability.
