The effects of retardation in the Coulomb excitation of radioactive nuclei in
intermediate energy collisions (Elab ~100 MeV/nucleon) are investigated. We
show that the excitation cross sections of low-lying states in 11Be,
{38,40,42}S and {44,46}Ar projectiles incident on gold and lead targets are
modified by as much as 20% due to these effects. The angular distributions of
decaying gamma-rays are also appreciably modified.
