We consider the problem of approximating all real roots of a square-free
polynomial $f$. Given isolating intervals, our algorithm refines each of them
to a width of $2^{-L}$ or less, that is, each of the roots is approximated to
$L$ bits after the binary point. Our method provides a certified answer for
arbitrary real polynomials, only considering finite approximations of the
polynomial coefficients and choosing a suitable working precision adaptively.
In this way, we get a correct algorithm that is simple to implement and
practically efficient. Our algorithm uses the quadratic interval refinement
method; we adapt that method to be able to cope with inaccuracies when
evaluating $f$, without sacrificing its quadratic convergence behavior. We
prove a bound on the bit complexity of our algorithm in terms of the degree of
the polynomial, the size and the separation of the roots, that is, parameters
exclusively related to the geometric location of the roots. Our bound is near
optimal and significantly improves previous work on integer polynomials.
Furthermore, it essentially matches the best known theoretical bounds on root
approximation which are obtained by very sophisticated algorithms. We also
investigate the practical behavior of the algorithm and demonstrate how closely
the practical performance matches our asymptotic bounds.
