In this report, we show how to use the Simple Fluent Calculus (SFC) to
specify generic tracers, i.e. tracers which produce a generic trace. A generic
trace is a trace which can be produced by different implementations of a
software component and used independently from the traced component. This
approach is used to define a method for extending a java based CHRor platform
called CHROME (Constraint Handling Rule Online Model-driven Engine) with an
extensible generic tracer. The method includes a tracer specification in SFC, a
methodology to extend it, and the way to integrate it with CHROME, resulting in
the platform CHROME-REF (for Reasoning Explanation Facilities), which is a
constraint solving and rule based reasoning engine with explanatory traces.
