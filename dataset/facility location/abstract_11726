Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale eruptions of plasma and
magnetic feld that can produce adverse space weather at Earth and other
locations in the Heliosphere. Due to the intrinsic multiscale nature of
features in coronagraph images, wavelet and multiscale image processing
techniques are well suited to enhancing the visibility of CMEs and supressing
noise. However, wavelets are better suited to identifying point-like features,
such as noise or background stars, than to enhancing the visibility of the
curved form of a typical CME front. Higher order multiscale techniques, such as
ridgelets and curvelets, were therefore explored to characterise the morphology
(width, curvature) and kinematics (position, velocity, acceleration) of CMEs.
Curvelets in particular were found to be well suited to characterising CME
properties in a self-consistent manner. Curvelets are thus likely to be of
benefit to autonomous monitoring of CME properties for space weather
applications.
