A method is presented to construct initial data for Einstein's equations as a
superposition of a gravitational wave perturbation on an arbitrary stationary
background spacetime. The method combines the conformal thin sandwich formalism
with linear gravitational waves, and allows detailed control over
characteristics of the superposed gravitational wave like shape, location and
propagation direction. It is furthermore fully covariant with respect to
spatial coordinate changes and allows for very large amplitude of the
gravitational wave.
