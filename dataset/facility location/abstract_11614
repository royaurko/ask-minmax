The formation of marginally trapped surfaces in the off-center collision of
two shock waves on AdS_D (with D=4,5,6,7 and 8) is studied numerically. We
focus on the case when the two waves collide with nonvanishing impact parameter
while the sources are located at the same value of the holographic coordinate.
In all cases a critical value of the impact parameter is found above which no
trapped surface is formed. The numerical results show the existence of a simple
scaling relation between the critical impact parameter and the energy of the
colliding waves. Using the isometries of AdS_D we relate the solutions obtained
to the ones describing the collision of two waves with a purely holographic
impact parameter. This provides a gravitational dual for the head-on collision
of two lumps of energy of unequal size.
