Electronic structures of SiC nanoribbons have been studied by spin-polarized
density functional calculations. The armchair nanoribbons are nonmagnetic
semiconductor, while the zigzag nanoribbons are magnetic metal. The spin
polarization in zigzag SiC nanoribbons is originated from the unpaired
electrons localized on the ribbon edges. Interestingly, the zigzag nanoribbons
narrower than $\sim$4 nm present half-metallic behavior. Without the aid of
external field or chemical modification, the metal-free half-metallicity
predicted for narrow SiC zigzag nanoribbons opens a facile way for nanomaterial
spintronics applications.
