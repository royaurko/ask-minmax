We propose a postulate $\dot{q} =MH$ concerning temporal variation of
quintessence field $q$ where $H$ is Hubble parameter ($=\dot{a}/a$) and $M$ is
the scale characterizing the field. Using the postulate we uniquely determines
a dynamical model of the field. The potential of the field satisfies the
tracking condition. The minimum of the total energy density of matter and the
field is located at $a=\infty$. We show that the present tiny dark energy is
caused by early inflation, while the energy is comparable to Planck scale
before the inflation. Since the model is reduced to $\Lambda$CDM model in the
limit $M\to 0$, it is a natural generalization of $\Lambda$CDM model.
