If Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are truly at astronomical, in particular
cosmological, distances, they represent one of the most exciting discoveries in
astrophysics of the past decade. However, the distance to FRBs has, to date,
been estimated purely from their excess dispersion, and has not been
corroborated by any independent means. In this paper we discuss the possibility
of detecting neutral hydrogen absorption against FRBs both from spiral arms
within our own galaxy, or from intervening extragalactic HI clouds. In either
case a firm lower limit on the distance to the FRB would be established.
Absorption against galactic spiral arms may already be detectable for bright
low-latitude bursts with existing facilities, and should certainly be so by the
Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Absorption against extragalactic HI clouds, which
would confirm the cosmological distances of FRBs, should also be detectable
with the SKA, and maybe also Arecibo. Quantitatively, we estimate that SKA1-MID
should be able to detect extragalactic HI absorption against a few percent of
FRBs at a redshift z~1.
