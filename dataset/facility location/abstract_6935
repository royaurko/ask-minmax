We study voter models defined on large sets. Through a perspective
emphasizing the martingale property of voter density processes, we prove that
in general, their convergence to the Wright-Fisher diffusion only involves
certain averages of the voter models over a small number of spatial locations.
This enables us to identify suitable mixing conditions on the underlying voting
kernels, one of which may just depend on their eigenvalues in some contexts, to
obtain the convergence of density processes. Our examples show that these
conditions are satisfied by a large class of voter models on growing finite
graphs.
