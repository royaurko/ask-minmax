Hopf bifurcations in fast-slow systems of ordinary differential equations can
be associated with surprising rapid growth of periodic orbits. This process is
referred to as canard explosion. The key step in locating a canard explosion is
to calculate the location of a special trajectory, called a maximal canard, in
parameter space. A first-order asymptotic expansion of this location was found
by Krupa and Szmolyan in the framework of a "canard point"-normal-form for
systems with one fast and one slow variable. We show how to compute the
coefficient in this expansion using the first Lyapunov coefficient at the Hopf
bifurcation thereby avoiding use of this normal form. Our results connect the
theory of canard explosions with existing numerical software, enabling easier
calculations of where canard explosions occur.
