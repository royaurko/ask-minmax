DNA-gold nanoparticle assemblies have shown promise as an alternative
technology to DNA microarrays for DNA detection and RNA profiling.
Understanding the effect of DNA sequences on the melting temperature of the
system is central to developing reliable detection technology. We studied the
effects of DNA base-pairing defects, such as mismatches and deletions, on the
melting temperature of DNA-nanoparticle assemblies. We found that, contrary to
the general assumption that defects lower the melting temperature of DNA, some
defects increase the melting temperature of DNA-linked nanoparticle assemblies.
The effects of mismatches and deletions were found to depend on the specific
base pair, the sequence, and the location of the defects. Our results
demonstrate that the surface-bound DNA exhibit hybridization behavior different
from that of free DNA. Such findings indicate that a detailed understanding of
DNA-nanoparticle assembly phase behavior is required for quantitative
interpretation of DNA-nanoparticle aggregation.
