The topic of finding effective strategy to halt virus in complex network is
of current interest. We propose an immunization strategy for seasonal epidemics
that occur periodically. Based on the local information of the infection status
from the previous epidemic season, the selection of vaccinated nodes is
optimized gradually. The evolution of vaccinated nodes during iterations
demonstrates that the immunization tends to locate in both global hubs and
local hubs. We analyze the epidemic prevalence by a heterogeneous mean-field
method and present numerical simulations of our model. This immunization
performs superiorly to some other previously known strategies. Our work points
out a new direction in immunization of seasonal epidemics.
