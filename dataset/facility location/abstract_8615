The observed solar p-mode velocity power spectra are compared with
theoretically calculated power spectra over a range of mode degree and
frequency. The shape of the theoretical power spectra depends on the depth of
acoustic sources responsible for the excitation of p-modes, and also on the
multipole nature of the source. We vary the source depth to obtain the best fit
to the observed spectra. We find that quadrupole acoustic sources provide a
good fit to the observed spectra provided that the sources are located between
700 km and 1050 km below the top of the convection zone. The dipole sources
give a good fit for significantly shallower source, with a source-depth of
between 120 km and 350 km. The main uncertainty in the determination of depth
arises due to poor knowledge of nature of power leakages from modes with
adjacent degrees, and the background in the observed spectra.
