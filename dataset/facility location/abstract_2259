We present the results on P11 resonances obtained with Dubna-Mainz-Taipei
(DMT) dynamical model for pion-nucleon scattering and pion electromagnetic
production. The extracted values agree well, in general, with PDG values. One
pole is found corresponding to the Roper resonance and two more resonances are
definitely needed in DMT model. We further find indication for a narrow P11
resonance at around 1700 MeV with a width of around 50 MeV in both pi-N and
gamma-pi reactions.
