We have studied the radial distribution and luminosity function of normal
pulsars in the Galaxy, on the basis of the ATNF Pulsar Catalogue where the
distances are calculated according to the new electron density model NE2001. We
show that the maximum of galactocentric distribution of pulsars located near
3.5 kpc and the scale-length of this distribution is nearly 4 kpc. The surface
density of pulsars near the Galactic center (GC) is equal or slightly higher
than that in the solar neighborhood. The local density and birth-rate of
pulsars is 1.5 and 4 times higher than previous estimates, correspondingly
before and after beaming corrections. The dependence of these results on the
NE2001 model and recommendations for further improvement of the electron
density distribution are discussed. We derived the luminosity function of
pulsars at frequencies near 1400 MHz. In the limited band of luminosities, the
luminosity function has a slope near -1, but a new luminosity function may be
better fitted by a Log-Normal distribution.
