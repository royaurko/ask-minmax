We study futher the recently developed formalism for the axial gauges toward
the comparison of calculations and of the renormalization procedure in the
axial and the Lorentz gauges. We do this in the 1-loop approximation for the
wavefunction renormalization and the identity of the beta-functions in the two
gauges. We take as the starting point the relation between the Green's
functions in the two gauges obtained earlier. We obtain the relation between
the 1-loop propagators in the two gauges and locate those diagrams that
contribute to the difference between the wave-function renormalizations in the
two gauges. We further employ this relation between the Green's functions to
the case of the 3-point function and prove the identity of the beta functions
in the two gauges.
