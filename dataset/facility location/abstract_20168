Observing the Sun at high time and spatial scales is a step towards
understanding the finest and fundamental scales of heating events in the solar
corona. The Hi-C instrument has provided the highest spatial and temporal
resolution images of the solar corona in the EUV wavelength range to date. Hi-C
observed an active region on 11 July 2012, which exhibits several interesting
features in the EUV line at 193\AA: one of them is the existence of short,
small brightenings ``sparkling" at the edge of the active region; we call these
EUV Bright Dots (EBDs). Individual EBDs have a characteristic duration of 25s
with a characteristic length of 680 km. These brightenings are not fully
resolved by the SDO/AIA instrument at the same wavelength, however, they can be
identified with respect to the Hi-C location of the EBDs. In addition, EBDs are
seen in other chromospheric/coronal channels of SDO/AIA suggesting a
temperature between 0.5 and 1.5 MK. Based on their frequency in the Hi-C time
series, we define four different categories of EBDs: single peak, double peak,
long duration, and bursty EBDs. Based on a potential field extrapolation from
an SDO/HMI magnetogram, the EBDs appear at the footpoints of large-scale
trans-equatorial coronal loops. The Hi-C observations provide the first
evidence of small-scale EUV heating events at the base of these coronal loops,
which have a free magnetic energy of the order of 10$^{26}$ erg.
