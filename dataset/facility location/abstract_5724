We report on mid-infrared observations of the compact stellar cluster located
in the proximity of SGR 1900+14, and the radio/X-ray position of this
soft-gamma repeater. Observations were performed in May and June of 2001 when
the bursting source was in an active state. At the known radio and X-ray
position of the SGR we did not detect transient mid-IR activity, although the
observations were performed only hours before and after an outburst in the
high-energy band.
