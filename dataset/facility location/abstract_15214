Observations of four WR galaxies (NGC 5430, NGC 6764, Mrk 309 and VII Zw 19)
using the Infrared Space Observatory are presented here. ISOCAM maps of NGC
5430, Mrk 309 and NGC 6764 revealed the location of star formation regions in
each of these galaxies. ISOPHOT spectral observations from 4 to 12 microns
detected the ubiquitous PAH bands in the nuclei of the targets and several of
the disk star forming regions, while LWS spectroscopy detected [OI] and [CII]
emission lines from two galaxies, NGC 5430 and NGC 6764.
  Using a combination of ISO and IRAS flux densities, a dust model based on the
sum of modified blackbody components was successfully fitted to the available
data. These models were then used to calculate new values for the total IR
luminosities for each galaxy, the size of the various dust populations, and the
global SFR.
  The derived flux ratios, the SFRs, the high L(PAH)/L(40-120 microns) and
F(PAH 7.7 microns)/F(7.7 microns continuum) values suggest that most of these
galaxies are home to only a compact burst of star formation. The exception is
NGC 6764, whose F(PAH 7.7 microns)/F(7.7 microns continuum) value of 1.22 is
consistent with the presence of an AGN, yet the L(PAH)/L(40-120 microns) is
more in line with a starburst, a finding in line with a compact low-luminosity
AGN dominated by the starburst.
