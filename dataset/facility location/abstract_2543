We present observations of quiet-sun small-scale structures (SSS) in the
microwave range with the {\it Radio Astronomical Telescope of the Academy of
Sciences 600} (RATAN-600) spectral-polarization facility in a wide range of
frequencies. SSS are regularly recorded in routine observations of the large
reflector-type radio telescope and represent manifestations in the radio range
of various structures of the quiet-sun: supergranulation network, bright
points, plage patches and so on. A comparison with with images from the {\it
Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO) showed that the microwave emission comes from
a region extending from the chromosphere to the low transition region. We
measured the properties of the SSS as well as the degree of circular
polarization averaged over the beam of the radio telescope and from this we
estimated the magnetic field at the formation level of the radiation.
