Charged current reactions of nu_e on 12C have been studied using a mu
decay-at-rest nu_e beam from the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility. More than
500 events from the exclusive reaction 12C + nu_e -> e- + 12N g.s. were
measured in a large Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND). The observed
energy dependence of the cross section and the angular distribution of the
outgoing electron agree well with theoretical expectations. Measurements are
also presented for inclusive transitions to 12N excited states, 12C + nu_e ->
e- + 12N and compared with theoretical expectations. Results are consistent
with a recent Continuum Random Phase Approximation (CRPA) calculation.
