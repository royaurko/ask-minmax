Quiescent emission from the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary Cen X-4 is
seen to be variable on timescales from hundreds of seconds to years, suggesting
that at least in this object, low-level accretion is important during
quiescence. Here we present results from recent XMM-Newton and Swift
observations of Cen X-4, where the X-ray flux (0.5 - 10 keV) varies by a factor
of 6.5 between the brightest and faintest states. We find a positive
correlation between the X-ray flux and the simultaneous near-UV flux, where as
there is no significant correlation between the X-ray and simultaneous optical
(V, B) fluxes. This suggests that while the X-ray and UV emitting regions are
somehow linked, the optical region originates elsewhere. Comparing the
luminosities, it is plausible that the UV emission originates due to
reprocessing of the X-ray flux by the accretion disk, with the hot inner region
of the disk being a possible location for the UV emitting region. The optical
emission, however, could be dominated by the donor star. The X-ray/UV
correlation does not favour the accretion stream-impact point as the source of
the UV emission.
