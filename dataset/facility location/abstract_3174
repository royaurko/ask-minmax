The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment, a dual-phase xenon
time-projection chamber operating at the Sanford Underground Research Facility
(Lead, South Dakota), was cooled and filled in February 2013. We report results
of the first WIMP search dataset, taken during the period April to August 2013,
presenting the analysis of 85.3 live-days of data with a fiducial volume of 118
kg. A profile-likelihood analysis technique shows our data to be consistent
with the background-only hypothesis, allowing 90% confidence limits to be set
on spin-independent WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering with a minimum upper limit
on the cross section of $7.6 \times 10^{-46}$ cm$^{2}$ at a WIMP mass of 33
GeV/c$^2$. We find that the LUX data are in strong disagreement with low-mass
WIMP signal interpretations of the results from several recent direct detection
experiments.
