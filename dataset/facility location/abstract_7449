We present high spectral resolution VLT observations of the BAL quasar SDSS
J0318-0600. This high quality data set allows us to extract accurate ionic
column densities and determine an electron number density of n_e=10^3.3 +/- 0.2
cm^-3 for the main outflow absorption component. The heavily reddened spectrum
of SDSS J0318-0600 requires purely silicate dust with a reddening curve
characteristic of predominately large grains, from which we estimate the
bolometric luminosity. We carry out photoionization modeling to determine the
total column density, ionization parameter and distance of the gas and find
that the photionization models suggest abundances greater than solar. Due to
the uncertainty in the location of the dust extinction, we arrive at two viable
distances for the main ouflow component from the central source, 6 and 18 kpc,
where we consider the 6 kpc location as somewhat more physically plausable.
Assuming the canonical global covering of 20% for the outflow and a distance of
6 kpc, our analysis yields a mass flux of 120 M_sun yr^-1 and a kinetic
luminosity that is ~0.1% of the bolometric luminosity of the object. Should the
dust be part of the outflow, then these values are ~4x larger. The large mass
flux and kinetic luminosity make this outflow a significant contributor to AGN
feedback processes.
