Aggregates immersed in a plasma or radiative environment will have charge
distributed over their extended surface. Previous studies have modeled the
aggregate charge using the monopole and dipole terms of a multipole expansion,
with results indicating that the dipole-dipole interactions play an important
role in increasing the aggregation rate and altering the morphology of the
resultant aggregates. This study examines the effect that including the
quadrupole terms has on the dynamics of aggregates interacting with each other
and the confining electric fields in laboratory experiments. Results are
compared to modeling aggregates as a collection of point charges located at the
center of each spherical monomer comprising the aggregate.
