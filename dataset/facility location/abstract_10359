We consider static axially symmetric solutions of SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs
theory. The simplest such solutions represent monopoles, multimonopoles and
monopole-antimonopole pairs. In general such solutions are characterized by two
integers, the winding number m of their polar angle, and the winding number n
of their azimuthal angle. For solutions with n=1 and n=2, the Higgs field
vanishes at m isolated points along the symmetry axis, which are associated
with the locations of m monopoles and antimonopoles of charge n. These
solutions represent chains of m monopoles and antimonopoles in static
equilibrium. For larger values of n, totally different configurations arise,
where the Higgs field vanishes on one or more rings, centered around the
symmetry axis. We discuss the properties of such monopole-antimonopole chains
and vortex rings, in particular their energies and magnetic dipole moments, and
we study the influence of a finite Higgs self-coupling constant on these
solutions.
