We analyse inhibition of emission in a 2.5D photonic structures made up a
photonic crystal (PhC) and Bragg mirrors using FDTD simulations. A comparison
is made between an isolated PhC membrane and the same PhC suspended onto a
Bragg mirror or sandwiched between 2 Bragg mirrors. Strong inhibition of the
Purcell factor is observed in a broad spectral range, whatever the in-plane
orientation and location of the emitting dipole. We analysed these results
numerically and theoretically by simulating the experimentally observed
lifetime of a collection of randomly distributed emitters, showing that their
average emission rate is decreased by more than one decade, both for coupled or
isolated emitters.
