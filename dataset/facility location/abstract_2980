We have analyzed the profile of the millisecond pulsar PSR J0437-4715 at 1440
MHz by fitting the Gaussians to pulse components, and identified its 11
emission components. We propose that they form a emission beam with 5 nested
cones centered on the core. Using the phase location of component peaks, we
have estimated the aberration--retardation (A/R) phase shift. Due to A/R phase
shift, the centroid of intensity profile and the inflection point of
polarization angle swing are symmetrically shifted in the opposite directions
with respect to the meridional plane, which is defined by the rotation and
magnetic axes. By recognizing this fact, we have been able to locate the phase
location of meridional plane and estimate the absolute altitude of emission of
core and conal components relative to the neutron star center. Using the more
exact expression for phase shift given recently by Gangadhara (2005), we find
that the radio emission comes from a range of altitude starting from the core
at 7% of light cylinder radius to outer most cone at 30%.
