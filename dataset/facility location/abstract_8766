The star formation process in molecular clouds usually leads to the formation
of multiple stellar systems, mostly binaries. Remaining disks around those
stars may be located around individual stars (circumstellar disks) or around
the entire binary system (circumbinary disk). We shall briefly review the
present observational evidence for both types of disks in binary stars, in
particular the properties of circumbinary disks.
  We then present recent results of the theoretical modeling of the collapse
and fragmentation of gravitationally unstable molecular cloud cores and their
implications for binary and disk formation, and discuss the dynamical influence
of the binary companions on disk truncation and gap formation. The presence of
binaries may have profound influence on the process of planet formation as
well. We present results on the stability and evolution of orbits of planets in
disks around binaries.
