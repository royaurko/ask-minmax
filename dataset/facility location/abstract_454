We review the most recent results from experiments studying systems
containing charmed quarks. The selection reflects the presenter's bias, and
there is an emphasis on decays of open charm. We discuss precision measurements
of various sorts, various new states in the charmonium system, measurements
aimed at testing Lattice QCD, and the latest searches for charm mixing. We
conclude with a discussion of upcoming experiments at existing and future
facilities.
