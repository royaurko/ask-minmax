The data on the location of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) relative to their host
galaxies are used to derive the distribution of surface density of GRBs along
the galaxy radius. It is shown that the gradient of GRB surface density changes
abruptly near the half-light radius. In the central parts of galaxies the
distribution of GRBs resembles closely the luminosity distribution, while in
the outer parts the galactic surface brightness falls much steeper than the
GRBs density. The radial distribution of type Ib/c supernovae is investigated
on the basis of enlarged statistics. It is shown that SNe Ib/c do not differ
significantly from other types of supernovae and their distribution is more
similar to the one for recent star formation sites than that of GRBs. In spite
of the poor statistics of GRBs, the difference in the distributions of active
star formation regions and GRBs appears to be significant. We get the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov probability P_ks of only 4% that GRBs and star-forming sites
belong to the same distribution. The correlation of GRBs with the distribution
of dark matter in the outer parts of galaxies is not excluded.
