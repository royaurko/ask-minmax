We present optical spectroscopy of the emission line star BAL 224 (V=17.3,
B-V=0.46). This star also named KWBBE 485, [MA93]906 is located at the
periphery of the young SMC cluster NGC 330; it is known as a photometric
variable with a possible period around 1 day (Balona 1992). Furthermore it was
reported as the optical counterpart of the prominent mid-infrared source (MIR1)
by Kucinskas et al. (2000), indicating the presence of a dust shell. The star
was included in a sample of B-type stars observed using the ESO VLT-FLAMES
facilities. The presence of emission lines such as Fe II,[Fe II], [S II] make
this object like a B[e] star. The H$ alpha$, H$ gamma$ and H$ delta$ lines show
an asymmetrical double-peaked emission profile suggesting the presence of an
accretion disk. Moreover the MACHO and OGLE light curves were analyzed; in
addition to a long-term variability ($ simeq$ 2300d), a short period very close
to 1 day has been detected using different methods, confirming the variability
previously reported by Balona (1992). Finally the nature of this object is
reconsidered.
