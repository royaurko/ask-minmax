We present our NMR studies of double-layer hydrated cobalt oxides
NaxCoO2-yH2O (x ~ 0.35, y ~ 1.3) with various Tc = 0 - 4.8 K and magnetic
transition temperatures. High-resolution $^{1}$H NMR spectrum served as an
evidence for the existence of H$_{3}$O$^{+}$ oxonium ions. $^{23}$Na nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation rates served to detect local field fluctuations
sensitive to Tc. $^{59}$Co nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectra served to
classify the various Tc samples. From the classification by $^{59}$Co NQR
frequency, the double-layer hydrated compounds were found to have two
superconducting phases closely located to a magnetic phase. In the normal state
and at a magnetic field in the $ab$-plane, two $^{59}$Co NMR signals with
different Knight shifts and different $^{59}$Co nuclear spin-lattice relaxation
times $^{59}T_{1}$ were observed. The two $^{59}$Co NMR signals suggest
magnetic disproportionation of two Co sites or in-plane (XY) anisotropy of a
single Co site. Non Korringa behavior and power law behavior in zero-field NQR
1/$^{59}T_{1}$ above and below Tc suggest non-Fermi liquid and unconventional
superconductivity.
