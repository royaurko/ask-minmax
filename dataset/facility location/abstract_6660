Erosion creates beautiful landscapes. In most cases, it is just the local
population to know them. Google Maps can be helpful for locating the places,
for their studies and eventual projects of preservation. An interesting example
is given by a landscape of fairy chimneys in Peru, near Pampachiri and San
Pedro de Larcay. It is remarkable the fact that some of them have been adapted
as dwelling places.
