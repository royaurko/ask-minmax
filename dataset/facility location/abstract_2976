We have calculated an evolution of protoplanetary disk from an extensive set
of initial conditions using a time-dependent model capable of simultaneously
keeping track of the global evolution of gas and water-ice. A number of
simplifications and idealizations allows for an embodiment of gas-particle
coupling, coagulation, sedimentation, and evaporation/condensation processes.
We have shown that, when the evolution of ice is explicitly included, the
location of the snowline has to be calculated directly as the inner edge of the
region where ice is present and not as the radius where disk's temperature
equals the evaporation temperature of water-ice. The final location of the
snowline is set by an interplay between all involved processes and is farther
from the star than implied by the location of the evaporation temperature
radius. The evolution process naturally leads to an order of magnitude
enhancement in surface density of icy material.
