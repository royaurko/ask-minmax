We present the H$\alpha$ observations from ARIES, Nainital of a compact and
impulsive solar flare occurred on March 10, 2001 and associated with a CME. We
have also analysed HXT, SXT/Yohkoh observations as well as radio observations
from Nobeyama Radio Observatory to derive the energetics and dynamics of this
impulsive flare. We co-align the H$\alpha$, SXR, HXR, MW and magnetogram images
within the instrumental spatial resolution limit. We detect a single HXR source
in this flare, which is found spatially associated with one of the H$\alpha$
bright kernel. The unusual feature of HXR and H$\alpha$ sources, observed for
the first time, is the rotation during the impulsive phase in clockwise
direction. We propose that the rotation may be due to asymmetric progress of
the magnetic reconnection site or may be due to the change of peak point of the
electric field. In MW emission we found two sources, one is main source which
is at the main flare site and another is remote source located in South-West
direction. It appears that the remote source is formed by the impact of
accelerated energetic electrons from the main flare site. From the spatial
co-relation of multi-wavelength images of th
