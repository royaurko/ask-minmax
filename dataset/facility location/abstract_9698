We use parametrized linear combination of atomic orbitals calculations to
determine the stability, optimum geometry and electronic properties of
nanometer-sized capped graphitic cones, called ``nano-horns''. Different
nano-horn morphologies are considered, which differ in the relative location of
the five terminating pentagons. Simulated scanning tunneling microscopy images
of the various structures at different bias voltages reflect a net electron
transfer towards the pentagon vertex sites. We find that the local density of
states at the tip, observable by scanning tunneling spectroscopy, can be used
to discriminate between different tip structures. Our molecular dynamics
simulations indicate that disintegration of nano-horns at high temperatures
starts in the highest-strain region near the tip.
