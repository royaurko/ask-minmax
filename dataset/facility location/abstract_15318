Radioastronomical studies have indicated that the magnetic field in the
central few hundred parsecs of our Milky Way Galaxy has a dipolar geometry and
a strength substantially larger than elsewhere in the Galaxy, with estimates
ranging up to a milligauss. A strong, large-scale magnetic field can affect the
Galactic orbits of molecular clouds by exerting a drag on them, it can inhibit
star formation, and it can guide a wind of cosmic rays away from the central
region, so a characterization of the magnetic field at the Galactic center is
important for understanding much of the activity there. Here, we report Spitzer
Space Telescope observations of an unprecedented infrared nebula having the
morphology of an intertwined double helix. This feature is located about 100 pc
from the Galaxy's dynamical centre toward positive Galactic latitude, and its
axis is oriented perpendicular to the Galactic plane. The observed segment is
about 25 pc in length, and contains about 1.25 full turns of each of the two
continuous, helically wound strands. We interpret this feature as a torsional
Alfven wave propagating vertically away from the Galactic disk, driven by
rotation of the magnetized circumnuclear gas disk. As such, it offers a new
morphological probe of the Galactic center magnetic field. The direct
connection between the circumnuclear disk and the double helix is ambiguous,
but the MSX images show a possible meandering channel that warrants further
investigation.
