To fully utilize graphene's remarkable optical properties for optoelectronic
applications, it needs to be integrated in planar photonic systems. Here, we
demonstrate integration of graphene on silicon photonic circuits and precise
measurement of the optical absorption coefficient in a graphene/waveguide
hybrid structure. A method based on Mach-Zehnder interferometry is employed to
achieve high measurement precision and consistency, yielding a maximal value of
absorption coefficient of 0.2 dB/{\mu}m when graphene is located directly on
top of the waveguide. The results agree with theoretical model utilizing the
universal ac conductivity in graphene. Our work provides an important guide for
the design and optimization of integrated graphene optoelectronic devices.
