We present a catalog of 520 most isolated nearby galaxies with radial
velocities V_LG<3500 km/s covering the entire sky. This population of "space
orphans" makes up 4.8% among 10900 galaxies with measured radial velocities. We
describe the isolation criterion used to select our sample, called the "Local
Orphan Galaxies" (LOG), and discuss their basic optical and HI properties. A
half of the LOG catalog is occupied by the Sdm, Im and Ir morphological type
galaxies without a bulge. The median ratio M_gas/M_star in the LOG galaxies
exceeds 1. The distribution of the catalog galaxies on the sky looks uniform
with some signatures of a weak clustering on the scale of about 0.5 Mpc. The
LOG galaxies are located in the regions where the mean local density of matter
is approximately 50 times lower than the mean global density. We indicate a
number of LOG galaxies with distorted structures, which may be the consequence
of interaction of isolated galaxies with massive dark objects.
