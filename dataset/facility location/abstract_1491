Interstellar matter is known to be strongly irradiated by radiation and
several types of cosmic ray particles. Simulated interstellar matter, such as
forsterite $\rm Mg_{2}SiO_{4}$, enstatite $\rm MgSiO_{3}$ and magnesite $\rm
MgCO_{3}$ has been irradiated with the $\rm ^{60}Co$ gamma-rays in liquid
nitrogen, and also irradiated with fast neutrons at 10 K and 70 K by making use
of the low-temperature irradiation facility of Kyoto University Reactor
(KUR-LTL. Maximum fast neutron dose is $10^{17}n_f{\rm /cm^{2}}$).
 After irradiation, samples are stored in liquid nitrogen for several months to
allow the decay of induced radioactivity. We measured the luminescence spectra
of the gamma ray irradiated samples during warming to 370K using a
spectrophotometer. For the forsterite and magnesite, the spectra exhibit a
rather intense peak at about 645 -- 655 nm and 660 nm respectively, whereas
luminescence scarcely appeared in olivine sample. The spectra of forsterite is
very similar to the ERE of the Red Rectangle.
