We have observed the ultracompact HII region G29.96-0.02 in the near infrared
J, H, and K bands and in the Br-gamma line. By comparison with radio
observations, we determine that the extinction to the nebula is AK = 2.14 with
a 3 sigma uncertainty of 0.25. We identify the ionizing star and determine its
intrinsic K magnitude. The star does not have an infrared excess and so appears
to be no longer accreting. The K magnitude and the bolometric luminosity allow
us to place limits on the location of the ionizing star in the HR diagram. The
3 sigma upper limit on the effective temperature of the ionizing star is 42500
K. We favor a luminosity appropriate for star with a mass in excess of about 60
solar masses. The limit on the temperature and luminosity exclude stars on the
ZAMS and stars within 10^6 yr of the ZAMS. Since the age of the UC HII region
is estimated to be only about 10^5 yr, we suggest that this is direct evidence
that the stellar birth line for massive stars at twice solar metallicity must
be significantly redder than the ZAMS.
