Device-to-Device (D2D) communication was initially proposed in cellular
networks as a new paradigm to enhance network performance. The emergence of new
applications such as content distribution and location-aware advertisement
introduced new use-cases for D2D communications in cellular networks. The
initial studies showed that D2D communication has advantages such as increased
spectral efficiency and reduced communication delay. However, this
communication mode introduces complications in terms of interference control
overhead and protocols that are still open research problems. The feasibility
of D2D communications in LTE-A is being studied by academia, industry, and the
standardization bodies. To date, there are more than 100 papers available on
D2D communications in cellular networks and, there is no survey on this field.
In this article, we provide a taxonomy based on the D2D communicating spectrum
and review the available literature extensively under the proposed taxonomy.
Moreover, we provide new insights to the over-explored and under-explored areas
which lead us to identify open research problems of D2D communication in
cellular networks.
