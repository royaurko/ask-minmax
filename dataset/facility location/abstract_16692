The dust cloud TGU H645 P2 and embedded in it young open cluster NGC 7129 are
investigated using the results of medium-band photometry of 159 stars in the
Vilnius seven-colour system down to V = 18.8 mag. The photometric data were
used to classify about 50 percent of the measured stars in spectral and
luminosity classes. The extinction A_V vs. distance diagram for the 20x20
arcmin area is plotted for 155 stars with two-dimensional classification from
the present and the previous catalogues. The extinction values found range
between 0.6 and 3.4 mag. However, some red giants, located in the direction of
the dense parts of the cloud, exhibit the infrared extinction equivalent up to
A_V = 13 mag. The distance to the cloud (and the cluster) is found to be 1.15
kpc (the true distance modulus 10.30 mag). For determining the age of NGC 7129,
a luminosity vs. temperature diagram for six cluster members of spectral
classes B3 to A1 was compared with the Pisa pre-main-sequence evolution tracks
and the Palla birthlines. The cluster can be as old as about 3 Myr, but star
forming continues till now as witnessed by the presence in the cloud of many
younger pre-main-sequence objects identified with photometry from 2MASS,
Spitzer and WISE infrared surveys.
