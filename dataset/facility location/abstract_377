The work presented in this Tesi di Laurea arises from a collaboration between
the IPL (Image Processing Laboratory) of the Dipartimento di Elettrotecnica,
Elettronica ed Informatica (DEEI) at the University of Trieste and the
Instrumentation and Detector Laboratory belonging to the ELETTRA Synchrotron
Light Source of Trieste. Under the European Contract ERBFMGECT 980104 a project
was active at ELETTRA with the objective to improve facilities for time
resolved small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments within Europe.
Partners of the project were, together with ELETTRA, other large scale
facilities like the HASYLAB (Hamburger Synchrotron, Germany), the CCLRC
(Daresbury Laboratory, UK), the ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility
in Grenoble, France) and the University of Siegen (Germany). In particular the
latest half of the time spent working on this project was based in the
Arbeitsgruppe Detektorphysik und Elektronik belonging to the Faculty of Physics
at the University of Siegen.
