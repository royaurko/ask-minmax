With an effective chiral flavour SU(3) model we show the effect of hadronic
resonances on the QCD phase diagram. We state that varying the resonance
couplings to the scalar and vector fields affects the order and location of the
phase transition, the possible existence of a critical end point (CEP), and the
thermodynamic properties. We present (strange) quark number susceptibilities at
zero baryochemical potential and at three different points at the phase
transition. Comparing results to lattice QCD, we state that reasonable large
vector couplings limit the phase transition to a smooth crossover ruling out a
CEP.
