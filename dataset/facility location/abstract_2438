Modern coronagraphic systems require very precise alignment between optical
components and can benefit greatly from automated image processing. We discuss
three techniques commonly employed in the fields of computer vision and image
analysis as applied to the Gemini Planet Imager, a new facility instrument for
the Gemini South Observatory. We describe how feature extraction and clustering
methods can be used to aid in automated system alignment tasks, and also
present a search algorithm for finding regular features in science images used
for calibration and data processing. Along with discussions of each technique,
we present our specific implementation and show results of each one in
operation.
