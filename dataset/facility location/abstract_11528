Based on $58 \times 10^6 $ $J/\psi$ events collected by BESII, the decay
$J/\psi \to K^{\pm} K_s \pi^{\mp} \pi^0$ is studied. In the invariant mass
spectrum recoiling against the charged $K^*(892)^{\pm}$, the charged $\kappa$
particle is found as a low mass enhancement. If a Breit-Wigner function of
constant width is used to parameterize the kappa, its pole locates at $(849 \pm
77 ^{+18}_{-14}) -i (256 \pm 40 ^{+46}_{-22})$ MeV/$c^2$. Also in this channel,
the decay $J/\psi \to K^*(892)^+ K^*(892)^-$ is observed for the first time.
Its branching ratio is $(1.00 \pm 0.19 ^{+0.11}_{-0.32}) \times 10^{-3}$.
