PROOF, the Parallel ROOT Facility, is a ROOT-based framework which enables
interactive parallelism for event-based tasks on a cluster of computing nodes.
Although PROOF can be used simply from within a ROOT session with no additional
requirements, deploying and configuring a PROOF cluster used to be not as
straightforward. Recently great efforts have been spent to make the
provisioning of generic PROOF analysis facilities with zero configuration, with
the added advantages of positively affecting both stability and scalability,
making the deployment operations feasible even for the end user. Since a
growing amount of large-scale computing resources are nowadays made available
by Cloud providers in a virtualized form, we have developed the Virtual
PROOF-based Analysis Facility: a cluster appliance combining the solid CernVM
ecosystem and PoD (PROOF on Demand), ready to be deployed on the Cloud and
leveraging some peculiar Cloud features such as elasticity. We will show how
this approach is effective both for sysadmins, who will have little or no
configuration to do to run it on their Clouds, and for the end users, who are
ultimately in full control of their PROOF cluster and can even easily restart
it by themselves in the unfortunate event of a major failure. We will also show
how elasticity leads to a more optimal and uniform usage of Cloud resources.
