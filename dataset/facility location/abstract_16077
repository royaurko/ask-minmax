When we cut an i.i.d. sequence of letters into words according to an
independent renewal process, we obtain an i.i.d. sequence of words. In the
\emph{annealed} large deviation principle (LDP) for the empirical process of
words, the rate function is the specific relative entropy of the observed law
of words w.r.t. the reference law of words. In the present paper we consider
the \emph{quenched} LDP, i.e., we condition on a typical letter sequence. We
focus on the case where the renewal process has an \emph{algebraic} tail. The
rate function turns out to be a sum of two terms, one being the annealed rate
function, the other being proportional to the specific relative entropy of the
observed law of letters w.r.t. the reference law of letters, with the former
being obtained by concatenating the words and randomising the location of the
origin. The proportionality constant equals the tail exponent of the renewal
process. Earlier work by Birkner considered the case where the renewal process
has an exponential tail, in which case the rate function turns out to be the
first term on the set where the second term vanishes and to be infinite
elsewhere. In a companion paper the annealed and the quenched LDP are applied
to the collision local time of transient random walks, and the existence of an
intermediate phase for a class of interacting stochastic systems is
established.
