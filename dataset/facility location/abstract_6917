186Pt was tested in the framework of IBM-1 and the X(3) model. The results
show that 186Pt is located close to the shape phase transition point, but the
B(E2) values little agree with the X(3) model. The shape evolution in the yrast
states of 186Pt is also discussed in detail. TRS calculation exhibits a at
bottomed potential at low spin states, but a relatively deep minimum at high
spin states. It suggests that a shape evolution from vibrational mode to
rotational mode happens in 186Pt. The result is in agreement with the E-GOS
calculation.
