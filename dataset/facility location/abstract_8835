While all but one Gamma-Ray Bursts observed in the X-ray band showed an X-ray
afterglow, about 60 per cent of them have not been detected in the optical
band. We demonstrate that in many cases this is not due to adverse observing
conditions, or delay in performing the observations. We also show that the
optically non-detected afterglows are not affected by particularly large
Galactic absorbing columns, since its distribution is similar for both the
detected and non-detected burst subclasses. We then investigate the hypothesis
that the failure of detecting the optical afterglow is due to absorption at the
source location. We find that this is a marginally viable interpretation, but
only if the X-ray burst and afterglow emission and the possible optical/UV
flash do not destroy the dust responsible for absorption in the optical band.
If dust is efficiently destroyed, we are led to conclude that bursts with no
detected optical afterglow are intrinsically different. Prompt infrared
observations are the key to solve this issue.
