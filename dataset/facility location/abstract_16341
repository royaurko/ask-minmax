CH stars form a distinct class of objects with characteristic properties like
iron deficiency, enrichment of carbon and overabundance in heavy elements.
These properties can provide strong observational constraints for theoretical
computation of nucleosynthesis at low-metallicity. An important question is the
relative surface density of CH stars which can provide valuable inputs to our
understanding on the role of low to intermediate-mass stars in the early
Galactic chemical evolution. Spectroscopic characterization provides an
effective way of identifying CH stars. The present analysis is aimed at a
quantitative assessment of the fraction of CH stars in a sample of stars using
a set of spectral classification criteria. The sample consists of 92 objects
selected from a collection of candidate Faint High Latitude Carbon stars from
the Hamburg/ESO survey. Medium resolution (R ~ 1300) spectra for these objects
were obtained using OMR at VBO, Kavalur and HFOSC at HCT, IAO, Hanle, during
2007 - 2009 spanning a wavelength range 3800 - 6800 A. Spectral analysis shows
36 of the 92 objects to be potential CH stars; combined with our earlier
studies (Goswami 2005, Goswami et al. 2007) this implies ~ 37% (of 243) objects
as the CH fraction. We present spectral descriptions of the newly identified CH
star candidates. Estimated effective temperatures, 12C/13C isotopic ratios and
their locations on the two colour J-H vs H-K plot are used to support their
identification.
