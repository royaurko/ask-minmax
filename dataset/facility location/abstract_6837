Regulatory relationships of 686 intronic miRNA and 784 intergenic miRNAs with
mRNAs of 51 intronic miRNA coding genes were established. Interaction features
of studied miRNAs with 5'UTR, CDS and 3'UTR of mRNA of each gene were revealed.
Functional regions of mRNA were shown to be significantly heterogenous
according to the number of binding sites of miRNA and to the location density
of these sites.
