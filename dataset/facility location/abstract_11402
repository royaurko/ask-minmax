The kinetics of isotropic-nematic (I-N) and nematic-isotropic (N-I) phase
transitions in dispersions of rod-like {\it fd}-viruses are studied.
Concentration quenches were applied using pressure jumps in combination with
polarization microscopy, birefringence and turbidity measurements. The full
biphasic region could be accessed, resulting in the construction of a first
experimental analogue of the bifurcation diagram. The N-I spinodal points for
dispersions of rods with varying concentrations of depletion agents (dextran)
were obtained from orientation quenches, using cessation of shear flow in
combination with small angle light scattering. We found that the location of
the N-I spinodal point is independent of the attraction, which was confirmed by
theoretical calculations. Surprisingly, the experiments showed that also the
absolute induction time, the critical nucleus and the growth rate are
insensitive of the attraction, when the concentration is scaled to the distance
to the phase boundaries.
