A 60 MeV beam at the BNL Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) was manipulated by a
planar tunable de-chirper made out of two 10 cm long dielectric slabs with
copper plated backs. While the gap was changed from 5.8 mm to 1 mm, the
correlated energy chirp of the low charge electron bunch was reduced from
approximately 330 keV/mm to zero. This result is in agreement with simulations.
Calculations show that similar devices, properly scaled to account for the
expected electron bunch charge and length, can be used to remove residual
correlated energy spread at the end of the linacs used for free-electron lasers
(FEL). Potentially, this technique could significantly simplify linac design
and improve FEL performance.
