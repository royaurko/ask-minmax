A new CLIC Test Facility (CTF3) at CERN will serve to study the drive beam
generation for the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). CTF3 has to accelerate a 3.5
A electron beam in almost fully-loaded structures. The pulse contains more than
2000 bunches, one in every second RF bucket, and has a length of more than one
microsecond. Different options for the lattice of the drive-beam accelerator
are presented, based on FODO-cells and triplets as well as solenoids. The
transverse stability is simulated, including the effects of beam jitter,
alignment and beam-based correction.
