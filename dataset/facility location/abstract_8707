Previous calculations of Fe K-alpha line profiles are based on axisymmetric
emissivity laws. In this paper, we show line profiles driven by non-axial
symmetric illumination which results from an off-axis X-ray point source. We
find that source location and motion have significant effects on the red wing
and blue horn of the line profiles. The disk region under the source will
receive more flux, which is the most important factor to affect the line
profiles. We suggest that at least part of the variation in Fe K-alpha line
profiles is caused by the motion of X-ray sources. Future observations of Fe
K-alpha line profiles will provide more information about the distribution and
motion of the X-ray sources around black holes, and hence the underlying
physics.
