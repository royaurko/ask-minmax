The stars that end their lives as supernovae (SNe) have been directly
observed in only a handful of cases, due mainly to the extreme difficulty in
identifying them in images obtained prior to the SN explosions. Here we report
the identification of the progenitor for the recent Type II-plateau
(core-collapse) SN 2005cs in pre-explosion archival images of the Whirlpool
Galaxy (M51) obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for
Surveys (ACS). From high-quality ground-based images of the SN from the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we precisely determine the position of the SN
and are able to isolate the SN progenitor to within 0".04 in the HST/ACS
optical images. We further pinpoint the SN location to within 0".005 from
HST/ACS ultraviolet images of the SN, confirming our progenitor identification.
  From photometry of the SN progenitor obtained with the pre-SN ACS images, and
also limits to its brightness in pre-SN HST/NICMOS images, we infer that the
progenitor is a red supergiant star of spectral type K0--M3, with initial mass
7--9 Msun. We also discuss the implications of the SN 2005cs progenitor
identification and its mass estimate. There is an emerging trend that the most
common Type II-plateau SNe originate from low-mass supergiants 8--15 Msun.
