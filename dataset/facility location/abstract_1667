We compute the leading order (in alpha_s) perturbative QCD and power
(1/m_b^2) corrections to the hadronic invariant mass and hadron energy spectra
in the decay B \to X_s \ell^+ \ell^- in standard model using the heavy quark
expansion technique (HQET). Results for the first two hadronic moments < S_H^n>
and <E_H^n>, n=1,2, are presented here working out their sensitivity on the
HQET parameters lambda_1 and \bar{\Lambda}. Data from the forthcoming B
facilities can be used to measure the short-distance contribution in B \to X_s
\ell^+ \ell^- and determine the HQET parameters from the moments <S_H^n>. This
can be combined with the analysis of semileptonic decays B \to X \ell \nu_\ell
to determine them precisely.
