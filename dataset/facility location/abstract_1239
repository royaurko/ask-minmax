An in-trap decay spectroscopy setup has been developed and constructed for
use with the TITAN facility at TRIUMF. The goal of this device is to observe
weak electron-capture (EC) branching ratios for the odd-odd intermediate nuclei
in the $\beta\beta$ decay process. This apparatus consists of an up-to 6 Tesla,
open-access spectroscopy ion-trap, surrounded radially by up to 7 planar Si(Li)
detectors which are separated from the trap by thin Be windows. This
configuration provides a significant increase in sensitivity for the detection
of low-energy photons by providing backing-free ion storage and eliminating
charged-particle-induced backgrounds. An intense electron beam is also employed
to increase the charge-states of the trapped ions, thus providing storage times
on the order of minutes, allowing for decay-spectroscopy measurements. The
technique of multiple ion-bunch stacking was also recently demonstrated, which
further extends the measurement possibilities of this apparatus. The current
status of the facility and initial results from a $^{116}$In measurement are
presented.
