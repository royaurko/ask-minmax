Resonance Raman experiments on doped and photoexcited single crystals of
mixed-halide $MX$ complexes ($M$=Pt; $X$=Cl,Br) clearly indicate charge
separation: electron polarons preferentially locate on PtBr segments while hole
polarons are trapped within PtCl segments. This polaron selectivity,
potentially very useful for device applications, is demonstrated theoretically
using a discrete, 3/4-filled, two-band, tight-binding, extended Peierls-Hubbard
model. Strong hybridization of the PtCl and PtBr electronic bands is the
driving force for separation.
