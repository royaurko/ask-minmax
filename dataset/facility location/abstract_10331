We discuss the brane cosmology in the 5D anti de Sitter Schwarzschild
(AdSS$_5$) spacetime. A brane with the tension $\sigma$ is defined as the edge
of an AdSS$_5$ space. We point out that the location of the horizon is an
apparently, singular point at where we may not define an embedding of the
AdSS$_5$ spacetime into the moving domain wall (MDW). We resolve this problem
by introducing a radially infalling brane (RIB) in AdSS$_5$ space, where an
apparent singularity turns out to be a coordinate one. Hence the
CFT/FRW-cosmology is well-defined at the horizon. As an example, an universal
Cardy formula for the entropy of the CFT can be given by the Friedmann equation
at the horizon.
