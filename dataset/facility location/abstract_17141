Measurements of the coefficient of thermal expansion on the spin-liquid
candidate $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ have revealed distinct and
strongly anisotropic lattice effects around 6 K - a possible spin-liquid
instability. In order to study the effects of a magnetic field on the
low-temperature spin-liquid state, dilatometric measurements have been
conducted both as a function of temperature at \emph{B} = const. and as a
function of field at \emph{T} = const. While the 6 K anomaly is found to be
insensitive to magnetic fields \emph{B} $\leq$ 10 T, the maximum field applied,
surprisingly strong \emph{B}-induced effects are observed for magnetic fields
applied along the in-plane \emph{b}-axis. Above a threshold field of 0.5 T <
\emph{B}$_c$ $\leq$ 1 T, a jump-like anomaly is observed in the \emph{b}-axis
lattice parameter. This anomaly, which is located at 8.7 K at \emph{B} = 1 T,
grows in size and shifts to lower temperatures with increasing the magnetic
field. Although the anomaly bears resemblance to a first-order phase
transition, the lack of hysteresis suggests otherwise.
