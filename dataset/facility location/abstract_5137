This work demonstrates an innovative numerical method for counting and
locating eigenvalues with the Evans function. Utilizing the geometric phase in
the Hopf bundle, the technique calculates the winding of the Evans function
about a contour in the spectral plane, describing the eigenvalues enclosed by
the contour for the Hocking-Stewartson pulse of the complex Ginzburg-Landau
equation. Locating eigenvalues with the geometric phase in the Hopf bundle was
proposed by Way in "Dynamics in the Hopf bundle, the geometric phase and
implications for dynamical systems", and proven in Grudzien, Jones "Finding
Eigenvalues the Rupert Way". Way demonstrated his proposed method for the
Hocking-Stewartson pulse, and this work redevelops this example as in the proof
of the method in Grudzien, Jones, modifying his numerical shooting argument,
and concludes with new numerical results concerning the phase transition.
