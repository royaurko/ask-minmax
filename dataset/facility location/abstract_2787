The problem of locating the global optimum of functions is studied in a
dynamic setting. The dynamics of simple multistable systems under the influence
of chaotic forcing is investigated. When the magnitude of the forcing signal
decays slowly, it is shown that the system attains an equilibrium state, which
corresponds to the global optimum of the corresponding multimodal potential
function. The role of bifurcations in facilitating the approach to the global
optimum is discussed.
