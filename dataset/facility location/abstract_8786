We present evidence that the high-velocity CIV lambda 1549 emission line gas
of radio-loud quasars may originate in a disk-like configuration, in close
proximity to the accretion disk often assumed to emit the low-ionization lines.
For a sample of 36 radio-loud z~2 quasars we find the 20--30% peak width to
show significant inverse correlations with the fractional radio core-flux
density, R, the radio axis inclination indicator. Highly inclined systems have
broader line wings, consistent with a high-velocity field perpendicular to the
radio axis. By contrast, the narrow line-core shows no such relation with R, so
the lowest velocity CIV-emitting gas has an inclination independent velocity
field. We propose that this low-velocity gas is located at higher
disk-altitudes than the high-velocity gas. A planar origin of the high-velocity
CIV-emission is consistent with the current results and with an accretion
disk-wind emitting the broad lines. A spherical distribution of randomly
orbiting broad-line clouds and a polar high-ionization outflow are ruled out.
