The structures for the TRI$\mu$P facility have been completed and
commissioned. At the facility radioactive nuclides are produced to study
fundamental interactions and symmetries. An important feature is the
possibility to trap radioactive atoms in order to obtain and hold a pure
substrate-free sample for precision measurements. In the TRI$\mu$P facility a
production target is followed by a magnetic separator, where radioactive
isotopes are produced in inverse reaction kinematics. Separation up to 99.95%
could be achieved for $^{21}$Na. A novel transmitting thermal ionizing device
was developed to stop the energetic isotopes. Some 50% of stopped $^{21}$Na
could be extracted and transported as low energy singly charged ions into a
radio frequency quadrupole cooler and buncher with 35% transmission efficiency.
The ions are transported lossless via a drift tube and a low energy
electrostatic beam line into the experimental setup. Such ions can be
neutralized on hot metal foils and the resulting atoms can be stored in a
magneto-optical trap. The functioning of that principle was demonstrated with
stable Na extracted from the thermal ionizer, radioactive beams will follow
next.
