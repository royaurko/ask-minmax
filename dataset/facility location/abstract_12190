The starting point of the present paper is Bell's notion of local causality
and his own sharpening of it so as to provide for mathematical formalisation.
Starting with Norsen's (2007, 2009) analysis of this formalisation, it is
subjected to a critique that reveals two crucial aspects that have so far not
been properly taken into account. These are (i) the correct understanding of
the notions of sufficiency, completeness and redundancy involved; and (ii) the
fact that the apparatus settings and measurement outcomes have very different
theoretical roles in the candidate theories under study. Both aspects are not
adequately incorporated in the standard formalisation, and we will therefore do
so. The upshot of our analysis is a more detailed, sharp and clean mathematical
expression of the condition of local causality. A preliminary analysis of the
repercussions of our proposal shows that it is able to locate exactly where and
how the notions of locality and causality are involved in formalising Bell's
condition of local causality.
