Maps of Galactic polarized continuum emission at 1408, 1660, and 1713 MHz
towards the local Taurus molecular cloud complex were made with the Effelsberg
100-m telescope. Minima in the polarized emission which are located at the
boundary of a molecular cloud were detected. Beside high rotation measures and
unusual spectral indices of the polarized intensity, these features are
associated with the molecular gas. At the higher frequencies the minima get
less distinct. We have modelled the multi-frequency observations by placing
magneto-ionic Faraday screens at the distance of the molecular cloud. In this
model Faraday rotated background emission adds to foreground emission towards
these screens. The systematic variation of the observed properties is the
result of different line-of-sight lengths through the screen assuming spherical
symmetry. For a distance of 140 pc to the Taurus clouds the physical sizes of
the Faraday screens are of the order of 2 pc. In this paper we describe the
data calibration and modelling process for one such object. We find an
intrinsic rotation measure of about -29 rad/m^{2} to model the observations. It
is pointed out that the observed rotation measure differs from the physical.
Further observational constraints from H-alpha observations limit the thermal
electron density to less than 0.8 cm^{-3}, and we conclude that the regular
magnetic field strength parallel to the line-of-sight exceeds 20 micro Gauss to
account for the intrinsic rotation measure.
