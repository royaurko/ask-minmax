The Third EGRET Catalog (3EG) lists 66 high-confidence identifications of
sources with Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). All are classified as belonging to
the blazar class, with the only exception of the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus
A. We report and strengthen the association of another radio galaxy, 3C111,
with the EGRET source 3EG J0416+3650. At the time of the compilation of the 3EG
catalogue, 3C111 has been considered as a low-confidence counterpart of
3EGJ0416+3650, being located outside the 99% gamma-ray probability contour.
Since this first suggestion, no other counterparts have been reported nor the
EGRET error box has been searched for likely candidates. 3C111 has never been
considerated or cited in literature as a radiogalaxy counterpart of an EGRET
source. We report a detailed multiwavelength study of the EGRET error box as
well as for the first time the overall spectral energy distribution of 3C111,
which appears to be intriguingly similar to those of blazars, suggesting that
the radiogalaxy 3C111 is the likely counterpart of 3EG J0416+3650.
