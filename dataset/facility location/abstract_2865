We report the results of Monte Carlo simulations investigating the effect of
a spherical confinement within a simple model for a flexible homopolymer. We
use the parallel tempering method combined with multi-histogram reweighting
analysis and multicanonical simulations to investigate thermodynamical
observables over a broad range of temperatures, which enables us to describe
the behavior of the polymer and to locate the freezing and collapse
transitions. We find a strong effect of the spherical confinement on the
location of the collapse transition, whereas the freezing transition is hardly
effected.
