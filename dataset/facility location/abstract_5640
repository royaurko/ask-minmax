The stochastic excitation of solar oscillations due to turbulent convection
is reviewed. A number of different observational results that provide test for
solar p-mode excitation theories are described. I discuss how well the
stochastic excitation theory does in explaining these observations. The
location and properties of sources that excite solar p-modes are also
described. Finally, I discuss why solar g-modes should be linearly stable, and
estimate the surface velocity amplitudes of low degree g-modes assuming that
they are stochastically excited by the turbulent convection in the sun.
