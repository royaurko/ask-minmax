We report the discovery of a very unusual, predominantly one-sided radio
galaxy CGCG049-033. Its radio jet, the largest detected so far, emits strongly
polarized synchrotron radiation and can be traced all the way from the galactic
nucleus to the hot spot located ~440 kpc away. This jet emanates from an
extremely massive black-hole (mass > 10^9 times solar mass) and forms a
strikingly compact radio lobe. To a surface brightness contrast of at least 20
no radio lobe is detected on the side of the counter-jet, which is similar to
the main jet in brightness upto the scale of tens of kpc. Thus, contrary to the
nearly universal trend, the brightness asymmetry in this radio galaxy increases
with distance from the nucleus. With several unusual properties, including a
predominantly toroidal magnetic field, this Fanaroff-Riley type II (FR-II)
mega-jet is an exceptionally useful laboratory for testing the role of magnetic
field in jet stabilization and radio lobe formation.
