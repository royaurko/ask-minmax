We study the problem of the low-energy quasiparticle spectrum of the extended
t-J model and analyze the coherent hopping between weakly coupled planes
described by this model. Starting with a two-band model describing the Cu-O
planes and the unoccupied bands associated to the metallic atoms located in
between the planes, we obtain effective hopping matrix elements describing the
c-axis charge transfer. A computational study of these processes shows an
anomalously large charge anisotropy for doping concentrations around and below
the optimal doping.
