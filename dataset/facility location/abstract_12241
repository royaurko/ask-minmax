The light curves of 50 RRab (RR0) stars in M5 collected in Paper I are
investigated to detect Blazhko modulation. 18 Blazhko stars are identified, and
modulation is suspected in two additional cases. The mean pulsation period of
Blazhko stars is 0.04 d shorter than the mean period of the entire RRab sample
in M5. Among the RRab stars with period shorter than 0.55 d the incidence rate
of the modulation is as high as 60 per cent. The mean $B-V$ colours of Blazhko
stars overlap with the colours of first overtone RRc (RR1) pulsators. The mean
$V$ magnitudes of Blazhko stars are on the average 0.05-mag fainter than those
of the RRab stars with stable light curves. Blazhko stars tend to be situated
close to the zero-age horizontal branch at the blue edge of the
fundamental-mode instability strip in M5. We speculate that this specific
location hints that the Blazhko effect may have an evolutionary connection with
the mode switch from the fundamental to the overtone-mode pulsation.
