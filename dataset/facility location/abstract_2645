KOSMOS and COSMOS are twin high-efficiency imaging spectrographs that have
been deployed as NOAO facility instruments for the Mayall 4-meter telescope on
Kitt Peak in Arizona and for the Blanco telescope on Cerro Tololo in Chile,
respectively. The NOAO Data Handling System (DHS) has seen aggressive use over
several years at both the Blanco and Mayall telescopes with NEWFIRM (the NOAO
Extremely Wide-Field Infrared Imager) and the Mosaic-1.1 wide-field optical
imager. Both of these instruments also rely on the Monsoon array controller and
related software, and on instrument-specific versions of the NOAO Observation
Control System (NOCS). NOCS, Monsoon and DHS are thus a well-tested software
suite that was adopted by the KOSMOS project. This document describes the
specifics of the KOSMOS implementation of DHS, in particular in support of the
original two-amplifier e2v 2Kx4K CCD detectors with which the instruments were
commissioned. The emphasis will be on the general layout of the DHS software
components and the flow of data and metadata through the system as received
from Monsoon and the NOCS. Instructions will be provided for retrieving and
building the software, and for taking simulated and actual exposures.
