On the basis of the separated form-factors model, parameters of the
polydispersed unilamellar DMPC vesicle population are analyzed. The neutron
scattering length density across the membrane is simulated on the basis of
fluctuated model of lipid bilayer. The hydration of vesicle is described by
sigmoid distribution function of the water molecules. The results of fitting of
the experimental data obtained at the small angle spectrometer SANS-I, PSI
(Switzerland) are: average vesicle radius 272 angstrom, polydispersity of the
radius 27%, membrane thickness 50.6 angstrom, thickness of hydrocarbon chain
region 21.4 angstrom, number of water molecules located per lipid molecule 13,
and DMPC surface area 59. The calculated water distribution function across the
bilayer directly explains why lipid membrane is easy penetrated by water
molecules.
