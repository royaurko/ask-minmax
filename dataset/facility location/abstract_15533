A thermodynamically self-consistent Ornstein-Zernike approximation (SCOZA) is
applied to a fluid of spherical particles with a pair potential given by a
hard-core repulsion and a Yukawa attractive tail $w(r)=-\exp [-z(r-1)]/r$. This
potential allows one to take advantage of the known analytical properties of
the solution to the Ornstein-Zernike equation for the case in which the direct
correlation function outside the repulsive core is given by a linear
combination of two Yukawa tails and the radial distribution function $g(r)$
satisfies the exact core condition $g(r)=0$ for $r<1$. The predictions for the
thermodynamics, the critical point, and the coexistence curve are compared here
to other theories and to simulation results. In order to unambiguously assess
the ability of the SCOZA to locate the critical point and the phase boundary of
the system, a new set of simulations has also been performed. The method
adopted combines Monte Carlo and finite-size scaling techniques and is
especially adapted to deal with critical fluctuations and phase separation. It
is found that the version of the SCOZA considered here provides very good
overall thermodynamics and a remarkably accurate critical point and coexistence
curve. For the interaction range considered here, given by $z=1.8$, the
critical density and temperature predicted by the theory agree with the
simulation results to about 0.6%.
