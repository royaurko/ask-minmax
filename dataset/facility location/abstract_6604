In this paper we consider bubbling solutions to the general Liouville system:
\label{abeq1} \Delta_g u_i^k+\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}\rho_j^k(\frac{h_j
e^{u_j^k}}{\int h_j e^{u_j^k}}-1)=0\quad\text{in}M, i=1,...,n (n\ge 2) where
$(M,g)$ is a Riemann surface, and $A=(a_{ij})_{n\times n}$ is a constant
non-negative matrix and $\rho_j^k\to \rho_j$ as $k\to \infty$. Among other
things we prove the following sharp estimates. The location of the blowup
point. The convergence rate of $\rho_j^k-\rho_j$, $j=1,..,n$. These results are
of fundamental importance for constructing bubbling solutions. It is
interesting to compare the difference between the general Liouville system and
the SU(3) Toda system on estimates (1) and (2).
