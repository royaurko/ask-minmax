This paper presents a novel repeater insertion algorithm for interconnect
power minimization. The novelty of our approach is in the judicious integration
of an analytical solver and a dynamic programming based method. Specifically,
the analytical solver chooses a concise repeater library and a small set of
repeater location candidates such that the dynamic programming algorithm can be
performed fast with little degradation of the solution quality. In comparison
with previously reported repeater insertion schemes, within comparable
runtimes, our approach achieves up to 37% higher power savings. Moreover, for
the same design quality, our scheme attains a speedup of two orders of
magnitude.
