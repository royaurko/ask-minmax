The Fluorescence Detector (FD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory provides a
nearly calorimetric measurement of the primary particle energy, since the
fluorescence light produced is proportional to the energy dissipated by an
Extensive Air Shower (EAS) in the atmosphere. The atmosphere therefore acts as
a giant calorimeter, whose properties need to be well known during data taking.
Aerosols play a key role in this scenario, since their effect on light
transmission is highly variable even on a time scale of one hour, and the
corresponding correction to EAS energy can range from a few percent to more
than 40%. For this reason, hourly Vertical Aerosol Optical Depth (taer(h))
profiles are provided for each of the four FD stations. Starting from 2004, up
to now 9 years of taer(h) profiles have been produced using data from the
Central Laser Facility (CLF) and the eXtreme Laser Facility (XLF) of the Pierre
Auger Observatory. The two laser facilities, the techniques developed to
measure taer(h) profiles using laser data and the results will be discussed.
