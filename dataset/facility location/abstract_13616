This article details the potential for using Charge Coupled Devices (CCD) to
detect low-energy neutrinos through their coherent scattering with nuclei. The
detection of neutrinos through this standard model process has not been
accessible because of the small energy deposited in such interactions with the
detector nuclei. Typical particle detectors have thresholds of a few keV, and
most of the energy deposition expected from coherent scattering is well below
this level. The devices we discuss can be operated at a threshold of
approximately 30 eV, making them ideal for observing this signal. For example,
the number of coherent scattering events expected on a 52 gram CCD array
located next to a power nuclear reactor is estimated as approximately 626
events/year. The results of our study show that detection at a confidence level
of 99% can be reached within three months for this kind of detector array.
