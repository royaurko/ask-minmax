Using a scale transformation in momentum space a phase equivalent
relativistic potential is generated from the nonrelativistic potential. By that
transformation a practical method for the relativistic 3N scattering with
realistic nucleon-nucleon potentials is introduced. The formalism can be
applied to any realistic nonrelativistic potential. We also discuss the
locations of the moving logarithmic singularities of the free relativistic
three-body Green's function. It enters in the relativistic 3N Faddeev
equations, which have been formulated long time ago for a 3-boson bound state
and which we propose to also use for 3N scattering. Finally we compare
relativistic deuteron wave functions to nonrelativistic ones.
