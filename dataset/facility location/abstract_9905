The phase diagram of a polydisperse hard sphere system is examined by
numerical minimization of a discretized form of the Ramakrishnan-Yussouff free
energy functional. Crystalline and glassy local minima of the free energy are
located and the phase diagram in the density-polydispersity plane is mapped out
by comparing the free energies of different local minima. The crystalline phase
disappears and the glass becomes the equilibrium phase beyond a "terminal"
value of the polydispersity. A crystal to glass transition is also observed as
the density is increased at high polydispersity. The phase diagram obtained in
our study is qualitatively similar to that of hard spheres in a quenched random
potential.
