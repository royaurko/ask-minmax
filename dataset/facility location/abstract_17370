A compact steep spectrum radio source (J0535-0452) is located in the sky
coincident with a bright optical rim in the HII region NGC1977. J0535-0452 is
observed to be $\leq 100$ mas in angular size at 8.44 GHz. The spectrum for the
radio source is steep and straight with a spectral index of -1.3 between 330
and 8440 MHz. No 2 \mu m IR counter part for the source is detected. These
characteristics indicate that the source may be either a rare high redshift
radio galaxy or a millisecond pulsar (MSP). Here we investigate whether the
steep spectrum source is a millisecond pulsar.The optical rim is believed to be
the interface between the HII region and the adjacent molecular cloud. If the
compact source is a millisecond pulsar, it would have eluded detection in
previous pulsar surveys because of the extreme scattering due to the HII
region--molecular cloud interface. The limits obtained on the angular
broadening along with the distance to the scattering screen are used to
estimate the pulse broadening. The pulse broadening is shown to be less than a
few msec at frequencies $\gtsim$ 5 GHz. We therefore searched for pulsed
emission from J0535-0452 at 14.8 and 4.8 GHz with the Green Bank Telescope
(GBT). No pulsed emission is detected to 55 and 30 \mu Jy level at 4.8 and 14.8
GHz. Based on the parameter space explored by our pulsar search algorithm, we
conclude that, if J0535-0452 is a pulsar, then it could only be a binary MSP of
orbital period $\ltsim$ 5 hrs.
