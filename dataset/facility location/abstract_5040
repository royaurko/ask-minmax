The numerical size of academic publications that are being published in
recent years had grown rapidly. Accessing and searching massive academic
publications that are distributed over several locations need large amount of
computing resources to increase the system performance. Therefore, many
grid-based search techniques were proposed to provide flexible methods for
searching the distributed extensive data. This paper proposes search technique
that is capable of searching the extensive publications by utilizing grid
computing technology. The search technique is implemented as interconnected
grid services to offer a mechanism to access different data locations. The
experimental result shows that the grid-based search technique has enhanced the
performance of the search.
