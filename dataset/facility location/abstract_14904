This paper describes a series of 3D simulations of shallow inefficient
convection in the outer layers of the Sun. The computational domain is a closed
box containing the convection-radiation transition layer, located at the top of
the solar convection zone. The most salient features of the simulations are
that: i)The position of the lower boundary can have a major effect on the
characteristics of solar surface convection (thermal structure, kinetic energy
and turbulent pressure). ii)The width of the box has only a minor effect on the
thermal structure, but a more significant effect on the dynamics (rms
velocities). iii)Between the surface and a depth of 1 Mm, even though the
density and pressure increase by an order of magnitude, the vertical
correlation length of vertical velocity is always close to 600 km. iv) In this
region the vertical velocity cannot be scaled by the pressure or the density
scale height. This casts doubt on the applicability of the mixing length
theory, not only in the superadiabatic layer, but also in the adjacent
underlying layers. v) The final statistically steady state is not strictly
dependent on the initial atmospheric stratification.
