The electron states in a size-quantaized coated semiconductor wire in a
uniform magnetic field applied parallel to the wire axis is considered. The
wave functions are found and the equation for determination of energy
eigenvalues depending both on magnetic field and parameters of the wire and the
coating is obtained. The binding energy of a hydrogen-like impurity located on
the wire axis is computed by the use of the variational method, and it is shown
that this energy increases with the increase of the magnetic field.
