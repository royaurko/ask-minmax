We report on the discovery of the first BL Herculis star displaying
period-doubling behaviour as predicted by the hydrodynamic models of Buchler &
Moskalik. The star, with P=2.4d, is located in the Galactic bulge and was
discovered with OGLE-III photometry. We present new nonlinear convective
models, which, together with recent evolutionary tracks, put constraints on the
stellar parameters. In particular, we estimate the mass and metallicity of the
object.
