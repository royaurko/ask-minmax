The D2-D0 bound state exhibits a Gregory-Laflamme instability when it is
sufficiently non-extremal. If there are no D0-branes, the requisite
non-extremality is finite. When most of the extremal mass comes from D0-branes,
the requisite non-extremality is very small. The location of the threshhold for
the instability is determined using a local thermodynamic analysis which is
then checked against a numerical analysis of the linearized equations of
motion. The thermodynamic analysis reveals an instability of non-commutative
field theory at finite temperature, which may occur only at very long
wavelengths as the decoupling limit is approached.
