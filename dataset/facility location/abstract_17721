We prove that the moduli space of compact genus three Riemann surfaces
contains only finitely many algebraically primitive Teichmueller curves. For
the stratum consisting of holomorphic one-forms in genus three with a single
zero, our approach to finiteness uses the Harder-Narasimhan filtration of the
Hodge bundle over a Teichmueller curve to obtain new information on the
locations of the zeros of eigenforms. By passing to the boundary of moduli
space, this gives explicit constraints on the cusps of Teichmueller curves in
terms of cross-ratios of six points on a projective line. These constraints are
akin to those that appear in Zilber and Pink's conjectures on unlikely
intersections in diophantine geometry. However, in our case one is lead
naturally to the intersection of a surface with a family of codimension two
algebraic subgroups of $G_m^n \times G_a^n$ (rather than the more standard
$G_m^n$). The ambient algebraic group lies outside the scope of Zilber's
Conjecture but we are nonetheless able to prove a sufficiently strong height
bound. For the generic stratum in genus three, we obtain global torsion order
bounds through a computer search for subtori of a codimension-two subvariety of
$G_m^9$. These torsion bounds together with new bounds for the moduli of
horizontal cylinders in terms of torsion orders yields finiteness in this
stratum. The intermediate strata are handled with a mix of these techniques.
