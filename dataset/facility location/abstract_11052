The longitudinal and transverse beam coupling impedance of the first final
TOTEM Roman Pot unit has been measured in the laboratory with the wire method.
For the evaluation of transverse impedance the wire position has been kept
constant, and the insertions of the RP were moved asymmetrically. With the
original configuration of the RP, resonances with fairly high Q values were
observed. In order to mitigate this problem, RF-absorbing ferrite plates were
mounted in appropriate locations. As a result, all resonances were sufficiently
damped to meet the stringent LHC beam coupling impedance requirements.
