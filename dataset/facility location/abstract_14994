We have obtained Keck spectra of six candidate globular clusters (GCs) in the
dynamically young elliptical galaxy NGC 3610, supplementing our previous Keck
spectra of eight confirmed GCs (Strader et al. 2003). Five of our new
candidates are confirmed to be GCs. Of the thirteen GCs, eleven are located
within the K band effective radius of 7 kpc. Two of these thirteen clusters are
found to be young (~ 2 Gyr) and very metal-rich ([Z/H] ~ +0.5), three are old
and metal-poor, and the remaining eight clusters are old and metal-rich. The
ages of the young clusters are consistent with a recent spectroscopic age
estimate of 1.6+/-0.5 Gyr for the galaxy itself (Denicolo et al. 2003) and
suggest that these clusters formed in the disk-disk merger which likely created
NGC 3610. Intriguingly, both young GCs have [alpha/Fe] ~ +0.3, while the
majority of the old clusters are not alpha-enhanced, in contrast to Galactic
and M31 GCs, and contrary to predictions of nucleosynthetic calculations. The
two old subpopulations of GCs can be attributed to the merger progenitors. The
relative numbers of old and new metal-rich GCs are poorly constrained because
of the expected differences in radial distributions of the two subpopulations.
However, based on our spectroscopic results and a comparison of the Hubble
Space Telescope color magnitude diagram (Whitmore et al. 2002) with stellar
population models, we argue that more than half of the metal-rich GCs are
likely to be old.
