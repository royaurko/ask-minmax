This work presents a method for determining the accuracy of a source finder
algorithm for spectral line radio astronomy data and the Source Finder Accuracy
Evaluator (SFAE), a program that implements this method. The accuracy of a
source finder is defined in terms of its completeness, reliability, and
accuracy of the parameterisation of the sources that were found. These values
are calculated by executing the source finder on an image with a known source
catalogue, then comparing the output of the source finder to the known
catalogue. The intended uses of SFAE include determining the most accurate
source finders for use in a survey, determining the types of radio sources a
particular source finder is capable of accurately locating, and identifying
optimum parameters and areas of improvement for these algorithms. This paper
demonstrates a sample of accuracy information that can be obtained through this
method, using a simulated ASKAP data cube and the Duchamp source finder.
