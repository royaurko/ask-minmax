The method of perturbed angular correlation (PAC) was used to determine
lattice locations of 111In impurity probe atoms present in extreme dilution in
the intermetallic compound FeGa3. In slightly Ga-poor samples, probes were
found to strongly prefer one of two inequivalent Ga-sites. In slightly Ga-rich
samples at room temperature, 293 K, the PAC spectrum exhibited an unperturbed
quadrupole interaction signal that is consistent with indium probes dissolved
in small liquid pools of the excess Ga. A myriad of such pools are probably
located along grain boundaries in the sample. Cooling from 293 K down to 12 K,
the site fraction of indium in liquid decreased, being offset by the increase
in a signal attributed to indium solutes in precipitates with other impurities
at the sides of the Ga pools. However, these changes were completely reversible
upon heating, and no crystallization of the liquid gallium pools was observed
down to 12 K. This is attributed to the extraordinarily small volumes for the
pools, which, while not measured directly, are orders of magnitude smaller than
cubic microns. The measured temperature dependence of the site fraction of
indium in the liquid was used to extend the metastable solubility curve for
indium in liquid gallium down to a temperature of 150 K, much lower than the
eutectic temperature of Ga-In at 288.5 K.
