Math is the backbone of any field. Still its a night mare for many. Recent
survey proves that many students become dropouts from their higher education
due to math courses. ICT is an enchanted word in the contemporary educational
environment. It made the learning process more entertaining and almost made the
knowledge loss negligible. Adopting the ICT in math courses are still in the
infant level. Hence its a challenge placed in front of the IT and academic
professionals teaching math to make a suitable ICT tools for math courses to
make the learning an amusing experience. In this paper we have highlighted
three main concepts which make the math classes in a fascinating way. The first
method is introducing revolutionary hybrid ebooks which make the reading with
both audio and video facilities. The second method is facilitating the flip
class room so that student may have anywhere-anytime learning experience.
Finally the recent trends in m-learning are using apps for math courses. We
have highlighted the improvement showed by the students based on the survey
conducted with two groups of students with m-learning tools and without
m-learning tools. Even though there are good improvements showed by the
students, we the researchers feel that few more improvements are required in
these methodologies. The suggestions for the same are made in the
recommendations and conclusion section.
