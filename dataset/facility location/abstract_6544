We consider the infinite-range spin glass in which the spins have m > 1
components (a vector spin glass). Applying a magnetic field which is random in
direction, there is an Almeida Thouless (AT) line below which the "replica
symmetric" solution is unstable, just as for the Ising (m=1) case. We calculate
the location of this AT line for Gaussian random fields for arbitrary m, and
verify our results by numerical simulations for m = 3$.
