People can help other people find information in networked information
seeking environments. Recently, many such systems and algorithms have
proliferated in industry and in academia. Unfortunately, it is difficult to
compare the systems in meaningful ways because they often define collaboration
in different ways. In this paper, we propose a model of possible kinds of
collaboration, and illustrate it with examples from literature. The model
contains four dimensions: intent, depth, concurrency and location. This model
can be used to classify existing systems and to suggest possible opportunities
for design in this space.
