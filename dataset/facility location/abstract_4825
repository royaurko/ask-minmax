This note investigates the effects of a misaligned tracking system on the
analysis of B decays. Misalignment effects of both the vertex locator and the
inner and outer T-stations have been studied. $z$-scaling effects of the vertex
locator are also considered. It is proven that misalignments of the order of
the detector single-hit resolutions have little or negligible effects on the
quality of the reconstruction and of the analysis of B decays. The studies were
performed with a sample of $B^0_{(s)} \to h^+h^{'-}$ decays, but the impact of
misalignments on the performance of the pattern recognition algorithms and on
the primary vertex resolutions, assessed for the first time, are rather general
and not restricted to $B^0_{(s)} \to h^+h^{'-}$ decays.
