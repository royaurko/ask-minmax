Numerical simulations of atmospheric circulation models are limited by their
finite spatial resolution, and so large eddy simulation (LES) is the preferred
approach to study these models. In LES a low-pass filter is applied to the flow
field to separate the large and small scale motions. In implicitly filtered LES
the computational mesh and discretization schemes are considered to be the
low-pass filter while in the explicitly filtered LES approach the filtering
procedure is separated from the grid and discretization operators and allows
for better control of the numerical errors. The aim of this paper is to study
and compare implicitly filtered and explicitly filtered LES of atmospheric
circulation models in spectral space. To achieve this goal we present the
results of implicitly filtered and explicitly filtered LES of a barotropic
atmosphere circulation model on the sphere in spectral space and compare them
with the results obtained from direct numerical simulation (DNS). Our study
shows that although in the computation of some integral quantities like total
kinetic energy and total enstrophy the results obtained from implicitly
filtered LES and explicitly filtered LES show the same good agreement with the
DNS results, explicit filtering produces energy spectra that show better
agreement with the DNS results. More importantly, explicit filtering captures
the location of coherent structures over time while implicit filtering does
not.
