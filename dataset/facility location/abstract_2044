A number of Baker-Nunn Camera (BNC) were manufactured by Smithsonian
Institution during the 60s as optical tracking systems for artificial
satellites with optimal optical and mechanical specifications. One of them was
installed at the Real Instituto y Observatorio de la Armada (ROA).
  We have conducted a profound refurbishment project of the telescope to be
installed at Observatori Astron\`omic del Montsec (OAdM). As a result, the BNC
offers the largest combination of a huge FOV (4.4$\deg$x4.4$\deg$) and aperture
(leading to a limiting magnitude of V$\sim$20).
  These specifications, together with their remote and robotic natures, allows
this instrument to face an observational program of exoplanets detection by
means of transit technique with high signal-to-noise ratio in the appropiate
magnitude range.
