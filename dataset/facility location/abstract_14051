Cancer arises from successive rounds of mutations which generate tumor cells
with different genomic variation i.e. clones. For drug responsiveness and
therapeutics, it is necessary to identify the clones in tumor sample
accurately. Many methods are developed to infer tumor heterogeneity by either
computing cellular prevalence and tumor phylogeny or predicting genotype of
mutations. All methods suffer some problems e.g. inaccurate computation of
clonal frequencies, discarding clone specific genotypes etc. In the paper, we
propose a method, called- HetFHMM to infer tumor heterogeneity by predicting
clone specific genotypes and cellular prevalence. To infer clone specific
genotype, we consider the presence of multiple mutations at any genomic
location. We also tested our model on different simulated data. The results
shows that HetFHMM outperforms recent methods which infer tumor heterogeneity.
Therefore, HetFHMM is a novel approach in tumor heterogeneity research area.
