We present a theoretical analysis of a spin-dependent multicomponent
condensate in two dimensions. The case of a condensate of resonantly
photoexcited excitons having two different spin orientations is studied in
detail. The energy and the chemical potentials of this system depend strongly
on the spin polarization . When electrons and holes are located in two
different planes, the condensate can be either totally spin polarized or spin
unpolarized, a property that is measurable. The phase diagram in terms of the
total density and electron-hole separation is discussed.
