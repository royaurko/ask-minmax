The TRI$\mu$P facility, under construction at KVI, requires the production
and separation of short-lived and rare isotopes. Direct reactions,
fragmentation and fusion-evaporation reactions in normal and inverse kinematics
are foreseen to produce nuclides of interest with a variety of heavy-ion beams
from the superconducting cyclotron AGOR. For this purpose, we have designed,
constructed and commissioned a versatile magnetic separator that allows
efficient injection into an ion catcher, i.e., gas-filled stopper/cooler or
thermal ionizer, from which a low energy radioactive beam will be extracted.
The separator performance was tested with the production and clean separation
of $^{21}$Na ions, where a beam purity of 99.5% could be achieved. For
fusion-evaporation products, some of the features of its operation as a
gas-filled recoil separator were tested.
