We study the evolution of the energy spectrum of cosmic-ray electrons
accelerated at spherically expanding shocks with low Mach numbers and the
ensuing spectral signatures imprinted in radio synchrotron emission.
Time-dependent simulations of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) of electrons
in the test-particle limit have been performed for spherical shocks with
parameters relevant for typical shocks in the intracluster medium. The electron
and radiation spectra at the shock location can be described properly by the
test-particle DSA predictions with instantaneous shock parameters. However, the
volume integrated spectra of both electrons and radiation deviate significantly
from the test-particle power-laws, because the shock compression ratio and the
flux of injected electrons at the shock gradually decrease as the shock slows
down in time.So one needs to be cautious about interpreting observed radio
spectra of evolving shocks based on simple DSA models in the test-particle
regime.
