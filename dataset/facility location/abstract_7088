This note introduces a result on the location of eigenvalues, i.e., the
spectrum, of the Laplacian for a family of undirected graphs with self-loops.
We extend on the known results for the spectrum of undirected graphs without
self-loops or multiple edges. For this purpose, we introduce a new concept of
pseudo-connected graphs and apply a lifting of the graph with self-loops to a
graph without self-loops, which is then used to quantify the spectrum of the
Laplacian for the graph with self-loops.
