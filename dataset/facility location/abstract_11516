Trapping of hot electron behavior by trap centers located in buffer layer of
a wurtzite phase GaN MESFET has been simulated using an ensemble Monte Carlo
simulation. The results of the simulation show that the trap centers are
responsible for current collapse in GaN MESFET at low temperatures. These
electrical traps degrade the performance of the device at low temperature. On
the opposite, a light-induced increase in the trap-limited drain current,
results from the photoionization of trapped carriers and their return to the
channel under the influence of the built in electric field associated with the
trapped charge distribution. The simulated device geometries and doping are
matched to the nominal parameters described for the experimental structures as
closely as possible, and the predicted drain current and other electrical
characteristics for the simulated device including trapping center effects show
close agreement with the available experimental data.
