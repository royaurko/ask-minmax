The present paper is devoted to the study of transition fronts of nonlocal
Fisher-KPP equations in time heterogeneous media. We first construct transition
fronts with prescribed interface location functions, which are natural
generalizations of front location functions in homogeneous media. It it shown
that these transition fronts have exact decaying rates as the space variable
tends to infinity. Then, by the general results on space regularity of
transition fronts of nonlocal evolution equations proven in the contributors'
earlier work (\cite{ShSh14-4}), these transition fronts are continuously
differentiable in space. We show that their space partial derivatives have
exact decaying rates as the space variable tends to infinity. Finally, we study
the asymptotic stability of transition fronts. It is shown that transition
fronts attract those solutions whose initial data decays as fast as transition
fronts near infinity and essentially above zero near negative infinity.
