In the model of Arkani-Hamed and Schmaltz the various chiral fermions of the
Standard Model(SM) are localized at different points on a thick wall which
forms an extra dimension. Such a scenario provides a way of understanding the
absence of proton decay and the fermion mass hierarchy in models with extra
dimensions. In this paper we explore the capability of future lepton colliders
to determine the location of these fermions in the extra dimension through
precision measurements of conventional scattering processes both below and on
top of the lowest lying Kaluza-Klein gauge boson resonance. We show that for
some classes of models the locations of these fermions can be very precisely
determined while in others only their relative positions can be well measured.
