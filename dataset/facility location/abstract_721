This paper reviews our current understanding of the process of re-ionization
of the Universe, focusing especially on those models where re-ionization is
caused by UV radiation from massive stars. After reviewing the expected
properties of stars at zero metallicity, I discuss the properties of primordial
HII regions and their observability.
