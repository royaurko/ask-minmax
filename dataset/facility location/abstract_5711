We present preliminary results from a detailed study towards four previously
detected bright mid-infrared sources in the southern part of the Carina Nebula:
G287.73--0.92, G287.84--0.82, G287.93--0.99 and G288.07--0.80. All of these
sources are located at the heads of giant dust pillars that point towards the
nearby massive star cluster, Trumpler 16. It is unclear if these pillars are
the prime sites for a new generation of triggered star formation or if instead
they are the only remaining parts of the nebula where ongoing star fromation
can take place.
