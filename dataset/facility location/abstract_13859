Dynamic Thermal Line Rating (DLR) is deemed to be an effective way to
increase transmission capacities and therefore enabling additional operational
flexibility. The transmission capacities are dynamically determined based on
current or expected weather conditions. First pilot projects have proven its
efficiency. In this paper we present two approaches to determine the location
and amount of ramping capabilities for corrective control measures in the case
of errors in the forecast of the line rating. Both approaches result in robust
optimization problems, where the first approach guarantees that there is a
suitable remedial action for every realization of uncertainty in a given
uncertainty set. The corrective control action is calculated once the forecast
error is known. The second approach relies on affine policies which directly
relate the current line rating to corrective control measures, if needed, which
enables a decentralized operation. In case studies, the two approaches are
compared and the reduction of overall operational costs is demonstrated
exemplarily for different parameters.
