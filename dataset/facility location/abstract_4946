Reconstruction of a function from noisy data is often formulated as a
regularized optimization problem over an infinite-dimensional reproducing
kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The solution describes the observed data and has a
small RKHS norm. When the data fit is measured using a quadratic loss, this
estimator has a known statistical interpretation. Given the noisy measurements,
the RKHS estimate represents the posterior mean (minimum variance estimate) of
a Gaussian random field with covariance proportional to the kernel associated
with the RKHS. In this paper, we provide a statistical interpretation when more
general losses are used, such as absolute value, Vapnik or Huber. Specifically,
for any finite set of sampling locations (including where the data were
collected), the MAP estimate for the signal samples is given by the RKHS
estimate evaluated at these locations.
