Active regions often host large-scale gas flows in the chromosphere
presumably directed along curved magnetic field lines. Spectropolarimetric
observations of these flows are critical to understanding the nature and
evolution of their anchoring magnetic structure. We discuss recent work with
the Facility Infrared Spectropolarimeter (FIRS) located at the Dunn Solar
Telescope in New Mexico to achieve high resolution imaging-spectropolarimetry
of the Fe I lines at 630 nm, the Si I line at 1082.7 nm, and the He I triplet
at 1083 nm. We present maps of the photospheric and chromospheric magnetic
field vector above a sunspot as well as discuss characteristics of surrounding
chromospheric flow structures.
