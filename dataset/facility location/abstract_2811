It is shown that the RHIC energy-scan experiments can serve as an effective
tool for studying the system evolution along the first order phase transition
line passing the critical point, which is a second order phase transition
process. During this process the system structure changes while passing the
critical point, and correspondingly, the transverse momentum of the final state
particles gets an extra component. This phenomenon can provide useful
information about the system structure in different phases and can serve as an
effective signal for locating the critical point.
