We present an analysis of thermal emission from comet 162P/Siding Spring
(P/2004 TU12) measured during its discovery apparition in 2004 December. The
comet showed no dust coma at this time, so we have sampled emission from the
comet's nucleus. Observations using the Mid-Infrared Spectrometer and Imager
(MIRSI) were performed at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility, where the peak of
the comet's spectral energy distribution was observed between 8 and 25 microns.
In combination with the three near-IR spectra presented by Campins et al.
(2006, Astron. J. 132, 1346) that show the Wien-law tail of the thermal
emission, the data provide powerful constraints on surface properties of the
nucleus. We find that the nucleus's effective radius is 6.0+/-0.8 km. This is
one of the largest radii known among Jupiter-family comets, which is unusual
considering that the comet was discovered only recently. Its geometric albedo
is 0.059+/-0.023 in the H band, 0.037+/-0.014 in the R band, and 0.034+/-0.013
in the V band. We also find that the nucleus of 162P has little IR beaming, and
this implies that the nucleus has low thermal inertia. Including all near-IR
spectra yields a beaming parameter of 1.01+/-0.20. This result is in agreement
with others showing that cometary nuclei have low thermal inertia and little IR
beaming. If confirmed for many nuclei, the interpretation of radiometry may not
be as problematic as feared.
