Cities are physical manifestations of our competitive and cooperative
behaviours. The tension between these two forces generates dynamic equilibriums
whose material expressions are cities and their evolutions. In a Darwinian
cooperative view, as Darwinism does not involve only competition, the public
benefit obtained by cooperation, return in terms of private benefit too. An
urban genetic code is proposed, according to which cities emerge connecting
nature and urbanity, and as sum of multiuse, independent micro-areas, each one
with its centrality, job locations, parks and daily shops-services and
amenities. This mechanism, called Isobenefit Urbanism, is not static and
pre-designed, but allows infinitely dynamic changes and expansions. Rather than
describing The ideal city, which doesn't exist outside our own minds,
Isobenefit Urbanism describes what a city should avoid to be in order to not
become an unideal city. Its six principles are the urban DNA which does not
give predetermined forms but indications to follow according to contexts and
times.
