The recent data taken by the CLAS Collaboration at the Thomas Jefferson
National Accelerator Facility for the reaction of $\gamma p \to K^+ K^+ \Xi^-$
are reanalyzed within a relativistic meson-exchange model of hadronic
interactions. The present model is an extension of the one developed in an
earlier work by Nakayama, Oh, and Haberzettl [Phys. Rev. C 74, 035205 (2006)].
In particular, the role of the spin-5/2 and -7/2 hyperon resonances, which were
not included in the previous model, is investigated in the present study. It is
shown that the contribution of the $\Sigma(2030)$ hyperon having spin-7/2 and
positive parity has a key role to bring the model predictions into a fair
agreement with the measured data for the $K^+\Xi^-$ invariant mass
distribution.
