Modern coaxial and planar HPGe detectors allow a precise determination of the
energies and trajectories of the impinging gamma-rays. This entails the
location of the gamma interactions inside the crystal from the shape of the
delivered signals. This paper reviews the state of the art of the analysis of
the HPGe response function and proposes methods that lead to optimum signal
decomposition. The generic matrix method allows fast location of the
interactions even when the induced signals strongly overlap.
