The gamma-ray pulsar PSR B1706-44 and the adjacent supernova remnant (SNR)
candidate G343.1-2.3 were observed by H.E.S.S. during a dedicated observation
campaign in 2007. As a result of this observation campaign, a new source of
very-high-energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray emission, HESS J1708-443, was
detected with a statistical significance of 7 sigma, although no significant
point-like emission was detected at the position of the energetic pulsar
itself. In this paper, the morphological and spectral analyses of the
newly-discovered TeV source are presented. The centroid of HESS J1708-443 is
considerably offset from the pulsar and located near the apparent center of the
SNR, at RA(J2000) = 17h08m11s +/- 17s and Dec(J2000) = -44d20' +/- 4'. The
source is found to be significantly more extended than the H.E.S.S. point
spread function (~0.1 deg), with an intrinsic Gaussian width of 0.29 deg +/-
0.04 deg. Its integral flux between 1 and 10 TeV is ~ 3.8 x 10^-12 ph cm^-2
s^-1, equivalent to 17% of the Crab Nebula flux in the same energy range. The
measured energy spectrum is well-fit by a power law with a relatively hard
photon index Gamma = 2.0 +/- 0.1 (stat) +/- 0.2 (sys). Additional
multi-wavelength data, including 330 MHz VLA observations, were used to
investigate the VHE gamma-ray source's possible associations with the pulsar
wind nebula of PSR B1706-44 and/or with the complex radio structure of the
partial shell-type SNR G343.1-2.3.
