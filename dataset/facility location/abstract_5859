We study one- and two-dimensional models which undergo a transition between
active and absorbing phases. The transition point in these models is of novel
type: jump of the order parameter coincides with its power-law singularity.
Some arguments supported by Monte Carlo simulations prompted us to predict the
exact location of the transition point. Both models possess gauge-like
symmetry.
