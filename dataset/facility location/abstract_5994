We predict a nonequilibrium critical phenomenon in the space-time density
evolution of a fermionic gas above the temperature of transition into the
superfluid phase. On the BCS side of the BEC-BCS crossover, the evolution of a
localized density disturbance exhibits a negative echo at the point of the
initial inhomogeneity. Approaching the BEC side, this effect competes with the
slow spreading of the density of bosonic molecules. However, even here the echo
dominates for large enough times. This effect may be used as an experimental
tool to locate the position of the transition.
