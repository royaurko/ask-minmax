In this paper we study and analyze coverage region for half-duplex
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay channel with amplify-and-forward
(AF) strategy at the relay station. By assuming mixed Rayleigh and Rician
fading channels with two different relay station situations, we consider the
objective of maximizing coverage region for a given transmission rate and find
the optimal relay location in the sense of maximizing coverage region. using
Monte Carlo simulations, the coverage region and capacity bounds are shown for
different fading cases and different relay station locations. Finally, we
compare our results with previous ones obtained for decode-and-forward (DF)
MIMO relay channel.
