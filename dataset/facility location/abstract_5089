We use the Bolshoi Simulation to find the most probable location of the Local
Group (LG) in the cosmic web. Our LG simulacra are pairs of halos with
isolation and kinematic properties consistent with observations. The cosmic web
is defined using a tidal tensor approach. We find that the LG's preferred
location is regions with a dark matter overdensity close to the cosmic average.
This makes filaments and sheets the preferred environment. We also find a
strong alignment between the LG and the cosmic web. The orbital angular
momentum is preferentially perpendicular to the smallest tidal eigenvector,
while the vector connecting the two halos is strongly aligned along the
smallest tidal eigenvector and perpendicular to the largest tidal eigenvector;
the pair lies and moves along filaments and sheets. We do not find any evidence
for an alignment between the spin of each halo in the pair and the cosmic web.
