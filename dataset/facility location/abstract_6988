We study the secrecy of a distributed storage system for passwords. The
encoder, Alice, observes a length-n password and describes it using two hints,
which she then stores in different locations. The legitimate receiver, Bob,
observes both hints. The eavesdropper, Eve, sees only one of the hints; Alice
cannot control which. We characterize the largest normalized (by n) exponent
that we can guarantee for the number of guesses it takes Eve to guess the
password subject to the constraint that either the number of guesses it takes
Bob to guess the password or the size of the list that Bob must form to
guarantee that it contain the password approach 1 as n tends to infinity.
