We report on the chemical stability of La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 thin films. X-ray
absorption spectroscopy at the Mn L-edge and O K-edge makes evident deviations
from the nominally expected (2/3-1/3) Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio after the growth of thin
films on LaAlO3 substrates. As-grown thin films, exhibiting Curie temperature,
TC, well below that of the LCMO bulk material, develop an unexpected Mn2+
contribution after a few days of air exposure which increases with time.
Moreover, a reduction of the saturation magnetization, MS, is also detected.
The similarity of the results obtained by electron yield and fluorescence yield
demonstrates that the location of the Mn valence anomalies are not confined to
a narrow surface region of the film but can extend throughout the film
thickness in case of granular films. High temperature annealing not only
improves the magnetic and transport properties of such as-grown films but also
recovers the expected 2/3-1/3 Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio, which thereafter is stable to
air exposure. Similar results on La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 films grown on SrTiO3 and
NdGaO3 substrates demonstrate that there is no direct relation between the
observed Mn valence instability and the strain state of the films due to their
lattice mismatch with the substrate. A mechanism for the formation of Mn2+ ions
formation is discussed.
