We provide a perspective on studies aimed at observing the transition between
hadronic and quark-gluonic descriptions of reactions involving light nuclei. We
begin by summarizing the results for relatively simple reactions such as the
pion form factor and the neutral pion transition form factor as well as that
for the nucleon and end with exclusive photoreactions in our simplest nuclei. A
particular focus will be on reactions involving the deuteron. It is noted that
a firm understanding of these issues is essential for unraveling important
structure information from processes such as deeply virtual Compton scattering
as well as deeply virtual meson production. The connection to exotic phenomena
such as color transparency will be discussed. A number of outstanding
challenges will require new experiments at modern facilities on the horizon as
well as further theoretical developments.
