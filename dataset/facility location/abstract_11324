We estimate the di-photon coupling of $f_0(600)$, $f_0(980)$ and $f_2(1270)$
resonances in a coupled channel dispersive approach. The $f_0(600)$ di-photon
coupling is also reinvestigated using a single channel $T$ matrix for $\pi\pi$
scattering with better analyticity property, and it is found to be
significantly smaller than that of a $\bar qq$ state. Especially we also
estimate the di-photon coupling of the third sheet pole located near $\bar KK$
threshold, denoted as $f_0^{III}(980)$.
  It is argued that this third sheet pole may be originated from a coupled
channel Breit-Wigner description of the $f_0(980)$ resonance.
