An OLED architecture is described in which a thin emitter layer is located at
the anti-node of a resonant microcavity. In two realizations, the mode space is
constrained by either multi-layer mirrors or by an emitter with transition
dipole moments oriented normal to the vertical mode of the device. The
multi-layer mirror device achieves 315 lm/W and the oriented emitter device
achieves 340 lm/W. Output is observed to be linear in current and efficiency
increases with power. This is in agreement with a proposed theoretical model
for a microcavity device with emitter located at an anti-node where spontaneous
emission is suppressed.
