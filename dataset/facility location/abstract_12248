Native point defects, defect complexes, and oxygen impurities in BaCuChF were
studied using density functional theory calculations, self-consistent
thermodynamic simulations, and various experimental techniques. Unintentional
p-type conductivity in BaCuChF is explained by the presence of copper vacancies
with transition levels in the valence band. These acceptor-like defects are
partially compensated by donor-like chalcogen vacancies with transition levels
deep in the gap. Chalcogen vacancies also cause the experimentally observed
sub-gap photoluminescence, optical absorption, and persistent photoconductivity
in BaCuSF and BaCuSeF. In thermodynamic equilibrium, both copper and chalcogen
vacancies have low formation enthalpies and are likely to form defect complexes
among themselves and with fluorine interstitials. The calculated Fermi level
pinning range in BaCuChF is narrow and located close to the valence band
maximum. It makes BaCuChF a suitable transparent p-type contact layer for
optoelectronic applications, but hinders attempts to fabricate transparent thin
film transistors using this material. Oxygen-related defects do not affect bulk
BaCuChF properties, but surface oxidation decreases the mean free path of free
holes by almost an order of magnitude.
