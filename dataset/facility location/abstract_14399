Recent advances in single particle tracking (SPT) microscopy 1 make it
possible to obtain tens of thousands macromolecular trajectories from within a
living cell in just a few minutes. Since molecules typically change their
movement properties upon interactions, these trajectories contain information
about both locations and rates of intracellular reactions. This information is
unfortunately obscured by physical limitations of the optical microscope and
noise in detection systems, making statistical methods development for SPT
analysis a very active research field. Unbiased testing and comparison of such
methods are however difficult given the absence of in vivo data of
intracellular dynamics where the true states of interaction are known, a.k.a.
the ground truth. A common resort is to instead use simulated, synthetic, data.
However, tests using such data give unrealistically optimistic results if the
simplifying assumptions underlying the analysis method are satisfied in the
synthetic data, a practice known as "inverse crimes". We here present the
SMeagol (Simulated Single Molecule Microscopy) package, that has been developed
to generate highly realistic single molecule microscopy time-lapse image series
in order to avoid inverse crimes.
