Accurate transition probabilities for forbidden lines are important
diagnostic parameters for low-density astrophysical plasmas. In this paper we
present experimental atomic data for forbidden [FeII] transitions that are
observed as strong features in astrophysical spectra.
  Aims: To measure lifetimes for the 3d^6(^3G)4s a ^4G_{11/2} and 3d^6(^3D)4s b
^4D_{1/2} metastable levels in FeII and experimental transition probabilities
for the forbidden transitions 3d^7 a ^4F_{7/2,9/2}- 3d^6(^3G)4s a ^4G_{11/2}.
  Methods: The lifetimes were measured at the ion storage ring facility CRYRING
using a laser probing technique. Astrophysical branching fractions were
obtained from spectra of Eta Carinae, obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The lifetimes and branching
fractions were combined to yield absolute transition probabilities.
  Results: The lifetimes of the a ^4G_{11/2} and the b ^4D_{1/2} levels have
been measured and have the following values, 0.75(10) s and 0.54(3) s
respectively. Furthermore, we have determined the transition probabilities for
two forbidden transitions of a ^4F_{7/2,9/2}- a ^4G_{11/2} at 4243.97 and
4346.85 A. Both the lifetimes and the transition probabilities are compared to
calculated values in the literature.
