We calculate the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in the minimal
Randall-Sundrum model with standard model fields in five-dimensional (5D)
warped space and a brane-localized Higgs. We use a fully 5D framework to
compute the one-loop matching coefficients of the effective theory at the
electroweak scale. The extra contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment from
the model-independent gauge-boson exchange contributions \Delta a_\mu is
approximately 8.8*10^-11 (1TeV/T)^2, where 1/T denotes the location of the TeV
brane in conformal coordinates, and is related to the mass of the lowest gauge
boson KK excitation, which is roughly 2.5T. The result constitutes the first
complete determination of the gauge-boson contribution to g-2 and is robust
against the variation of the bulk fermion masses and 5D Yukawa coupling. We
also determine the strongly model-parameter dependent effect of Higgs-exchange
diagrams.
