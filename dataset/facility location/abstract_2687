We have investigated the electromagnetic decays of the antitriplet and sextet
charmed baryon systems with $J^P= \frac{1}{2}^+, \frac{3}{2}^+$ in the
framework of the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. We first construct
the chiral Lagrangians at $O(p^2)$ and $O(p^3)$. Then we calculate the
electromagnetic (EM) decay amplitudes of the charmed baryon systems up to
$O(p^3)$. With the help of the quark model, we estimate the low energy
constants. The numerical results of the EM decay widths show good convergence
of the chiral expansion. We notice that the two neutral EM decay processes
$\Xi_c'^0\rightarrow\gamma+\Xi_c^0$ and ${\Xi_c^*}'^0\rightarrow\gamma+\Xi_c^0$
are strongly suppressed by the SU(3) U-spin flavor symmetry. With the same
formalism, we also estimate the EM decay widths of the bottomed baryons. The EM
decay widths of the heavy baryons may be measured at facilities such as LHCb
and JPARC. The explicit chiral structures of the heavy baryon decay amplitudes
derived in this work may be useful to the possible chiral extrapolations of the
future lattice simulations of these EM decay amplitudes.
