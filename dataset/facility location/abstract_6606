In this paper we construct an illustration of a space that expands via
discrete expansion of its basic elements. We prove that in such an expanding
space-time, the geodesics are curved and more precisely they fluctuate on the
boundaries of the expanding basic elements. This induces a variable curvature
of the space as well as a variable topology. The identification of the light
geodesics in this expanding space-time leads to determine matter location; we
prove that the variation of the space-time curvature is responsible for matter
distribution at large scale and makes the geometry of the expanding space-time
invisible.
