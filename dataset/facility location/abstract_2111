The pp -> pp gamma reaction has been studied at a beam energy of 310 MeV by
detecting both final protons at the PROMICE-WASA facility and identifying the
photon through the resulting missing-mass peak. The photon angular distribution
in the center-of-mass system and those of the proton-proton relative momentum
with respect to the beam direction and to that of the recoil photon were
determined reliably up to a final pp excitation energy of Epp ~ 30 MeV. Except
for very small Epp values, the behavior of these distributions with excitation
energy is well reproduced by a new refined model of the hard bremsstrahlung
process. The model reproduces absolutely the total cross section and its energy
dependence to within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties.
