A number of companies are trying to migrate large monolithic software systems
to Service Oriented Architectures. A common approach to do this is to first
identify and describe desired services (i.e., create a model), and then to
locate portions of code within the existing system that implement the described
services. In this paper we describe a detailed case study we undertook to match
a model to an open-source business application. We describe the systematic
methodology we used, the results of the exercise, as well as several
observations that throw light on the nature of this problem. We also suggest
and validate heuristics that are likely to be useful in partially automating
the process of matching service descriptions to implementations.
