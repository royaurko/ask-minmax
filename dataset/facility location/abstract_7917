The g p -> K^0 Sigma^+ reaction has been measured from threshold to Eg=1.45
GeV (W_cm=1.9 GeV) using the Crystal Ball and TAPS multiphoton spectrometers
together with the photon tagging facility at the Mainz Microtron MAMI. In the
present experiment, this reaction was searched for in the 3pi^0 p final state,
by assuming K^0_S -> pi^0 pi^0 and Sigma^+ -> pi^0 p. The experimental results
include total and differential cross sections as well as the polarization of
the recoil hyperon. The new data significantly improve empirical knowledge
about the g p -> K^0 Sigma^+ reaction in the measured energy range. The results
are compared to previous measurements and model predictions. It is demonstrated
that adding the present g p -> K^0 Sigma^+ results to existing data allowed a
better description of this reaction with various models.
