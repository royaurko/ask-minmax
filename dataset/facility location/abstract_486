Measurement of the CKM phase gamma in B->DK decays can be potentially
performed with high precision due to low theoretical uncertainties. However,
the precision measurement requires very large experimental samples of B decays.
This report covers prospects for gamma measurement at the future e+e-
facilities and upgraded LHCb detector.
