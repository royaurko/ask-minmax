The problem of the motion of high-energy wave packets combined of free
electromagnetic waves is considered. It is demonstrated that the transformation
of such packets to the packet of spherically diverging waves happens on long
distances along the packet's motion direction, that substantially exceed the
radiated wavelength. The transition radiation by the ``half-bare''
ultrarelativistic electron is considered. It is demonstrated that the
transition radiation by such an electron on the targets located inside and
outside the coherence length of the radiation process would be substantially
different.
