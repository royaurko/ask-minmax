A self-consistent mean-field method is used to study critical wetting
transitions under nonequilibrium conditions by analyzing Kardar-Parisi-Zhang
(KPZ) interfaces in the presence of a bounding substrate. In the case of
positive KPZ nonlinearity a single (Gaussian) regime is found. On the contrary,
interfaces corresponding to negative nonlinearities lead to three different
regimes of critical behavior for the surface order-parameter: (i) a trivial
Gaussian regime, (ii) a weak-fluctuation regime with a trivially located
critical point and nontrivial exponents, and (iii) a highly non-trivial
strong-fluctuation regime, for which we provide a full solution by finding the
zeros of parabolic-cylinder functions. These analytical results are also
verified by solving numerically the self-consistent equation in each case.
Analogies with and differences from equilibrium critical wetting as well as
nonequilibrium complete wetting are also discussed.
