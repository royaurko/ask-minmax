Upper critical fields of several magnesium diboride thin films were measured
up to 28 T at the Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory (GHMFL) in Grenoble
and up to 60 T at the Laboratoire National des Champs Magnetiques Pulses
(LNCMP) in Toulouse. The samples were prepared both by pulsed laser deposition
(PLD) and hybrid physical chemical vapour deposition (HPCVD) technique; they
have critical temperatures between 29 and 39 K and normal state resistivities
between 5 and 250 &#956;ohmcm; one of them has been intentionally doped with
carbon. The measured critical fields were exceptionally high; we obtained the
record value of 52 T at 4.2 K in the parallel orientation. In contrast with the
BCS predictions, no saturation in Hc2 at low temperature was observed.
Furthermore, films with a wide range of resistivity values showed similar
critical fields, suggesting that in a two band system resistivity and Hc2 are
not trivially linked. The high Hc2 values seem to be related with the expanded
c-axis. The structure of one of the samples was carefully investigated with
X-ray diffraction at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in
Grenoble.
