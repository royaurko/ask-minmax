For widespread deployment in domains characterized by partial observability,
non-deterministic actions and unforeseen changes, robots need to adapt sensing,
processing and interaction with humans to the tasks at hand. While robots
typically cannot process all sensor inputs or operate without substantial
domain knowledge, it is a challenge to provide accurate domain knowledge and
humans may not have the time and expertise to provide elaborate and accurate
feedback. The architecture described in this paper combines declarative
programming and probabilistic reasoning to address these challenges, enabling
robots to: (a) represent and reason with incomplete domain knowledge, resolving
ambiguities and revising existing knowledge using sensor inputs and minimal
human feedback; and (b) probabilistically model the uncertainty in sensor input
processing and navigation. Specifically, Answer Set Programming (ASP), a
declarative programming paradigm, is combined with hierarchical partially
observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), using domain knowledge to revise
probabilistic beliefs, and using positive and negative observations for early
termination of tasks that can no longer be pursued. All algorithms are
evaluated in simulation and on mobile robots locating target objects in indoor
domains.
