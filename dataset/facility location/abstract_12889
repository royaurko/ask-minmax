We report enhancement in the magnetic critical current density of indium
added polycrystalline SmFeAsO1-xFx. The value of magnetic Jc is around 25
kA/cm2 at 4.2 K under self-magnetic field. Polycrystalline SmFeAsO1-xFx is
mainly composed of the superconducting grains and a little of amorphous FeAs
compounds. These areas randomly co-exist and amorphous areas are located
between superconducting grains. Therefore, the superconducting current is
prevented by the amorphous areas. In this study, it is found that indium
addition to polycrystalline SmFeAsO1-xFx removes these amorphous areas and
induces the bringing together the superconducting grains. It means the total
contact surfaces of grains are increased. We suggest that the enhancement of
the magnetic critical current density is a direct effect of the indium
addition.
