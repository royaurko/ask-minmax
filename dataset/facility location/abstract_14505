Recent claims of angular correlations between gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and
clusters of galaxies are evaluated in light of existing but previously
uncorrelated GRB positional data. Additional GRB data sets we use include
sub-samples of soft BATSE 3B bursts, bursts located by the Interplanetary
Network (IPN), and GRBs localized by COMPTEL. We confirm a previously reported
excess by Rood and Struble (1996) of the 185 rich, nearby clusters of galaxies
(Abell, Corwin, and Olowin 1989, ACO) in the 1-$\sigma$ error circles of 74
BATSE 3B positions, but find a typical correlation strength of only
$~$2.5-$\sigma$ for typical sub-samples. However, none of the 185 ACO clusters
occur in the 1-$\sigma$ error boxes of 40 IPN GRBs or 18 COMPTEL GRBs. When all
ACO clusters are correlated with BATSE 3B GRBs however, we find an increasingly
strong correlation for GRBs with decreasingly small error boxes, reaching above
the 3.5-$\sigma$ level. We also find a slight excess of {\it soft} BATSE GRBs
near the positions of 185 rich, nearby ACO clusters, but the significance of
the correlation averages only $~$2.5-$\sigma$ for sub-samples delineated by
softness. We caution that the statistical significance of all these
correlations is marginal, and so conclude that the excess is at best only
suggestive of a physical association. Statistical fluke is still a strong
possibility. BATSE could confirm or refute such correlations in a 10-year
lifetime.
