We present a new, approximate method for modelling the acceleration and
collimation of relativistic jets in the presence of gravity. This method is
self-similar throughout the computational domain where gravitational effects
are negligible and, where significant, self-similar within a flux tube. These
solutions are applicable to jets launched from a small region (e.g., near the
inner edge of an accretion disk). As implied by earlier work, the flow can
converge onto the rotation axis, potentially creating a collimation shock.
  In this first version of the method, we derive the gravitational contribution
to the relativistic equations by analogy with non-relativistic flow. This
approach captures the relativistic kinetic gravitational mass of the flowing
plasma, but not that due to internal thermal and magnetic energies. A more
sophisticated treatment, derived from the basic general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamical equations, is currently being developed.
  Here we present an initial exploration of parameter space, describing the
effects the model parameters have on flow solutions and the location of the
collimation shock. These results provide the groundwork for new, semi-analytic
models of relativistic jets which can constrain conditions near the black hole
by fitting the jet break seen increasingly in X-ray binaries.
