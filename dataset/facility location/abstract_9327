By coupling observations of type Ia supernovae with results obtained from the
best available numerical models we constrain the Hubble constant, independently
of any external calibrators. We find an absolute lower limit of Ho > 50
km/s/Mpc. In addition, we construct a Hubble diagram with UVOIR light curves of
12 type Ia supernovae located in the Hubble flow, and when adopting the most
likely values (obtained from 1-D and 3-D deflagration simulations) of the
amount of (56)Ni produced in a typical event, we find values of Ho $\geq$
66$\pm$8 and $\geq$ 78$\pm$9 km/s/Mpc, respectively. Our result may be
difficult to reconcile with recent discussions in the literature as it seems
that an Einstein-de Sitter universe requires Ho $\simeq$ 46 km/s/Mpc in order
to fit the temperature power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background and
maintain the age constraints of the oldest stars.
