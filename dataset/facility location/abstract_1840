For the CLIC two-beam scheme, a high-current, long-pulse drive beam is
required for RF power generation. Taking advantage of the 3 GHz klystrons
available at the LEP injector once LEP stops, a 180 MeV electron accelerator is
being constructed for a nominal beam current of 3.5 A and 1.5 microsecond pulse
length. The high current requires highly effective suppression of dipolar
wakes. Two concepts are investigated for the accelerating structure design: the
"Tapered Damped Structure" developed for the CLIC main beam, and the "Slotted
Iris - Constant Aperture" structure. Both use 4 SiC loads per cell for
effective higher-order mode damping. A full-size prototype of the TDS structure
has been built and tested successfully at full power. A first prototype of the
SICA structure is being built.
