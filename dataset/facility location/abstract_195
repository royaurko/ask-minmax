"KPipe" is a proposed experiment which will study muon neutrino disappearance
for a sensitive test of the $\Delta m^2\sim1 \mathrm{eV}^2$ anomalies, possibly
indicative of one or more sterile neutrinos. The experiment is to be located at
the J-PARC Materials and Life Science Facility's spallation neutron source,
which represents the world's most intense source of charged kaon decay-at-rest
monoenergetic (236 MeV) muon neutrinos. The detector vessel, designed to
measure the charged current interactions of these neutrinos, will be 3 m in
diameter and 120 m long, extending radially at a distance of 32 m to 152 m from
the source. This design allows a sensitive search for $\nu_\mu$ disappearance
associated with currently favored light sterile neutrino models and features
the ability to reconstruct the neutrino oscillation wave within a single,
extended detector. The required detector design, technology, and costs are
modest. The KPipe measurements will be robust since they depend on a known
energy neutrino source with low expected backgrounds. Further, since the
measurements rely only on the measured rate of detected events as a function of
distance, with no required knowledge of the initial flux and neutrino
interaction cross section, the results will be largely free of systematic
errors. The experimental sensitivity to oscillations, based on a shape-only
analysis of the $L/E$ distribution, will extend an order of magnitude beyond
present experimental limits in the relevant high-$\Delta m^2$ parameter space.
