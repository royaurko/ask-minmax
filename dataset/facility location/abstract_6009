In this note we consider a society that partitions itself into disjoint
jurisdictions, each choosing a location of its public project and a taxation
scheme to finance it. The set of public project is multi-dimensional, and their
costs could vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We impose two principles,
egalitarianism, that requires the equalization of the total cost for all agents
in the same jurisdiction, and efficiency, that implies the minimization of the
aggregate total cost within jurisdiction. We show that these two principles
always yield a core-stable partition but a Nash stable partition may fail to
exist.
