The injector of C-ADS (Chinese Accelerator Driven Sub-critical System)
project is a high current, fully super-conducting proton accelerator.
Meanwhile, a BLM system is indispensable to this facility, especially in low
energy segments. This paper presents some basic simulations for 10MeV proton by
Monte Carlo program FLUKA, as well as the distributions on different secondary
particles in three aspects: angular, energy spectrum and current. These results
are beneficial to selecting the detector type and its location and determining
its dynamic range matching different requirements for both fast and slow beam
loss. Further, the major impact of the background is analyzed, such as
superconducting cavity X radiation and radiation caused by material activation,
in this paper as well. This work is meaningful in BLM system research.
