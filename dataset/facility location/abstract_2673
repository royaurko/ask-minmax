Medical images require immediate access by several physicians in different
places within a medical facility and access to a critically injured persons
medical image, such as the x-ray, on time can be a key factor in the diagnosis
and treatment of the patient. The electronic medical image archive system can
help to solve the problem faced in previous physical medium archiving, thus
increasing productivity and time which patients are attended to. In this paper,
simple but functional electronic medical image archive architecture was
proposed and implemented. The system was further evaluated in a hospital
setting by medical experts using sample patient image data. Results of the
system evaluation shows that electronic medical image archiving systems can
actually promote efficiency, quality improvement, provide timely availability
of radiologic images, image consultation, and image interpretation in emergent
and no emergent clinical care areas among other benefits
