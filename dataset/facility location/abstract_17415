By focusing on the oscillations of the cross-sectional area and the intensity
of magnetic waveguides located in the lower solar atmosphere, we aim to detect
and identify magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) sausage waves. Capturing several series
of high-resolution images of pores and sunspots and employing wavelet analysis
in conjunction with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) makes the MHD wave
analysis possible. For this paper, two sunspots and one pore (with a light
bridge) were chosen as representative examples of MHD waveguides in the lower
solar atmosphere. The sunspots and pore display a range of periods from 4 to 65
minutes. The sunspots support longer periods than the pore - generally enabling
a doubling or quadrupling of the maximum pore oscillatory period. All of these
structures display area oscillations indicative of MHD sausage modes and
in-phase behaviour between the area and intensity, presenting mounting evidence
for the presence of the slow sausage mode within these waveguides. The presence
of fast and slow MHD sausage waves has been detected in three different
magnetic waveguides in the lower solar photosphere. Furthermore, these
oscillations are potentially standing harmonics supported in the waveguides
which are sandwiched vertically between the temperature minimum in the lower
solar atmosphere and the transition region. Standing harmonic oscillations, by
means of solar magneto-seismology, may allow insight into the sub-resolution
structure of photospheric MHD waveguides.
