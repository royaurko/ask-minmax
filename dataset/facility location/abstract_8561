The applicability of the potential approximation in the case of open
universes is tested. Great Attractor-like structures are considered in the
test. Previous estimates of the Cosmic Microwave background anisotropies
produced by these structures are analyzed and interpreted. The anisotropies
corresponding to inhomogeneous ellipsoidal models are also computed. It is
proved that, whatever the spatial symmetry may be, Great Attractor-like objects
with extended cores (radius $\sim 10h^{-1}$),located at redshift $z=5.9$ in an
open universe with density parameter $\Omega_{0}=0.2$, produce secondary
gravitational anisotropies of the order of $10^{-5}$ on angular scales of a few
degrees. This anisotropy appears to be an integrated effect along the photon
geodesics. Its angular scale is much greater than that subtended by the Great
Attractor itself. This is understood taking into account that the integrated
effect is produced by the variations of the gravitational potential, which seem
to be important in large regions subtending angular scales of various degrees.
As a result of the large size of these regions, the spatial curvature of the
universe becomes important and, consequently, significant errors ($\sim 30$ per
cent) arise in estimations based on the potential approximation.
