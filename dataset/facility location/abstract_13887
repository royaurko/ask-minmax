Ideas from the theory of multisymplectic systems, introduced recently in
integrable systems by the contributor and Kundu to discuss Liouville integrability
in classical field theories with a defect, are applied to the sine-Gordon
model. The key ingredient is the introduction of a second Poisson bracket in
the theory that allows for a Hamiltonian description of the model that is
completely equivalent to the standard one, in the absence of a defect. In the
presence of a defect described by frozen B\"acklund transformations, our
approach based on the new bracket unifies the various tools used so far to
attack the problem. It also gets rid of the known issues related to the
evaluation of the Poisson brackets of the defect matrix which involve fields at
coinciding space point (the location of the defect). The original Lagrangian
approach also finds a nice reinterpretation in terms of the canonical
transformation representing the defect conditions.
