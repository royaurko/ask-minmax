A system for bunch-by-bunch detection of transverse proton and antiproton
coherent oscillations in the Fermilab Tevatron collider is described. It is
based on the signal from a single beam-position monitor located in a region of
the ring with large amplitude functions. The signal is digitized over a large
number of turns and Fourier-analyzed offline with a dedicated algorithm. To
enhance the signal, band-limited noise is applied to the beam for about 1 s.
This excitation does not adversely affect the circulating beams even at high
luminosities. The device has a response time of a few seconds, a frequency
resolution of $1.6\times 10^{-5}$ in fractional tune, and it is sensitive to
oscillation amplitudes of 60 nm. It complements Schottky detectors as a
diagnostic tool for tunes, tune spreads, and beam-beam effects. Measurements of
coherent mode spectra are presented and compared with models of beam-beam
oscillations.
