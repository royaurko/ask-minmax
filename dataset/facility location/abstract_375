Since 1990, the United Nations is annually holding a workshop on basic space
science for the benefit of the worldwide development of astronomy. Additional
to the scientific benefits of the workshops and the strengthening of
international cooperation, the workshops lead to the establishment of
astronomical telescope facilities through the Official Development Assistance
(ODA) of Japan. Teaching material, hands-on astrophysics material, and variable
star observing programmes had been developed for the operation of such
astronomical telescope facilities in an university environment. This approach
to astronomical telescope facility, observing programme, and teaching astronomy
has become known as the basic space science TRIPOD concept. Currently, a
similar TRIPOD concept is being developed for the International Heliophysical
Year 2007, consisting of an instrument array, data taking and analysis, and
teaching space science.
