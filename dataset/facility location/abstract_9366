We present absolute astrometry of the core of the Orion molecular cloud, made
with Very Large Array archive data taken over the last two decades. Our
analysis reveals that both the BN object and the radio source I have proper
motions: the BN object has a proper motion of $12.6 \pm 0.6$ mas yr$^{-1}$
(corresponding to a velocity of $27 \pm 1$ km s$^{-1}$ at an adopted distance
of 450 pc) to the northwest, while the radio source I has a proper motion of
$5.6 \pm 0.7$ mas yr$^{-1}$ (corresponding to a velocity of $12 \pm 2$ km
s$^{-1}$) to the southeast. The motion of the two sources is nearly
antiparallel, diverging from a point in between them, where they were located
about 500 years ago. These results suggest that the BN object and the radio
source I were part of a multiple young stellar system that disintegrated in the
recent past.
