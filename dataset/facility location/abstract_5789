We present a new method for locating unstable periodic points of one
dimensional chaotic maps. This method is based on order statistics. The
densities of various maxima of the iterates are discontinuous exactly at
unstable periodic points of the map. This is illustrated using logistic map
where densities corresponding to a small number of iterates have been obtained
in closed form. This technique can be applied to the class of continuous time
systems where the successive maxima of the time series behave as if they were
generated from a unimodal map. This is demonstrated using Lorenz model.
