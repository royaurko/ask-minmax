A non-local cascade model for anisotropic MHD turbulence in the presence of a
guiding magnetic field is proposed. The model takes into account that (a)
energy cascades in an anisotropic manner and as a result a different estimate
for the cascade rate in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the guiding
field is made. (b) the interactions that result in the cascade are between
different scales. Eddies with wave numbers $k_\|$ and $k_\perp$ interact with
eddies with wave numbers $q_\|,q_\perp$ such that a resonance condition between
the wave numbers $q_\|,q_\perp$ and $k_\|,k_\perp$ holds. As a consequence
energy from the eddy with wave numbers $k_\|$ and $k_\perp$ cascades due to
interactions with eddies located in the resonant manifold whose wavenumbers are
determined by: $q_\|\simeq \epsilon^{{1}/{3}}k_\perp^{2/3}/B$,
$q_\perp=k_\perp$ and energy will cascade along the lines $k_\|\sim
C+k_\perp^{2/3} \epsilon^{1/3}/B_0$. For a uniform energy injection rate in the
parallel direction the resulting energy spectrum is $E(k_\|,k_\perp)\simeq
\epsilon^{2/3}k_\|^{-1}k_\perp^{-5/3}$. For a general forcing however the model
suggests a non-universal behavior. The connections with previous models,
numerical simulations and weak turbulence theory are discussed.
