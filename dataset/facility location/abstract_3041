The M82 galaxy has been the subject of several studies basically because it
is relatively close to to the Milky Way and it displays a strong star formation
activity. Using multi-band images of M82 we have determined the age and
extinction of the stellar population located in regions with strong UV
emission, these region are in the nucleus and the disk of M82. We also have
employed the UV images of M82 and the physical properties of its stellar
clusters to measure the contribution of the clusters to the detected UV flux.
We found that clusters located in the nuclear regions are emitting all the
observed UV flux, whereas clusters of the disk emit less than ~10%. Based on
the results obtained from this work we can infer that the field stars located
in the disk of M82 could have been part of a stellar cluster when they were
born.
