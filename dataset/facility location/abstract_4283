Computational time reversal imaging can be used to locate the position of
multiple scatterers in a known background medium. Here, we discuss a sparse
approximation method for computational time-reversal imaging. The method is
formulated entirely in the frequency domain, and besides imaging it can also be
used for denoising, and to determine the magnitude of the scattering
coefficients in the presence of moderate noise levels.
