As antivirus and network intrusion detection systems have increasingly proven
insufficient to detect advanced threats, large security operations centers have
moved to deploy endpoint-based sensors that provide deeper visibility into
low-level events across their enterprises. Unfortunately, for many
organizations in government and industry, the installation, maintenance, and
resource requirements of these newer solutions pose barriers to adoption and
are perceived as risks to organizations' missions.
  To mitigate this problem we investigated the utility of agentless detection
of malicious endpoint behavior, using only the standard build-in Windows audit
logging facility as our signal. We found that Windows audit logs, while
emitting manageable sized data streams on the endpoints, provide enough
information to allow robust detection of malicious behavior. Audit logs provide
an effective, low-cost alternative to deploying additional expensive
agent-based breach detection systems in many government and industrial
settings, and can be used to detect, in our tests, 83% percent of malware
samples with a 0.1% false positive rate. They can also supplement already
existing host signature-based antivirus solutions, like Kaspersky, Symantec,
and McAfee, detecting, in our testing environment, 78% of malware missed by
those antivirus systems.
