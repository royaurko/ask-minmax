We study the evolution of galaxy structure since z ~ 1 to the present. From a
GOODS-S multi-band catalog we define (blue) luminosity- and mass-weighted
samples, limited by M_B <= -20 and M_star >= 10^10 M_Sun, comprising 1122 and
987 galaxies, respectively. We extract early-type (E/S0/Sa) and late-type
(Sb-Irr) subsamples by their position in the concentration-asymmetry plane, in
which galaxies exhibit a clear bimodality.
  We find that the early-type fraction, f_ET, rises with cosmic time, with a
corresponding decrease in the late-type fraction, f_LT, in both luminosity- and
mass-selected samples. However, the evolution of the comoving number density is
very different: the decrease in the total number density of M_B <= -20 galaxies
since z = 1 is due to the decrease in the late-type population, which accounts
for ~75% of the total star-formation rate in the range under study, while the
increase in the total number density of M_star >= 10^10 M_Sun galaxies in the
same redshift range is due to the evolution of early types. This suggests that
we need a structural transformation between late-type galaxies that form stars
actively and early-type galaxies in which the stellar mass is located.
  Comparing the observed evolution with the gas-rich major merger rate in
GOODS-S, we infer that only ~20% of the new early-type galaxies with M_star >=
10^10 M_Sun appeared since z ~ 1 can be explained by this kind of mergers,
suggesting that minor mergers and secular processes may be the driving
mechanisms of the structural evolution of intermediate-mass (M_star ~ 4x10^10
M_Sun) galaxies since z ~ 1.
