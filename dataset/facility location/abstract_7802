In this work we derive the full 3-D kinematics of the near-infrared outflow
HH 223, located in the dark cloud Lynds 723 (L723), where a well-defined
quadrupolar CO outflow is found. HH 223 appears projected onto the two lobes of
the east-west CO outflow. The radio continuum source VLA 2, towards the centre
of the CO outflow, harbours a multiple system of low-mass young stellar
objects. One of the components has been proposed to be the exciting source of
the east-west CO outflow.
  From the analisys of the kinematics, we get further evidence on the
relationship between the near-infrared and CO outflows and on the location of
their exciting source. The proper motions were derived using multi-epoch,
narrow-band H$_2$ (2.122 $\mu$m line) images. Radial velocities were derived
from the 2.122 $\mu$m line of the spectra. Because of the extended (~5 arcmin),
S-shaped morphology of the target, the spectra were obtained with the
Multi-Object-Spectroscopy (MOS) observing mode using the instrument LIRIS at
the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope. To our knowledge, this work is the first
time that MOS observing mode has been successfully used in the near infrared
range for an extended target.
