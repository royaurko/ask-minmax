In the early days of methanol maser discoveries the 9(2)-10(1) A+ transition
at 23.1 GHz was found to exhibit maser characteristics in the northern
star-forming region W3(OH), and probable maser emission in two other sources.
Attention subsequently turned to the 6.6-GHz 5(1)-6(0) A+ methanol maser
transition, which has proved a valuable tracer of early high-mass star
formation. We have undertaken a new search for 23.1-GHz methanol masers in 50
southern star formation regions using the Parkes radiotelescope. The target
sources all exhibit class II methanol maser emission at 6.6 GHz, with 20
sources also displaying maser features in the 107.0-GHz 3(1)-4(0) A+ methanol
line. Strong emission at 23.1 GHz in NGC 6334F was confirmed, but no emission
was detected in the remaining sources. Thus the 23.1-GHz methanol masers are
rare. A maser model in which methanol molecules are pumped to the second
torsionally excited state by radiation from warm dust can account for class II
maser activity in all the transitions in which it is observed. According to
this model the 23.1-GHz maser is favoured by conditions representing low gas
temperature, high external dust temperature, low gas density, and high column
density of methanol; the scarcity of this maser indicates that such
combinations of conditions are uncommon. We have undertaken new model
calculations to examine the range of parameters compatible with the upper
limits on 23.1-GHz emission from our survey.
