Maria family is regarded as an old-type (~3 +/- 1 Gyr) asteroid family which
has experienced substantial collisional and dynamical evolution in the
Main-belt. It is located nearby the 3:1 Jupter mean motion resonance area that
supplies Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) to the inner Solar System. We carried out
observations of Maria family asteroids during 134 nights from 2008 July to 2013
May, and derived synodic rotational periods for 51 objects, including newly
obtained periods of 34 asteroids. We found that there is a significant excess
of fast and slow rotators in observed rotation rate distribution. The
two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirms that the spin rate distribution is
not consistent with a Maxwellian at a 92% confidence level. From correlations
among rotational periods, amplitudes of lightcurves, and sizes, we conclude
that the rotational properties of Maria family asteroids have been changed
considerably by non-gravitational forces such as the YORP effect. Using a
lightcurve inversion method (Kaasalainen & Torppa 2001; Kaasalainen et al.
2001), we successfully determined the pole orientations for 13 Maria members,
and found an excess of prograde versus retrograde spins with a ratio (N_p/N_r)
of 3. This implies that the retrograde rotators could have been ejected by the
3:1 resonance into the inner Solar System since the formation of Maria family.
We estimate that approximately 37 to 75 Maria family asteroids larger than 1 km
have entered the near-Earth space every 100 Myr.
