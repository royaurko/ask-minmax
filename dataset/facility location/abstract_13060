Quorum sensing is a decentralized biological process, by which a community of
cells with no global awareness can coordinate their functional behaviors based
on cell-medium interaction and local decision making. This paper draws
inspirations from quorum sensing and colony competition to study the clustering
problem.
  We propose an algorithm treating each data as a single cell, utilizing the
knowledge of local connectivity to cluster cells into multiple colonies
simultaneously. The algorithm consists of two stages: first, it spots sparsely
distributed "core cells" and determines for each cell its influence radius;
second, core cells secrete "auto-inducers" that diffuse into the environment to
form colonies. Interactions between colonies eventually determine each cell's
identity. We combine the two steps into a dynamic process, which gives the
algorithm flexibility to analyze both static and time-varying data.
  Finally, we test our algorithm on several applications, including synthetic
and real benchmarks datasets, alleles clustering, and dynamic systems grouping
and identification. The results suggest that our algorithm performs as well as
other cutting-edge methods on static data, while applications on time-varying
data like locations of swarms of robots are also promising.
