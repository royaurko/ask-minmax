Using particle-in-cell simulations, we examine hot electron generation from
electron plasma waves excited by stimulated Raman scattering and rescattering
in the kinetic regime where the wavenumber times the Debye length (k\lambda_D)
is greater than 0.3 for backscatter. We find that for laser and plasma
conditions of possible relevance to experiments at the National Ignition
Facility (NIF), anomalously energetic electrons can be produced through the
interaction of a discrete spectrum of plasma waves generated from SRS (back and
forward scatter), rescatter, and the Langmuir decay of the rescatter-generated
plasma waves. Electrons are bootstrapped in energy as they propagate into
plasma waves with progressively higher phase velocities.
