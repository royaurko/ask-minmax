MGSim is an open source discrete event simulator for on-chip hardware
components, developed at the University of Amsterdam. It is intended to be a
research and teaching vehicle to study the fine-grained hardware/software
interactions on many-core and hardware multithreaded processors. It includes
support for core models with different instruction sets, a configurable
multi-core interconnect, multiple configurable cache and memory models, a
dedicated I/O subsystem, and comprehensive monitoring and interaction
facilities. The default model configuration shipped with MGSim implements
Microgrids, a many-core architecture with hardware concurrency management.
MGSim is furthermore written mostly in C++ and uses object classes to represent
chip components. It is optimized for architecture models that can be described
as process networks.
