Distance matrices are matrices whose elements are the relative distances
between points located on a certain manifold. In all cases considered here all
their eigenvalues except one are non-positive. When the points are uncorrelated
and randomly distributed we investigate the average density of their
eigenvalues and the structure of their eigenfunctions. The spectrum exhibits
delocalized and strongly localized states which possess different power-law
average behaviour. The exponents depend only on the dimensionality of the
manifold.
