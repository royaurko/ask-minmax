The paper develops DILOC, a \emph{distributive}, \emph{iterative} algorithm
that locates M sensors in $\mathbb{R}^m, m\geq 1$, with respect to a minimal
number of m+1 anchors with known locations. The sensors exchange data with
their neighbors only; no centralized data processing or communication occurs,
nor is there centralized knowledge about the sensors' locations. DILOC uses the
barycentric coordinates of a sensor with respect to its neighbors that are
computed using the Cayley-Menger determinants. These are the determinants of
matrices of inter-sensor distances. We show convergence of DILOC by associating
with it an absorbing Markov chain whose absorbing states are the anchors. We
introduce a stochastic approximation version extending DILOC to random
environments when the knowledge about the intercommunications among sensors and
the inter-sensor distances are noisy, and the communication links among
neighbors fail at random times. We show a.s. convergence of the modified DILOC
and characterize the error between the final estimates and the true values of
the sensors' locations. Numerical studies illustrate DILOC under a variety of
deterministic and random operating conditions.
