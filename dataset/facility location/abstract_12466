The phase diagram of five-dimensional SU(2) gauge theories is explored using
Monte Carlo simulations of the theory discretized on a Euclidean lattice using
the Wilson plaquette action and periodic boundary conditions. We simulate
anisotropic gauge couplings which correspond to different lattice spacings a_4
in the four dimensions and a_5 along the extra dimension. In particular we
study the case where a_5>a_4. We identify a line of first order phase
transitions which separate the confined from the deconfined phase. We perform
simulations in large volume at the bulk phase transition staying in the
confined vacuum. The static potential measured in the hyperplanes orthogonal to
the extra dimension hint at dimensional reduction. We also locate and analyze
second order phase transitions related to breaking of the center along one
direction.
