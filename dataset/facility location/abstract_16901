We report the discovery made using the Australia Telescope Compact Array of a
remarkable string of radio emission towards IRAS 16562-3959, a luminous
infrared source with a bolometric luminosity of $7.0\times10^4$ \Lsun. The
radio emission arises from a compact, bright central component, two inner
lobes, which are separated by about 7\arcsec\ and symmetrically offset from the
central source, and two outer lobes which are separated by about 45\arcsec. The
emission from the central object has a spectral index between 1.4 and 8.6 GHz
of $0.85\pm0.15$, consistent with free-free emission from a thermal jet. The
radio emission from the lobes have spectral indices in the range characteristic
of thermal emission. We suggest that the emission from the lobes arises in
shocks resulting from the interaction of a collimated wind with the surrounding
medium. The radio string is located within a massive dense molecular core, and
is associated with extended green emission (Spitzer 3-color), Herbig-Haro type
emission (2MASS K$_s$-band) and OH maser sites -- all phenomena readily
observed towards sites of massive star formation. We conclude that the massive
core hosts a high-mass star in an early stage of evolution in which it is
undergoing the ejection of a powerful collimated stellar wind, showing that
jets found in the formation of low-mass stars are also produced in high-mass
stars.
