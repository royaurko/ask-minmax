Modern, powerful techniques for the residual analysis of spatial-temporal
point process models are reviewed and compared. These methods are applied to
California earthquake forecast models used in the Collaboratory for the Study
of Earthquake Predictability (CSEP). Assessments of these earthquake
forecasting models have previously been performed using simple, low-power means
such as the L-test and N-test. We instead propose residual methods based on
rescaling, thinning, superposition, weighted K-functions and deviance
residuals. Rescaled residuals can be useful for assessing the overall fit of a
model, but as with thinning and superposition, rescaling is generally
impractical when the conditional intensity $\lambda$ is volatile. While
residual thinning and superposition may be useful for identifying spatial
locations where a model fits poorly, these methods have limited power when the
modeled conditional intensity assumes extremely low or high values somewhere in
the observation region, and this is commonly the case for earthquake
forecasting models. A recently proposed hybrid method of thinning and
superposition, called super-thinning, is a more powerful alternative.
