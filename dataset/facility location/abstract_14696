Multi-frequency polarimetry with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)
telescope has revealed absolute Faraday Rotation Measures (RMs) in excess of
1000 rad/m/m in the central regions of 7 out of 8 strong quasars studied (e.g.,
3C 273, 3C 279, 3C 395). Beyond a projected distance of ~20 pc, however, the
jets are found to have |RM| < 100 rad/m/m. Such sharp RM gradients cannot be
produced by cluster or galactic-scale magnetic fields, but rather must be the
result of magnetic fields organized over the central 1-100 pc. The RMs of the
sources studied to date and the polarization properties of BL Lacs, quasars and
galaxies are shown to be consistent so far with the predictions of unified
schemes. The direct detection of high RMs in these quasar cores can explain the
low fractional core polarizations usually observed in quasars at centimeter
wavelengths as the result of irregularities in the Faraday screen on scales
smaller than the telescope beam. Variability in the RM of the core is reported
for 3C 279 between observations taken 1.5 years apart, indicating that the
Faraday screen changes on that timescale, or that the projected superluminal
motion of the inner jet components samples a new location in the screen with
time. Either way, these changes in the Faraday screen may explain the dramatic
variability in core polarization properties displayed by quasars.
