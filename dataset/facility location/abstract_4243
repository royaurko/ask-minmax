We present an algorithm for the maximization of photonic bandgaps in
two-dimensional crystals. Once the translational symmetries of the underlying
structure have been imposed, our algorithm finds a global maximal (and
complete, if one exists) bandgap. Additionally, we prove two remarkable results
related to maximal bandgaps: the so-called `maximum contrast' rule, and about
the location in the Brillouin zone of band edges.
