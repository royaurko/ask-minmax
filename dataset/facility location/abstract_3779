We used high-resolution spectra acquired with the multifiber facility FLAMES
at the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory to investigate
the chemical and kinematical properties of a sample of 22 Blue Straggler Stars
(BSSs) and 26 red giant branch stars in the nearby globular cluster NGC 6752.
We measured radial and rotational velocities and Fe, O and C abundances.
According to radial velocities, metallicity and proper motions we identified 18
BSSs as likely cluster members. We found that all the BSSs rotate slowly (less
than 40 km/s), similar to the findings in 47 Tucanae, NGC 6397 and M30. The Fe
abundance analysis reveals the presence of 3 BSSs affected by radiative
levitation (showing [Fe/H] significantly higher than that measured in "normal"
cluster stars), confirming that element transport mechanisms occur in the
photosphere of BSSs hotter than 8000 K. Finally, BSS C and O abundances are
consistent with those measured in dwarf stars. No C and O depletion ascribable
to mass transfer processes has been found on the atmospheres of the studied
BSSs (at odds with previous results for 47 Tucanae and M30), suggesting the
collisional origin for BSSs in NGC 6752 or that the CO-depletion is a transient
phenomenon.
