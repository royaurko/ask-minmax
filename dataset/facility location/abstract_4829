In this paper we compute exactly the ground state energy and entropy of the
dilute ferromagnetic Ising model. The two thermodynamic quantities are also
computed when a magnetic field with random locations is present. The result is
reached in the replica approach frame by a class of replica order parameters
introduced by Monasson. The strategy is first illustrated considering the SK
model, for which we will show the complete equivalence with the standard
replica approach. Then, we apply to the diluted ferromagnetic Ising model with
a random located magnetic field, which is mapped into a Potts model. This
formalism can be, in principle, applied to all random systems, and we believe
that it could be of help in many other contexts.
