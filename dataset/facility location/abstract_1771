The 46Ti compound nucleus, as populated by the fusion-evaporation reaction
27Al + 19F at the bombarding energy of 144 MeV, has been investigated by
charged particle spectroscopy using the multidetector array ICARE at the
VIVITRON tandem facility of the IReS (Strasbourg). The light charged particles
have been measured in coincidence with evaporation residues. The CACARIZO code,
a Monte Carlo implementation of the statistical-model code CASCADE, has been
used to calculate the spectral shapes of evaporated alpha-particles which are
compared with the experimental spectra. This comparison indicates the possible
signature of large deformations of the compound nucleus.
