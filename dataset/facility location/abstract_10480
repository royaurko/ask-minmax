Classical tools of nonlinear dynamics are used to study the highly excited
vibrations of small molecules. For effective Hamiltonians with one polyad
number (approximate constant of motion), previously developed methods locate
new anharmonic modes using the critical points in the reduced classical phase
space. Theoretical arguments are given for generalizing the method to more than
one polyad number.
  The pure bending Hamiltonian of acetylene is analyzed to demonstrate the
effectiveness of critical points analysis. Four families of critical points are
born in distinct bifurcations, each corresponding to a novel anharmonic mode.
These modes are visualized with custom computer-generated animations.
  The same analysis is extended for the first time to the acetylene stretchbend
system, which has never been analyzed classically with all the resonance
couplings. Preliminary results are obtained for the polyad series containing
the C-H stretch overtones.
