In this paper, we analyze the high-energy limits for Higgs boson plus two jet
production. We consider two high-energy limits, corresponding to two different
kinematic regions: a) the Higgs boson is centrally located in rapidity between
the two jets, and very far from either jet; b) the Higgs boson is close to one
jet in rapidity, and both of these are very far from the other jet. In both
cases the amplitudes factorize into impact factors or coefficient functions
connected by gluons exchanged in the t channel. Accordingly, we compute the
coefficient function for the production of a Higgs boson from two off-shell
gluons, and the impact factors for the production of a Higgs boson in
association with a gluon or a quark jet. We include the full top quark mass
dependence and compare this with the result obtained in the large top-mass
limit.
