This paper looks at tungsten samples irradiated by beams of protons, gammas,
electrons and positrons at the Jupiter Laser Facility of Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory (LLNL). The resulting unstable nuclei created are
identified using their gamma spectra. These spectra were taken, usually within
an hour of irradiation, for periods up to 48 hrs. In several cases there are
two isotopes, one of Rhenium and the other of Tantalum, that emit the same
gamma lines. These pairs often involve a long-lived and a short-lived
candidate. Spectra were taken 80 days after initial exposure and the long-lived
candidates are ruled out.
