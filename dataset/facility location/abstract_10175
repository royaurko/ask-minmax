Lattice QED2 with the Wilson formulation of fermions is used as a convenient
model system to study artifacts of the quenched approximation on a finite
lattice. The quenched functional integral is shown to be ill-defined in this
system as a consequence of the appearance of exactly real modes for physical
values of the fermion mass.
  The location and frequency of such modes is studied as a function of lattice
spacing, lattice volume, topological charge and improved action parameters. The
efficacy of the recently proposed modified quenched approximation is examined,
as well as a new approach to the interpolation from the quenched to full
dynamical theory employing a truncated form of the fermion determinant.
