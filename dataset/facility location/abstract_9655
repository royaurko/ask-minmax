A single electron transistor based on Al-AlO_x-Nb tunnel junctions was
fabricated by shadow evaporation and in situ barrier formation. Its output
current noise was measured, using a transimpedance amplifier setup, as a
function of bias voltage, gain, and temperature, in the frequency range 1...300
Hz. The spot noise at 10 Hz is dominated by a gain dependent component,
indicating that the main noise contribution comes from fluctuations at the
input of the transistor. Deviations from ideal input charge noise behaviour are
found in the form of a bias dependence of the differential charge equivalent
noise, i. e. the derivative of current noise with respect to gain. The
temperature dependence of this effect could indicate that heating is activating
the noise sources, and that they are located inside or in the near vicinity of
the junctions.
