One of the challenges currently problems in the use of cloud services is the
task of designing of specialized data management systems. This is especially
important for hybrid systems in which the data are located in public and
private clouds. Implementation monitoring functions querying, scheduling and
processing software must be properly implemented and is an integral part of the
system. To provide these functions is proposed to use an object-relational
mapping (ORM). The article devoted to presenting the approach of designing
databases for information systems hosted in a hybrid cloud infrastructure. It
also provides an example of the development of ORM library.
