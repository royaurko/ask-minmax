In many situations it is required to perform an inspection of large at parts
on a coordinate-measuring machine (CMM) when it is impossible to probe all
necessary surfaces from one position of the part. Or it is necessary to measure
a large part which dimensions exceed the volume of an available CMM. For this
purpose one needs to merge the data measured in two different positions of the
workpiece into one coordinate system. Though most of geodesic software has
out-of-the-box functionality to do that, a lot of popular CMM software lacks
it. In this paper a practical approach is described to bring a repositioning
functionality into a CMM software. The Calypso metrology software was studied.
The proposed inspection method can be used both for the measurements of linear
dimensions and location tolerances as common practice in Calypso.
