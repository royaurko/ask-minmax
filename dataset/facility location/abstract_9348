Co-addition of blank-field FIRST data at the location of over 8000 QSOs in
the 2QZ survey has yielded statistical detections of radio quiet QSOs with
median flux levels of 20-40microJy. We show that the total radio flux of
radio-quiet QSOs in the 2QZ is consistent with a smooth extrapolation of the
2QZ radio-loud QSO number-flux distribution based on the slope of the relation
flattening near the FIRST flux limit. However, we are unable to distinguish a
smooth extrapolation of the luminosity function to faint levels from a bimodal
luminosity function with a break close to or below the FIRST radio detection
limit. We also demonstrate that the redshift dependence of the median
radio-to-optical spectral index for these radio quiet QSOs is consistent with
that obtained for individual radio-loud 2QZ QSOs detected by FIRST.
