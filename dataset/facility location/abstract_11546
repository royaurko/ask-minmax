The primary instrument of the proposed EXIST mission is a coded mask high
energy telescope (the HET), that must have a wide field of view and extremely
good sensitivity. It will be crucial to minimize systematic errors so that even
for very long total integration times the imaging performance is close to the
statistical photon limit. There is also a requirement to be able to reconstruct
images on-board in near real time in order to detect and localize gamma-ray
bursts. This must be done while the spacecraft is scanning the sky. The
scanning provides all-sky coverage and is key to reducing systematic errors.
The on-board computational problem is made even more challenging for EXIST by
the very large number of detector pixels. Numerous alternative designs for the
HET have been evaluated. The baseline concept adopted depends on a unique coded
mask with two spatial scales. Monte Carlo simulations and analytic analysis
techniques have been used to demonstrate the capabilities of the design and of
the proposed two-step burst localization procedure.
