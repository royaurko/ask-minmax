We report the Chandra/ACIS-S detection of more than 20 ultraluminous X-ray
sources (ULXs, L_{0.5-10 keV} >~ 3 x 10^{39} ergs/sec) in the Cartwheel
collisional ring galaxy system, of which over a dozen are located in the outer
active star-forming ring. A remarkable hyperluminous X-ray source (HLX,
L_{0.5-10 keV} >~ 10^{41} ergs/sec assuming isotropic radiation), which
dominates the X-ray emission from the Cartwheel ring, is located in the same
segment of the ring as most ULXs. These powerful H/ULXs appear to be coincident
with giant HII region complexes, young star clusters, and radio and
mid-infrared hot-spots: all strong indicators of recent massive star formation.
The X-ray spectra show that H/ULXs have similar properties as those of the {\it
most luminous} ULXs found in the nearest starbursts and galaxy mergers such as
the Antennae galaxies and M82. The close association between the X-ray sources
and the starbursting ring strongly suggests that the H/ULXs are intimately
associated with the production and rapid evolution of short-lived massive
stars. The observations represent the most extreme X-ray luminosities
discovered to date associated with star-forming regions--rivaling the X-ray
luminosities usually associated with active galactic nuclei.
