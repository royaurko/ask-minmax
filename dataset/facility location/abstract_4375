We study the stability of capillary hypersurfaces in a unit Euclidean ball.
It is proved that if the mass center of the generalized body enclosed by the
immersed capillary hypersurface and the wetted part of the sphere is located at
the origin, then the hypersurface is unstable. An immediate result is that all
known examples except the totally geodesic ones and spherical caps are
unstable.
