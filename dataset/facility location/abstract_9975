We investigate the antiferromagnetic insulating nature of Ca3FeRhO6 both
experimentally and theoretically. Susceptibility measurements reveal a Neel
temperature T_N = 20 K, and a magnetic moment of 5.3 muB/f. u., while
Moessbauer spectroscopy strongly suggests that the Fe ions, located in trigonal
prismatic sites, are in a 3+ high spin state. Transport measurements display a
simple Arrhenius law, with an activation energy of 0.2 eV. The experimental
results are interpreted with LSDA band structure calculations, which confirm
the Fe 3+ state, the high-spin/low-spin scenario, the antiferromagnetic
ordering, and the value for the activation energy.
