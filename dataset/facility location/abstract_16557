This paper investigates the star formation rate (SFR) in the Solar
neighbourhood. First, we build the local age distribution function (ADF) with
an updated sample of 442 star clusters located at less than 1\,kpc from the
Sun. Next, we define the SFR, compute the individual mass evolution of a
population of artificial clusters covering the broad range of parameters
observed in actual clusters, and assume 100\,\ms\ as the low-mass limit for
effective cluster observation. This leads to a simulated ADF, which is compared
to the low-noise Solar neighbourhood ADF. The best match corresponds to a
non-constant SFR presenting two conspicuous excesses for ages $\le9$\,Myr and
between 220-600\,Myr (the local starburst). The average formation rate is
$\bar{SFR}\approx(2500\pm500)\,\mmy$, corresponding to the average surface
formation rate $\bar{\ssfr}\approx(790\pm160)\,\mmk$. These values are
consistent with the formation rate inferred from embedded clusters (ECs), but
much lower ($\la16%$) than that implied by field stars. Both the local
starburst and the recent star formation period require
$SFR\sim2\times\bar{SFR}$ to be described. The simulations show that
$91.2\pm2.7%$ of the clusters created in the Solar neighbourhood do not survive
the first 10\,Myr, which is consistent with the rate of EC dissolution.
