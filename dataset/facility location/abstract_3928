Potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) represent a unique opportunity for
physical characterization during their close approaches to Earth. The proximity
of these asteroids makes them accessible for sample-return and manned missions,
but could also represent a risk for life on Earth in the event of collision.
Therefore, a detailed mineralogical analysis is a key component in planning
future exploration missions and developing appropriate mitigation strategies.
In this study we present near-infrared spectra (0.7-2.55 microns) of PHA
(214869) 2007 PA8 obtained with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility during its
close approach to Earth on November 2012. The mineralogical analysis of this
asteroid revealed a surface composition consistent with H ordinary chondrites.
In particular, we found that the olivine and pyroxene chemistries of 2007 PA8
are Fa18(Fo82) and Fs16, respectively. The olivine-pyroxene abundance ratio was
estimated to be 47%. This low olivine abundance and the measured band
parameters, close to the H4 and H5 chondrites, suggest that the parent body of
2007 PA8 experienced thermal metamorphism before being catastrophically
disrupted. Based on the compositional affinity, proximity to the J5:2
resonance, and estimated flux of resonant objects we determined that the
Koronis family is the most likely source region for 2007 PA8.
