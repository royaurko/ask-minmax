The China Dark Matter Experiment (CDEX) is located at the China Jinping
underground laboratory (CJPL) and aims to directly detect the WIMP flux with
high sensitivity in the low mass region. Here we present a study of the
predicted photon and electron backgrounds including the background contribution
of the structure materials of the germanium detector, the passive shielding
materials, and the intrinsic radioactivity of the liquid argon that serves as
an anti-Compton active shielding detector. A detailed geometry is modeled and
the background contribution has been simulated based on the measured
radioactivities of all possible components within the GEANT4 program. Then the
photon and electron background level in the energy region of interest (<10^-2
events kg-1 day-1 keV-1 (cpkkd)) is predicted based on Monte Carlo simulations.
The simulated result is consistent with the design goal of CDEX-10 experiment,
0.1 cpkkd, which shows that the active and passive shield design of CDEX-10 is
effective and feasible.
