KASCADE-Grande is a new extensive air shower experiment co-located to the
KASCADE site at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe. The multi-detector system allows
to investigate the energy spectrum, composition, and anisotropies of cosmic
rays with unprecedented prevision in the energy range from 10^{14}-10^{18} eV.
The primary goals besides investigating the origin of the knee at E ~ 3 *
10^{15} eV, are to verify the existence of the second knee at E ~ 10^{17} eV
and to measure the composition in the expected transition region of galactic to
extragalactic cosmic rays. The performance of the apparatus and shower
reconstruction methods will be discussed on the basis of detailed Monte Carlo
simulations and first data. First results based on slightly more than a year of
data taking are presented.
