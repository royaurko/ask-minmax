Despite the evolution in deployed infrastructure and in the way that people
access information, still there are those who are socially excluded and have no
access to information due to their geographic location (e.g.,
riverside/countryside communities). This paper proposes an extension to a DTN
architecture implementation to allow the dissemination of information in such
communities, including educational short-video clips and audio books. The
IBR-DTN architecture is complemented with a Bluetooth Convergence Layer, to
facilitate the exchange of information over this short-range wireless
technology, and with a Bundle Compression mechanism that aims at improving data
exchange in short-lived opportunistic contacts happening among nodes.
Experiments in a small-scale testbed and in a large-scale simulator environment
show that nodes are indeed able to efficiently use contact opportunities to
exchange an increased amount of data, allowing people in riverside communities
to receive more content related to digital inclusion services.
