We discuss the origin of ultraviolet sensitivity in extra dimensional
theories, and compare and contrast the cutoff dependences in universal,
nonuniversal and split five dimensional models. While the gauge bosons and
scalars are in the five dimensional bulk in all scenarios, the locations of the
fermions are different in different cases. In the universal model all fermions
can travel in the bulk, in the nonuniversal case they are all confined at the
brane, while in the split scenario some are in the bulk and some are in the
brane. A possible cure from such divergences is also discussed.
