The arrangement of things in n-dimensional space is specified as Spatial.
Spatial data consists of values that denote the location and shape of objects
and areas on the earths surface. Spatial information includes facts such as
location of features, the relationship of geographic features and measurements
of geographic features. The spatial cognition is a primal area of study in
various other fields such as Robotics, Psychology, Geosciences, Geography,
Political Sciences, Geographic Economy, Environmental, Mining and Petroleum
Engineering, Natural Resources, Epidemiology, Demography etc., Any text
document which contains physical location specifications such as place names,
geographic coordinates, landmarks, country names etc., are supposed to contain
the spatial information. The spatial information may also be represented using
vague or fuzzy descriptions involving linguistic terms such as near to, far
from, to the east of, very close. Given a query involving events, the aim of
this ongoing research work is to extract the relevant information from multiple
text documents, resolve the uncertainty and vagueness and translate them in to
locations in a map. The input to the system would be a text Corpus and a
Spatial Query event. The output of the system is a map showing the most
possible, disambiguated location of the event queried. The contributor proposes
Fuzzy Logic Techniques for resolving the uncertainty in the spatial
expressions.
