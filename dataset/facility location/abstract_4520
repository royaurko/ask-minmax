Fast and slow magnetosonic shock formation is presented for stationary and
axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) accretion flows onto a black hole. The
shocked black hole accretion solution must pass through magnetosonic points at
some locations outside and inside the shock location. We analyze critical
conditions at the magnetosonic points and the shock conditions. Then, we show
the restrictions on the flow parameters for strong shocks. We also show that a
very hot shocked plasma is obtained for a very high-energy inflow with small
number density. Such a MHD shock can appear very close to the event horizon,
and can be expected as a source of high-energy emissions. Examples of shocked
MHD accretion flows are presented in the Schwarzschild case.
