Recently the H.E.S.S. collaboration announced the detection of an
unidentified gamma-ray source with an off-set from the galactic plane of 3.5
degrees: HESS J1507-622. If the distance of the object is larger than about one
kpc it would be physically located outside the galactic disk. The density
profile of the ISM perpendicular to the galactic plane, which acts as target
material for hadronic gamma-ray production, drops quite fast with increasing
distance. This fact places distance dependent constraints on the energetics and
properties of off-plane gamma-ray sources like HESS J1507-622 if a hadronic
origin of the gamma-ray emission is assumed. For the case of this source it is
found that there seems to be no simple way to link this object to the remnant
of a stellar explosions.
