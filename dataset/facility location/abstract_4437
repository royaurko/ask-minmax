The Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on the Compton Gamma Ray
Observatory (CGRO) has triggered on 1637 cosmic gamma-ray bursts between 1991
April 19 and 1996 August 29. These events constitute the Fourth BATSE burst
catalog. The current version (4Br) has been revised from the version first
circulated on CD-ROM in September 1997 (4B) to include improved locations for a
subset of bursts that have been reprocssed using additional data. A significant
difference from previous BATSE catalogs is the inclusion of bursts from periods
when the trigger energy range differed from the nominal 50-300 keV. We present
tables of the burst occurrence times, locations, peak fluxes, fluences, and
durations. In general, results from previous BATSE catalogs are confirmed here
with greater statistical significance.
