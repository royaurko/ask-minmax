The ANTARES project aims to build a deep-sea Cherenkov Telescope for High
Energy Neutrino Astronomy located in the Mediterranean Sea. The experiment,
currently in the construction phase, has recently achieved an important
milestone : the operation of a prototype line and of a line with monitoring
instruments. These deployments allowed a thorough understanding of
environmental parameters.
