In this paper we present a method for locating transition states and
higher-order saddles on potential energy surfaces using double-ended classical
trajectories. We then apply this method to 7- and 8-atom Lennard-Jones
clusters, finding one previously unreported transition state for the 7-atom
cluster and two for the 8-atom cluster.
