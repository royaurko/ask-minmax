The experimental two-microphone transfer function method (TMTF) is adapted to
the numerical framework to compute the radiation and input impedances of
three-dimensional vocal tracts of elliptical cross section. In its simplest
version, the TMTF method only requires measuring the acoustic pressure at two
points in an impedance duct and the postprocessing of the corresponding
transfer function. However, some considerations are to be taken into account
when using the TMTF method in the numerical context, which constitute the main
objective of this paper. In particular, the importance of including absorption
at the impedance duct walls to avoid lengthy numerical simulations is discussed
and analytical complex axial wave numbers for elliptical ducts are derived for
this purpose. It is also shown how the plane wave restriction of the TMTF
method can be circumvented to some extent by appropriate location of the
virtual microphones, thus extending the method frequency range of validity.
Virtual microphone spacing is also discussed on the basis of the so called
singularity factor. Numerical examples include the computation of the radiation
impedance of vowels /a/, /i/ and /u/ and the input impedance of vowel /a/, for
simplified vocal tracts of circular and elliptical cross sections.
