We determined the exact location of the shearless KAM curve in the quadratic
map and numerically investigate the breakup thresholds of those curves in the
entire parameter space. The breakup diagram reveals many sharp singularities
like fractals on the reconnection thresholds of the twin-chains with rational
rotation numbers.
