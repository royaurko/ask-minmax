A chiral unitary approach for antikaon-nucleon scattering in on-shell
factorization is studied. We find multiple sets of parameters for which the
model describes all existing hadronic data similarly well. We confirm the
two-pole structure of the $\Lambda (1405)$. The narrow $\Lambda(1405)$ pole
appears at comparable positions in the complex energy plane, whereas the
location of the broad pole suffers from a large uncertainty. In the second
step, we use a simple model for photoproduction of $K^+\pi\Sigma$ off the
proton and confront it with the experimental data from the CLAS collaboration.
It is found that only a few of the hadronic solutions allow for a consistent
description of the CLAS data within the assumed reaction mechanism.
