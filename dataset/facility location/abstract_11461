This paper addresses the issue of detecting point objects in a clutter
background and estimating their position by image processing. We are interested
in the specific context where the object signature significantly varies with
its random subpixel location because of aliasing. Conventional matched filter
neglects this phenomenon and causes consistent loss of detection performance.
Thus, alternative detectors are proposed and numerical results show the
improvement brought by approximate and generalized likelihood ratio tests in
comparison with pixel matched filtering. We also study the performance of two
types of subpixel position estimators. Finally, we put forward the major
influence of sensor design on both estimation and point object detection
performance.
