We have investigated evolution of non-thermal emission from relativistic
electrons accelerated at around the shock fronts during merger of clusters of
galaxies. We estimate synchrotron radio emission and inverse Compton scattering
of cosmic microwave background photons from extreme ultraviolet (EUV) to hard
X-ray range. The hard X-ray emission is most luminous in the later stage of
merger. Both hard X-ray and radio emissions are luminous only while signatures
of merging events are clearly seen in thermal intracluster medium (ICM). On the
other hand, EUV radiation is still luminous after the system has relaxed.
Propagation of shock waves and bulk-flow motion of ICM play crucial roles to
extend radio halos. In the contracting phase, radio halos are located at the
hot region of ICM, or between two substructures. In the expanding phase, on the
other hand, radio halos are located between two ICM hot regions and shows
rather diffuse distribution.
