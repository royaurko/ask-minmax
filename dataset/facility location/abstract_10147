The forward proton spectrometer is part of the H1 detector at the HERA
collider. Protons with energies above 500 GeV and polar angles below 1 mrad can
be detected by this spectrometer. The main detector components are
scintillating fiber detectors read out by position-sensitive photo-multipliers.
These detectors are housed in so-called Roman Pots which allow them to be moved
close to the circulating proton beam. Four Roman Pot stations are located at
distances between 60 m and 90 m from the interaction point.
