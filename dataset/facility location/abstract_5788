We present a method to detect the unstable periodic orbits of a
multidimensional chaotic dynamical system. Our approach allows us to locate in
an efficient way the unstable cycles of, in principle, arbitrary length with a
high accuracy. Based on a universal set of linear transformations the
originally unstable periodic orbits are transformed into stable ones and can
consequently be detected and analyzed easily. This method is applicable to
dynamical systems of any dimension and requires no preknowledges with respect
to the solutions of the original chaotic system. As an example of application
of our method we investigate the Ikeda attractor in some detail.
