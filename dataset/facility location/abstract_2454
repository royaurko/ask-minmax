Gas targets are often used at accelerator facilities. A design of
high-pressure gas cells that are suitable for hydrogen and helium isotopes at
relatively high electron beam currents is presented. In particular, we consider
rare gas targets, $^3$H$_2$ and $^3$He. In the design, heat transfer and
mechanical integrity of the target cell are emphasized. ANSYS 12 was used for
the thermo-mechanical studies of the target cell. Since the ultimate goal in
this study was to design a gas target for use at the Jefferson Laboratory
(JLab), particular attention is given to the typical operating conditions found
there. It is demonstrated that an aluminum alloy cell can meet the required
design goals.
