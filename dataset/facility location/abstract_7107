Could the location of the maximum point for a positive solution of a
semilinear Poisson equation on a convex domain be independent of the form of
the nonlinearity? Cima and Derrick found certain evidence for this surprising
conjecture.
  We construct counterexamples on the half-disk, by working with the torsion
function and first Dirichlet eigenfunction. On an isosceles right triangle the
conjecture fails again. Yet the conjecture has merit, since the maxima of the
torsion function and eigenfunction are unexpectedly close together. It is an
open problem to quantify this closeness in terms of the domain and the
nonlinearity.
