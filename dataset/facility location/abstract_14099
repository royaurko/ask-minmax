The increasing adoption of Cloud-based data processing and storage poses a
number of privacy issues. Users wish to preserve full control over their
sensitive data and cannot accept it to be fully accessible to an external
storage provider. Previous research in this area was mostly addressed at
techniques to protect data stored on untrusted database servers; however, I
argue that the Cloud architecture presents a number of specific problems and
issues. This dissertation contains a detailed analysis of open issues. To
handle them, I present a novel approach where confidential data is stored in a
highly distributed partitioned database, partly located on the Cloud and partly
on the clients. In my approach, data can be either private or shared; the
latter is shared in a secure manner by means of simple grant-and-revoke
permissions. I have developed a proof-of-concept implementation using an
in-memory RDBMS with row-level data encryption in order to achieve fine-grained
data access control. This type of approach is rarely adopted in conventional
outsourced RDBMSs because it requires several complex steps. Benchmarks of my
proofof-concept implementation show that my approach overcomes most of the
problems.
