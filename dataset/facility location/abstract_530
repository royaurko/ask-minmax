The Relational Database Aspects of Argonnes ATLAS Control System Argonnes
ATLAS (Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System) control system comprises two
separate database concepts. The first is the distributed real-time database
structure provided by the commercial product Vsystem [1]. The second is a more
static relational database archiving system designed by ATLAS personnel using
Oracle Rdb [2] and Paradox [3] software. The configuration of the ATLAS
facility has presented a unique opportunity to construct a control system
relational database that is capable of storing and retrieving complete archived
tune-up configurations for the entire accelerator. This capability has been a
major factor in allowing the facility to adhere to a rigorous operating
schedule. Most recently, a Web-based operator interface to the control systems
Oracle Rdb database has been installed. This paper explains the history of the
ATLAS database systems, how they interact with each other, the design of the
new Web-based operator interface, and future plans.
