The European X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) is a new research facility
currently under construction in Hamburg, Germany. With a pulse length of less
than 100 fs and an extremely high luminosity of 27000 flashes per second the
European XFEL will have a unique time structure that demands the development of
new detectors tailored to the requirements imposed by the experiments while
complying with the machine specific operation parameters. The Adaptive Gain
Integrating Pixel Detector (AGIPD) is one response to the need for large 2D
detectors, able to cope with the 4.5 MHz frame rate, as well as with the high
dynamic range needed by XFEL experiments ranging from single photons to more
than 10$^4$ 12 keV photons per pixel per pulse. In addition it has to withstand
doses of up to 1 GGy over three years.
