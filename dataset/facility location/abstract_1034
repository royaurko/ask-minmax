We have created a new semantic tool called AstroConcepts, providing
definitions of astronomical concepts present on Web pages. This tool is a
Google Chrome plug-in that interrogates the Etymological Dictionary of
Astronomy and Astrophysics, developed at Paris Observatory. Thanks to this
tool, if one selects an astronomical concept on a web page, a pop-up window
will display the definition of the available English or French terms. Another
expected use of this facility could be its implementation in Virtual
Observatory services.
