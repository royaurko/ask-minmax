A detailed comparison is made between the topological structure of quenched
QCD as revealed by the recently proposed over-improved stout-link smearing in
conjunction with an improved gluonic definition of the topological density on
one hand and a similar analysis made possible by the overlap-fermionic
topological charge density both with and without variable ultraviolet cutoff
$\lambda_{cut}$. The matching is twofold, provided by fitting the
density-density two-point functions on one hand and by a point-by-point fitting
of the topological densities according to the two methods. We point out the
similar cluster structure of the topological density for moderate smearing and
$200 \mathrm{MeV} < \lambda_{cut} < 600 \mathrm{MeV}$, respectively. We
demonstrate the relation of the gluonic topological density for extensive
smearing to the location of the overlap zero modes and the lowest overlap
non-zero mode as found for the unsmeared configurations.
