We show that extreme vacuum pressures can be measured with current technology
by detecting the photons produced by the relativistic Thomson scattering of
ultra-intense laser light by the electrons of the medium. We compute the amount
of radiation scattered at different frequencies and angles and design
strategies for the efficient measurement of pressure. In particular, we show
that a single day experiment at a high repetition rate Petawatt laser facility
such as VEGA, that will be operating in 2014 in Salamanca, will be sensitive,
in principle, to pressures p as low as 10^{-16} Pa, and will be able to provide
highly reliable measurements for p>10^{-14} Pa.
