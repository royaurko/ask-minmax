We present the photometry and theoretical models for a Galactic bulge
microlensing event OGLE-2000-BUL-43. The event is very bright with I=13.54 mag,
and has a very long time scale, t_E=156 days. The long time scale and its light
curve deviation from the standard shape strongly suggest that it may be
affected by the parallax effect. We show that OGLE-2000-BUL-43 is the first
discovered microlensing event, in which the parallax distortion is observed
over a period of 2 years. Difference Image Analysis (DIA) using the PSF
matching algorithm of Alard & Lupton enabled photometry accurate to 0.5%. All
photometry obtained with DIA is available electronically. Our analysis
indicates that the viewing condition from a location near Jupiter will be
optimal and can lead to magnifications ~ 50 around January 31, 2001. These
features offer a great promise for resolving the source (a K giant) and
breaking the degeneracy between the lens parameters including the mass of the
lens, if the event is observed with the imaging camera on the Cassini space
probe.
