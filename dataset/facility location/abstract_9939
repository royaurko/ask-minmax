We investigate the kinetics of phase separation for a mixture of rodlike
viruses (fd) and polymer (dextran), which effectively constitutes a system of
attractive rods. This dispersion is quenched from a flow-induced fully nematic
state into the region where the nematic and the isotropic phase coexist. We
show experimental evidence that the kinetic pathway depends on the overall
concentration. When the quench is made at high concentrations, the system is
meta-stable and we observe typical nucleation-and-growth. For quenches at low
concentration the system is unstable and the system undergoes a spinodal
decomposition. At intermediate concentrations we see the transition between
both demixing processes, where we locate the spinodal point.
