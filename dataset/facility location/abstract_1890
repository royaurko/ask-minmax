The National Ignition Facility (NIF) technology is designed to drive
deuterium-tritium (DT) internal confinement fusion (ICF) targets to ignition
using indirect radiation from laser beam energy captured in a hohlraum.
Hydrodynamical instabilities at interfaces in the ICF capsule leading to mix
between the DT fue l and the ablator shell material are of fundamental physical
interest and can affect the performance characteristics of the capsule. In this
Letter we describe new radiochemical diagnostics for mix processes in ICF
capsules with plastic or Be (0.9%Cu) ablator shells. Reactions of high-energy
tritons with shell material produce high-energy $\beta$-emitters.
  We show that mix between the DT fuel and the shell material enhances
high-energy prompt beta emission from these reactions by more than an order of
magnitude over that expected in the absence of mix.
