Following our previous work on metamaterial high-impedance surfaces made of
Hilbert curve inclusions, here we theoretically explore the performance of the
high-impedance surfaces made of another form of space-filling curve known as
the Peano curve. This metamaterial surface, formed by a 2-D periodic
arrangement of Peano curve inclusions, is located above a conducting ground
plane and is shown to exhibit a high surface impedance surface at certain
specific frequencies. Our numerical study reveals the effect of the iteration
order of the Peano curve, the surface height above the conducting ground plane
and the separation distance between adjacent inclusions.
