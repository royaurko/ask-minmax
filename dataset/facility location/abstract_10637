A vital constituent of a virus is its protein shell, called the viral capsid,
that encapsulates and hence provides protection for the viral genome. Viral
capsids are usually spherical, and for a significant number of viruses exhibit
overall icosahedral symmetry. The corresponding surface lattices, that encode
the locations of the capsid proteins and intersubunit bonds, can be modelled by
Viral Tiling Theory.
  It has been shown in vitro that under a variation of the experimental
boundary conditions, such as the pH value and salt concentration, tubular
particles may appear instead of, or in addition to, spherical ones. In order to
develop models that describe the simultaneous assembly of both spherical and
tubular variants, and hence study the possibility of triggering tubular
malformations as a means of interference with the replication mechanism, Viral
Tiling Theory has to be extended to include tubular lattices with end caps.
This is done here for the case of Papovaviridae, which play a distinguished
role from the viral structural point of view as they correspond to all pentamer
lattices, i.e. lattices formed from clusters of five protein subunits
throughout. These results pave the way for a generalisation of recently
developed assembly models.
