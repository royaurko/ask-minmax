The former Homestake gold mine in Lead, South Dakota is being transformed
into a dedicated laboratory to pursue underground research in rare-process
physics, as well as offering research opportunities in other disciplines such
as biology, geology and engineering. A key component of the Sanford Underground
Research Facility (SURF) is the Davis Campus, which is in operation at the
4850-foot level (4300 m.w.e) and currently hosts three projects: the LUX dark
matter experiment, the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR neutrinoless double-beta decay
experiment and the CUBED low-background counter. Plans for possible future
experiments at SURF are well underway and include long baseline neutrino
oscillation experiments, future dark matter experiments as well as nuclear
astrophysics accelerators. Facility upgrades to accommodate some of these
future projects have already started. SURF is a dedicated facility with
significant expansion capability.
