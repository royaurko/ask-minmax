Recent observations of the Crab pulsar show no evidence for a spectral break
in the infrared regime. It is argued that the observations are consistent with
a power-law spectrum in the whole observable infrared - optical range. This is
taken as the starting point for an evaluation of how self-consistent incoherent
synchrotron models fare in a comparison with observations. Inclusion of
synchrotron self-absorption proves important as does the restriction on the
observed size of the emission region imposed by the relativistic beaming
thought to define the pulse profile. It is shown that the observations can be
used to derive two independent constraints on the distance from the neutron
star to the emission region; in addition to a direct lower limit, an indirect
measure is obtained from an upper limit to the magnetic field strength. Both of
these limits indicate that the emission region is located at a distance
considerably larger than the light cylinder radius. The implications of this
result are discussed and it is emphasized that, in order for standard
incoherent synchrotron models to fit inside the light cylinder, rather special
physical conditions need to be invoked.
