We report on the detection of 43 GHz SiO maser emission in V838 Mon, a
prototype of a new class of eruptive variables, in which a red supergiant was
formed after the nova-like eruption in 2002. The detection of SiO masers
indicates that the star formed after the eruption is indeed a kind of cool
mass-losing object with circumstellar masers. The measured radial velocity and
the intensity of maser emission are consistent with the object being located at
the distance of about 7 kpc from the sun. It also suggests that a considerable
percentage of SiO masing objects in the Galaxy are formed in the same mechanism
as that created V838 Mon.
