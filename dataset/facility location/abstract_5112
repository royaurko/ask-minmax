In this paper, we analyze both the rate of convergence and the performance of
a matched-filter (MF) precoder in a massive multi-user (MU)
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system, with the aim of determining the
impact of distributing the transmit antennas into multiple clusters. We
consider cases of transmit spatial correlation, unequal link gains and
imperfect channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, we derive a MF
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) limit as both the number of
transmit antennas and the number of users tend to infinity. In our results, we
show that both the rate of convergence and performance is strongly dependent on
spatial correlation. In the presence of spatial correlation, distributing the
antennas into multiple clusters renders significant gains over a co-located
antenna array scenario. In uncorrelated scenarios, a co-located antenna cluster
has a marginally better mean per-user SINR performance due to its superior
single-user signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime, i.e., when a user is close to
the base station (BS), the links between the user and all transmit antennas
becomes strong.
