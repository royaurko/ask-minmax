We report the detection of hard X-ray emission (>2 keV) from a number of
point sources associated with the very young massive star-forming region IRAS
19410+2336. The X-ray emission is detected from several sources located around
the central and most deeply embedded mm continuum source, which remains
undetected in the X-ray regime. All X-ray sources have K-band counterparts, and
those likely belonging to the evolving massive cluster show near-infrared
colors in the 2MASS data indicative of pre-main-sequence stages. The X-ray
luminosities around 10^{31} erg/s are at the upper end of luminosities known
for low-mass pre-main-sequence sources, and mass estimates based on the
infrared data indicate that at least some of the X-ray detected sources are
intermediate-mass objects. Therefore, we conclude that the X-ray emission is
due to intermediate-mass pre-main-sequence Herbig Ae/Be stars or their
precursors. The emission process is possibly due to magnetic star-disk
interaction as proposed for their low-mass counterparts.
