We report metallicities and radial velocities derived from spectra at the
near-infrared calcium triplet for 373 red giants in a 200 square arcminute area
at the optical center of the LMC bar. These are the first spectroscopic
abundance measurements of intermediate-age and old field stars in the high
surface brightness heart of the LMC. The metallicity distribution is sharply
peaked at the median value [Fe/H] = -0.40, with a small tail of stars extending
down to [Fe/H] <= -2.1; 10% of the red giants are observed to have [Fe/H] <=
-0.7. The relative lack of metal-poor stars indicates that the LMC has a "G
dwarf" problem, similar to the Milky Way. The abundance distribution can be
closely approximated by two Gaussians containing 89% and 11% of the stars,
respectively: the first component is centered at [Fe/H] = -0.37 with standard
deviation = 0.15, and the second at [Fe/H] = -1.08 with standard deviation =
0.46. Because of the central location of our field, kinematic constraints are
not strong, but there is no evidence that the bar deviates from the general
motion of the LMC disk. The velocity dispersion of the whole sample is 24.7 +/-
0.4 km/sec. The most metal-poor 5% of stars ([Fe/H] < -1.15) show a dispersion
of 40.8 +/- 1.7 km/sec, more than twice the value for the most metal-rich 5%.
The age-metallicity relation (AMR) is almost flat during the period from 5-10
Gyr ago, with an apparent scatter of +/-0.15 dex about the mean metallicity for
a given age. (abstract abridged)
