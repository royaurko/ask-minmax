We present observations of OY Car, obtained with the Anglo-Australian
telescope, during a normal outburst in 1991. Two sinusoidal components are
resolved in the Hbeta trailed spectra and we determine the location of the
narrow component to be on the secondary star with a maximum contributed flux of
~2.5 per cent to the total flux. Imaging of the line distribution reveals that
the other emission component is associated with the gas stream. This follows a
velocity close to the ballistic one from the red star to a distance of ~0.5
R_L1 from the white dwarf. Then. its kinematics changes from 0.5-0.2 R_L1
(accretion disc) following velocities now closer to (but lower than) the
keplerian velocities along the path of the gas stream. We finally dicsuss the
implications of having observed simultaneously line emission from the gas
stream and the red star during outburst.
