In the analysis of large random wireless networks, the underlying node
distribution is almost ubiquitously assumed to be the homogeneous Poisson point
process. In this paper, the node locations are assumed to form a Poisson
clustered process on the plane. We derive the distributional properties of the
interference and provide upper and lower bounds for its CCDF. We consider the
probability of successful transmission in an interference limited channel when
fading is modeled as Rayleigh. We provide a numerically integrable expression
for the outage probability and closed-form upper and lower bounds.We show that
when the transmitter-receiver distance is large, the success probability is
greater than that of a Poisson arrangement. These results characterize the
performance of the system under geographical or MAC-induced clustering. We
obtain the maximum intensity of transmitting nodes for a given outage
constraint, i.e., the transmission capacity (of this spatial arrangement) and
show that it is equal to that of a Poisson arrangement of nodes. For the
analysis, techniques from stochastic geometry are used, in particular the
probability generating functional of Poisson cluster processes, the Palm
characterization of Poisson cluster processes and the Campbell-Mecke theorem.
