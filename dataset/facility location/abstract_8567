We have detected seven stars with a common proper motion which are located
within 2.5 arcminutes of the globular cluster NGC 6522 in the Baade's Window
field of the Galactic bulge. We argue that these stars are members of the
cluster, and derive a weighted mean proper motion and heliocentric radial
velocity of mu_l = 1.4 +/- 0.2 mas/yr, mu_b = -6.2 +/- 0.2 mas/yr, v = -28.5
+/- 6.5 km/s. We rederive the distance to NGC 6522 (0.91 +/- 0.04 R_0, where
R_0 is the Galactocentric distance) and metallicity ([Fe/H] = -1.28 +/- 0.12),
making use of recent revisions in the foreground extinction toward the cluster
(A_V = 1.42 +/- 0.05). We find the spatial velocity of the cluster and conclude
that the cluster stays close to the Galactic center, and may have experienced
significant bulge/disk shocking during its lifetime.
