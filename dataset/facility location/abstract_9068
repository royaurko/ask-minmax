The atmospheric muon and neutrino flux have been simulated using the same
approach which successfully accounted for the recent secondary proton, electron
and positron flux measurements in orbit by the AMS experiment. For the muon
flux, a good agreement is obtained with the CAPRICE and HEAT data for altitudes
ranging from sea level up to about 38 km. The general features of the
calculated atmospheric neutrino flux are reported and discussed. The flux
obtained at the Super-Kamiokande experiment location are reported and compared
with other calculations. For low neutrino energies the flux obtained is
significantly smaller than that used in the data analysis of underground
experiment. The simulation results for the SOUDAN experiment site are also
reported.
