We analyse the model of stochastic re-acceleration of electrons, which are
emitted by supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Galactic Disk and propagate then
into the Galactic halo, in order to explain the origin on nonthermal (radio and
gamma-ray) emission from the Fermi Bubbles (FB). We assume that the energy for
re-acceleration in the halo is supplied by shocks generated by processes of
star accretion onto the central black hole. Numerical simulations show that
regions with strong turbulence (places for electron re-acceleration) are
located high up in the Galactic Halo about several kpc above the disk. The
energy of SNR electrons that reach these regions does not exceed several GeV
because of synchrotron and inverse Compton energy losses. At appropriate
parameters of re-acceleration these electrons can be re-accelerated up to the
energy 10E12 eV which explains in this model the origin of the observed radio
and gamma-ray emission from the FB. However although the model gamma-ray
spectrum is consistent with the Fermi results, the model radio spectrum is
steeper than the observed by WMAP and Planck. If adiabatic losses due to plasma
outflow from the Galactic central regions are taken into account, then the
re-acceleration model nicely reproduces the Planck datapoints.
