The status of the R&D on the Cylindrical-GEM (CGEM) detector foreseen as
Inner Tracker for KLOE-2, the upgrade of the KLOE experiment at the DAFNE
phi-factory, will be presented. The R&D includes several activities: i) the
construction and complete characterization of the full-size CGEM prototype,
equipped with 650 microns pitch 1-D longitudinal strips; ii) the study of the
2-D readout with XV patterned strips and operation in magnetic field (up to
1.5T), performed with small planar prototypes in a dedicated test at the H4-SPS
beam facility; iii) the characterization of the single-mask GEM technology for
the realization of large-area GEM foils.
