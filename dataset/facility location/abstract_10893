Author suggests and researches a new revolutionary idea for a closed-loop
irrigation method. He offers to cover a given site by a thin closed film with
controlled heat conductivity and clarity located at an altitude of 50 300 m.
The film is supported at altitude by small additional atmospheric overpressure
and connected to the ground by thin cables. Authors show that this closed dome
allows full control of the weather in a given region (the day is always fine,
the rain is only at night, no strong winds). The dome (having control of the
clarity of film and heat conductivity) converts the cold regions to subtropics,
hot deserts and desolate wildernesses to prosperous regions with a temperate
climate. This is a realistic and cheap method of evaporation economical
irrigation and virtual weather control on Earth at the current time.
