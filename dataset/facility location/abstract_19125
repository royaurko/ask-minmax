We report the detection of gamma-ray pulsations (> 0.1 GeV) from PSR
J2229+6114 and PSR J1048-5832, the latter having been detected as a
low-significance pulsar by EGRET. Data in the gamma-ray band were acquired by
the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, while the
radio rotational ephemerides used to fold the gamma-ray light curves were
obtained using the Green Bank Telescope, the Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank,
and the Parkes telescope. The two young radio pulsars, located within the error
circles of the previously unidentified EGRET sources 3EG J1048-5840 and 3EG
J2227+6122, present spin-down characteristics similar to the Vela pulsar. PSR
J1048-5832 shows two sharp peaks at phases 0.15 \pm 0.01 and 0.57 \pm 0.01
relative to the radio pulse confirming the EGRET light curve, while PSR
J2229+6114 presents a very broad peak at phase 0.49 \pm 0.01. The gamma-ray
spectra above 0.1 GeV of both pulsars are fit with power laws having
exponential cutoffs near 3 GeV, leading to integral photon fluxes of (2.19 \pm
0.22 \pm 0.32) x 10^{-7} cm^{-2} ^{-1} for PSR J1048-5832 and (3.77 \pm 0.22
\pm 0.44) x 10^{-7} cm^{-2} s^{-1} for PSR J2229+6114. The first uncertainty is
statistical and the second is systematic. PSR J1048-5832 is one of two LAT
sources which were entangled together as 3EG J1048-5840. These detections add
to the growing number of young gamma-ray pulsars that make up the dominant
population of GeV gamma-ray sources in the Galactic plane.
