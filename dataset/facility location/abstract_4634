We study the dynamic generation of spin entanglement between two distant
sites in an XY model with $1/r^{2}$-decay long range couplings. Due to the
linear dispersion relation $\epsilon (k)\sim |k|$ of magnons in such model, we
show that a well-located spin state can be dynamically split into two moving
entangled local wave packets without changing their shapes. Interestingly, when
such two wave packets meet at the diametrically opposite site after the fast
period $\tau =\pi $, the initial well-located state can be recurrent
completely. Numerical calculation is performed to confirm the analytical result
even the ring system of sizes $N$ up to several thousands are considered. The
truncation approximation for the coupling strengths is also studied. Numerical
simulation shows that the above conclusions still hold even the range of the
coupling strength is truncated at a relative shorter scale comparing to the
size of the spin system.
