We calculate in detail the expected properties of low redshift DLA systems
under the assumption that they arise in the gaseous disks of galaxies like
those in the z=0 population. A sample of 355 nearby galaxies is analysed, for
which high quality HI 21-cm emission line maps are available as part of an
extensive survey with the Westerbork telescope (WHISP). We find that expected
luminosities, impact parameters between quasars and DLA host galaxies, and
metal abundances are in good agreement with the observed properties of DLAs and
DLA galaxies. The measured redshift number density of z=0 gas above the DLA
limit is dN/dz=0.045 +/- 0.006, which compared to higher redshift measurements
implies that there is no evolution in the comoving density of DLAs along a line
of sight between z=1.5 and z=0, and a decrease of only a factor of two from z=4
to the present time. We conclude that the local galaxy population can explain
all properties of low redshift DLAs.
