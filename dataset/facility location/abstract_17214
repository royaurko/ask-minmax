Multi--wavelength studies of energetic solar flares with seismic emissions
have revealed interesting common features between them. We studied the first
GOES X--class flare of the 24th solar cycle, as detected by the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO). For context, seismic activity from this flare
(SOL2011-02-15T01:55-X2.2, in NOAA AR 11158) has been reported in the
literature (Kosovichev, 2011; Zharkov et al., 2011). Based on Dopplergram data
from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), we applied standard methods of
local helioseismology in order to identify the seismic sources in this event.
RHESSI hard X-ray data are used to check the correlation between the location
of the seismic sources and the particle precipitation sites in during the
flare. Using HMI magnetogram data, the temporal profile of fluctuations in the
photospheric line-of-sight magnetic field is used to estimate the magnetic
field change in the region where the seismic signal was observed. This leads to
an estimate of the work done by the Lorentz-force transient on the photosphere
of the source region. In this instance this is found to be a significant
fraction of the acoustic energy in the attendant seismic emission, suggesting
that Lorentz forces can contribute significantly to the generation of
sunquakes. However, there are regions in which the signature of the
Lorentz-force is much stronger, but from which no significant acoustic emission
emanates.
