We investigate the dynamical properties of ${\rm Na_2IrO_3}$. For five
effective models proposed for ${\rm Na_2IrO_3}$, we numerically calculate
dynamical structure factors (DSFs) with an exact diagonalization method. An
effective model obtained from $ab$ $initio$ calculations explains inelastic
neutron scattering experiments adequately. We further calculate excitation
modes based on linearized spin-wave theory. The spin-wave excitation of the
effective models obtained by $ab$ $initio$ calculations disagrees with the
low-lying excitation of DSFs. We attribute this discrepancy to the location of
${\rm Na_2IrO_3}$ in a parameter space close to the phase boundary with the
Kitaev spin-liquid phase.
