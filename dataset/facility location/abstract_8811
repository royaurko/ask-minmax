We present a preliminary report on the first deep infrared photometry of
2MASS GC01 and 2MASS GC02 (GC01 and GC02 hereafter) - new Galactic globular
cluster (GC) candidates, discovered by the 2MASS. They both appear to be
genuine disk GCs though highly obscured. The location of the two GCs suggests
that they are metal rich - [Fe/H]~-0.5. We estimated their distance and
reddening using the K_s-band brightness of the red giant branch (RGB) bump, and
J-K_s color of the RGB at M_K=-3 mag: D=3.1+/-0.5, 3.9+/-0.6 kpc, and
A_V=20.9+/-0.7, 17.2+/-1.2 mag, for GC01 and GC02 respectively. Variation in
the metal abundance can change our results within 30-35%.
