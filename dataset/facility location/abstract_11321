A simple molecular model of chiral molecules is presented in this paper : the
chiral dipolar hard sphere model. The discriminatory interaction between
enantiomers is represented by electrostatic (or magnetic) dipoles-dipoles
interactions : short ranged steric repulsion are represented by hard sphere
potential and, in each molecule, two point dipoles are located inside the
sphere. The model is described in detail and some of its elementary properties
are given ; in particular, it is shown that the that the knowledge of only
three multipole spherical components (namely : $Q_{10}$, $Q_{21}$ and $Q_{22}$)
allows to compute all multipole spherical components of the model. Despite, the
simplicity of the model, it is shown also that the energy landscape of the
interaction between two enantiomers is quite rich, this renders systems of
chiral dipolar hard sphere very interesting and complicated to study. Few
preliminary Monte Carlo simulation results are also reported in the paper.
Last, but not least, this paper is dedicated to Jean-Jacques Weis.
