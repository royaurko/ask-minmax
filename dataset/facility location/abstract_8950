We present the results of the spectral investigations of IP Peg in
quiescence. Optical spectra obtained on 6-m telescope at the Special
Astrophysical Observatory (Russia), and on the 3.5-m telescope at the
German-Spanish Astronomical Center (Calar Alto, Spain), have been analysed by
means of Doppler tomography and phase modeling technique. This analysis has
allowed us to make conclusions, that the quiescent accretion disk of IP Peg has
a complicated structure. Equally with the bright spot originated in the region
of interaction between the stream and the disk's particles, there are also
explicit indications of the spiral shocks. We also have found that the
brightness of the bright spot considerably oscillates during orbital period.
The spot becomes brightest at an inferior conjunction. On the contrary, the
spot is almost not visible when it is located on a distant half of the
accretion disk. Apparently, it is connected to an eclipse of the bright spot by
an outer edge of the accretion disk.
