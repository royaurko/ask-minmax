Conductive micro-patterned copper tracks were fabricated by UV direct-writing
of a nanoparticle silver seed layer followed by selective electroless copper
deposition. Silver ions were first incorporated into a hydrolyzed polyimide
surface layer by wet chemical treatment. A photoreactive polymer coating,
methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (MPEG) was coated on top of the substrate prior
to UV irradiation. Electrons released through the interaction between the MPEG
molecules and UV photons allowed the reduction of the silver ions across the
MPEG/doped polyimide interface. The resultant silver seed layer has a cluster
morphology which is suitable for the initiation of electroless plating. Initial
results showed that the deposited copper tracks were in good agreement with the
track width on the photomask and laser direct-writing can also fabricate
smaller line width metal tracks with good accuracy. The facile fabrication
presented here can be carried out in air, at atmospheric pressure, and on
contoured surfaces.
