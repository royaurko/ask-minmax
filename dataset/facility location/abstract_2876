We perform a statistical analysis of measured time series of sea levels at
various coastal locations in the UK, measured at time differences of 15 minutes
over the past 20 years. When the astronomical tide and other deterministic
components are subtracted, a stochastic signal remains which is well-described
by a superstatistical model. We do various tests on the measured time series,
and compare the data of 5 different UK locations. Overall it appears that
$\chi^2$-superstatistics is best suitable to describe the data, in particular
when one looks at the dynamics of sealevel {\em differences} on short time
scales.
