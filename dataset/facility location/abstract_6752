The electronic property of monolayer-bilayer hybrid graphene with a zigzag
interface is studied by both the Dirac equation and numerical calculation.
There are two types of zigzag interface stacks. The dispersion and local
density of states behave quit differently along the interface at the Fermi
energy due to the different locations of the edge state. We hope our study can
give some insights in the understanding of the transport and STM experiments.
