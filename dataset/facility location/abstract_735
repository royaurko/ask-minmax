Following the tentative identification of the blue luminescence in the Red
Rectangle by Vijh et al. (2005), we compute absolute fluxes for the vibrational
IR emission and phosphorescence bands of three small polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons. The calculated IR spectra are compared with available ISO
observations. A subset of the emission bands are predicted to be observable
using presently available facilities, and can be used for an immediate,
independent, discriminating test on their alleged presence in this well-known
astronomical object.
