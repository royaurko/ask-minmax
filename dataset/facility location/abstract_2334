We estimate the dependence of $\nu_{\mu}$ to $\nu_{e}$ conversion on
parameters $\theta_{13}$ and $\delta_{CP}$ for several experimental facilities
studying neutrino oscillations. We use the S-Matrix theory to estimate
$\bar{\nu_e}$ disappearance and compare estimates based on an older theory
being used to extract $\theta_{13}$ from the Double Chooz, Daya Bay, and RENO
data, to assist in extracting an accurate value for $\theta_{13}$ from these
projects. We use values of $\theta_{13}$ within known limits, and estimate the
dependence of $\nu_{\mu}$ - $\nu_{e}$ CP violation (CPV) probability on
$\delta_{CP}$ in order to suggest new experiments to measure CPV for neutrinos
moving in matter.
