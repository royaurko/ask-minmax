The emission of 21-cm radiation from a neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) at
high redshift is discussed in connection with the thermal and ionization
history of the universe. The physical mechanisms that make such radiation
detectable against the cosmic microwave background include Ly_alpha coupling of
the hydrogen spin temperature to the kinetic temperature of the gas and
preheating of the IGM by the first generation of stars and quasars. Three
different signatures are investigated in detail: (a) the fluctuations in the
redshifted 21-cm emission induced by the gas density inhomogeneities that
develop at early times in cold dark matter (CDM) dominated cosmologies; (b) the
sharp absorption feature in the radio sky due to the rapid rise of the Ly_alpha
continuum background that marks the birth of the first UV sources in the
universe; and (c) the 21-cm emission and absorption shells that are generated
on several Mpc scales around the first bright quasars. Future radio
observations with projected facilities like the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope
and the Square Kilometer Array may shed light on the power spectrum of density
fluctuations at z>5, and map the end of the "dark ages", i.e. the transition
from the post-recombination universe to one populated with radiation sources.
