Spontaneous emission and Lamb shift of atoms in absorbing dielectrics are
discussed. A Green's-function approach is used based on the multipolar
interaction Hamiltonian of a collection of atomic dipoles with the quantised
radiation field. The rate of decay and level shifts are determined by the
retarded Green's-function of the interacting electric displacement field, which
is calculated from a Dyson equation describing multiple scattering. The
positions of the atomic dipoles forming the dielectrics are assumed to be
uncorrelated and a continuum approximation is used. The associated unphysical
interactions between different atoms at the same location is eliminated by
removing the point-interaction term from the free-space Green's-function (local
field correction). For the case of an atom in a purely dispersive medium the
spontaneous emission rate is altered by the well-known Lorentz local-field
factor. In the presence of absorption a result different from previously
suggested expressions is found and nearest-neighbour interactions are shown to
be important.
