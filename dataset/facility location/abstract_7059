We show that if m is a probability measure with infinite support on the unit
circle having no singular component and a differentiable weight, then the
corresponding paraorthogonal polynomial P_n(z;B) solves an explicit second
order linear differential equation. We also show that if T and B are distinct,
then the pair {P_n(z;B),P_n(z;T)} solves an explicit first order linear system
of differential equations. One can use these differential equations to deduce
that the zeros of every paraorthogonal polynomial mark the locations of a set
of particles that are in electrostatic equilibrium with respect to a particular
external field.
