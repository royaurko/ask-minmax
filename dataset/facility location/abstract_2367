This article discusses an efficient implementation of tensors of arbitrary
rank by using some of the idioms introduced by the recently published C++ ISO
Standard (C++11). With the aims at providing a basic building block for
high-performance computing, a single Array class template is carefully crafted,
from which vectors, matrices, and even higher-order tensors can be created. An
expression template facility is also built around the array class template to
provide convenient mathematical syntax. As a result, by using templates, an
extra high-level layer is added to the C++ language when dealing with algebraic
objects and their operations, without compromising performance. The
implementation is tested running on both CPU and GPU.
