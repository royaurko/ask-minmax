We study the temperature structure of the rich cluster of galaxies Abell 1367
using two independent methods of correcting for the ASCA PSF. The results of
the two methods are in excellent agreement and give solid evidence of a strong
and localized shock in the intracluster medium (ICM). Our analysis suggests
that we are observing the merger of two subclusters. We find that the lower
luminosity subcluster, located to the northwest, has a higher temperature of
4.2 +/- 0.3 keV, compared to the more luminous southeast subcluster, whose
temperature is 3.2 +/- 0.1 keV. An analysis of the ROSAT surface brightness
profiles of both subclusters is also presented. The data agree well with
predictions from numerical simulations of mergers between subcluster sized
masses, in particular, with early stages of the merger, prior to the first core
passage.
