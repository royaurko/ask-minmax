Using the Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy 0.6 meter
telescope located at Cerro Tololo, we searched for variable stars in the
southern globular cluster NGC 6584. We obtained images during 8 nights between
28 May and 6 July of 2011. After processing the images, we used the image
subtraction package ISIS developed by Alard (2000)to search for the variable
stars. We identified a total of 69 variable stars in our 10x10 arcmin^2 field,
including 43 variables cataloged by Millis & Liller (1980) and 26 hereto
unknown variables. In total, we classified 46 of the variables as type RRab,
with a mean period of 0.56776 days, 15 as type RRc with a mean period of
0.30886 days, perhaps one lower amplitude type RRe, with a period of 0.26482
days, 4 eclipsing binaries, and 3 long period (P > 2 days) variable stars. As
many as 15 of the RRab Lyrae stars exhibited the Blazhko Effect. Furthermore,
the mean periods of the RR Lyrae types, the exhibited period/amplitude
relationship, and the ratio of N_c/(N_ab+N_c) of 0.25 are consistent with an
Oosterhoff Type I cluster. Here we present refined periods, V-band light
curves, and classifications for each of the 69 variables, as well as a
color-magnitude diagram of the cluster.
