The availability of big data on human activity is currently changing the way
we look at our surroundings. With the high penetration of mobile phones, nearly
everyone is already carrying a high-precision sensor providing an opportunity
to monitor and analyze the dynamics of human movement on unprecedented scales.
In this article, we present a technique and visualization tool which uses
aggregated activity measures of mobile networks to gain information about human
activity shaping the structure of the cities. Based on ten months of mobile
network data, activity patterns can be compared through time and space to
unravel the "city's pulse" as seen through the specific signatures of different
locations. Furthermore, the tool allows classifying the neighborhoods into
functional clusters based on the timeline of human activity, providing valuable
insights on the actual land use patterns within the city. This way, the
approach and the tool provide new ways of looking at the city structure from
historical perspective and potentially also in real-time based on dynamic
up-to-date records of human behavior. The online tool presents results for four
global cities: New York, London, Hong Kong and Los Angeles.
