Textile storm surge barriers, sited at multiple locations, are literally
extensions of the city world famous urban fabric - another manifestation of the
dominance of the City over local Nature. Textile Storm Surge Barriers (TSSB)
are intended to preserve the City from North Atlantic Ocean hurricanes that
cause sea waves impacting the densely populated and high-value real estate,
instigating catastrophic, and possibly long-term, infrastructure and monetary
losses. Complicating TSSB installation macroproject planning is the presence of
the Hudson and other rivers, several small tidal straits, future climate change
and other factors. We conclude that TSSB installations made of homogeneous
construction materials are worthwhile investigating because they may be less
expensive to build, and more easily replaced following any failure, than
concrete and steel storm surge barriers, which are also made of homogeneous
materials. We suppose the best macroproject outcome will develop in the perfect
Macro-engineering planning way and at the optimum time-of-need during the very
early 21st Century by, among other groups, the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey. TSSB technology is a practical advance over wartime harbor
anti-submarine/anti-torpedo steel nets and rocky Churchill Barriers.
