The Chinese Small Telescope ARray (CSTAR) is a group of four identical, fully
automated, static 14.5 cm telescopes. CSTAR is located at Dome A, Antarctica
and covers 20 square degree of sky around the South Celestial Pole. The
installation is designed to provide high-cadence photometry for the purpose of
monitoring the quality of the astronomical observing conditions at Dome A and
detecting transiting exoplanets. CSTAR has been operational since 2008, and has
taken a rich and high-precision photometric data set of 10,690 stars. In the
first observing season, we obtained 291,911 qualified science frames with
20-second integrations in the i-band. Photometric precision reaches about 4
mmag at 20-second cadence at i=7.5, and is about 20 mmag at i=12. Using robust
detection methods, ten promising exoplanet candidates were found. Four of these
were found to be giants using spectroscopic follow-up. All of these transit
candidates are presented here along with the discussion of their detailed
properties as well as the follow-up observations.
