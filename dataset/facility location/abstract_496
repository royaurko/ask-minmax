In this paper we revisit the calculation of the emittance dilution of charged
particle bunches due to collimator wakefield effects in the paraxial
approximation. We also compare analytical results with numerical simulations
considering the example of a collimator structure installed in the Accelerator
Test Facility 2 (ATF2) at KEK
