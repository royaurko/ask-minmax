Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have provided Thomas Jefferson
National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) with versatile VME-based data
acquisition and control interfaces with minimal development times. FPGA designs
have been used to interface to VME and provide control logic for numerous
systems. The building blocks of these logic designs can be tailored to the
individual needs of each system and provide system operators with read-backs
and controls via a VME interface to an EPICS based computer. This versatility
allows the system developer to choose components and define operating
parameters and options that are not readily available commercially. Jefferson
Lab has begun developing standard FPGA libraries that result in quick turn
around times and inexpensive designs.
