We present the results of CO (J=3-2) and CO (J=1-0) mapping observations
toward the active cluster forming clump, L1688, in the rho Ophiuchi molecular
cloud. From the CO (J=3-2) and CO (J=1-0) data cubes, we identify five
outflows, whose driving sources are VLA 1623, EL 32, LFAM 26, EL 29, and IRS
44. Among the identified outflows, the most luminous outflow is the one from
the prototypical Class 0 source, VLA 1623. We also discover that the EL 32
outflow located in the Oph B2 region has very extended blueshifted and
redshifted lobes with wide opening angles. This outflow is most massive and
have the largest momentum among the identified outflows in the CO (J=1-0) map.
We estimate the total energy injection rate due to the molecular outflows
identified by the present and previous studies to be about 0.2 L_solar, larger
than or at least comparable to the turbulence dissipation rate [~(0.03 - 0.1)
L_solar]. Therefore, we conclude that the protostellar outflows are likely to
play a significant role in replenishing the supersonic turbulence in this
clump.
