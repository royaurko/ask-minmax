This paper contains a catlog of sources observed in a portion of the Hubble
Deep Field by the NICMOS instrument. Methods of observation and data analysis
are discussed. The catalog has two parts. The first is a listing of all sources
with signal to noise ratios greater than or equal to 2.5. The second part
contains sources with signal to noise ratios less than 2.5. The second part is
intended for researchers who wish to know the limits to which sources may
appear at a location.
