In this paper, we analyze the feasibility of indoor broadband service
provisioning using secondary spectrum access to the 960-1215 MHz band,
primarily allocated to the distance measuring equipment (DME) system for
aeronautical navigation. We propose a practical secondary sharing scheme
customized to the characteristics of the DME. Since the primary system performs
a safety-of-life functionality, protection from harmful interference becomes
extremely critical. The proposed scheme controls aggregate interference by
imposing an individual interference threshold on the secondary users. We
examine the feasibility of large scale secondary access in terms of the
transmission probability of the secondary users that keeps the probability of
harmful interference below a given limit. Uncertainties in the estimation of
propagation loss and DME location affect the feasibility of the secondary
access. Numerical results show that large number of secondary users are able to
operate in adjacent DME channels without harming the primary system even with
limited accuracy in the estimation of the propagation loss.
