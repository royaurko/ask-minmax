We demonstrate that assuming the "discrete" vacuum geometry in the
Minkowskian Higgs model with vacuum BPS monopole solutions can justify the
Dirac fundamental quantization of that model. The important constituent of this
quantization is getting various rotary effects, including collective solid
rotations inside the physical BPS monopole vacuum, and just assuming the
"discrete" vacuum geometry seems to be that thing able to justify these rotary
effects. More precisely, assuming the "discrete" geometry for the appropriate
vacuum manifold implies the presence of thread topological defects (side by
side with point hedgehog topological defects and walls between different
topological domains) inside this manifold in the shape of specific
(rectilinear) threads: gauge and Higgs fields located in the spatial region
intimately near the axis $z$ of the chosen (rest) reference frame. This serves
as the source of collective solid rotations proceeding inside the BPS monopole
vacuum suffered the Dirac fundamental quantization. It will be argued that
indeed the first-order phase transition occurs in the Minkowskian Higgs model
with vacuum BPS monopoles quantized by Dirac. This comes to the coexistence of
two thermodynamic phases inside the appropriate BPS monopole vacuum. There are
the thermodynamic phases of collective solid rotations and superfluid potential
motions.
