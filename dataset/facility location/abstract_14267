We report on an eruption involving a relatively rare filament-filament
interaction on 2013 June 21, observed by SDO and STEREO-B. The two filaments
were separated in height within AR 11777. The onset of the eruption of the
lower filament was accompanied simultaneously by the apparent descent of the
upper filament resulting in a convergence and direct interaction of the two
filaments. The interaction was accompanied by the heating of plasmas
surrounding the upper filament and the subsequent coalescence of the filaments
into a magnetically complex structure, whose eruption was associated with an
M2.9 class solar flare. Magnetic loop shrinkage and descending dark voids were
observed at different locations as part of the large flare energy release
giving us a unique insight into these dynamic flare phenomena.
