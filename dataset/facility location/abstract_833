In an experiment at the SISSI/LISE3 facility of GANIL, the most proton-rich
zinc isotopes 55,56Zn have been observed for the first time. The experiment was
performed using a high-intensity 58Ni beam at 74.5 MeV/nucleon impinging on a
nickel target. The identification of 55,56Zn opens the way to 54Zn, a good
candidate for two-proton radioactivity according to theoretical predictions.
