World Wide Web consists of more than 50 billion pages online. It is highly
dynamic i.e. the web continuously introduces new capabilities and attracts many
people. Due to this explosion in size, the effective information retrieval
system or search engine can be used to access the information. In this paper we
have proposed the EPOW (Effective Performance of WebCrawler) architecture. It
is a software agent whose main objective is to minimize the overload of a user
locating needed information. We have designed the web crawler by considering
the parallelization policy. Since our EPOW crawler has a highly optimized
system it can download a large number of pages per second while being robust
against crashes. We have also proposed to use the data structure concepts for
implementation of scheduler & circular Queue to improve the performance of our
web crawler.
