A pioneering experiment in Lambda hypernuclear spectroscopy, undertaken at
the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jlab), was recently
reported. The experiment used the high- precision, continuous electron beam at
Jlab, and a special arrangement of spectrometer magnets to measure the spectrum
from {nat}C and 7Li targets using the (e,e' K+)reaction. The 12B hypernuclear
spectrum was previously published. This experiment is now reported in more
detail, with improved results for the 12B hypernuclear spectrum. In addition,
unpublished results of the 7He hypernuclear spectrum are also shown. This later
spectrum indicates the need for a more detailed few-body calculation of the
hypernucleus and the reaction process. The success of this experiment
demonstrates that the (e,e'K+) reaction can be effectively used as a high
resolution tool to study hypernuclear spectra, ant its use should be vigorously
pursued.
