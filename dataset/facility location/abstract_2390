In analogy to the f_0(500), which appears as a $\pi \pi $ resonance in chiral
unitary theory, and the f_0(980), which appears as a quasibound $K \bar K$
state, the extension of this approach to the charm sector also predicts a
quasibound $D \bar D $ state with mass around 3720 MeV, named as X(3700), for
which some experimental support is seen in the $e^+ e^- \to J/\psi D \bar D $
reaction close to the $D \bar D $ threshold. In the present work we propose
three different experiments to observe it as a clear peak. The first one is the
radiative decay of the $\psi(3770)$, $\psi(3770) \to \gamma X(3700) \to \gamma
\eta \eta '$. The second one proposes the analogous reaction $\psi(4040) \to
\gamma X(3700) \to \gamma \eta \eta '$ and the third reaction is the $e^+ e^-
\to J/\psi X(3700) \to J/\psi \eta \eta '$. Neat peaks are predicted for all
the reactions and the calculated rates are found within measurable range in
present facilities.
