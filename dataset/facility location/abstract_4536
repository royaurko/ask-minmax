Boundary conditions for unconventional superconducting order parameter are
obtained on the basis of a microscopic theory. The upper critical field in a
superconducting film is examined for unconventional superconductors with
two-component order parameter and is compared with the case of accidental
degeneracy. It is shown, that for both cases temperature dependences of the
upper critical field in a superconducting film may depend substantially on the
quality of boundaries, and under certain conditions have a kink due to the
influence of film boundaries. The location of a kink point appears to be
dependent on a film thickness. If for a massive sample there is another reason
for the existance of a kink, the interplay of the reasons may lead to a
specific behaviour of a kink point location as a function of a temperature or a
film thickness. A new test is suggested permitting to distinguish between
$E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ types of pairing in a hexagonal superconductor near $T_c$.
