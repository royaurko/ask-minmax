Wind Energy is a useful resource for Renewable energy purpose. Wind speed
plays a vital role for wind energy calculation of certain location. So, it is
very much necessary to know the wind speed data characteristics. In this paper
fourier and wavelet transform are applied to study the wind speed data. We have
compared wind speed of winter with summer by taking their speed into account
using various discrete wavelets namely Haar and Daubechies-4 (Db-4). Also the
periodicity of wind speed is checked using Continuous Wavelet Transform (MCWT)
like Morlet. Thereafter a comparative study is done for detecting the
periodicity of both summer and winter. Then wavelet coherence is checked
between these two data for extracting the phase coherency information.
