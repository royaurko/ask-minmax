Observations of high energy gamma rays recently revealed a persistent source
in spatial coincidence with the binary system Eta Carinae. Since modulation of
the observed gamma-ray flux on orbital time scales has not been reported so
far, an unambiguous identification was hitherto not possible. Particularly the
observations made by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) posed additional
questions regarding the actual emission scenario owing to the existence of two
energetically distinct components in the gamma-ray spectrum of this source,
best described by an exponentially cutoff power-law function (CPL) at energies
below 10 GeV and a power-law (PL) component dominant at higher energies. The
increased exposure in conjunction with the improved instrumental response
functions of the LAT now allow us to perform a more detailed investigation of
location, spectral shape, and flux time history of the observed gamma-ray
emission.
  For the first time, we are able to report a weak but regular flux decrease
over time. This can be understood and interpreted in a colliding-wind binary
scenario for orbital modulation of the gamma-ray emission. We find the spectral
shape of the gamma-ray signal in agreement with a single emitting particle
population in combination with significant absorption by gamma-gamma pair
production.
  Studying the correlation of the flux decrease with the orbital separation of
the binary components allows us to predict the behaviour up to the next
periastron passage in 2014.
