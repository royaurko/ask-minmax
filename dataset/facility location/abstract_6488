We present a simple lattice model showing a glassy behavior. $R$ matrix
analysis predicts critical termination of the super-cooled fluid branch at
density $\rho_g=0.1717$. This prediction is confirmed by dynamical numerical
simulations, showing power-law divergences of relaxation time $\tau_{1/2}$, as
well as the 4-susceptibility $\chi_4$ peak's location and height exactly at the
predicted density. The power-law divergence of $\chi_4$ continues up to
$\chi_4$ as high as $10^4$. Finite-size scaling study reveals divergence of
correlation length accompanying the transition.
