Extending our previous work on 2D growth for the Laplace equation we study
here {\it multidimensional} growth for {\it arbitrary elliptic} equations,
describing inhomogeneous and anisotropic pattern formations processes. We find
that these nonlinear processes are governed by an infinite number of
conservation laws. Moreover, in many cases {\it all dynamics of the interface
can be reduced to the linear time--dependence of only one ``moment" $M_0$}
which corresponds to the changing volume while {\it all higher moments, $M_l$,
are constant in time. These moments have a purely geometrical nature}, and thus
carry information about the moving shape. These conserved quantities (eqs.~(7)
and (8) of this article) are interpreted as coefficients of the multipole
expansion of the Newtonian potential created by the mass uniformly occupying
the domain enclosing the moving interface. Thus the question of how to recover
the moving shape using these conserved quantities is reduced to the classical
inverse potential problem of reconstructing the shape of a body from its
exterior gravitational potential. Our results also suggest the possibility of
controlling a moving interface by appropriate varying the location and strength
of sources and sinks.
