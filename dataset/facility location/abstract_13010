Computational ghost imaging retrieves the spatial information of a scene
using a single pixel detector. By projecting a series of known random patterns
and measuring the back reflected intensity for each one, it is possible to
reconstruct a 2D image of the scene. In this work we overcome previous
limitations of computational ghost imaging and capture the 3D spatial form of
an object by using several single pixel detectors in different locations. From
each detector we derive a 2D image of the object that appears to be illuminated
from a different direction, using only a single digital projector as
illumination. Comparing the shading of the images allows the surface gradient
and hence the 3D form of the object to be reconstructed. We compare our result
to that obtained from a stereo- photogrammetric system utilizing multiple high
resolution cameras. Our low cost approach is compatible with consumer
applications and can readily be extended to non-visible wavebands.
