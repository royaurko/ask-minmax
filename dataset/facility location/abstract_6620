We have investigated temperature and magnetic-field dependence of dielectric
properties in the orthorhombic GdMnO$_3$ single crystal which is located near
the phase boundary between the ferroelectric/spiral-antiferromagnetic phase and
the paraelectric/$A$-type-antiferromagnetic one. In this compound, strong phase
competition between these two phases results in a unique phase diagram with
large temperature and magnetic-field hystereses. Based on the phase diagram, we
have successfully demonstrated the persistent and reversible phase switching
between them by application of magnetic fields.
