In this talk I discuss two types of experiments with exotic nuclei which
could be performed at the forthcoming Italian INFN facilities with radioactive
beams. First I will discuss nuclear and Coulomb breakup experiments which
involve heavy exotic beams and intermediate incident energies, thus being
suited for the LNL-SPES proposed facility. Then I will discuss transfer to the
continuum reactions aiming at performing spectroscopy in the continuum of light
unbound nuclei like $^{10}$Li. Such reactions are best matched if the incident
beam energy is very low, as it will be at the LNS-EXCYT facility.
