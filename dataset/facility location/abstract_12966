Marangoni propulsion is a form of locomotion wherein an asymmetric release of
surfactant by a body located at the surface of a liquid leads to its directed
motion. We present in this paper a mathematical model for Marangoni propulsion
in the viscous regime. We consider the case of a thin rigid circular disk
placed at the surface of a viscous fluid and whose perimeter has a prescribed
concentration of an insoluble surfactant, to which the rest of its surface is
impenetrable. Assuming a linearized equation of state between surface tension
and surfactant concentration, we derive analytically the surfactant, velocity
and pressure fields in the asymptotic limit of low Capillary, Peclet and
Reynolds numbers. We then exploit these results to calculate the Marangoni
propulsion speed of the disk. Neglecting the stress contribution from Marangoni
flows is seen to over-predict the propulsion speed by 50%.
