We present a multi-wavelength photometric study of individual stars in M83
based on observations taken as part of the WFC3 Early Release Science (ERS)
program. The central region of M83 has been imaged in seven broad-band filters
to obtain multi-wavelength coverage from the near-UV to near-IR. We use four
filters- F336W, F438W, F555W, and F814W-to measure the UBVI photometric colors
and intrinsic luminosity for ~10,000 stars. These measurements are used to
determine the recent (< 1 Gyr) star formation history of M83. We selected 50
regions in the spiral arm and the inter-arm area of M83 and categorize them
based on their H? morphology. To determine ages of stars in each region, the
color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) and the color-color diagrams were used with the
Padova isochrones with a metallicity of Z=0.03 (1.5 Z{\odot}). We correct the
foreground and internal extinction of individual stars using the reddening-free
Q parameter and improve our age estimates of stars from the isochrone fitting
on the CMDs. Comparisons of stellar ages and cluster ages based on both their
H? morphology and their spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting were made
and show fairly good correlations. We also find that the regions with ages
determined younger than 10 Myr are located preferentially along the active
star-forming regions on the spiral arm.
