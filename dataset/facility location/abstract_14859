We report the discovery of nineteen new HI shells in the Southern Galactic
Plane Survey (SGPS). These shells, which range in radius from 40 pc to 1 kpc,
were found in the low resolution Parkes portion of the SGPS dataset, covering
Galactic longitudes l=253 deg to l=358 deg. Here we give the properties of
individual shells, including positions, physical dimensions, energetics,
masses, and possible associations. We also examine the distribution of these
shells in the Milky Way and find that several of the shells are located between
the spiral arms of the Galaxy. We offer possible explanations for this effect,
in particular that the density gradient away from spiral arms, combined with
the many generations of sequential star formation required to create large
shells, could lead to a preferential placement of shells on the trailing edges
of spiral arms. Spiral density wave theory is used in order to derive the
magnitude of the density gradient behind spiral arms. We find that the density
gradient away from spiral arms is comparable to that out of the Galactic plane
and therefore suggest that this may lead to exaggerated shell expansion away
from spiral arms and into interarm regions.
