We present a theoretical model for the ionized disk in M87 which includes
spiral shock waves. The line emission profiles computed from this model at
various positions on the disk are found to be in agreement with the recent
Hubble Space Telescope results. Based on this model, we find that the ionized
disk comprises two-armed giant spiral shock waves which extend from around
$0.1$ arc sec from the center to at least $1$ arc second or more. Our model
requires that the mass of the black hole be $(4 \pm 0.2) \times 10^9 M_\odot$
and the inclination angle to be $(42\pm 2)^{\deg}$. We predict the nature of
the line profiles at many other locations of the disk which could be verified
in future observations.
