A model of nonlinear optical system surrounded by two loops of feedback is
investigated. The cell with the vapor of rubidium - type atoms is taken in the
capacity of nonlinear element. Two modes of near-resonant electromagnetic field
interacting with the cell are involved in the feedback. Two-dimensional optical
bistability domain in location of input field intensities is obtained and
dependence of its form and magnitude from the system parameters (photon
detunings, feedback factor etc.) is investigated. "Input - output" relations
corresponding to different trajectories in the bistability domain are obtained.
Cross-hysteresis is studied.
