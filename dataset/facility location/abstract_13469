The knowledge of atmospheric parameters -- such as temperature, pressure, and
humidity -- is very important for a proper reconstruction of air showers,
especially with the fluorescence technique. The Global Data Assimilation System
(GDAS) provides altitude-dependent profiles of these state variables of the
atmosphere and several more. Every three hours, a new data set on 23 constant
pressure level plus an additional surface values is available for the entire
globe. These GDAS data are now used in the standard air shower reconstruction
of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The validity of the data was verified by
comparisons with monthly models that were averaged from on-site meteorological
radio soundings and weather station measurements obtained at the Observatory in
Malarg\"ue. Comparisons of reconstructions using the GDAS data and the monthly
models are also presented. Since GDAS is a global model, the data can
potentially be used for other cosmic and gamma ray detectors. Several studies
were already performed or are underway for several locations worldwide. As an
example, a study performed in Colorado as part of an Atmospheric R&D for a
possible future cosmic ray observatory is presented.
