The motivations for simulating QCD thermodynamics with Wilson fermions and a
twisted mass term are introduced. The twisted mass approach provides a natural
infrared cutoff and O(a) improvement at maximal twist, and can be extended to
finite temperature. Our strategy for exploring the QCD phase diagram at finite
temperature in this setup, while taking advantage of the results at T=0, is
explained. The first results for the order parameters and susceptibilities on a
16^3 x 8 lattice are presented. All dynamical simulations are carried out on
the apeNEXT facility in Rome.
