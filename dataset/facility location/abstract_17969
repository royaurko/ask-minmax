This document describes the DIR net, a distributed environment which is part
of the EFTOS fault tolerance framework. The DIR net is a system consisting of
two components, called DIR Manager (or, shortly, the manager) and DIR Backup
Agent (shortly, the backup). One manager and a set of backups is located in the
system to be `guarded', one component per node. At this point the DIR net
weaves a web which substantially does two things: 1) makes itself tolerant to a
number of possible faults, and 2) gathers information pertaining the run of the
user application. As soon as an error occurs within the DIR net, the system
executes built-in recovery actions that allow itself to continue processing
despite a number of hardware/software faults, possibly doing a graceful
degradation of its features; when an error occurs in the user application, the
DIR net, by means of custom- and user-defined detection tools, is informed of
such events and runs one or more recovery strategies, both built-in and coded
by the user using an ancillary compile-time tool, the rl translator. Such tools
translates the user-defined strategies into a binary `R-code', i.e., a
pseudo-code interpreted by a special component of the DIR net, the Recovery
Interpreter, rint (in a sense, rint is a r-code virtual machine.) This document
describes the generic component of the DIR net, a function which can behave
either as manager or as backup.
