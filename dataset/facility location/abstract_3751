The study of neutron cross sections for elements used as efficient
``absorbers'' of ultracold neutrons (UCN) is crucial for many precision
experiments in nuclear and particle physics, cosmology and gravity. In this
context, ``absorption'' includes both the capture and upscattering of neutrons
to the energies above the UCN energy region. The available data, especially for
hydrogen, do not agree between themselves or with the theory. In this report we
describe measurements performed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory UCN
facility of the UCN upscattering cross sections for vanadium and for hydrogen
in CH$_2$ using simultaneous measurements of the radiative capture cross
sections for these elements. We measured $\sigma_{up}=1972\pm130$ b for
hydrogen in CH$_2$, which is below theoretical expectations, and $\sigma_{up} <
25\pm9$ b for vanadium, in agreement with the expectation for the neutron
heating by thermal excitations in solids.
