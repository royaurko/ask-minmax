In the present paper a self-consistent theory, interpreting the VERITAS
observations of the very high energy pulsed emission from the Crab pulsar is
considered. The photon spectrum between 10MeV and 400GeV can be described by
two power-law functions with the spectral indexes equal to 2 and 3.8. The
source of the pulsed emission above 10MeV is assumed to be the synchrotron
radiation, which is generated near the light cylinder during the quasi-linear
stage of the cyclotron instability. The emitting particles are the primary beam
electrons with the Lorentz factors up to $10^{9}$. Such high energies by beam
particles is supposed to be reached due to Landau damping of the centrifugally
induced Langmuir waves. This mechanism provides simultaneous generation of low
(radio) and high energy (10MeV-400GeV) emission on the light cylinder scales,
in one location of the pulsar magnetosphere.
