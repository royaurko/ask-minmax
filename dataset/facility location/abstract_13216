We make a comprehensive study of HI absorption toward HII regions located
within Galactic longitudes less than 10 degrees. Structures in the extreme
inner Galaxy are traced using the longitude-velocity space distribution of this
absorption. We find significant HI absorption associated with the Near and Far
3kpc Arms, the Connecting Arm, Banias Clump 1 and the H I Tilted Disk. We also
constrain the line of sight distances to HII regions, by using HI absorption
spectra together with the HII region velocities measured by radio recombination
lines.
