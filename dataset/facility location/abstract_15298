Scattering by interstellar dust grains can produce time variable X-ray halos
around gamma-ray bursts (GRB). In particular, an X-ray expanding ring is
expected when a short pulse of X-ray radiation is scattered by a narrow layer
of dust in our Galaxy. We present a new method to detect and analyze dust
scattering expanding rings around gamma-ray bursts, using as an example
XMM-Newton data of GRB 031203. Consistent with previous reports (Vaughan et al.
2004), we find that the two expanding rings observed in this burst are due to
dust unevenly distributed in two layers at distances of 870 and 1384 pc, with
the more distant one responsible for 70% of the total optical depth. Our
modelling of the rings indicates that the prompt X-ray emission of GRB 031203
was consistent with a power law spectrum with photon index $\Gamma$=2.1$\pm$0.2
and 1-2 keV fluence of (3.6$\pm$0.2)$\times10^{-7}$ erg cm$^{-2}$. Thanks to
the sensitivity of our technique, we discovered an expanding ring around
another burst recently observed with XMM-Newton, GRB 050713A. In this case the
dust layer is located at a distance of 364 pc and we derive a GRB fluence of
(1.2$\pm$0.3)$\times10^{-7}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ (1-2 keV). A search for similar
halos in other twelve bursts observed with XMM-Newton gave negative results.
