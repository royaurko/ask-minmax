We study the possibility to constrain the hidden strangeness content of the
nucleon by means of the polarization observables in phi meson
electroproduction. We consider the OZI evading direct knockout mechanism that
arises from the non-vanishing s\bar{s} sea quark admixture of the nucleon as
well as the background of the dominant diffractive and the one-boson-exchange
processes. Large sensitivity on the nucleon strangeness are found in several
beam-target and beam-recoil double polarization observables. The small \sqrt{s}
and W region, which is accesible at some of the current high-energy electron
facilities, is found to be the optimal energy region for extracting out the OZI
evasion process.
