This paper suggests a full protocol of Computer Aided Surgery as previously
recommended in literature addressing the challenging task of primary or
secondary reconstruction of orbito-zygomatic dislocation. First, on a
specifically developed planning software, the best zygoma reduction and orbital
boundaries reconstruction to achieve skeletal symmetry are determined. This
treatment plan is then transferred to the 3D Navigation Systems within the
operating room. After patient's anatomy registration to his preoperative CT
scan data, the navigation system allows zygomatic guiding to its planned
reduced location and bone orbital volume restoration control. The feasibility
of this technique was checked in 3 patients with major orbito-zygomatic
deformities. Preliminary clinical results are presented.
