We propose the idea of a "spinguide", i.e. the semiconductor channel which is
surrounded with walls from the diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS) with the
giant Zeeman splitting which are transparent for electrons with the one spin
polarization only. These spinguides may serve as sources of a spin-polarized
current in non-magnetic conductors, ultrafast switches of a spin polarization
of an electric current and, long distances transmission facilities of a spin
polarization (transmission distances can exceed a spin-flip length). The
selective transparence of walls leads to new size effects in transport.
