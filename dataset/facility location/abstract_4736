We present JHK near-infrared photometric study for the old open cluster (OC)
Trumpler 5 (Tr 5), based on the 2MASS data. From the color-magnitude diagrams
of Tr 5, we have located the position of the red giant clump (RGC) stars, and
used the mean magnitude of the RGC stars in K-band to estimate the distance to
Tr 5, d = 3.1 +/- 0.1 kpc ((m-M)_0 = 12.46 +/- 0.04). From fitting the
theoretical isochrones of Padova group, we have estimated the reddening,
metallicity, and age : E(B-V) = 0.64 +/- 0.05, [Fe/H] = -0.4 +/- 0.1 dex, and t
=2.8 +/- 0.2 Gyr (log t=9.45 +/- 0.04), respectively. These parameters
generally agree well with those obtained from the previous studies on Tr 5 and
confirms that this cluster is an old OC with metallicity being metal-poorer
than solar abundance, located in the anti-Galactic center region.
