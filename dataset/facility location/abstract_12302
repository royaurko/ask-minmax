We collected the existing data on the distances and radial velocities of
galaxies around the Local Void in the Aquila/Hercules to examine the peculiar
velocity field induced by its underdensity. A sample of 1056 galaxies with
distances measured from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch, the Cepheid
luminosity, the SNIa luminosity, the surface brightness fluctuation method, and
the Tully-Fisher relation has been used for this purpose. The amplitude of
outflow is found to be ~300 km/s. The galaxies located within the void produce
the mean intra-void number density about 1/5 of the mean external number
density of galaxies. The void's population has a lower luminosity and a later
morphological type with the medians: M_B = -15.7^m and T = 8 (Sdm),
respectively.
