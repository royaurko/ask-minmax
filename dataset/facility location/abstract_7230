The five millisecond pulsars that inhabit NGC 6752 display locations or
accelerations that are quite unusual compared to all other pulsars known in
globular clusters. In particular PSR-A, a binary pulsar, lives in the cluster
halo, while PSR-B and PSR-E, located in the core, show remarkably high negative
spin derivatives. This is suggestive that some uncommon dynamical process is at
play in the cluster core that we attribute to the presence of a massive
perturber. We here investigate whether a single intermediate-mass black hole,
lying on the extrapolation of the Mass versus Sigma relation observed in galaxy
spheroids, or a less massive binary consisting of two black holes could play
the requested role. To this purpose we simulated binary-binary encounters
involving PSR-A, its companion star, and the black hole(s). Various scenarios
are discussed in detail. In our close 4-body encounters, a black hole-black
hole binary may attract on a long-term stable orbit a millisecond pulsar.
Timing measurements on the captured satellite-pulsar, member of a hierarchical
triplet, could unambiguously unveil the presence of a black hole(s) in the core
of a globular cluster.
