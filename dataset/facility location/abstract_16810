The effects of bond randomness on the phase diagram and critical behavior of
the square lattice ferromagnetic Blume-Capel model are discussed. The system is
studied in both the pure and disordered versions by the same efficient
two-stage Wang-Landau method for many values of the crystal field, restricted
here in the second-order phase transition regime of the pure model. For the
random-bond version several disorder strengths are considered. We present phase
diagram points of both pure and random versions and for a particular disorder
strength we locate the emergence of the enhancement of ferromagnetic order
observed in an earlier study in the ex-first-order regime. The critical
properties of the pure model are contrasted and compared to those of the random
model. Accepting, for the weak random version, the assumption of the double
logarithmic scenario for the specific heat we attempt to estimate the range of
universality between the pure and random-bond models. The behavior of the
strong disorder regime is also discussed and a rather complex and yet not fully
understood behavior is observed. It is pointed out that this complexity is
related to the ground-state structure of the random-bond version.
