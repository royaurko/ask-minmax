We have estimated the number flux of of mu-neutrinos which are produced due
to the hadronic interactions between the cosmic rays coming from a neutron star
and the matter in a companion star. The event rate at 1 km^2 detectors of
high-energy neutrinos such as ICECUBE, ANTARES and NESTOR is also estimated to
be 2.7 \times 10^4 events yr^-1 when the source is located at 10 kpc away from
the Earth. We have estimated the number of such a system and concluded that
there will be several candidates in our galaxy. Taking these results into
consideration, this scenario is promising and will be confirmed by the future
observations.
