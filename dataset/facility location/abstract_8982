We present results from an analysis of two Chandra observations of the rich,
nearby galaxy cluster Abell 2199. We find evidence (having corrected for
projection effects) for radial gradients in temperature and metallicity in the
X-ray emitting gas: the temperature drops from kT~4.2 keV at R=200 kpc to 1.6
keV within R=5 kpc of the centre. The metallicity rises from ~0.3 solar at
R=200 kpc to ~0.7 solar at R=30 kpc before dropping to 0.3 solar within the
central 5 kpc. We find evidence for structure in the surface brightness
distribution associated with the central radio source 3C338. No evidence is
found for the gas having a large spread in temperature at any particular
location despite the cooling time being short (<10**9yr) within the central ~15
kpc. Heating and mass cooling rates are calculated for various assumptions
about the state of the gas.
