The IBIS/ISGRI first year galactic plane survey has produced a catalogue
containing 123 hard X-ray sources visible down to a flux limit of a few
milliCrabs. The point source location accuracy of typically 1-3 arcminutes has
allowed the counterparts for 95 of these sources to be found at other
wavelengths. In order to identify the remaining 28 objects, we have
cross-correlated the ISGRI catalogue with the ROSAT All Sky Survey Bright
Source Catalogue. In this way, for ISGRI sources which have a counterpart in
soft X-rays, we can use the, much smaller, ROSAT error box to search for
identifications. As expected, we find a strong correlation between the two
catalogues and calculate that there are 75 associations with the number
expected by chance to be almost zero. Of these 75 sources, ten are in the list
of unidentified objects. Using the ROSAT error boxes we provide tentative
associations for 8 of these.
