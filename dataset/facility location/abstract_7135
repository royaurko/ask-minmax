We investigate clustering in the angular distribution of the 260 $\gamma$-ray
bursts in the publicly available BATSE catalogue, using a nearest neighbour
analysis and the measures of burst brightness $B$ and short time scale
variability $V$ which we introduced earlier. We find that while all 260 bursts
are only modestly clustered (Q-value = $1.8 \times 10^{-2}$), the 202 bursts in
this sample for which the statistical error in their locations is $<9^\circ$
are significantly clustered on an angular scale $\approx 5^\circ$ (Q-value =
$2.5 \times 10^{-4}$, taking into acoount having chosen the cutoff in the
statistical error). We also find a significant correlation between bright type
I bursts and faint type I and type II bursts on an angular scale $\approx
5^\circ$ (Q-value = $4.0 \times 10^{-3}$). This angular scale is smaller than
the typical (statistical plus systematic) error in burst locations of
$6.8^\circ$, suggesting multiple recurrences from individual sources. We
conclude that ``classical'' $\gamma$-ray burst sources repeat on a time scale
of months, and that many faint type I and II bursts come from the sources of
bright type I bursts.
