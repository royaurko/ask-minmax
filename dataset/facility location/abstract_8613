Cross-correlation function (CCF) has become the standard tool for extraction
of radial-velocity and broadening information from high resolution spectra. It
permits integration of information which is common to many spectral lines into
one function which is easy to calculate, visualize and interpret. However, CCF
is not the best tool for many applications where it should be replaced by the
proper broadening function (BF). Typical applications requiring use of the BF's
rather than CCF's involve finding locations of star spots, studies of projected
shapes of highly distorted stars such as contact binaries (as no assumptions
can be made about BF symmetry or even continuity) and [Fe/H] metallicity
determinations (good baselines and avoidance of negative lobes are essential).
It is stressed that the CCF's are not broadening functions. The note
concentrates on the advantages of determining the BF's through the process of
linear inversion, preferably accomplished using the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD). Some basic examples of numerical operations are given in
the IDL programming language.
