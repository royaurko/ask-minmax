We present an analysis of twisting motions in penumbral filaments in sunspots
located at heliocentric angles from $30^\circ$ to $48^\circ$ using three time
series of blue continuum images obtained by the Broadband Filter Imager (BFI)
onboard {\it Hinode}. The relations of the twisting motions to the filament
brightness and the position within the filament and within the penumbra,
respectively, are investigated. Only certain portions of the filaments show
twisting motions. In a statistical sense, the part of the twisting portion of a
filament located closest to the umbra is brightest and possesses the fastest
twisting motion, with a mean twisting velocity of 2.1\,km\,s$^{-1}$. The middle
and outer sections of the twisting portion of the filament (lying increasingly
further from the umbra), which are less bright, have mean velocities of
1.7\,km\,s$^{-1}$ and 1.35\,km\,s$^{-1}$, respectively. The observed reduction
of brightness and twisting velocity towards the outer section of the filaments
may be due to reducing upflow along the filament's long axis. No significant
variation of twisting velocity as a function of viewing angles was found. The
obtained correlation of brightness and velocity suggests that overturning
convection causes the twisting motions observed in penumbral filament and may
be the source of the energy needed to maintain the brightness of the filaments.
