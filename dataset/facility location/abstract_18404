We present deep BVI observations of the core of M35 and a nearby comparison
field obtained at the WIYN 3.5m telescope under excellent seeing. These
observations display the lower main sequence in BV and VI CMDs down to V = 23.3
and 24.6, respectively. At these faint magnitudes background field stars are
far more numerous than the cluster stars, yet by using a smoothing technique
and CMD density distribution subtraction we recover the cluster fiducial main
sequence and luminosity function to V = 24.6. We find the location of the main
sequence in these CMDs to be consistent with earlier work on other open
clusters, specifically NGC 188, NGC 2420, and NGC 2477. We compare these open
cluster fiducial sequences to stellar models by Baraffe et al. (1998), Siess et
al. (2000), Girardi et al. (2000), and Yi et al. (2001) and find that the
models are too blue in both B-V and V-I for stars below ~0.4 Mo. M35 contains
stars to the limit of the extracted main sequence, at M ~ 0.10-0.15 Mo,
suggesting that M35 may harbor a large number of brown dwarfs, which should be
easy targets for near-IR instrumentation on 8-10m telescopes. We also identify
a new candidate white dwarf in M35 at V = 21.36 +- 0.01. Depending on which WD
models are used to interpret this cluster candidate, it is either a very high
mass WD (1.05 +- 0.05 Mo) somewhat older (0.19-0.26 Gyr, 3-4 sigma) than our
best isochrone age (150 Myr), or it is a modestly massive WD (0.67-0.78 Mo)
much too old (0.42-0.83 Gyr) to belong to the cluster.
