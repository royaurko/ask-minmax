Future security measures will create comfortable living environments that are
embedded with a wide range of intelligent functionalities including home
computing, entertainment, health care and security. These place stringent
requirements on the home networking architecture which integrates various
existing technologies for monitoring and control for future high security
needs. This paper discusses the design and implementation of a gvss gprs Video
Streaming Surveillance System system, which integrates various existing
technologies for providing security for smart home environments. This system
provides security for office, home and other buildings where high security is
required.This allows the mobile user to track the activities from a particular
location. The system will send snapshots of the video and stores them in
different formats. It is also possible to display the time with the image when
it was captured in the gprs enabled mobiles. This system is implemented using
J2me Technology
