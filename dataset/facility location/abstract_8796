We consider archival ROSAT and HST observations of five FRI radio galaxies
and isolate their nuclear emission from that of the host galaxy. This enable us
to determine the Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) of their nuclei spanning
from the radio to the X-ray band. They cannot be described as single power-laws
but require the presence of an emission peak located between the IR and soft
X-ray band. We found consistency between the SED peak position and the values
of the broad band spectral indices of radio galaxies with those of BL Lac, once
the effects of beaming are properly taken into account. FRI SED are thus
qualitatively similar to those of BL Lacs supporting the identification of FRI
sources as their mis-oriented counterparts. No dependence of the shape of the
SED on the FR~I orientation is found.
