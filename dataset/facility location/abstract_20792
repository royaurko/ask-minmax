Volume 1913 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 27-32 Date: 03 June 2003 Approximation Algorithms for Facility Location Problems David B. Shmoys Affiliated with Cornell University One of the most flourishing areas of research in the design and analysis of approximation algorithms has been for facility location problems. In particular, for the metric case of two simple models, the uncapacitated facility location and the k -median problems, there are now a variety of techniques that yield constant performance guarantees. These methods include LP rounding, primal-dual algorithms, and local search techniques. Furthermore, the salient ideas in these algorithms and their analyzes are simple-to-explain and reflect a surprising degree of commonality. This note is intended as companion to our lecture at CONF 2000, mainly to give pointers to the appropriate references.
