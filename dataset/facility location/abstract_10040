Traditionally, cardiac surgery has been performed through a median
sternotomy, which allows the surgeon generous access to the heart and
surrounding great vessels. As a paradigm shift in the size and location of
incisions occurs in cardiac surgery, new methods have been developed to allow
the surgeon the same amount of dexterity and accessibility to the heart in
confined spaces and in a less invasive manner. Initially, long instruments
without pivot points were used, however, more recent robotic telemanipulation
systems have been applied that allow for improved dexterity, enabling the
surgeon to perform cardiac surgery from a distance not previously possible. In
this rapidly evolving field, we review the recent history and clinical results
of using robotics in cardiac surgery.
