Just as the astronomical "Time Domain" is a catch-phrase for a diverse group
of different science objectives involving time-varying phenomena in all
astrophysical regimes from the solar system to cosmological scales, so the
"Virtual Observatory" is a complex set of community-wide activities from
archives to astroinformatics. This workshop touched on some aspects of adapting
and developing those semantic and network technologies in order to address
transient and time-domain research challenges. It discussed the VOEvent format
for representing alerts and reports on celestial transient events, the SkyAlert
and ATELstream facilities for distributing these alerts, and the IVOA
time-series protocol and time-series tools provided by the VAO. Those tools and
infrastructure are available today to address the real-world needs of
astronomers.
