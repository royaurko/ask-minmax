We report the discovery of a young and energetic pulsar in the Parkes
multibeam survey of the Galactic plane. PSR J1016-5857 has a rotation period of
107 ms and period derivative of 8e-14, implying a characteristic age of 21 kyr
and spin-down luminosity of 2.6e36 erg/s. The pulsar is located just outside,
and possibly interacting with, the shell supernova remnant G284.3-1.8. Archival
X-ray data show a source near the pulsar position which is consistent with
emission from a pulsar wind nebula. The pulsar is also located inside the error
box of the unidentified EGRET source 3EG J1013-5915, for which it represents a
plausible counterpart.
