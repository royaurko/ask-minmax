To explain the pulsed emission of the rotation powered pulsars from radio to
gamma-ray, the polar cap models, the slot gap models, and the outer gap models
are proposed. The recent observations suggest that these models are likely to
co-exist in the same magnetosphere. If so, their mutual relation is known to be
troublesome (Harding 2009) due to the boundary conditions and the direction of
the current which are properly assumed in each acceleration models. We
performed a particle simulation for the global magnetospheric structure. Based
on the simulation, we present a new picture of the global structure of the
pulsar magnetosphere. It is found that a new dead zone is formed along the
current neutral line which separates the oppositely directed current. We shall
call this the current- neutral zone. We suggest that the polar cap accelerators
and the slot gaps locate above the current-neutral zone, and the outer gap
exist between the current neutral zone and the traditional dead zone. We also
give an estimate of the super-rotation region.
