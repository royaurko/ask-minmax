We present the first observations of magnetic cataclysmic variables with the
Spitzer Space Telescope. We used the Infrared Array Camera to obtain photometry
of the polars EF Eri, GG Leo, V347 Pav, and RX J0154.0-5947 at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8,
and 8.0 $\mu$m. In all of our targets, we detect excess mid-infrared emission
over that expected from the component stars alone. We explore the origin of
this IR excess by examining bremsstrahlung, cyclotron emission, circumbinary
dust, and L/T brown dwarf secondary stars. Bremsstrahlung and cyclotron
emission appear unlikely to be significant contributors to the observed fluxes.
At present, the most likely candidate for the excess emission is dust that is
probably located in a circumbinary disk with an inner temperature near 800 K.
However, a simple dust disk plus any reasonable low mass or brown dwarf-like
secondary star is unable to fully explain the observed flux densities in the
3--8 $\mu$m region.
