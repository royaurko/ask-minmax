Orbifold compactification of heterotic E8 x E8 string theory is a source for
promising grand unified model building. It can accommodate the successful
aspects of grand unification while avoiding problems like doublet-triplet
splitting in the Higgs sector. Many of the phenomenological properties of the
4-dimensional effective theory find an explanation through the geometry of
compact space and the location of matter and Higgs fields. These geometrical
properties can be used as a guideline for realistic model building.
