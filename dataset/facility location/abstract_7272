We have observed two low concentration Galactic globular clusters with the
X-ray observatory XMM-Newton. We detect 47 faint X-ray sources in the direction
of M 55 and 62 in the field of view of NGC 3201. Using the statistical Log
N-Log S relationship of extragalactic sources derived from XMM-Newton Lockman
Hole observations, to estimate the background source population, we estimate
that very few of the sources (1.5+/-1.0) in the field of view of M 55 actually
belong to the cluster. These sources are located in the centre of the cluster
as we expect if the cluster has undergone mass segregation. NGC 3201 has
approximately 15 related sources, which are centrally located but are not
constrained to lie within the half mass radius. The sources belonging to this
cluster can lie up to 5 core radii from the centre of the cluster which could
imply that this cluster has been perturbed. Using X-ray (and optical, in the
case of M 55) colours, spectral and timing analysis (where possible) and
comparing these observations to previous X-ray observations, we find evidence
for sources in each cluster that could be cataclysmic variables, active
binaries, millisecond pulsars and possible evidence for a quiescent low mass
X-ray binary with a neutron star primary, even though we do not expect any such
objects in either of the clusters, due to their low central concentrations. The
majority of the other sources are background sources, such as AGN.
