We report the discovery of a relatively faint (V=15.5) early-type WN star in
the SMC. The line strength and width of He II lambda 4686 emission is similar
to that of the other SMC WNs, and the presense of N V lambda 4603,19 emission
(coupled with the lack of N III) suggests this star is of spectral type
WN3-4.5, and thus is similar in type to the other SMC WRs. Also like the other
SMC WN stars, an early-type absorption spectrum is weakly present. The absolute
magnitude is comparable to that of other (single) Galactic early-type WNs. The
star is located in the Hodge 53 OB association, which is also the home of two
other SMC WNs. This star, which we designate SMC-WR12, was actually detected at
a high significance level in an earlier interference-filter survey, but the
wrong star was observed as part of a spectroscopic followup, and this case of
mistaken identity resulted in its Wolf-Rayet nature not being recognized until
now.
