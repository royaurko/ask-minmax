Coalescing massive Black Hole binaries are the strongest and probably the
most important gravitational wave sources in the LISA band. The spin and
orbital precessions bring complexity in the waveform and make the likelihood
surface richer in structure as compared to the non-spinning case. We introduce
an extended multimodal genetic algorithm which utilizes the properties of the
signal and the detector response function to analyze the data from the third
round of mock LISA data challenge (MLDC 3.2). The performance of this method is
comparable, if not better, to already existing algorithms. We have found all
five sources present in MLDC 3.2 and recovered the coalescence time, chirp
mass, mass ratio and sky location with reasonable accuracy. As for the orbital
angular momentum and two spins of the Black Holes, we have found a large number
of widely separated modes in the parameter space with similar maximum
likelihood values.
