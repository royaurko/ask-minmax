The Anti-Proton ANnihilation at DArmstadt (PANDA) experiment proposed at the
Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) in Darmstadt (Germany) will
perform a high precision spectroscopy of charmonium and exotic hadrons, such as
hybrids, glueballs and hypernuclei. A highly intense beam of anti-protons
provided by High Energy Storage Ring (HESR) with an unprecedented resolution
will scan a mass range of 2 to 5.5 GeV/c2.
  In preparation for experiments with PANDA, careful and large-scale simulation
studies need to be performed in the coming years to determine analysis
strategies, to provide feedback for the design, construction and performance
optimization of individual detector components and to design methods for the
calibration and interpretation of the experimental results. Results of a
simulation for the ElectroMagnetic Calorimeter (EMC), built from lead tungstate
(PWO) crystals and placed inside the Target Spectrometer (TS), are presented.
The simulations were carried out using the PandaRoot framework, which is based
on ROOT and being developed by the PANDA collaboration.
