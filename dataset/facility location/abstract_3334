The program Ortocartan for algebraic calculations in relativity has just been
implemented in the Codemist Standard Lisp and can now be used under the Windows
98 and Linux operating systems. The paper describes the new facilities and
subprograms that have been implemented since the previous release in 1992.
These are: the possibility to write the output as Latex input code and as
Ortocartan's input code, the calculation of the Ellis evolution equations for
the kinematic tensors of flow, the calculation of the curvature tensors from
given (torsion-free) connection coefficients in a manifold of arbitrary
dimension, the calculation of the lagrangian from a given metric by the
Landau-Lifshitz method, the calculation of the Euler-Lagrange equations from a
given lagrangian (only for sets of ordinary differential equations) and the
calculation of first integrals of sets of ordinary differential equations of
second order (the first integrals are assumed to be polynomials of second
degree in the first derivatives of the functions).
