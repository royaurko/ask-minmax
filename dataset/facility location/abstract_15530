We present a computational study of the electronic properties of amorphous
SiO2. The ionic configurations used are the ones generated by an earlier
molecular dynamics simulations in which the system was cooled with different
cooling rates from the liquid state to a glass, thus giving access to
glass-like configurations with different degrees of disorder [Phys. Rev. B 54,
15808 (1996)]. The electronic structure is described by a tight-binding
Hamiltonian. We study the influence of the degree of disorder on the density of
states, the localization properties, the optical absorption, the nature of
defects within the mobility gap, and on the fluctuations of the Madelung
potential, where the disorder manifests itself most prominently. The
experimentally observed mismatch between a photoconductivity threshold of 9 eV
and the onset of the optical absorption around 7 eV is interpreted by the
picture of eigenstates localized by potential energy fluctuations in a mobility
gap of approximately 9 eV and a density of states that exhibits valence and
conduction band tails which are, even in the absence of defects, deeply located
within the former band gap.
