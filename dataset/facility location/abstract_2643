The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is an integral part of the next-generation
observatories that will survey the Universe across the electromagnetic
spectrum, and beyond, revolutionizing our view of fundamental physics,
astrophysics and cosmology. Owing to their extreme nature and clock-like
properties, pulsars discovered and monitored by SKA will enable a broad range
of scientific endeavour and play a key role in this quest. This chapter
summarizes the pulsar-related science goals that will be reached with
coordinated efforts among SKA and other next-generation astronomical
facilities.
