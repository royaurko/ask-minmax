A new overdensity of A-colored stars in distant parts of the Milky Way's
stellar halo, at a dereddened SDSS magnitude of g_0 = 20.3, is presented.
Identification of associated variable RR Lyrae candidates supports the claim
that these are blue horizontal branch stars. The inferred distance of these
stars from the Galactic center is 90 kpc, assuming the absolute magnitude of
these stars is M_g_0 = 0.7 and that the Sun is 8.5 kpc from the Galactic
center. The new tidal debris is within 10 kpc of same plane as other confirmed
tidal debris from the disruption of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and could be
associated with the trailing tidal arm. Distances to the Sagittarius stream
estimated from M stars are about 13% smaller than our inferred distances. The
tidal debris has a width of at least 10 degrees, and is traced for more than 20
degrees across the sky. The globular cluster NGC 2419 is located within the
detected tidal debris, and may also have once been associated with the
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
