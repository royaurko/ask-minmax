We demonstrate that the temporal peak generated by specific electromagnetic
pulses may arrive at different positions simultaneously in an absorbing wave
guide. The effect can be used for triggering several devices all at once at
unknown distances from the sender or generally to transmit information so that
it arrives at the same time to receivers at different, unknown locations. This
simultaneity cannot be realized by the standard transmission methods.
