Positive frequency Wightman function, vacuum expectation values of the field
square and the energy-momentum tensor induced by a Z_{2}-symmetric brane with
finite thickness located on (D+1)- dimensional AdS background are evaluated for
a massive scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter. For the
general case of static plane symmetric interior structure the expectation
values in the region outside the brane are presented as the sum of free AdS and
brane induced parts. For a conformally coupled massless scalar the brane
induced part in the vacuum energy-momentum tensor vanishes. In the limit of
strong gravitational fields the brane induced parts are exponentially
suppressed for points not too close to the brane boundary. As an application of
general results a special model is considered in which the geometry inside the
brane is a slice of the Minkowski spacetime orbifolded along the direction
perpendicular to the brane. For this model the Wightman function, vacuum
expectation values of the field square and the energy-momentum tensor inside
the brane are evaluated as well and their behavior is discussed in various
asymptotic regions of the parameters. It is shown that for both minimally and
conformally coupled scalar fields the interior vacuum forces acting on the
brane boundaries tend to decrease the brane thickness.
