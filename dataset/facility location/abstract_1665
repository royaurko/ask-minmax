In the leading order of perturbative QCD one calculates the total and
differential cross-sections for the hadronic production of doubly charmed
baryons $\Xi_{cc}$ and $\Xi_{cc}^*$ in different experiments. The experimental
evaluation of cross-sections for the $J/\Psi +D + \bar D$ production would
allow one to decrease the uncertainty in the determination of cross-sections
for the doubly charmed baryons due to the choice of $\alpha_s$ and $m_c$. One
shows that in the HERA-B and E781 experiments with fixed tagets the suppression
of the $\Xi_{cc}$ and $\Xi_{cc}^*$ production to the yield of $c \bar c$-pairs
is the value of the order of $10^{-6}-10^{-5}$, whereas at the TEVATRON and LHC
colliders it is about $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$. In the E781 experiment the observation
of $\Xi_{cc}$ and $\Xi_{cc}^*$ is practically unpossible. At the HERA-B and
TEVATRON facilities one can expect $10^5$ events with the double charm, and at
LHC one has about $10^9$ ones.
