We study six months of human mobility data, including WiFi and GPS traces
recorded with high temporal resolution, and find that time series of WiFi scans
contain a strong latent location signal. In fact, due to inherent stability and
low entropy of human mobility, it is possible to assign location to WiFi access
points based on a very small number of GPS samples and then use these access
points as location beacons. Using just one GPS observation per day per person
allows us to estimate the location of, and subsequently use, WiFi access points
to account for 80\% of mobility across a population. These results reveal a
great opportunity for using ubiquitous WiFi routers for high-resolution outdoor
positioning, but also significant privacy implications of such side-channel
location tracking.
