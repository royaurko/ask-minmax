We develop an analytical framework for the analysis of planar chiral
multi-split rings, based on a Fourier series expansion of the induced current.
The number, width, and location of each split (gap) is arbitrary. Provision is
made for the possibility of inserting lumped active or passive impedance loads
in the gaps. The model demonstrates the hallmark of planar chirality and its
consequent magneto-electric coupling as a function of the parameters of the
splits and impedance loads. It is demonstrated that impedance loads sequenced
in a clockwise or anti-clockwise fashion allow for generation of dissymetric
current distributions in the plane, like for geometric (structural) chirality.
We also determine the effect of planar chirality on the relevant dyadic
polarizability components of a split ring. Reflection and transmission
coefficient characteristics of regular arrays of such rings are determined with
the aid of the periodic method of moments. Phase-coherent detection of the
sense of handedness and incoherent detection of planar chirality per se by
measurement of the field intensity are shown to be possible, in both the
reflection and transmission characteristics. These results are relevant to both
coherent and incoherent detection at optical and suboptical wavelengths.
