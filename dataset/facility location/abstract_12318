We present results of our pulsar population synthesis of normal pulsars from
the Galactic disk using our previously developed computer code. On the same
footing, we use slot gap and outer gap models for gamma-ray emission from
normal pulsars to obtain statistics of radio-loud and radio-quiet gamma-ray
pulsars. From recently improved understanding of HII and star forming regions
in the Galaxy, we develop a new surface density model of the birth location of
neutron stars. We explore models of neutron star evolution with magnetic
field-decay, and with different initial period and magnetic field
distributions. We present preliminary results including simulated population
statistics that are compared with recent detections by Fermi of normal,
isolated pulsars.
