The decision to incorporate cross-validation into validation processes of
mathematical models raises an immediate question - how should one partition the
data into calibration and validation sets? We answer this question
systematically: we present an algorithm to find the optimal partition of the
data subject to certain constraints. While doing this, we address two critical
issues: 1) that the model be evaluated with respect to predictions of a given
quantity of interest and its ability to reproduce the data, and 2) that the
model be highly challenged by the validation set, assuming it is properly
informed by the calibration set. This framework also relies on the interaction
between the experimentalist and/or modeler, who understand the physical system
and the limitations of the model; the decision-maker, who understands and can
quantify the cost of model failure; and the computational scientists, who
strive to determine if the model satisfies both the modeler's and decision
maker's requirements. We also note that our framework is quite general, and may
be applied to a wide range of problems. Here, we illustrate it through a
specific example involving a data reduction model for an ICCD camera from a
shock-tube experiment located at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC).
