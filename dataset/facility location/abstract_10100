We present a singularity excision algorithm appropriate for numerical
simulations of black holes moving throughout the computational domain. The
method is an extension of the excision procedure previously used to obtain
stable simulations of single, non-moving black holes. The excision procedure
also shares elements used in recent work to study the dynamics of a scalarfield
in the background of a single, boosted black hole. The robustness of our
excision method is tested with single black-hole evolutions using a coordinate
system in which the coordinate location of the black hole, and thus the
excision boundary, moves throughout the computational domain.
