The huge photometric databases that are being created for stars in the
Magellanic Clouds and in Local Group galaxies not only allow detailed study of
the star formation history of these systems, but also provide important
information on stellar evolutionary theory. Two low-level features above the
red-clump in the LMC color-magnitude diagram (CMD) have been discussed by
Zaritsky & Lin (1997) and Alcock et al. (1997) as the possible signature of an
intervening population. I conclude that one of the features, which has also
been associated with the red giant branch bump (RGB-bump) predicted by theory
and observed in globular clusters, is instead produced during asymtotic giant
branch (AGB) evolution. I will call it the AGB-bump. In this paper, it will be
shown that the stellar evolution predictions about the position and strength of
the AGB-bump are in very good agreement with the observed structures in the
LMC, M31 and globular clusters. The position in the CMD of the other feature is
consistent with the location of the blue-loops of a few Myr old stars and it
has also been observed in the CMD of other galaxies with a young stellar
population.
