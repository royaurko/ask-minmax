We present new X-ray observations of the A0p stars alpha^2 CVn (log Lx < 26.0
erg/s) and IQ Aur (log Lx = 29.6 erg/s) and find that their X-ray luminosities
differ by at least three orders of magnitude. IQ Aur possesses a strong cool
plasma component with X-ray emitting regions located well above the stellar
surface, but also significant amounts of hot plasma. Further, a large X-ray
flare is detected from IQ Aur, implying the presence of magnetic reconnection.
Our comparison study of similar stars indicates that the occurrence of X-ray
emission generated by magnetically channelled wind shocks (MCWS) strongly
depends on stellar properties. X-ray emission is preferably generated by more
luminous and massive objects such as IQ Aur. The MCWS scenario can consistently
describe the X-ray emission of these A0p stars, assuming that the very strong
magnetic confinement of the stellar wind has led to the build up of a rigidly
rotating disk around the star, where magnetic reconnection and centrifugal
breakout events occur.
