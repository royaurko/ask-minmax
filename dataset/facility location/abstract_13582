We present the first applications of the recently established by us
(arXiv:1304.7895; Ukrainian Math. J. - 2014. -66. - P. 371-383) generalized
Li's criterion equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis. This criterion is the
statement that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the non-negativity of
the derivatives 1/((m-1)!)*d^m/dz^m((z+b)^(m-1)*ln(\xi(z))) for z=b+1 of the
Riemann xi-function for all real b>-1/2 and all m = 1, 2, 3... We show that for
any positive integer n there is such value of b_n (depending on n) that for all
m<=n and b>b_n, inequality 1/((m-1)!)*d^m/dz^m((z+b)^(m-1)*ln(\xi(z))) for
z=b+1 >=0 does hold true. Assuming RH, we also have found an asymptotic of the
generalized Li's sums over non-trivial Rieman zeroes for large n, and discuss
what asymptotic of 1/((m-1)!)*d^m/dz^m((z+b)^(m-1)*ln((z-1)*(\zeta(z))) at the
point z+b+1 is required for the Riemann hypothesis holds true.
