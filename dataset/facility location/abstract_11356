We analyse a model where the anomalies of the bond-stretching LO phonon mode
are caused by the coupling to electron dynamic response in the form of a damped
oscillator and explore the possibility to reconstruct the spectrum of the
latter from the phonon measurements. Preliminary estimates point to its
location in the mid infrared region and we show how the required additional
information can be extracted from the oxygen isotope effect on the phonon
spectrum. The model predicts a significant measurable deviation from the
"standard value" of the isotope effect even if the phonon frequency is far
below the electron spectrum, provided the latter is strongly incoherent. In
this regime, which corresponds to the "mid infrared scenario", the phonon
linewidth becomes a sensitive and informative probe of the isotope effect.
