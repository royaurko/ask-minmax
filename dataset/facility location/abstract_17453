Ground- and space-based observations of solar flares from radio wavelengths
to gamma-rays have produced considerable insights but raised several unsolved
controversies. The last unexplored wavelength frontier for solar flares is in
the range of submillimeter and infrared wavelengths. Here we report the
detection of an intense impulsive burst at 30 THz using a new imaging system.
The 30 THz emission exhibited remarkable time coincidence with peaks observed
at microwave, mm/submm, visible, EUV and hard X-ray wavelengths. The emission
location coincides with a very weak white-light feature, and is consistent with
heating below the temperature minimum in the atmosphere. However, there are
problems in attributing the heating to accelerated electrons. The peak 30 THz
flux is several times larger than the usual microwave peak near 9 GHz,
attributed to non-thermal electrons in the corona. The 30 THz emission could be
consistent with an optically thick spectrum increasing from low to high
frequencies. It might be part of the same spectral component found at sub-THz
frequencies whose nature remains mysterious. Further observations at these
wavelengths will provide a new window for flare studies.
