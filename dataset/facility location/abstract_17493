A blowout jet occurred within the south coronal hole on 9 February 2011 at
09:00 UT and was observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory,
and the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and X-Ray Telescope (XRT) onboard the
Hinode spacecraft during coronal hole monitoring performed as part of Hinode
Operations Program No. 177. Images from AIA show expanding hot and cold loops
from a small bright point with plasma ejected in a curtain up to 30 Mm wide.
The initial intensity front of the jet had a projected velocity of 200 km/s and
line-of-sight (LOS) velocities measured by EIS are between 100 and 250 km/s.
The LOS velocities increased along the jet, implying an acceleration mechanism
operating within the body of the jet. The jet plasma had a density of 2.7 x
10^8 cm^-3, and a temperature of 1.4 MK. During the event a number of bright
kernels were seen at the base of the bright point. The kernels have sizes of
about 1000 km, are variable in brightness, and have lifetimes of 1-15 minutes.
An XRT filter ratio yields temperatures of 1.5-3.0 MK for the kernels. The
bright point existed for at least ten hours, but disappeared within two hours
after the jet, which lasted for 30 minutes. HMI data reveal converging
photospheric flows at the location of the bright point, and the mixed polarity
magnetic flux canceled over a period of four hours on either side of the jet.
