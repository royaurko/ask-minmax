NGC 3642 was classified as a spiral galaxy with three rings and no bar. We
have performed an HI and optical study of this nearly face-on galaxy. We find
that the nuclear ring might in fact be part of an inner one-armed spiral, that
could be driving nuclear accretion and feeding the central activity in the
inner kpc. The inner ring is faint, and the outer ring is a rather ill-defined
pseudoring. Furthermore, the size ratio of the rings is such that they cannot
be due to a single pattern speed linking them together.
  The outer pseudoring is peculiar, since it lies in the faint outer parts of
the disk, where star formation is still going on at 1.4 times the optical
radius. Higher HI column densities are associated with these regions and the
atomic gas layer is warped. These perturbations affect only the outer disk,
since the kinematics within the main body conforms well to an ordinary
differentially rotating disk.
  We propose here that both nuclear activity and star formation in the warped
outer parts might be linked to the fact that NGC 3642 is located in a rich
environment, where its close neighbors show clear signs of merging. Our
suggestion is that NGC 3642 has captured recently a low-mass, gas-rich dwarf,
and star formation was triggered in this infalling external gas that produced
also a pronounced warp in the gaseous disk.
