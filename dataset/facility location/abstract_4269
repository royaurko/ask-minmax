We research the location of the zeros of the Eisenstein series and the
modular functions from the Hecke type Faber polynomials associated with the
normalizers of congruence subgroups which are of genus zero and of level at
most twelve.
  In Part I, we will consider the general theory of modular functions for the
normalizers.
