We present very deep RIc photometry of the M35 open cluster. We have covered
30' \times 30', equivalent to about a fourth of the total area of the cluster.
The data range from I_c=17.5 to 23.5 magnitudes, and the color interval is $0.5
\le (R-I)_c \le 2.5$. Roughly, these values correspond from $0.6 M_\odot$ to
$0.1 M_\odot$ in the cases of members of the cluster. By using the location of
the stars on a Color-Magnitude Diagram, we have selected possible members of
this cluster and obtained the Luminosity and Mass Functions of the M35 open
cluster and compared them with those from the Pleiades.
