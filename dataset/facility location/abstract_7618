Quasi-periodic disturbances have been observed in the outer solar atmosphere
for many years now. Although first interpreted as upflows (Schrijver et al.
(1999)), they have been widely regarded as slow magnetoacoustic waves, due to
observed velocities and periods. However, recent observations have questioned
this interpretation, as periodic disturbances in Doppler velocity, line width
and profile asymmetry were found to be in phase with the intensity oscillations
(De Pontieu et al. (2010),Tian1 et al. (2011))}, suggesting the disturbances
could be quasi-periodic upflows. Here we conduct a detailed analysis of the
velocities of these disturbances across several wavelengths using the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO). We analysed 41 examples, including both sunspot and non sunspot regions
of the Sun. We found that the velocities of propagating disturbances (PDs)
located at sunspots are more likely to be temperature dependent, whereas the
velocities of PDs at non sunspot locations do not show a clear temperature
dependence. We also considered on what scale the underlying driver is affecting
the properties of the PDs. Finally, we found that removing the contribution due
to the cooler ions in the 193 A wavelength suggests that a substantial part of
the 193 emission of sunspot PDs can be contributed to the cool component of
193\AA.
