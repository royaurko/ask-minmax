We discuss work toward developing a 2.5D non-LTE radiative transfer code. Our
code uses the short characteristic method with modifications to handle
realistic 3D wind velocities. We also designed this code for parallel computing
facilities by representing the characteristics with an impact parameter vector
p. This makes the interpolation in the radiation angles unnecessary and allows
for an independent calculation for characteristics represented by different p
vectors. The effects of the velocity field are allowed for by increasing, as
needed, the number of grid points along a short characteristic. This allows us
to accurately map the variation of the opacities and emissivities as a function
of frequency and spatial coordinates. In the future we plan to use this
transfer code with a 2D non-LTE stellar atmosphere program to self-consistently
solve for level populations, the radiation field and temperature structure for
stars with winds and without spherical symmetry.
