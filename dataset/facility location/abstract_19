HEP Cluster is designed and implemented in Scientific Linux Cern 5.5 to grant
High Energy Physics researchers one place where they can go to undertake a
particular task or to provide a parallel processing architecture in which CPU
resources are shared across a network and all machines function as one large
supercomputer. It gives physicists a facility to access computers and data,
transparently, without having to consider location, operating system, account
administration, and other details. By using this facility researchers can
process their jobs much faster than the stand alone desktop systems. Keywords:
Cluster, Network, Storage, Parallel Computing & Gris.
