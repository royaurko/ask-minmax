In this paper we present the R&D activity on a new GEM-based TPC prototype
for AMADEUS, a new experimental proposal at the DA{\Phi}NE {\Phi}-factory at
the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati (INFN), aiming to perform measurements of
the low-energy negative kaons interactions in nuclei. Such innovative detector
will equip the inner part of the experiment in order to perfom a better
reconstruction of the primary vertex and the secondary particles tracking. A
10x10 cm2 prototype with a drift gap up to 15 cm was realized and succesfully
tested at the {\pi} M1 beam facility of the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) with
low momentum hadrons. The measurements of the detector efficiency and spatial
resolution have been performed. The results as a function of the gas gain,
drift field, front-end electronic threshold and particle momentum are reported
and discussed.
