Activity-based models, as a specific instance of agent-based models, deal
with agents that structure their activity in terms of (daily) activity
schedules. An activity schedule consists of a sequence of activity instances,
each with its assigned start time, duration and location, together with
transport modes used for travel between subsequent activity locations. A
critical step in the development of simulation models is validation. Despite
the growing importance of activity-based models in modelling transport and
mobility, there has been so far no work focusing specifically on statistical
validation of such models. In this paper, we propose a six-step Validation
Framework for Activity-based Models (VALFRAM) that allows exploiting historical
real-world data to assess the validity of activity-based models. The framework
compares temporal and spatial properties and the structure of activity
schedules against real-world travel diaries and origin-destination matrices. We
confirm the usefulness of the framework on three real-world activity-based
transport models.
