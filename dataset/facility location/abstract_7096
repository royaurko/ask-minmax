Recently, the reference functions for the synthesis and analysis of the
autostereoscopic multiview and integral images in three-dimensional displays we
introduced. In the current paper, we propose the wavelets to analyze such
images. The wavelets are built on the reference functions as on the scaling
functions of the wavelet analysis. The continuous wavelet transform was
successfully applied to the testing wireframe binary objects. The restored
locations correspond to the structure of the testing wireframe binary objects.
