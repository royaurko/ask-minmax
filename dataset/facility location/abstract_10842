Fluoride materials exhibit surface resonances located in the thermal
infrared. This makes them interesting to search for a fundamental temperature
dependence of the atom-surface interaction, originating in the near-field
thermal emissivity of the surface. Preliminary selective reflection experiments
performed on a special Cs vapour cell that includes a CaF2 interface show a
temperature dependence, yet to be analyzed
