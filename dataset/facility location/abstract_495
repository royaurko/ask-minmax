Studies of single and double-spin asymmetries in pion electro-production in
semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering of 5.8 GeV polarized electrons from
unpolarized and longitudinally polarized targets at the Thomas Jefferson
National Accelerator Facility using CLAS discussed. We present a
Bessel-weighting strategy to extract transverse-momentum-dependent parton
distribution functions.
