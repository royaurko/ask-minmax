The locations of multicritical points on many hierarchical lattices are
numerically investigated by the renormalization group analysis. The results are
compared with an analytical conjecture derived by using the duality, the gauge
symmetry and the replica method. We find that the conjecture does not give the
exact answer but leads to locations slightly away from the numerically reliable
data. We propose an improved conjecture to give more precise predictions of the
multicritical points than the conventional one. This improvement is inspired by
a new point of view coming from renormalization group and succeeds in deriving
very consistent answers with many numerical data.
