We present deep 3.6 cm radio continuum observations of the H II region NGC
2024 in Orion B obtained using the Very Large Array in its A-configuration,
with $0\rlap.{''}2$ angular resolution. We detect a total of 25 compact radio
sources in a region of $4' \times 4'$. We discuss the nature of these sources
and its relation with the infrared and X-ray objects in the region. At least
two of the radio sources are obscured proplyds whose morphology can be used to
restrict the location of the main ionizing source of the region. This cluster
of radio sources is compared with others that have been found in regions of
recent star formation.
