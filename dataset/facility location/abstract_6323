We have analyzed the Cu K-EXAFS of Bi_2Sr_1.5Ca_1.5Cu_2O_8+d using a full
multiple scattering analysis in a cluster with diameter d = 7.6 AA. The
numerous quasi one-dimensional structural elements give rise to significant
multiple scattering contributions in the EXAFS. We confirm the Sr/Ca ratio of
the sample is 1:1, and one Ca atom is located close to a nominal Sr-site. At 40
K the dimpling angle in the $\rm CuO_2-plane is found to be < 3.5 degrees.
