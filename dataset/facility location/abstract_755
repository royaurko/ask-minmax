We propose to use Tarski's least fixpoint theorem as a basis to define
recursive functions in the calculus of inductive constructions. This widens the
class of functions that can be modeled in type-theory based theorem proving
tool to potentially non-terminating functions. This is only possible if we
extend the logical framework by adding the axioms that correspond to classical
logic. We claim that the extended framework makes it possible to reason about
terminating and non-terminating computations and we show that common facilities
of the calculus of inductive construction, like program extraction can be
extended to also handle the new functions.
