In this article we introduce a procedure which allows to recover the
potentially very good approximation properties of tensor-based model reduction
procedures for the solution of partial differential equations in the presence
of interfaces or strong gradients in the solution which are skewed with respect
to the coordinate axes. The two key ideas are the location of the interface by
solving a lower-dimensional partial differential equation and the subsequent
removal of the interface of the solution by choosing the determined interface
as the lifting function of the Dirichlet boundary conditions. For prescribed
interfaces we demonstrate in numerical experiments for linear elliptic
equations and the reduced basis-hierarchical model reduction approach that the
proposed procedure yields a significantly improved convergence behavior even in
the case when we only consider an approximation of the interface.
