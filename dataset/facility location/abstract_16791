In accordance with recent experiments the mean-field type theories predict
the presence of numerous metastable minima (states) in the rugged free-energy
landscape of frustrated disordered magnets. This multiplicity of long-lived
states with lifetimes greater than $10^5 s$ makes the task to experimentally
determine which of them has the lowest free energy (and thus what thermodynamic
phase the sample is in) seem rather hopeless the more so as we do not know a
protocol (such as field-cooling or zero-field-cooling) leading to the
equilibrium state(s). Nevertheless here we show in the framework of Landau-type
phenomenological model that signatures of the mean-field equilibrium phase
transitions in such highly nonequilibrium systems may be found in the evolution
of the hysteresis loop form. Thus the sequence of transitions from spin-glass
to mixed phase and to ferromagnetic one results in the changes from inclined
hysteresis loop to that with the developing vertical sides and to one with the
perfectly vertical sides. Such relation between loop form and the location of
global minimum may hold beyond the mean-field approximation and can be useful
in the real experiments and Monte-Carlo simulations of the problems involving
rugged potential landscape. Also the very existence of the quasi-static loops
in spin glass and mixed phases implies that the known disorder-smoothing of the
first-order transition can be always accompanied by the emergence of multiple
metastable states.
