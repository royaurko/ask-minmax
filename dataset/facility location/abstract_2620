The harsh environment on the lunar surface presents unique technological
challenges for space exploration. This paper presents research on the design
and development of the Tele- scope-deployment High-vacuum teleOperated Rover
(THOR), currently being built and tested in the Lunar and Airless Bodies
Simulator (LABS) facility at the University of Colorado Boulder. This rover is
fabricated entirely out of cost-effective commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
components and materials. THOR can potentially survive for more than one
simulated year in conditions similar to that of the lunar environment,
demonstrating the successful initial results of a first phase research study on
material and electronic survivability in an extreme environment such as the
Moon.
