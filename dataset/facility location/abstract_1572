The Spitzer Space Telescope and in particular its InfraRed Array Camera
(IRAC) is an ideal facility to study the distribution of AGB stars in our own
and other galaxies because of its efficiency in surveying vast areas of the sky
and its ability to detect sources with infrared excess. The IRAC colors of AGB
stars, however, are not well known because cool stars have numerous molecular
absorption features in the spectral region covered by the IRAC photometric
system. The presence and strength of these features depends on the chemistry of
the stellar atmosphere and the mass loss rate and can change with time due to
the star's variability. To characterize the IRAC colors of AGB stars, we are
carrying out a Spitzer Guaranteed Time Observation program to observe a sample
of AGB stars with IRAC. The results will be made available to the community in
the form of template magnitudes and colors for each target with the goal of
aiding the identification of AGB stars in already available and future IRAC
surveys. We present here the first results of this project.
