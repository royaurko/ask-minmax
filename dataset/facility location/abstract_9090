We have observed several magnetic cataclysmic variables located in the range
between 2 and 3 hours, known as the period gap. This work was prompted by the
recent discovery of RX J1554.2+2721. It has 2.54 hours orbital period and shows
almost pure cyclotron continuum in a low luminosity state, similar to
HS1023+3900,
  HS0922+1333 and RBS206. These are low accretion rate polars (LARPs) known to
have mass transfer rates of order of a few 10^-13Msun/year.
  The aim of the study was to find out, if magnetic systems filling the period
gap are in any way different from their counterparts outside that range of
periods. The only significant difference we encounter, is much higher number of
asynchronous magnetic systems to-wards longer periods than below the gap.
