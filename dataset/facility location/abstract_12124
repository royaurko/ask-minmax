The ALFALFA (Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA) blind survey is providing a census of
HI in galaxies of all types in a range of environments. Here we report on
ALFALFA results for Virgo Cluster early-type dwarfs between declinations of 4
and 16 degrees. Less than 2% of the Virgo early-type dwarf population is
detected, compared to 70-80% of the Im/BCD dwarf population. Most of the dwarfs
detected in HI show evidence for ongoing or recent star formation. Early-type
galaxies with HI tend to be located in the outer regions of the cluster and to
be brighter. Early-type dwarfs with HI may be undergoing morphological
transition due to cluster environmental effects.
