A mechanism is proposed based on the Kubo formula to generate a
spin-polarized magneto-optical current of Dirac electrons in solids which have
strong spin-orbit interactions such as bismuth. The ac current response
functions are calculated in the isotropic Wolff model under an external
magnetic field, and the selection rules for Dirac electrons are obtained. By
using the circularly polarized light and tuning its frequency, one can excite
electrons concentrated in the spin-polarized lowest Landau level when the
chemical potential locates in the band gap, so that spin-polarization in the
magneto-optical current can be achieved.
