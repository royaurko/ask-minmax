We report on a new method to identify Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) among
unidentified INTEGRAL sources. This method consists of cross-correlating
unidentified sources listed in the fourth IBIS Survey Catalogue first with
infrared and then with radio catalogues and a posteriori verifying, by means of
X-ray and optical follow up observations, the likelihood of these associations.
In order to test this method, a sample of 8 sources has been extracted from the
fourth IBIS Catalogue. For 7 sources of the sample we obtained an
identification, whereas the last one (IGR J03103+5706) has insufficient
information for a clear classification and deserves more in-depth study. We
identified three objects (IGR J08190-3835, IGR J17520-6018, IGR J21441+4640) as
AGNs and suggest that three more (IGR J00556+7708, IGRJ17219-1509, IGR
J21268+6203) are likely active galaxies on the basis of their radio spectra,
near-infrared photometry and location above the Galaxy plane. One source (IGR
J05583-1257) has been classified as a starburst galaxy but it might have been
spuriously associated with the INTEGRAL detection.
