We present results of non-LTE modeling of H-alpha 6563 A and Mg II k&h 2796 A
and 2803 A lines. This modeling is important for interpretation of coordinated
observations from the recently launched NASA's IRIS mission and from the New
Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory. Among available codes for the
non-LTE modeling, the RH code is chosen as the most appropriate for modeling of
the line profiles. The most suitable Hydrogen and Magnesium atomic models are
selected by performing several tests of the code. The influence of the
ionization degree on the line profiles is also studied. Radiative-MHD
simulations of the solar atmosphere, obtained with the Bifrost code, are used
as input data for calculation of synthetic spectra of the H-alpha and Mg II h&k
lines for particular locations evolving with time. The spectral line variations
reveal the presence of MHD waves in the simulation results. We construct
oscillation power spectra of the line intensity for different wavelength, and
compare these with the corresponding height-dependent power spectra of
atmospheric parameters from the simulations. We find correlations between the
power spectra of intensities of the line profiles at certain wavelengths and
the power spectra of the atmospheric parameters at the tau-unity heights for
these wavelengths. These results provide a new diagnostic method of
chromospheric oscillations; however, larger amounts of data are needed to
confirm these correlations.
