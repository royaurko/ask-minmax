The Andravida EQ, Greece (8/6/2008, Ms=7.0R) seismic parameters: location,
time of occurrence and magnitude were determined "a posteriori" in an attempt
to verify the predictability of the large EQs. The Earth's electric field,
after its processing by de-noising techniques, was used, in conjunction with
appropriate physical models, for the determination of the epicenter by
triangulation. The time of occurrence was determined in very short-term mode by
the use of the tidal waves (M1, K1) and the "strange attractor like" seismic
electric precursor, while its magnitude was calculated by the application of
the "lithospheric seismic energy flow model" applied on the past seismicity of
the Andravida EQ regional seismogenic area. The quite accurate obtained results
corroborate the validity of the methodology and suggest its use as a valuable
tool for predicting large earthquakes. Key words: earthquake prediction,
epicenter area, time of occurrence, earthquake magnitude, seismic potential,
tidal waves.
