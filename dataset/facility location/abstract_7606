Using high resolution spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we
map the electronic structure and spin texture of the surface states of the
topological insulator Sb2Te3. In combination with density functional
calculations (DFT), we directly show that Sb2Te3 exhibits a partially occupied,
single spin-Dirac cone around the Fermi energy, which is topologically
protected. DFT obtains a spin polarization of the occupied Dirac cone states of
80-90%, which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental data after
careful background subtraction. Furthermore, we observe a strongly spin-orbit
split surface band at lower energy. This state is found at 0.8eV below the
Fermi level at the gamma-point, disperses upwards, and disappears at about
0.4eV below the Fermi level into two different bulk bands. Along the gamma-K
direction, the band is located within a spin-orbit gap. According to an
argument given by Pendry and Gurman in 1975, such a gap must contain a surface
state, if it is located away from the high symmetry points of the Brillouin
zone. Thus, the novel spin-split state is protected by symmetry, too.
