The Canadian Cluster Comparison Project is a comprehensive multi-wavelength
survey targeting 50 massive X-ray selected clusters of galaxies to examine
baryonic tracers of cluster mass and to probe the cluster-to-cluster variation
in the thermal properties of the hot intracluster medium. In this paper we
present the weak lensing masses, based on the analysis of deep wide-field
imaging data obtained using the Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope. The final
sample includes two additional clusters that were located in the field-of-view.
We take these masses as our reference for the comparison of cluster properties
at other wavelengths. In this paper we limit the comparison to published
measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. We find that this signal
correlates well with the projected lensing mass, with an intrinsic scatter of
12\pm5% at ~r_2500, demonstrating it is an excellent proxy for cluster mass.
