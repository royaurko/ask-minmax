Our correlation analysis of Swift gamma-ray burst coordinates and nearby star
locations (catalog Gliese) reveals 4 coincidences with angular accuracy better
than 0.1 degree. The random probability is 2\times 10^{-4}, so evidencing that
coincident stars are indeed gamma-ray burst sources. The fifth coincident
gamma-burst could be added (angular accuracy 0.14 degree) with random
probability for 5 events \sim 10^{-5}.
