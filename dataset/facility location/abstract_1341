We propose the concept of Action-Related Place (ARPlace) as a powerful and
flexible representation of task-related place in the context of mobile
manipulation. ARPlace represents robot base locations not as a single position,
but rather as a collection of positions, each with an associated probability
that the manipulation action will succeed when located there. ARPlaces are
generated using a predictive model that is acquired through experience-based
learning, and take into account the uncertainty the robot has about its own
location and the location of the object to be manipulated.
  When executing the task, rather than choosing one specific goal position
based only on the initial knowledge about the task context, the robot
instantiates an ARPlace, and bases its decisions on this ARPlace, which is
updated as new information about the task becomes available. To show the
advantages of this least-commitment approach, we present a transformational
planner that reasons about ARPlaces in order to optimize symbolic plans. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that using ARPlaces leads to more robust and
efficient mobile manipulation in the face of state estimation uncertainty on
our simulated robot.
