At passage of 21-cm pulsar radiation through clouds of neutral hydrogen atoms
the signal in the region of anomalous dispersion is appearing as faster-than-c.
As unlike laboratory researches separate scatterers are located on big
distances from each other, this effect can be attributed only to the
consecutive independent scattering on isolated atoms. For its explanation we
must accept that photons are emitted and absorbed on the distances \lamda/2, in
a near field, instantaneously. Such peculiarity of near field has been
established earlier within the frame of QED and explains, quantitatively and
qualitatively, different "superluminal" observations. It shows that processes
of absorption and reemission of photons do not submit to requirements of
special relativity describing only uniform movements, and consequently
possibilities of faster-than-c phenomena in the near field are not excluded.
