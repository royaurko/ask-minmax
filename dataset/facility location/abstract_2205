Optical long baseline interferometry is a technique that has generated almost
850 refereed papers to date. The targets span a large variety of objects from
planetary systems to extragalactic studies and all branches of stellar physics.
We have created a database hosted by the JMMC and connected to the Optical Long
Baseline Interferometry Newsletter (OLBIN) web site using MySQL and a
collection of XML or PHP scripts in order to store and classify these
publications. Each entry is defined by its ADS bibcode, includes basic ADS
informations and metadata. The metadata are specified by tags sorted in
categories: interferometric facilities, instrumentation, wavelength of
operation, spectral resolution, type of measurement, target type, and paper
category, for example. The whole OLBIN publication list has been processed and
we present how the database is organized and can be accessed. We use this tool
to generate statistical plots of interest for the community in optical long
baseline interferometry.
