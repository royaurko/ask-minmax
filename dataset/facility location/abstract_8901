We present a method for finding clusters of young stars in M31 using
broadband WFPC2 data from the HST data archive. Applying our identification
method to 13 WFPC2 fields, covering an area of ~60 arcmin^2, has revealed 79
new candidate young star clusters in these portions of the M31 disk. Most of
these clusters are small (~<5 pc) young (~10-200 Myr) star groups located
within large OB associations. We have estimated the reddening values and the
ages of each candidate individually by fitting isochrones to the stellar
photometry. We provide a catalog of the candidates including rough
approximations of their reddenings and ages. We also look for patterns of
cluster formation with galactocentric distance, but our rough estimates are not
precise enough to reveal any clear patterns.
