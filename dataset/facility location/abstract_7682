The GRS is a one of the important units in Erbil Power Station EPS, which is
responsible on controlling gas pressure and gas temperature this unit
previously works manually. The local control panel for GRS system contains two
types of digital signals the first one indicated by Light Emitting Diodes LED
to point normal operations, fault and alarm, and event of operations while the
second indicated by ON-OFF switches, which consists of two types the push
buttons switch and mode selector switch. To overcome human in manual control
faults in controlling GRS systems, automation system becomes the best solution.
The purpose of this research is to design and implement embedded automation
system that can be used to control a GRS automatically through a GUI and from
remote location by using programmable interface controller (PIC16F877A). In
this research the (PIC) software which is based on (C language), developed by
Microchip (MPLAB) is used in programming a PIC microcontroller, then Visual
Basic is used in the construction of GUI, the RS-232 serial cable is used as a
connector between PIC and PC. Implement the proposed design and test it as a
first system shows all operations of GRS successful were converted into full
computerize controlling (with the ability of full automatic control) from
remote location through proposed GUI. Keywords-Peripheral Interface Controller
