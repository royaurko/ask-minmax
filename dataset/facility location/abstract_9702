Multiple scattering of waves leads to many peculiar phenomena such as
complete band gaps in periodic structures and wave localization in disordered
media. Within a band gap excitations are evanescent; when localized they remain
confined in space until dissipated. Here we report acoustic band gap and
localization in a 2D system of air-cylinders in water. Exact numerical
calculations reveal the unexpected result that localization is relatively
independent of the precise location or organization of the scatterers.
Localization occurs within a finite region of frequencies, coincident with the
complete band gap predicted by a conventional band structure calculation for a
periodic lattice of scatterers. Inside the gap or localization regime, a
previously uninvestigated stable collective behavior of the cylinders appears.
