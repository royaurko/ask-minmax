I review the use of ROSAT over the last years for the investigation of well
localized gamma-ray burst (GRB) error boxes. In particular, I cover (i) the
systematic study of several dozens of IPN locations using the ROSAT
All-Sky-Survey data, (ii) results of deep ROSAT pointings of selected small GRB
error boxes, (iii) the attempts for and results of quick follow-up observations
after GRB events including the three GRBs localized with BeppoSAX, (iv) the
correlation of GRB locations with serendipitous ROSAT pointings and (v) the
search for X-ray flashes in the database of pointed ROSAT observations.
