Long-running service workloads (e.g. web search engine) and short-term data
analytic workloads (e.g. Hadoop MapReduce jobs) often co-locate in today's data
centers. Developing realistic benchmarks reflecting such practical scenarios is
a key problem to produce trustworthy results when evaluating and comparing data
center systems. This requires both actual workloads and their arrivals to
follow patterns hidden in real-world traces. However, existing benchmarks
either generate actual workloads based on probability models, or replay
workload traces using synthetic workloads. To fill this gap, we propose a
benchmark tool that is a first step towards generating a mix of realistic
service and data analytic workloads on the basis of real workload traces. Our
tool includes a combiner that enables the replaying of actual workloads
according to the workload traces, and a multi-tenant generator that assists
benchmark users to flexibly scale the workloads according to their
requirements. Based on this, our demo illustrates the workload customization
and generation process using the visual interface of our tool. The proposed
tool, called BigDataBench-MT, is a multi-tenant version of our comprehensive
benchmark suite BigDataBench and it is publicly available from
http://prof.ict.ac.cn/BigDataBench/multi-tenancyversion.
