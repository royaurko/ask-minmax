The KaoS spectrometer at the Mainz Microtron MAMI, Germany, is perceived as
the ideal candidate for a dedicated spectrometer in kaon and hypernuclei
electroproduction. KaoS will be equipped with new read-out electronics, a
completely new focal plane detector package consisting of scintillating fibres,
and a new trigger system. First prototypes of the fibre detectors and the
associated new front-end electronics are shown in this contribution. The Mainz
hypernuclei research program will complement the hypernuclear experiments at
the planned FAIR facility at GSI, Germany. At the proposed antiproton storage
ring the spectroscopy of double Lambda hypernuclei is one of the four main
topics which will be addressed by the PANDA Collaboration. The experiments
require the operation of high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors in high
magnetic fields (B= 1T) in the presence of a large hadronic background. The
performance of high resolution Ge detectors in such an environment has been
investigated.
