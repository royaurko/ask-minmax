Four Bok globules were studied in the Near-Infrared, through narrow-band
filters, centered at the 1.644 micron line of [FeII], the H2-line at 2.122
micron, and the adjacent continuum. We report the discovery of [FeII] and H2
protostellar jets and knots in the globules CB3 and CB230. The [FeII]-jet in
CB230 is defined by a continuous elongated emission feature, superimposed on
which two knots are seen; the brighter one lies at the tip of the jet. The jet
is oriented in the same direction as the large-scale CO outflow, and emerges
from the nebulosity in which a Young Stellar Object is embedded. The H2
emission associated with this jet is fainter and wider than the [FeII]
emission, and is likely coming from the walls of the jet-channel. In CB3 four
H2 emission knots are found, all towards the blue-shifted lobe of the
large-scale outflow. There is a good correspondence between the location of the
knots and the blue-shifted SiO(5-4) emission, confirming that SiO emission is
tracing the jet-like flow rather well. No line emission is found in the other
two targets, CB188 and CB205, although in CB205 faint line emission may have
been hidden in the diffuse nebulosity near the IRAS position. Around this
position a small group of (> 10) stars is found, embedded in the nebula. A
diffuse jet-like feature near this group, previously reported in the
literature, has been resolved into individual stars.
