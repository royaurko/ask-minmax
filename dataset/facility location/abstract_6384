All the geometric phases are shown to be topologically trivial by using the
second quantized formulation. The exact hidden local symmetry in the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation, which was hitherto unrecognized, controls the
holonomy associated with both of the adiabatic and non-adiabatic geometric
phases. The second quantized formulation is located in between the first
quantized formulation and the field theory, and thus it is convenient to
compare the geometric phase with the chiral anomaly in field theory. It is
shown that these two notions are completely different.
