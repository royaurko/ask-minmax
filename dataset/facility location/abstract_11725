We propose a holographic model of baryon interactions based on
non-supersymmetric D7-anti-D7 flavor branes embedded in the Klebanov-Strassler
background. The baryons are D3-branes wrapping the 3-sphere of the conifold
with M strings connecting the D3 and the flavor branes. Depending on the
location of the latter there are two possibilities: the D3 either remains
separate from the flavor branes or dissolves in them and becomes a flavor
instanton. The leading order interaction between the baryons is a competition
between the attraction and the repulsion due to the sigma and omega mesons. The
lightest 0++ particle sigma is a pseudo-Goldstone boson associated with the
spontaneous breaking of scale invariance. In a certain range of parameters it
is parametrically lighter than any other massive state. As a result at large
distances baryons attract each other. At short distances the potential admits a
repulsive core due to an exchange of the omega vector meson. We discuss baryon
coupling to glueballs, massive mesons and pions and point out the condition for
the model to have a small binding energy.
