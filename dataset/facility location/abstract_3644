We systematically establish the hyper-surface within the tan(beta), top quark
mass m_t, universal gaugino mass M_1/2, and vectorlike mass M_V parameter
volume which is compatible with the application of the No-Scale Supergravity
boundary conditions, particularly the vanishing of the Higgs bilinear soft term
B_mu, near to the Planck mass at the point M_F of ultimate F-lipped SU(5)
unification. M_F is elevated from the penultimate partial unification near the
traditional GUT scale at a mass M_32 by the inclusion of extra F-theory derived
heavy vectorlike multiplets. We demonstrate that simultaneous adherence to all
current experimental constraints, most importantly contributions to the muon
anomalous magnetic moment (g-2)_mu, the branching ratio limit on (b \to s
gamma), and the 7-year WMAP relic density measurement, dramatically reduces the
allowed solutions to a highly non-trivial "golden strip" with tan(beta) \sim
15, m_t = 173.0-174.4 GeV, M_1/2 = 455-481 GeV, and M_V = 691-1020 GeV,
effectively eliminating all extraneously tunable model parameters. We emphasize
that the consonance of the theoretically viable m_t range with the
experimentally established value is an independently correlated "postdiction".
The predicted range of M_V is testable at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The
partial lifetime for proton decay in the leading (e+|mu+) pi0 channels falls
around 4.6 X 10^34 Y, testable at the future DUSEL and Hyper-Kamiokande
facilities.
