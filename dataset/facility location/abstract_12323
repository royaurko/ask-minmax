When a stellar-mass compact object is captured by a supermassive black hole
located in a galactic centre, the system losses energy and angular momentum by
the emission of gravitational waves. Subsequently, the stellar compact object
evolves inspiraling until plunging onto the massive black hole. These EMRI
systems are expected to be one of the main sources of gravitational waves for
the future space-based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). However, the
detection of EMRI signals will require of very accurate theoretical templates
taking into account the gravitational self-force, which is the responsible of
the stellar-compact object inspiral. Due to its potential applicability on
EMRIs, the obtention of an efficient method to compute the scalar self-force
acting on a point-like particle orbiting around a massive black hole is being
object of increasing interest. We present here a review of our time-domain
numerical technique to compute the self-force acting on a point-like particle
and we show its suitability to deal with both circular and eccentric orbits.
