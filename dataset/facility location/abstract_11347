HD 152219 is a massive binary system with O9.5 III + B1-2 V/III components
and a short orbital period of 4.2 d. Its primary component further displays
clear line profile variability (LPV). The primary component being located
within the pulsational instability domain predicted for high-luminosity stars,
we previously suggested that the observed LPV could be associated with
non-radial pulsations. The aim of the present work is to determine the nature
of the observed LPV in the spectrum of the primary component of HD
152219.During a 4-night FEROS monitoring campaign, we collected a new set of
134 high signal-to-noise spectra. These new observations were then used to
re-investigate the variability of different line profiles in the spectrum of HD
152219. Based on the present analysis, we discard the non-radial pulsations and
point out the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect as the cause of the LPV in HD 152219.
The upper limit on the amplitude of possible weak pulsations is set at a few
parts per thousand of the continuum level.
