Results of a 1999 November 16--17 BeppoSAX observation of the low-mass X-ray
binary X2127+119 located in the globular cluster NGC7078 are presented. The
system is believed to be one where the central neutron star is normally
obscured by the accretion disk, and only X-rays scattered into our line of
sight by an extended accretion disk corona (ADC) are observed. The 0.1--10 keV
lightcurve is energy dependent and shows two partial eclipses separated by the
17.1 hr orbital period. The 0.1--100 keV spectrum is unusually complex, but can
be successfully modeled using a partially covered power-law and disk-blackbody
model. Together with a column consistent with the interstellar value to
NGC7078, about 60% of the source is covered by an additional column of 1E22
atom/cm2. The absorbed component may be X-rays that pass through the outer
layers of the accretion disk. The energy dependent intensity variations by a
factor of ~2 may be modeled as due to a changing normalization of the
disk-blackbody. None of the other spectral parameters appear to clearly depend
on luminosity. The same spectral model is also able to fit an archival ASCA
spectrum.
