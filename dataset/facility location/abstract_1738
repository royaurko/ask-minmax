Differential cross sections and beam asymmetries for coherent \pi^\circ
photoproduction from ^4He in the \Delta energy-range have been measured with
high statistical and systematic precisions using both decay photons for
identifying the process.The experiment was performed at the MAinz MIcrotron
using the TAPS photon spectrometer and the Glasgow/Mainz tagged photon
facility. The differential cross sections are in excellent agreement with
predictions based on the DWIA if an appropriate parametrization of the
\Delta-nuclear interaction is applied. The beam asymmetries are interpreted in
terms of degrees of linear polarization of collimated coherent bremsstrahlung.
The expected increase of the degree of linear polarization with decreasing
collimation angle is confirmed. Agreement with calculations is obtained on a
few-percent level of precision in the maxima of the coherent peaks.
