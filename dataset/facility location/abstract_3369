A search for nu_mu -> nu_e oscillations has been conducted with the LSND
apparatus at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility. Using nu_mu from pi^+ decay
in flight, the nu_e appearance is detected via the charged-current reaction
C(nu_e,e^-)X. Two independent analyses observe a total of 40 beam-on
high-energy electron events (60 < E_e < 200 MeV) consistent with the above
signature. This number is significantly above the 21.9 +- 2.1 events expected
from the nu_e contamination in the beam and the beam-off background. If
interpreted as an oscillation signal, the observed oscillation probability of
(2.6 +- 1.0 +- 0.5) x 10^{-3} is consistent with the previously reported
nu_mu_bar -> nu_e_bar oscillation evidence from LSND.
