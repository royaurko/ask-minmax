We study the universality class and critical properties of the electroweak
theory at finite temperature. Such critical behaviour is found near the
endpoint m_H=m_{H,c} of the line of first order electroweak phase transitions
in a wide class of theories, including the Standard Model (SM) and a part of
the parameter space of the Minimal Sypersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We
find that the location of the endpoint corresponds to the Higgs mass m_{H,c} =
72(2) GeV in the SM with sin^2 theta_W = 0, and m_{H,c} < 80 GeV with sin^2
theta_W = 0.23. As experimentally m_H > 88 GeV, there is no electroweak phase
transition in the SM. We compute the corresponding critical indices and provide
strong evidence that the phase transitions near the endpoint fall into the
three dimensional Ising universality class.
