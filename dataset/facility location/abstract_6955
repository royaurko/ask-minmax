The phase shift analysis for position location of the 2S1/2 resonance at 1,5
MeV was carried out on the basis of the known experimental measurements. Also,
the possibility to describe the available experimental data on the
astrophysical S-factor for the proton capture reaction on 14C to the ground
state of 15N at astrophysical energies was considered in the frame of modified
potential cluster model.
