Time-independent Hamiltonian flows are viewed as geodesic flows in a curved
manifold, so that the onset of chaos hinges on properties of the curvature
two-form entering into the Jacobi equation. Attention focuses on ensembles of
orbit segments evolved in 2-D potentials, examining how various orbital
properties correlate with the mean value and dispersion, <K> and k, of the
trace K of the curvature. Unlike most analyses, which have attributed chaos to
negative curvature, this work exploits the fact that geodesics can be chaotic
even if K is everywhere positive, chaos arising as a parameteric instability
triggered by regular variations in K along the orbit. For ensembles of fixed
energy, with both regular and chaotic segments, simple patterns connect the
values of <K> and k for different segments, both with each other and with the
short time Lyapunov exponent X. Often, but not always, there is a near one-to-
one correlation between <K> and k, a plot of these quantities approximating a
simple curve. X varies smoothly along this curve, chaotic segments located
furthest from the regular regions tending systematically to have the largest
X's. For regular orbits, <K> and k also vary smoothly with ``distance'' from
the chaotic phase space regions, as probed, e.g., by the location of the
initial condition on a surface of section. Many of these observed properties
can be understood qualitatively in terms of a one-dimensional Mathieu equation.
