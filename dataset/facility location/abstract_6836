We investigate the community structure of the global ownership network of
transnational corporations. We find a pronounced organization in communities
that cannot be explained by randomness. Despite the global character of this
network, communities reflect first of all the geographical location of firms,
while the industrial sector plays only a marginal role. We also analyze the
network in which the nodes are the communities and the links are obtained by
aggregating the links among firms belonging to pairs of communities. We analyze
the network centrality of the top 50 communities and we provide the first
quantitative assessment of the financial sector role in connecting the global
economy.
