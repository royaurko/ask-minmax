We report the detection of a new H2CO maser in the massive star forming
region G23.71-0.20 (IRAS 18324-0820), i.e., the fifth region in the Galaxy
where H2CO maser emission has been found. The new H2CO maser is located toward
a compact HII region, and is coincident in velocity and position with 6.7 GHz
methanol masers and with an IR source as revealed by Spitzer/IRAC GLIMPSE data.
The coincidence with an IR source and 6.7 GHz methanol masers suggests that the
maser is in close proximity to an embedded massive protostar. Thus, the
detection of H2CO maser emission toward G23.71-0.20 supports the trend that
H2CO 6cm masers trace molecular material very near young massive stellar
objects.
