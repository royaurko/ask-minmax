We detect a fast outflow of neutral and ionized gas with velocities up to
about 1000 km/s from the central region of radio galaxy 3C 293. With optical
spectroscopy we locate the bulk of the ionized gas outflow at the position of a
bright radio hot-spot in the inner radio jet, about 1 kpc east of the nucleus.
Given the presence of large amounts of cold gas and the distorted morphology of
the radio jet in this region, we argue that the ISM is pushed out by a severe
interaction with the radio plasma. The similarity of the outflow of HI with the
ionized gas outflow that we see at the position of the radio hot-spot suggests
that despite the high energies involved in the jet-ISM interaction, part of the
gas stays, or becomes again, neutral. In this paper we also present the
detection of HI emission in three nearby companions of 3C 293.
