The number of pulsars with detected emission at X-ray and gamma-ray energies
has been steadily growing, showing that beams of high-energy particles are
commonly accelerated in pulsar magnetospheres, even though the location and
number of acceleration sites remain unsettled. Acceleration near the magnetic
poles, close to the polar cap surface or to higher altitudes in the slot gap
along the last open field lines, involves an electric field component due to
inertial-frame dragging. Acceleration can also take place in the outer
magnetosphere where charge depletion due to global currents causes a large
electric field along the magnetic field lines. All models require a detailed
knowledge of the open magnetosphere geometry and its relativistic distortions.
Observational trends with age, spin-down power and magnetic field as well as
population synthesis studies in the Galactic disc and the nearby Gould Belt
provide useful, however not yet conclusive, constraints on the competing
models.
