A comparison of the close-to-threshold total cross section for the eta prime
production in pp --> pp eta prime and pn --> pn eta prime reactions constitutes
a tool to investigate the eta prime meson structure and the reaction mechanism
in the channels of isospin I=0 and I=1 and may provide insight into the
flavour-singlet (perhaps also into gluonium) content of the eta prime meson. In
this contribution we present preliminary results of measurement of the
quasi-free production of the eta prime meson in the proton-neutron collisions
conducted using the COSY-11 facility.
