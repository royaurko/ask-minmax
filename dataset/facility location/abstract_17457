Faraday rotation measures (RMs) of the polarized emission from extragalactic
radio sources occulted by the coronal plasma were used to infer the radial
profile of the inner heliospheric magnetic field near solar minimum activity.
By inverting LASCO/SOHO polarized brightness (pB) data taken during the days of
observations on May 1997, we retrieved the electron density distribution along
the lines of sight to the sources, thus allowing to disentangle the two plasma
properties that contribute to the observed RMs. By comparing the observed RM
values to those theoretically predicted by a power-law model of the radial
component of the coronal magnetic field, using a best-fitting procedure, we
found that the radial component of the inner heliospheric magnetic field can be
nicely approximated by a power-law of the form B_r = 3.76 r^{-2.29} G in a
range of heights from about 5 to 14 solar radii. Finally, our analysis suggests
that the radial computation of the potential field source surface (PFSS) model
from the Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO), assuming a radial field in the
photosphere and a source surface located at R_{ss} = 2.5 solar radii, is the
preferred choice near solar minimum.
