We use photometric and spectroscopic observations of the detached eclipsing
binary V209 omega Cen to derive the masses, radii, and luminosities of the
component stars. The system exhibits total eclipses and, based on the measured
systemic velocity and the derived distance, is a member of the globular cluster
omega Cen. We obtain 0.945 +/- 0.043 Msun, 0.983 +/- 0.015 Rsun and 6.68 +/-
0.88 Lsun for the cooler, but larger and more luminous primary component. The
secondary component has 0.144 +/- 0.008 Msun, 0.425 +/- 0.008 Rsun and 2.26 +/-
0.28 Lsun. The effective temperatures are estimated at 9370 K for the primary
and at 10866 K for the secondary. On the color-magnitude diagram of the
cluster, the primary component occupies a position between the tip of the blue
straggler region and the extended horizontal branch while the secondary
component is located close to the red border of the area occupied by hot
subdwarfs. However, its radius is too large and its effective temperature is
too low for it to be an sdB star. We propose a scenario leading to the
formation of a system with such unusual properties with the primary component
``re-born'' from a former white dwarf which accreted a new envelope through
mass transfer from its companion. The secondary star has lost most of its
envelope while starting its ascent onto the sub-giant branch. It failed to
ignite helium in its core and is currently powered by a hydrogen burning shell.
