We present the results of a mini-survey for associated HI 21-cm absorption at
z < 0.42 with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. Our targets are radio
galaxies, selected on the basis that the 1216 Angstrom luminosities are below
10^23 W/Hz, above which there has never been a detection of 21-cm absorption.
Of the three sources for which we obtained good data, two are unclassified
active galactic nuclei (AGN) and one is type-2. Being a non-detection, the
type-2 object is consistent with our previous result that 21-cm absorption in
radio sources is not dictated by unified schemes of AGN. In the case of the
detection, the absorption only occurs towards one of the two resolved radio
lobes in PKS 1649-062. If the absorption is due to an another intervening
galaxy, or cool HI gas in the intergalactic medium, covering only the
south-west lobe, then, being at the same redshift, this is likely to be
gravitationally bound to the optical object identified as PKS 1649-062. If the
absorption is due to an inclined disk centred between the lobes, intervening
the SW lobe while being located behind the NE lobe, by assuming that it covers
the emission peak at 150 kpc from the nucleus, we estimate a dynamical mass of
~3 x 10^12 solar masses for the disk.
