SPES (Study for the Production of Exotic Species) is a LNL project that will
produce by the end of this year the conceptual design of a specialized facility
for Radioactive Ion Beam (RIB) originated by fission fragments produced by
secondary neutrons; this facility will be characterized by moderate size,
performance and cost and will allow to produce also intense neutron beams for
activities both in fundamental and applied Nuclear Physics [1]. In the context
of this design study and tightly related to medium size of this facility the
architecture of a distributed control system using the Common Object Request
Broker Architecture (CORBA) [2] as middleware framework and JAVA [3] as main
programming language was investigated for the core sub-systems (diagnostics,
optics, RF-control) of the primary accelerator. The performance of CORBA for
the high level control system was measured in different conditions and showed
to be sufficient to cover the requirements for remote operations, because all
feedback loops will be performed either in specialized hardware or by dedicated
real-time embedded controllers. A minimal programming effort, a good level of
modularity and long-term maintenance were the reasons to choose JAVA and its
related application builders as the main programming language for the Graphical
User Interface (GUI) and the middleware implementations of this project.
