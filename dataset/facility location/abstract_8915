We present a preliminary analysis of the X-ray spectrum of the accretion disk
corona source, 4U 1822-37, obtained with the High Energy Transmission Grating
Spectrometer onboard the Chandra X-ray Observatory. We detect discrete emission
lines from photoionized iron, silicon, magnesium, neon, and oxygen, as well as
a bright iron fluorescence line. Phase-resolved spectroscopy suggests that the
recombination emission comes from an X-ray illuminated bulge located at the
predicted point of impact between the disk and the accretion stream. The
fluorescence emission originates in an extended region on the disk that is
illuminated by light scattered from the corona.
