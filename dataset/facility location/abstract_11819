Querying is one of the basic functionality expected from a database system.
Query efficiency is adversely affected by increase in the number of
participating tables. Also, querying based on syntax largely limits the gamut
of queries a database system can process. Syntactic queries rely on the
database table structure, which is a cause of concern for large organisations
due to incompatibility between heterogeneous systems that store data
distributed across geographic locations. Solution to these problems is answered
to some extent by moving towards semantic technology by making data and the
database meaningful. In doing so, relationship between sets of entity sets will
not be limited only to syntactic constraints but would also permit semantic
connections nonetheless such relationships may be tacit, intangible and
invisible. The goal of this work is to extract such hidden relationships
between unrelated sets of entity sets and store them in a tangible form. A few
sample cases are provided to vindicate that the proposed work improves querying
significantly.
