Gravitational weak lensing maps the location of (dark) matter at all scales.
The lens-induced distortion field traces gravity fields and can be used to
reconstruct the mass distribution in galaxies, groups, clusters of galaxies or
large-scale structures. From these reconstructions, one can in principle
recover where the matter is, what are its properties and how it is coupled with
light and baryons. In the following, we review the present status of weak
lensing analysis and discuss the most recent results regarding matter
properties in the universe.
