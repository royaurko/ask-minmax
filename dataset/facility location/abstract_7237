We present NOT optical observations of a clump (l = 127.9435 deg, b = +1.8298
deg), embedded in an extended, irregularly shaped, diffuse optical nebula. This
condensation shows an emission-line spectrum typical of classic HII regions.
Although its location on the sky coincides with a nearby extended photoionized
region recently identified by Cichowolski et al. (2003) in radio data from the
Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS), the systemic velocity of this ~ 1
arcmin-sized HII region, V_LSR = -71$\pm$12 km/s, poses it far out in the
Galaxy, beyond the Perseus arm. The location of this region in the Galaxy is
supported by HI structures visible at comparable radial velocity on CGPS data.
We argue that this HII region might belong to an outer Galactic arm. The
emission line ratios of the surrounding extended nebula, whose radial velocity
is consistent with that of the small HII region, are typical of photoionized
gas in the low density limit. Smaller clumps of comparable surface brightness
are visible within the optical boundaries of the extended, faint nebula. After
comparison of the optical data with far infrared and radio observations, we
conclude that this nebula is an HII region, ~ 70 pc in size, probably
photoionized by an association of OB stars and surrounded by a ring of neutral
hydrogen.
