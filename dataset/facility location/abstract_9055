Time series BVI photometry is presented for 16 short-period variables located
in the central region of the globular cluster NGC 6397. The sample includes 9
newly detected variables. The light curve of cataclysmic variable CV6 shows
variability with a period of 0.2356 days. We confirm an earlier reported period
of 0.472 days for cataclysmic variable CV1. Phased light curves of both CVs
exhibit sine-like light curves, with two minima occurring during each orbital
cycle. The secondary component of CV1 has a low average density of 0.83
g/cm^{3} indicating that it cannot be a normal main sequence star. Variables
among the cluster blue stragglers include a likely detached eclipsing binary
with orbital period of 0.787 days, three new SX Phe stars (one of which has the
extremely short period of 0.0215 days), and three low amplitude variables which
are possible gamma Doradus variables.
