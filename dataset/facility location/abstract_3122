We report on a magneto-Raman scattering study of graphene flakes located on
the surface of a bulk graphite substrate. By spatially mapping the Raman
scattering response of the surface of bulk graphite with an applied magnetic
field, we pinpoint specific locations which show the electronic excitation
spectrum of graphene. We present the characteristic Raman scattering signatures
of these specific locations. We show that such flakes can be superimposed with
another flake and still exhibit a graphene-like excitation spectrum.
  Two different excitation laser energies (514.5 and 720 nm) are used to
investigate the excitation wavelength dependence of the electronic Raman
scattering signal.
