We present phase-resolved spectroscopy of AM Herculis obtained with the
HST/GHRS when the system was in a high state. The ultraviolet light curve shows
a quasi-sinusoidal modulation, which can be explained by a hot spot on the
rotating white dwarf. The broad Lalpha absorption expected for photospheric
radiation of a moderately hot white dwarf is largely filled in with emission.
The UV/FUV spectrum of AM Her in high state can be quantitatively understood by
a two-component model consisting of the unheated white dwarf plus a
blackbody-like radiating hot spot. A kinematic study of the strong UV emission
lines using Doppler tomography is presented. The characteristics of the low
ionization species lines and the SiIV doublet can be explained within the
classical picture, as broad emission from the accretion stream and narrow
emission from the heated hemisphere of the secondary. However, we find that the
narrow emission of the NV doublet originates from material of low velocity
dispersion located somewhere between L_1 and the centre of mass. The high
signal-to-noise spectra contain a multitude of interstellar absorption lines
but no metal absorption lines from the white dwarf photosphere.
