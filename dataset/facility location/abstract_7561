We present aperture synthesis observations in the 21 cm line of pointings
centered on the Virgo Cluster region spirals NGC 4307, NGC 4356, NGC 4411B, and
NGC 4492 using the Very Large Array (VLA) radiotelescope in its CS
configuration. These galaxies were identified in a previous study of the
three-dimensional distribution of HI emission in the Virgo region as objects
with a substantial dearth of atomic gas and Tully-Fisher (TF) distance
estimates that located them well outside the main body of the cluster. We have
detected two other galaxies located in two of our fields and observed bands,
the spiral NGC 4411A and the dwarf spiral VCC 740. We provide detailed
information of the gas morphology and kinematics for all these galaxies. Our
new data confirm the strong HI-deficiency of all the main targets but NGC
4411B, which is found to have a fairly normal neutral gas content. The VLA
observations have also been used to discuss the applicability of TF techniques
to the five largest spirals we have observed. We conclude that none of them is
actually suitable for a TF distance evaluation, whether due to the radical
trimming of their neutral hydrogen disks (NGC 4307, NGC 4356, and NGC 4492) or
to their nearly face-on orientation (NGC 4411A and B).
