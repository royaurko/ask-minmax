We present a method of atmospheric Cherenkov imaging which reconstructs the
unique arrival direction of TeV gamma rays using a single telescope. The method
is derived empirically and utilizes several features of gamma-ray induced air
showers which determine, to a precision of 0.12 degrees, the arrival direction
of photons, on an event-by-event basis. Data from the Whipple Observatory's 10
m gamma-ray telescope is utilized to test selection methods based on source
location. The results compare these selection methods with traditional
techniques and three different camera fields of view. The method will be
discussed in the context of a search for a gamma-ray signal from a point source
located anywhere within the field of view and from regions of extended
emission.
