This article studies the weak convergence and associated Central Limit
Theorem for blurring and nonblurring processes. Then, they are applied to the
estimation of location parameter. Simulation studies show that the location
estimation based on the convergence point of blurring process is more robust
and often more efficient than that of nonblurring process.
