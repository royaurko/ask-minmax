Complex spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression underlie embryo
differentiation, yet methods do not yet exist for the efficient genome-wide
determination of spatial expression patterns during development. In situ
imaging of transcripts and proteins is the gold-standard, but it is difficult
and time consuming to apply to an entire genome, even when highly automated.
Sequencing, in contrast, is fast and genome-wide, but is generally applied to
homogenized tissues, thereby discarding spatial information. It is likely that
these methods will ultimately converge, and we will be able to sequence RNAs in
situ, simultaneously determining their identity and location. As a step along
this path, we developed methods to cryosection individual blastoderm stage
Drosophila melanogaster embryos along the anterior-posterior axis and sequence
the mRNA isolated from each 25 micron slice. The spatial patterns of gene
expression we infer closely match patterns previously determined by in situ
hybridization and microscopy. We applied this method to generate a genome-wide
timecourse of spatial gene expression from shortly after fertilization through
gastrulation. We identify numerous genes with spatial patterns that have not
yet been described in the several ongoing systematic in situ based projects.
This simple experiment demonstrates the potential for combining careful
anatomical dissection with high-throughput sequencing to obtain spatially
resolved gene expression on a genome-wide scale.
