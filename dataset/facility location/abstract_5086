This paper considers the problem of recovering an ensemble of Diracs on a
sphere from its low resolution measurements. The Diracs can be located at any
location on the sphere, not necessarily on a grid. We show that under a
separation condition, one can recover the ensemble with high precision by a
three-stage algorithm, which consists of solving a semi-definite program, root
finding and least-square fitting. The algorithm's computation time depends
solely on the number of measurements, and not on the required solution
accuracy. We also show that in the special case of non-negative ensembles, a
sparsity condition is sufficient for recovery. Furthermore, in the discrete
setting, we estimate the recovery error in the presence of noise as a function
of the noise level and the super-resolution factor.
