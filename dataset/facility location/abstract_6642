The paper is devoted to problem of spline approximation. A new method of
nodes location for curves and surfaces computer construction by means of
B-splines and results of simulink-modeling is presented. The advantages of this
paper is that we comprise the basic spline with classical polynomials both on
accuracy, as well as degree of paralleling calculations are also shown.
