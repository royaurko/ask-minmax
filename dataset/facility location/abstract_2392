We calculate theoretically the formation spectra of eta'(958)-nucleus systems
in the (p,d) reaction for the investigation of the in-medium modification of
the eta' mass. We show the comprehensive numerical calculations based on a
simple form of the eta' optical potential in nuclei with various potential
depths. We conclude that one finds an evidence of possible attractive
interaction between eta' and nucleus as peak structure appearing around the
eta' threshold in light nuclei such as 11C when the attractive potential is
stronger than 100 MeV and the absorption width is of order of 40 MeV or less.
Spectroscopy of the (p,d) reaction is expected to be performed experimentally
at existing facilities, such as GSI. We also estimate the contributions from
the omega and phi mesons, which have masses close to the eta' meson, concluding
that the observation of the peak structure of the eta'-mesic nuclei is not
disturbed although their contributions may not be small.
