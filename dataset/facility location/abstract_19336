The Pan Andromeda Archeological Survey (PAndAS) CFHT Megaprime survey of the
M31-M33 system has found a star stream which extends about 120 kpc NW from the
center of M31. The great length of the stream, and the likelihood that it does
not significantly intersect the disk of M31, means that it is unusually well
suited for a measurement of stream gaps and clumps along its length as a test
for the predicted thousands of dark matter sub-halos. The main result of this
paper is that the density of the stream varies between zero and about three
times the mean along its length on scales of 2 to 20 kpc. The probability that
the variations are random fluctuations in the star density is less than 10^-5.
As a control sample we search for density variations at precisely the same
location in stars with metallicity higher than the stream, [Fe/H]=[0, -0.5] and
find no variations above the expected shot noise. The lumpiness of the stream
is not compatible with a low mass star stream in a smooth galactic potential,
nor is it readily compatible with the disturbance caused by the visible M31
satellite galaxies. The stream's density variations appear to be consistent
with the effects of a large population of steep mass function dark matter
sub-halos, such as found in LCDM simulations, acting on an approximately 10Gyr
old star stream. The effects of a single set of halo substructure realizations
are shown for illustration, reserving a statistical comparison for another
study.
