While death rates due to diseases of the heart have experienced a sharp
decline over the past 50 years, these diseases continue to be the leading cause
of death in the United States, and the rate of decline varies by geographic
location, race, and gender. We look to harness the power of hierarchical
Bayesian methods to obtain a clearer picture of the declines from county-level,
temporally varying heart disease death rates for men and women of different
races in the US. Specifically, we propose a nonseparable multivariate
spatio-temporal Bayesian model which allows for group-specific temporal
correlations and temporally-evolving covariance structures in the multivariate
spatio-temporal component of the model. After verifying the effectiveness of
our model via simulation, we apply our model to a dataset of over 200,000
county-level heart disease death rates. In addition to yielding a superior fit
than other common approaches for handling such data, the richness of our model
provides insight into racial, gender, and geographic disparities underlying
heart disease death rates in the US which are not permitted by more restrictive
models.
