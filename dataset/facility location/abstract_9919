We study target-searching processes on a percolation, on which a hunter
tracks a target by smelling odors it emits. The odor intensity is supposed to
be inversely proportional to the distance it propagates. The Monte Carlo
simulation is performed on a 2-dimensional bond-percolation above the
threshold. Having no idea of the location of the target, the hunter determines
its moves only by random attempts in each direction. For lager percolation
connectivity $p\gtrsim 0.90$, it reveals a scaling law for the searching time
versus the distance to the position of the target. The scaling exponent is
dependent on the sensitivity of the hunter. For smaller $p$, the scaling law is
broken and the probability of finding out the target significantly reduces. The
hunter seems trapped in the cluster of the percolation and can hardly reach the
goal.
