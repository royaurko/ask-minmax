It is well known that the Dirac monopole solution with the U(1) gauge group
embedded into the group SU(2) is equivalent to the SU(2) Wu-Yang point monopole
solution having no Dirac string singularity. We consider a multi-center
configuration of m Dirac monopoles and n anti-monopoles and its embedding into
SU(2) gauge theory. Using geometric methods, we construct an explicit solution
of the SU(2) Yang-Mills equations which generalizes the Wu-Yang solution to the
case of m monopoles and n anti-monopoles located at arbitrary points in R^3.
