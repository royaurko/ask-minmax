We present the results of a HST/NICMOS coronagraphic survey for the direct
detection of substellar companions within the young TW Hydrae and Tucana
Associations. At the distance of these associations, the lower mass limit of
detection, based on models, is well into the high mass planet region for
separations > 30 AU. Results presented here include spectra and proper motion
verification of two brown dwarf companions, TWA 5B and HR 7329B, located 100 AU
and 180 AU from their primaries, respectively. We also present a possible
exo-solar giant planet candidate located 125 AU from TWA 6. These few examples
demonstrate that the young associations remain fertile ground for discovery and
environmental study of planetary systems.
