The AGILE scientific instrument has been calibrated with a tagged
$\gamma$-ray beam at the Beam Test Facility (BTF) of the INFN Laboratori
Nazionali di Frascati (LNF). The goal of the calibration was the measure of the
Point Spread Function (PSF) as a function of the photon energy and incident
angle and the validation of the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the silicon
tracker operation. The calibration setup is described and some preliminary
results are presented.
