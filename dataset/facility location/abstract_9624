We introduce an extension of the diagrammatic rules in random matrix theory
and apply it to nonhermitean random matrix models using the 1/N approximation.
A number of one- and two-point functions are evaluated on their holomorphic and
nonholomorphic supports to leading order in 1/N. The one-point functions
describe the distribution of eigenvalues, while the two-point functions
characterize their macroscopic correlations. Generic form for the two-point
functions are obtained, generalizing the concept of macroscopic universality to
nonhermitean random matrices. We show that the holomorphic and nonholomorphic
one- and two-point functions condition the behavior of pertinent partition
functions to order $O(1/N)$. We derive explicit conditions for the location and
distribution of their singularities. Most of our analytical results are found
to be in good agreement with numerical calculations using large ensembles of
complex matrices.
