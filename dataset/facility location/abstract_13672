We formalise and generalise the definition of the family of univariate double
two--piece distributions, obtained by using a density--based transformation of
unimodal symmetric continuous distributions with a shape parameter. The
resulting distributions contain five interpretable parameters that control the
mode, as well as the scale and shape in each direction. Four-parameter
subfamilies of this class of distributions that capture different types of
asymmetry are discussed. We propose interpretable scale and location-invariant
benchmark priors and derive conditions for the propriety of the corresponding
posterior distribution. The prior structures used allow for meaningful
comparisons through Bayes factors within flexible families of distributions.
These distributions are applied to data from finance, internet traffic and
medicine, comparing them with appropriate competitors.
