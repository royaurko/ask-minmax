The two-parameter charged McVittie solution of the Einstein equations is
revisited and its apparent horizons are discussed and located numerically (for
the extremal case, analytically). According to the parameter values, this
spacetime can be interpreted as a black hole, or a spacelike naked singularity,
in a spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe.
