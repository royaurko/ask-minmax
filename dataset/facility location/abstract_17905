The structure of $1/2^{\pm}$ states in $^{13}$C up to around the $3\alpha+n$
threshold ($E_x = 12.3$~MeV) is investigated with a full four-body $3\alpha+n$
orthogonality condition model (OCM) calculation, where the $3\alpha$ OCM, the
model space of which is the subspace of the $3\alpha+n$ model, describes well
the structure of the low-lying states of $^{12}$C including the $2^{+}_2$,
$0^{+}_3$, and $0^{+}_4$ states, which have been recently observed above the
Hoyle state ($0^+_2$). A full spectrum up to the $1/2^{-}_5$ ($1/2^{+}_3$)
state is reproduced consistently with the lowest five $1/2^{-}$ (three
$1/2^{+}$) states of experimental spectrum. It is shown that the $1/2^{-}_2$
and $1/2^{-}_3$ states are characterized by the dominant cluster configurations
of $^{9}$Be($3/2^-$,$1/2^-$)+$\alpha$, while the ground state $1/2^-_1$ has a
shell-model-like structure. The calculated monopole transition strengths to the
$1/2^{-}_{2,3}$ states are consistent with the experimental data, although the
shell model calculations have a difficulty to reproduce them. These results
indicate that the excited $1/2^-$ states have cluster structures. On the other
hand, the $1/2^{+}_{1}$ state is found to have a loosely bound neutron
structure in which the extra neutron moves around $^{12}$C(g.s) core with $1S$
orbit, reflecting the fact that this state appears by $1.9$~MeV just below the
$^{12}$C(g.s)+$n$ threshold, while the $1/2^{+}_{2}$ and $1/2^{+}_{3}$ states
are characterized by $^{9}$Be+$\alpha$ structures. We found that the $1/2^+_5$
state located above the $3\alpha+n$ threshold is the Hoyle analogue state in
$^{13}$C, the wave function of which is described by product states of
constituent clusters, $(0S)^3_{\alpha}(S)_n$, with the probability of $52~\%$.
