Structural and dynamical characteristics pertaining to the solvation of an
excess proton in liquid-like nanoclusters of the type [H$_2$O]$_n$ are
investigated using Molecular Dynamics experiments. Three different aggregate
sizes were analyzed: $n=10,$ 21 and 125. The simulation experiments were
performed using a multistate empirical valence bond Hamiltonian model. While in
the smallest aggregates the proton occupies a central position, the stable
solvation environments for $n=21$ and 125 are located at the cluster
boundaries. In all cases, the structure of the closest solvation shell of the
excess charge remains practically unchanged and coincides with that observed in
bulk water. Compared to results obtained in bulk, the computed rates for proton
transfer in clusters are between one and two orders of magnitude slower, and
tend to increase for larger cluster sizes.
