With the increasing popularity of GPS-enabled hand-held devices,
location-based applications and services have access to accurate and real-time
location information, raising serious privacy concerns for their millions of
users. Trying to address these issues, the notion of geo-indistinguishability
was recently introduced, adapting the well-known concept of Differential
Privacy to the area of location-based systems. A Laplace-based obfuscation
mechanism satisfying this privacy notion works well in the case of a sporadic
use; Under repeated use, however, independently applying noise leads to a quick
loss of privacy due to the correlation between the location in the trace.
  In this paper we show that correlations in the trace can be in fact exploited
in terms of a prediction function that tries to guess the new location based on
the previously reported locations. The proposed mechanism tests the quality of
the predicted location using a private test; in case of success the prediction
is reported otherwise the location is sanitized with new noise. If there is
considerable correlation in the input trace, the extra cost of the test is
small compared to the savings in budget, leading to a more efficient mechanism.
  We evaluate the mechanism in the case of a user accessing a location-based
service while moving around in a city. Using a simple prediction function and
two budget spending stategies, optimizing either the utility or the budget
consumption rate, we show that the predictive mechanim can offer substantial
improvements over the independently applied noise.
