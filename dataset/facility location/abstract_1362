One important application of the Wireless Sensor Network(WSN) is target
tracking, the aim of this application is converging to an event or object in an
area. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient distributed sensor
activation protocol based on predicted location technique, called Intelligent
Distributed Sensor Activation Algorithm (IDSA). The proposed algorithm predicts
the location of target in the next time interval, by analyzing current location
and movement history of the target, this prediction is done by computational
intelligence. The fewest essential number of sensor nodes within the predicted
location will be activated to cover the target. The results show that the
proposed method outperforms the existing methods such as Na\"ive and DSA in
terms of energy consumption and the number of nodes that was involved in
tracking the target.
