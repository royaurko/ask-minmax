The investigation of spatio-temporal dynamics of bacterial cells and their
molecular components requires automated image analysis tools to track cell
shape properties and molecular component locations inside the cells. In the
study of bacteria aging, the molecular components of interest are protein
aggregates accumulated near bacteria boundaries. This particular location makes
very ambiguous the correspondence between aggregates and cells, since computing
accurately bacteria boundaries in phase-contrast time-lapse imaging is a
challenging task. This paper proposes an active skeleton formulation for
bacteria modeling which provides several advantages: an easy computation of
shape properties (perimeter, length, thickness, orientation), an improved
boundary accuracy in noisy images, and a natural bacteria-centered coordinate
system that permits the intrinsic location of molecular components inside the
cell. Starting from an initial skeleton estimate, the medial axis of the
bacterium is obtained by minimizing an energy function which incorporates
bacteria shape constraints. Experimental results on biological images and
comparative evaluation of the performances validate the proposed approach for
modeling cigar-shaped bacteria like Escherichia coli. The Image-J plugin of the
proposed method can be found online at http://fluobactracker.inrialpes.fr.
