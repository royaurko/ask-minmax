Approximately four thousand light curves of red variable stars in the LMC
were selected from the 2.3-years duration MOA database by a period analysis
using the Phase Dispersion Minimization method. Their optical features
(amplitudes, periodicities, position in CMD) were investigated. Stars with
large amplitues and high periodicities were distributed on the only one strip
amongst multiple structure on the LMC period-luminosity relation. In the CMD,
the five strips were located in the order of the period. The stars with
characterized light curves were also discussed.
