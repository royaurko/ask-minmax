The control system of the VEPP-4 facility was designed more than fifteen
years ago and based on the home-developed CAMAC-embedded minicomputers Odrenok
[1]. Five years ago, all computers were connected via Ethernet network. This
step allowed us to force an integration of PCs into the VEPP-4 control system.
This paper reviews new tools running on the PCs under Linux. The beam
diagnostics tool described in this paper provides the data about position and
dimensions of e-/e+ beams from CCD matrix controller via 100-Mbit Ethernet. The
next tool provides measuring of beam energy at the VEPP-4M collider using a
well-known method of resonance depolarization by the observation of the
polarization degree on the effect of internal scattering of particles. Data
visualization tools are based on CERN ROOT framework. Hardware and software
aspects of the systems are presented in this paper.
