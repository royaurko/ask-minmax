We present deconvolved narrow band images of Cas A as observed by the MECS
instrument on the BeppoSAX X-ray satellite. The images show that Cas A has
different morphologies in the continuum and line bands. This difference points
towards a synchrotron origin for part of the X-ray continuum of Cas A. Going to
the hardest continuum band we find that the emission is coming predominantly
from the Western region, making this the most likely location for the hard
X-ray tail seen with instruments on CGRO (OSSE), BeppoSAX (PDS) and RXTE
(HEXTE).
