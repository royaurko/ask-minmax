Measurements of the ground-state nuclear spins, magnetic and quadrupole
moments of the copper isotopes from 61Cu up to 75Cu are reported. The
experiments were performed at the ISOLDE facility, using the technique of
collinear laser spectroscopy. The trend in the magnetic moments between the
N=28 and N=50 shell closures is reasonably reproduced by large-scale
shell-model calculations starting from a 56Ni core. The quadrupole moments
reveal a strong polarization of the underlying Ni core when the neutron shell
is opened, which is however strongly reduced at N=40 due to the parity change
between the $pf$ and $g$ orbits. No enhanced core polarization is seen beyond
N=40. Deviations between measured and calculated moments are attributed to the
softness of the 56Ni core and weakening of the Z=28 and N=28 shell gaps.
