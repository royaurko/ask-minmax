We report on the N II 5668-5712 emission and absorption lines in the spectrum
of Eta Carinae. Spectral lines of the stellar wind regions can be classified
into four physically distinct categories: 1) low-excitation emission such as H
I and Fe II, 2) higher excitation He I features, 3) the N II lines discussed in
this paper, and 4) He II emission. These categories have different combinations
of radial velocity behavior, excitation processes, and dependences on the
secondary star. The N II lines are the only known features that originate in
"normal" undisturbed zones of the primary wind but depend primarily on the
location of the hot secondary star. N II probably excludes some proposed
models, such as those where He I lines originate in the secondary star's wind
or in an accretion disk.
