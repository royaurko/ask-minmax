In this work we show how one can use the zeros of the canonical partition
function, the Fisher zeros, to unambiguously characterize a transition as being
in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless ($BKT$) class of universality. By
studying the zeros map for the 2D XY-model, we found that its internal border
coalesces into the real positive axis in a finite region corresponding to
temperatures smaller than the $BKT$ transition temperature. This behavior is
consistent with the predicted existence of a line of critical points below the
transition temperature, allowing one to distinguish the $BKT$ class of
universality from other possibilities.
