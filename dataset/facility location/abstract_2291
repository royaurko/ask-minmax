We present measurements of airborne fission products in Chapel Hill, NC, USA,
from 62 days following the March 11, 2011, accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi
nuclear power plant. Airborne particle samples were collected daily in air
filters and radio-assayed with two high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. The
fission products I-131 and Cs-137 were measured with maximum activities of 4.2
+/- 0.6 mBq/m^3 and 0.42 +/- 0.07 mBq/m^3 respectively. Additional activity
from I-131, I-132, Cs-134, Cs-136, Cs-137 and Te-132 were measured in the same
air filters using a low-background HPGe detector at the Kimballton Underground
Research Facility (KURF).
