We examine the hypothesis that hydrostatic pressure alone determines the
ratio of atomic to molecular gas averaged over a particular radius in disk
galaxies. The hypothesis implies that the transition radius, the location where
the ratio is unity, should always occur at the same value of stellar surface
density in all galaxies. We examine data for 28 galaxies and find that the
stellar surface density at the transition radius is indeed constant to 40% at a
value of 120 M_sun/pc^2. If the hypothesis can be confirmed at all radii within
a large range of galaxy types and metallicities, combining it with the observed
constancy of the star formation rate with H_2 surface density may enable a
physically motivated star formation prescription with wide applicability.
