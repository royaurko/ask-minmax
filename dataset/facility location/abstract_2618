Thanks to extensive observations with X-ray missions and facilities working
in other wavelengths, as well as rapidly--advancing numerical simulations of
accretion flows, our knowledge of astrophysical black holes has been remarkably
enriched. Rapid progress has opened new areas of enquiry, including
measurements of black hole spin, the properties and driving mechanisms of jets
and disk winds, the impact of feedback into local environments, the origin of
periodic and aperiodic X-ray variations, and the nature of super-Eddington
accretion flows, among others. The goal of this White Paper is to illustrate
how ASTRO-H can make dramatic progress in the study of astrophysical black
holes, particularly the study of black hole X-ray binaries.
