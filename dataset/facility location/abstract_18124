The Cherenkov Telescope Array is a project that aims to exploring the highest
energy region of electromagnetic spectrum. Two arrays, one for each hemisphere,
will cover the full sky in a range from few tens of GeV to hundreds of TeV
improving the sensitivity and angular resolution of the present operating
arrays. A prototype of the Large Size Telescope (LST) for the study of gamma
ray astronomy above some tens of GeV will be installed at the Canary Island of
La Palma in 2016. The LST camera, made by an array of photomultipliers (PMTs),
requires an accurate and systematic calibration over a wide dynamic range. In
this contribution, we present an optical calibration system made by a 355 nm
wavelength laser with 400 ps pulse width, 1 muJ output energy, up to 4k Hz
repetition rate and a set of neutral density filters to obtain a wide range of
photon intensities, up to 1000 photoelectrons/PMT, to be sent to the camera
plane 28 m away. The number of photons after the diffuser of the calibration
box, located in the center of the reflective plane, is monitored by a
photodiode. The stability of the laser and the ambient parameters inside this
calibration box are checked by a multi-task processor and a trigger signal is
sent to the camera data acquisition system. The box frame is designed with
special attention to obtain a robust device with stable optical and mechanical
features.
