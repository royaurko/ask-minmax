The Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) experiment is a second generation long baseline
neutrino oscillation experiment which aims at a sensitive search for the nu_e
appearance. The main design features of the T2K near detectors located at 280 m
from the target are presented. Scintillator counters developed for the T2K near
detectors are described. Readout of the counters is provided via WLS fibers
embedded into S-shape grooves in a scintillator and viewed from both ends by
multi-pixel avalanche photodiodes operating in a limited Geiger mode. A
desription, operational principles and the results of tests of photosensors
with a sensitive area of 1.1 mm^2 are presented. A time resolution of 1.5 ns, a
spatial resolution of 9.9-12.4 cm, and a MIP detection efficiency of more than
99% were obtained for scintillator detectors in a beam test.
