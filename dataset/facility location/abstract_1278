We have explored our own innovative work about the design & development of
internal location-identification system for mobile devices based on integration
of RFID and wireless technology. The function of our system is based on
strategically located passive RFID tags placed on objects around building which
are identified using an RFID reader attached to a mobile device. The mobile
device reads the RFID tag and through the wireless network, sends the request
to the server. The server resolves the request and sends the desired
location-based information back to the mobile device. We had addressed that we
can go through the RFID technology for internal location identification
(indoor), which provides us better location accuracy because of no contact
between the tag and the reader, and the system requires no line of sight. In
this paper we had also focused on the issues of RFID technologies i.e.
Non-line-of-sight & High inventory speeds.
