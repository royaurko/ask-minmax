We present CCD UBVI observations obtained in the field of the two previously
unstudied dissolving open cluster candidates NGC 7036 and NGC 7772. Our
analysis suggests that both the objects are Open Cluster Remnants (OCR). NGC
7036 is an open cluster remnant with a core radius of about 3-4 arcmin. We
derive for the first time estimates of its fundamental parameters. We identify
17 likely members which define a group of stars at 1 kpc from the Sun, with a
low reddening E$(B-V) \approx 0.1$, and with an age of about 3-4 Gyr. As for
NGC 7772, we identify 14 likely members, which define a group of stars with a
very low reddening (E$(B-V) \approx 0.03$), 1.5 Gyr old and located about 1.5
kpc from the Sun.
