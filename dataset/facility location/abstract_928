Remote control systems are becoming more and more important to give us the
flexibility to control facilities, provide assistance and intervene in case of
problems at any time and from every place. As a global operating group CALICE
[2] with approx. 220 members worldwide is dependent on using a remote control
system for shifts and monitoring of the data taking. CALICE has at present
installed its detector at Fermilab, Chicago, where will run test beam
experiments for the next year. The components of the remote control system and
kind of use are presented here.
