Colon and rectum cancer share many risk factors, and are often tabulated
together as ``colorectal cancer'' in published summaries. However, recent work
indicating that exercise, diet, and family history may have differential
impacts on the two cancers encourages analyzing them separately, so that
corresponding public health interventions can be more efficiently targeted. We
analyze colon and rectum cancer data from the Minnesota Cancer Surveillance
System from 1998--2002 over the 16-county Twin Cities (Minneapolis--St. Paul)
metro and exurban area. The data consist of two marked point patterns, meaning
that any statistical model must account for randomness in the observed
locations, and expected positive association between the two cancer patterns.
Our model extends marked spatial point pattern analysis in the context of a log
Gaussian Cox process to accommodate spatially referenced covariates (local
poverty rate and location within the metro area), individual-level risk factors
(patient age and cancer stage), and related interactions. We obtain smoothed
maps of marginal log-relative intensity surfaces for colon and rectum cancer,
and uncover significant age and stage differences between the two groups. This
encourages more aggressive colon cancer screening in the inner Twin Cities and
their southern and western exurbs, where our model indicates higher colon
cancer relative intensity.
