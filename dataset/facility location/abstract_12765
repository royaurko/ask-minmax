This paper present our color constancy investigation in the hybridization of
Wireless LAN and Camera positioning in the mobile phone. Five typical color
constancy schemes are analyzed in different location environment. The results
can be used to combine with RF signals from Wireless LAN positioning by using
model fitting approach in order to establish absolute positioning output. There
is no conventional searching algorithm required, thus it is expected to reduce
the complexity of computation. Finally we present our preliminary results to
illustrate the indoor positioning algorithm performance evaluation for an
indoor environment set-up.
