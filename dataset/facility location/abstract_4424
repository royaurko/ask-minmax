We assess the possibility that baryonic acoustic oscillations in adiabatic
models may explain the observations of excess power in large-scale structure on
100h^-1 Mpc scales. The observed location restricts models to two extreme areas
of parameter space. In either case, the baryon fraction must be large
(Omega_b/Omega_0 > 0.3) to yield significant features. The first region
requires Omega_0 < 0.2h to match the location, implying large blue tilts
(n>1.4) to satisfy cluster abundance constraints. The power spectrum also
continues to rise toward larger scales in these models. The second region
requires Omega_0 near 1, implying Omega_b well out of the range of big bang
nucleosynthesis constraints; moreover, the peak is noticeably wider than the
observations suggest. Testable features of both solutions are that they require
moderate reionization and thereby generate potentially observable (about 1 uK)
large-angle polarization, as well as sub-arc-minute temperature fluctuations.
In short, baryonic features in adiabatic models may explain the observed excess
only if currently favored determinations of cosmological parameters are in
substantial error or if present surveys do not represent a fair sample of
100h^-1 Mpc structures.
