The component of photoexcited states with large spatial extent is
investigated for poly(para-phenylenevinylene) using the intermediate exciton
theory. We find a peak due to long-range excitons at the higher-energy side of
the lowest main feature of optical spectra. The fact that the onset of
long-range excitons is located near the energy gap is related to the mechanisms
of large photocurrents measured in such energy regions. We show that a large
value of the hopping integral is realistic for characterizing optical
excitations.
