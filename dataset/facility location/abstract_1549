We describe the HI component of the Southern Galactic Plane Survey (SGPS).
The SGPS is a large-scale project to image at arcminute resolution the HI
spectral line and 21 cm continuum emission in parts of the plane of the Milky
Way. The survey covers Galactic longitudes 253 deg < l < 358 deg and latitudes
|b| <1.5 deg (SGPS I), plus a first quadrant extension covering 5 deg < l < 20
deg and |b| <1.5 deg (SGPS II). The survey combines data from the Australia
Telescope Compact Array and the Parkes Radio Telescope for sensitivity to
angular scales ranging from 2 arcminutes to several degrees. The combined data
cover 325 sq-deg and have an rms sensitivity of 1.6 K. Here we describe the HI
observations and data reduction in detail, and present examples from the final
data products. The complete dataset is publicly available through the Australia
Telescope National Facility's HI Surveys archive. This dataset provides an
unprecedented view of the neutral component of interstellar hydrogen in the
inner Milky Way.
