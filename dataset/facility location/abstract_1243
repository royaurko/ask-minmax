Books are the best friends of human beings and make them a rational animal.
In this E-world our traditional books are losing their values. Recent surveys
are proving that the younger generations are not much interested in visiting
libraries and reading books due to their addiction towards the electronic
gadgets. Many publishers are now changed their strategy by publishing and
promoting ebooks. Academicians are also badly affected by this trend and they
are forced to motivate the students to improve their reading habits for their
better performance in the institutions and to be responsible citizens of a
country.
  There are many difficulties faced by the ebook readers and it discourages the
people to read an ebook for long time like a normal printed book. The main
objective of this paper is to introduce a hybrid Ebook which is capable of
having audio and video files also in it. This makes the people to read the
e-book with modern electronic formats. This multimedia facility makes the
people to read or listen or watch the ebooks for long time. We have quoted the
survey results which prove that the students prefer to read hybrid books than
normal ebooks or the printed handouts in College of Applied Sciences, Oman.
Still we feel these books should have few more facilities, so that people who
like traditional books will also adopt these ebooks, without losing the
satisfaction of reading printed books. These things are listed in the
recommendations and conclusion section.
