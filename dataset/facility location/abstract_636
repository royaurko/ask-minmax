Measurements of neutron total cross-sections of natural bismuth in the
neutron energy region from 0.1 eV to 100 eV have been performed by using the
time-of-flight method at the Pohang Neutron Facility, which consists of an
electron linear accelerator, a water-cooled tantalum target with a water
moderator, and a 12-m-long time-of-flight path. A 6Li-ZnS(Ag) scintillator with
a diameter of 12.5 cm and a thickness of 1.6 cm is employed as a neutron
detector, and a piece of high purity natural bismuth metallic plates with a
thickness of 3 mm is used for the neutron transmission measurement. The present
results were compared with the evaluated data from ENDF/B VII.1 and other
previous reported experimental data.
