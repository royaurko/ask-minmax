It is shown that compact bodies project out strands of concentrated dark
matter filaments henceforth simply called hairs. These hairs are a consequence
of the fine-grained stream structure of dark matter halos, and as such
constitute a new physical prediction of $\Lambda$CDM. Using both an analytical
model of planetary density and numerical simulations utilizing the {\it Fast
Accurate Integrand Renormalization } (FAIR) algorithm (a fast geodesics
calculator described below) with realistic planetary density inputs, dark
matter streams moving through a compact body are shown to produce hugely
magnified dark matter densities along the stream velocity axis going through
the center of the body. Typical hair density enhancements are $10^7$ for Earth
and $10^8$ for Jupiter. The largest enhancements occur for particles streaming
through the core of the body that mostly focus at a single point called the
root of the hair. For the Earth, the root is located at about $10^6$~km from
the planetary center with a density enhancement of around $10^9$ while for a
gas giant like Jupiter, the root is located at around $10^{5}$~km with a
enhancement of around $10^{11}$.
