In this paper we present a model of Quantum Associative Memory which can be a
helpful tool for physicians without experience or laboratory facilities, for
the diagnosis of four tropical diseases (malaria, typhoid fever, yellow fever
and dengue) which have similar symptoms. The memory can distinguish single
infection from multi-infection. The algorithm used for Quantum Associative
Memory is an improve model of original algorithm made by Ventura for Quantum
Associative Memory. From the simulation results given, it appears that the
efficiency of recognition is good when a particular symptom of a disease with a
similar symptoms are inserted.
