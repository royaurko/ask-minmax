The optically-dark globule IC 1396A is revealed using Spitzer images at 3.6,
4.5, 5.8, 8, and 24 microns to be infrared-bright and to contain a set of
previously unknown protostars. The mid-infrared colors of the 24 microns
detected sources indicate several very young (Class I or 0) protostars and a
dozen Class II stars. Three of the new sources (IC 1396A: gamma, delta, and
epsilon) emit over 90% of their bolometric luminosities at wavelengths greater
than 3 microns, and they are located within ~0.02 pc of the ionization front at
the edge of the globule. Many of the sources have spectra that are still rising
at 24 microns. The two previously-known young stars LkHa 349 a and c are both
detected, with component c harboring a massive disk and component a being bare.
Of order 5% of the mass of material in the globule is presently in the form of
protostars in the 10^5 to 10^6 yr age range. This high star formation rate was
likely triggered by radiation from a nearby O star.
