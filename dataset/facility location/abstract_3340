The new data analysis of the experiment, where the photon splitting in the
atomic fields has been observed for the first time, is presented. This
experiment was performed at the tagged photon beam of the ROKK-1M facility at
the VEPP-4M collider. In the energy region of 120-450 MeV, the statistics of
$1.6\cdot 10^9$ photons incident on the BGO target was collected. About 400
candidates to the photon splitting events were reconstructed. Within the
attained experimental accuracy, the experimental results are consistent with
the cross section calculated exactly in an atomic field. The predictions
obtained in the Born approximation significantly differ from the experimental
results.
