We present observations of 86 post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) stars
of OH maser transitions, taken with the Parkes Telescope between September 2002
and August 2003. Post-AGB stars are the precursors of planetary nebulae, which
have a wide range of morphologies that are not well explained. By studying the
circumstellar envelopes of post-AGB stars through the masers produced in them,
we hope to shed light on the origin of planetary nebula morphologies.
