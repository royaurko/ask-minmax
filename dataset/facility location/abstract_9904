The antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model is considered for spins $s_{i}={1/2}$
located on the vertices of the dodecahedron and the icosahedron, which belong
to the point symmetry group $I_{h}$. Taking into account the permutational and
spin inversion symmetries of the Hamiltonian results in a drastic reduction of
the dimensionality of the problem, leading to full diagonalization for both
clusters. There is a strong signature of the frustration present in the systems
in the low energy spectrum, where the first excited states are singlets.
Frustration also results in a doubly-peaked specific heat as a function of
temperature for the dodecahedron. Furthermore, there is a discontinuity in the
magnetization as a function of magnetic field for the dodecahedron, where a
specific total spin sector never becomes the ground state in a field. This
discontinuity is accompanied by a magnetization plateau. The calculation is
also extended for $s_{i}=1$ where both systems again have singlet excitations.
The magnetization of the dodecahedron has now two discontinuities in an
external field and also magnetization plateaux, and the specific heat of the
icosahedron a two-peak structure as a function of temperature. The similarities
between the two systems suggest that the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on
a larger cluster with the same symmetry, the 60-site cluster, will have similar
properties.
