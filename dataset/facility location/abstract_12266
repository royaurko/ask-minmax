Combined recent data from cosmic-ray detectors and gamma-ray detectors have
produced some surprising insights regarding the sources of ultrahigh-energy
cosmic rays (UHECRs), magnetic fields inside and outside the Milky Way, and the
universal photon backgrounds. The energy-dependent composition of UHECRs
implies a non-negligible contribution of sources located in the Milky Way, such
as past gamma-ray bursts that took place in our Galaxy. Extended halos of
distant sources seen in the Fermi data imply that intergalactic magnetic fields
have average strengths of the order of a femtogauss. Such relatively low
magnetic fields imply that the protons from distant blazars generate a
detectable flux of secondary gamma rays in their interactions with the photon
background. A comparison with the data shows an excellent agreement of the
secondary photons with the spectra of distant blazars observed by atmospheric
Cherenkov telescopes.
