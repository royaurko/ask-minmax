A large area (128 m^2) Muon Tracking Detector (MTD), located within the
KASCADE experiment, has been built with the aim to identify muons (E_mu > 0.8
GeV) and their directions in extensive air showers by track measurements under
more than 18 r.l. shielding. The orientation of the muon track with respect to
the shower axis is expressed in terms of the radial- and tangential angles. By
means of triangulation the muon production height H_mu is determined. By means
of H_mu, a transition from light to heavy cosmic ray primary particle with
increasing shower energy Eo from 1-10 PeV is observed. Muon pseudorapidity
distributions for the first interactions above 15 km are studied and compared
to Monte Carlo simulations.
