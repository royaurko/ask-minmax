Bag-of-Distributed-Tasks (BoDT) application is the collection of identical
and independent tasks each of which requires a piece of input data located
around the world. As a result, Cloud computing offers an ef- fective way to
execute BoT application as it not only consists of multiple geographically
distributed data centres but also allows a user to pay for what she actually
uses only. In this paper, BoDT on the Cloud using virtually unlimited cloud
resources. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to find an execution plan that
takes budget constraints into account. Compared with other approaches, with the
same given budget, our algorithm is able to reduce the overall execution time
up to 50%.
