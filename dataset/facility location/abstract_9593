SN 2000ft is detected in two independent Planetary Camera images (F547W and
F814W) taken May 13, 2000, about two months before the predicted date of the
explosion (July 19, 2000), based on the analysis of its radio light evolution
by Alberdi and collaborators. The apparent optical magnitudes and red color of
SN 2000ft indicate that it is observed through an extinction of at least A$_V$=
3.0 magnitudes. The extinction corrected lower limit to the absolute visual
magnitude (M$_V$ $\leq -$ 18.0), identifies SN 2000ft as a luminous supernova
in the optical, as other luminous radio supernovae before. SN 2000ft exploded
in a region located at only 0.1 arcsec (i.e. 34 +/- 3 pc) west of a faint
cluster (C24). No parent cluster is identified within the detection limits of
the HST short exposures. The unambiguous detection of SN 2000ft in the visual
shows that multi-epoch sub-arcsecond (FWHM less than 0.1 arcsec) optical
imaging is also a valid tool that should be explored further to detect
supernovae in the dusty (circum)nuclear regions of (U)LIRGs.
