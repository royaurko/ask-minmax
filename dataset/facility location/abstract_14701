We here investigate the possibility that the ultra-high energy cosmic ray
(UHECR) events observed above the GZK limit are mostly protons accelerated in
reconnection sites just above the magnetosphere of newborn millisecond pulsars
which are originated by accretion induced collapse (AIC). We show that
AIC-pulsars with surface magnetic fields $10^{12} G < B_{\star} \lesssim
10^{15}$ G and spin periods $1 ms \lesssim P_{\star} < 60 ms$, are able to
accelerate particles to energies $\geq 10^{20}$ eV. Because the expected rate
of AIC sources in our Galaxy is very small (\sim 10^{-5} yr^{-1}), the
corresponding contribution to the flux of UHECRs is neglegible, and the total
flux is given by the integrated contribution from AIC sources produced by the
distribution of galaxies located within the distance which is unaffected by the
GZK cutoff ($\sim 50$ Mpc). We find that the reconnection efficiency factor
needs to be $\xi \gtrsim 0.1$ in order to reproduce the observed flux of
UHECRs.
