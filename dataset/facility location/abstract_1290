Schoenberg transformations, mapping Euclidean configurations into Euclidean
configurations, define in turn a transformed inertia, whose minimization
produces robust location estimates. The procedure only depends upon Euclidean
distances between observations, and applies equivalently to univariate and
multivariate data. The choice of the family of transformations and their
parameters defines a flexible location strategy, generalizing M-estimators. Two
regimes of solutions are identified. Theoretical results on their existence and
stability are provided, and illustrated on two data sets.
