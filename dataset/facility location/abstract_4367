Consider a uniformly chosen random reduced decomposition of the longest
element in the symmetric group. It is known that the location of the first
transposition in this decomposition converges to the semicircle distribution.
In this note we provide a sharp error term for this result, using the
"comparison of generators" approach to Stein's method.
