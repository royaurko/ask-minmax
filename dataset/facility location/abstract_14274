Low-temperature specific heat (SH) is measured on the postannealed
Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ni_x)_2As_2 single crystal with x = 0.058 under different magnetic
fields. The sample locates on the overdoped sides and the critical transition
temperature is determined to be 14.8 K by both the magnetization and SH
measurements. A simple and reliable analysis shows that, besides the phonon and
normal electronic contributions, a clear T2 termemerges in the low temperature
SH data.Our observation is similar to that observed in the Co-doped system in
our previous work and is consistent with the theoretical prediction for a
superconductor with line nodes in the energy gap.
