A high-voltage divider with accuracy at the ppm level and collinear laser
spectroscopy were used to calibrate the highvoltage installation at the
radioactive ion beam facility ISOLDE at CERN. The accurate knowledge of this
voltage is particularly important for collinear laser spectroscopy
measurements. Beam velocity measurements using frequencycomb based collinear
laser spectroscopy agree with the new calibration. Applying this, one obtains
consistent results for isotope shifts of stable magnesium isotopes measured
using collinear spectroscopy and laser spectroscopy on laser-cooled ions in a
trap. The long-term stability and the transient behavior during recovery from a
voltage dropout were investigated for the different power supplies currently
applied at ISOLDE.
