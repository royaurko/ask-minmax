I review the progress made in recent years with functional methods in our
understanding of the QCD phase diagram. In particular I discuss a
renormalisation group approach to QCD at finite temperature and chemical
potential. Results include the location of the confinement-deconfinement phase
transition/cross-over and the chiral phase transition/cross-over lines, their
nature as well as their interrelation.
