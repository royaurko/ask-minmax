We present an analysis of elastic and quasielastic parity-violating (PV)
electron scattering processes. These reactions can help to constrain the weak
neutral current form factors of the nucleon that play an essential role in the
description of neutrino cross sections at intermediate energies. We show that
combining information from the analysis of elastic and quasielastic reactions
the current knowledge on the strange and axial-vector form factors can be
significantly improved.
