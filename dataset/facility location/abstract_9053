We present here new observations conducted with the EVN and MERLIN of the
persistent microquasar LS 5039 discovered by Paredes et al. (2000) with the
VLBA. The new observations confirm the presence of an asymmetric two-sided jet
reaching up to 1000 AU on the longest jet arm. The results suggest a bending of
the jets with increasing distance from the core and/or precession. The origin
and location of the high-energy gamma-ray emission associated with the system
is discussed and an estimate of the magnetic field at the base of the jet
given. Our results suggest a well collimated radio jet. We also comment on new
observing strategies to be used with satellites and forthcoming detectors,
since this persistent source appears to be a rather good laboratory to explore
the accretion/ejection processes taking place near compact objects.
