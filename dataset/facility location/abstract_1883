Frequent polarization reversals, or spin-flips, of a stored polarized beam in
a high energy scattering asymmetry experiments may greatly reduce systematic
errors of spin asymmetry measurements. A spin-flipping technique is being
developed by using rf magnets running at a frequency close to the spin
precession frequency, thereby creating spin-depolarizing resonances; the spin
can then be flipped by ramping the rf magnet's frequency through the resonance.
We studied, at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility Cooler Ring,
properties of such rf depolarizing resonances in the presence of a nearly-full
Siberian snake and their possible application for spin-flipping. By using an
rf-solenoid magnet, we reached a 98.7% efficiency of spin-flipping. However, an
rf-dipole magnet is more practical at high energies; hence, studies of
spin-flipping by an rf-dipole are underway at IUCF.
