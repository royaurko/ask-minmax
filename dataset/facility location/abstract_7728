In fully developed turbulence, the velocity field possesses long-range
correlations, denoted by a scaling power spectrum or structure functions. Here
we consider the autocorrelation function of velocity increment $ {\Delta
u_{\ell}(t)}$ at separation {time} $\ell$. Anselmet et al. [Anselmet et al. J.
Fluid Mech. \textbf{140}, 63 (1984)] have found that the autocorrelation
function of velocity increment has a minimum value, whose location is
approximately equal to $\ell$. Taking statistical stationary assumption, we
link the velocity increment and the autocorrelation function with the power
spectrum of the original variable. We then propose an analytical model of the
autocorrelation function. With this model, we prove that the location of the
minimum autocorrelation function is exactly equal to the separation {time}
$\ell$ when the scaling of the power spectrum of the original variable belongs
to the range $0<\beta<2$. This model also suggests a power law expression for
the minimum autocorrelation. Considering the cumulative function of the
autocorrelation function, it is shown that the main contribution to the
autocorrelation function comes from the large scale part. Finally we argue that
the autocorrelation function is a better indicator of the inertial range than
the second order structure function.
