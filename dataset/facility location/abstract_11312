We investigate the symbiotic star BI Crucis through a comprehensive and
self-consistent analysis of the spectra emitted in three different epochs:
60's, 70's, and late 80's. In particular, we would like to find out the
physical conditions in the shocked nebula and in the dust shells, as well as
their location within the symbiotic system, by exploiting both photometric and
spectroscopic data from radio to UV. We suggest a model which, on the basis of
optical imaging, emission line ratios and spectral energy distribution profile,
is able to account for collision of the winds, formation of lobes and jets by
accretion onto the WD, as well as for the interaction of the blast wave from a
past, unrecorded outburst with the ISM. We have found that the spectra observed
throughout the years show the marks of the different processes at work within
BI Cru, perhaps signatures of a post-outburst evolution. We then call for new
infrared and millimeter observations, potentially able to resolve the inner
structure of the symbiotic nebula.
