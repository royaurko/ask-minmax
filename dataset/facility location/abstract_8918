Although soft X-ray absorption features in AGN were discovered almost ten
years ago, the nature and location of the gas creating them has remained
controversial. Guided by the results of recent high-resolution X-ray
spectroscopy, we argue that these features are created in a multi-temperature
wind whose source of matter is photoionized evaporation from the inner edge of
the obscuring torus often found surrounding AGN. Photoionized evaporation in
the presence of a copious mass source locks the ratio of ionizing intensity to
pressure to a critical value. However, a broad range of temperatures can all
coexist in equilibrium for this value of the ratio of ionizing intensity to
pressure. Consequently, the flow is expected to be strongly inhomogeneous in
temperature. The inferred distance of this material from the source of ionizing
radiation depends on how much matter exists at the highest-obtainable
temperature. This distance can be measured by monitoring how ionic column
densities respond to changes in the ionizing continuum on timescales of days to
years.
