The deuterium fractionation, Dfrac, has been proposed as an evolutionary
indicator in pre-protostellar and protostellar cores of low-mass star-forming
regions. We investigate Dfrac, with high angular resolution, in the cluster
environment surrounding the UCHII region IRAS 20293+3952. We performed high
angular resolution observations with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer
(PdBI) of the ortho-NH2D 1_{11}-1_{01} line at 85.926 GHz and compared them
with previously reported VLA NH3 data. We detected strong NH2D emission toward
the pre-protostellar cores identified in NH3 and dust emission, all located in
the vicinity of the UCHII region IRAS 20293+3952. We found high values of
Dfrac~0.1-0.8 in all the pre-protostellar cores and low values, Dfrac<0.1,
associated with young stellar objects. The high values of Dfrac in
pre-protostellar cores could be indicative of evolution, although outflow
interactions and UV radiation could also play a role.
