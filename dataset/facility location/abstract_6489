We address the existence and properties of optical solitons excited in
thermal nonlinear media with a transverse refractive index gradient. We show
that in such a geometry one can generate controllable switching from surface
soliton propagating near the sample edges to bulk solitons. Beam steering
associated to the different soliton output locations can be achieved by varying
the input light intensity.
