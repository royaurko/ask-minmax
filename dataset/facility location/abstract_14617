Near-infrared, sub-arcsecond seeing images obtained with the W. M. Keck I
Telescope of show strong evolution at rest--frame optical} wavelengths in the
morphologies of high redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs) with 1.9<z<4.4. The
structures change from large--scale low surface brightness regions surrounding
bright, multiple component and often radio--aligned features at z>3, to much
more compact and symmetrical shapes at z<3. The linear sizes (~10 kpc) and
luminosities (M_B~-20 to -22) of the individual components in the z>3 HzRGs are
similar to the total sizes and luminosities of normal, radio--quiet, star
forming galaxies seen at z=3--4.
  `R'-band, 0.1 arcsec resolution images with the Hubble Space Telescope of one
of these HzRGs, 4C41.17 at z=3.800, show that at rest--frame UV wavelengths the
galaxy morphology breaks up in even smaller, ~1 kpc--sized components embedded
in a large halo of low surface brightness emission. The brightest UV emission
is from a radio--aligned, edge-brightened feature (4C41.17-North) downstream
from a bright radio knot. A narrow--band Lyman-alpha image, also obtained with
HST, shows an arc--shaped Lyman-alpha feature at this same location, suggestive
of a strong jet/cloud collision.
  Deep spectropolarimetric observations with the W. M. Keck II Telescope of
4C41.17 show that the radio--aligned UV continuum is unpolarized. (abridged)
