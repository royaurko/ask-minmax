Collision of the magnetic flux tubes in the Quiet Sun was proposed as one of
the possible sources for the heating of the solar atmosphere (Furusawa and
Sakai, 2000). The solar photosphere was observed using the New Solar Telescope
ad Big Bear Solar Observatory. In TiO spectral line at 705.68 nm we approached
resolution of 0.1". The horizontal plasma wave was observed spreading from the
larger bright point. Shorty after this wave an increase in the oscillatory
power appeared at the same location as the observed bright point. This behavior
matches some of the results from the simulation of the collision of the two
flux tubes with a weak current.
