We present spatially resolved spectroscopic images of the gravitationally
lensed QSO 2237+0305 taken with the GMOS Integral Field Unit (IFU) on the
Gemini North telescope. These observations have the best spatial resolution of
any IFU observations of this object to date and include the redshifted CIII]
and MgII QSO broad lines. Unlike Mediavilla et al. 1998, we find no evidence
for an arc of resolved broad line emission in either the CIII] or MgII lines.
  We calculate the image flux ratios of both the integrated emission lines and
the surrounding continua. The flux ratios of the CIII] and MgII emission lines
are consistent with each other but differ substantially from their
corresponding continuum flux ratios and the radio/mid-IR flux ratios previously
published. We argue that the broad emission line region must be microlensed and
the CIII] and MgII emission regions must be approximately the same size and
co-located along the line-of-sight. Assuming a simple model for the broad
emission line region and the continuum region, we show the size of the CIII] /
MgII broad line region is ~0.06 h_{70}^{1/2} pc and the continuum region is <=
0.02 h_{70}^{1/2} pc.
