This article develops a computational framework for determining the location
of boundary-covariant apparent horizons in the geometry of conformal
fluid-gravity duality in arbitrary dimensions. In particular, it is shown up to
second order and conjectured to hold to all orders in the gradient expansion
that there is a unique apparent horizon which is covariantly expressible in
terms of fluid velocity, temperature and boundary metric. This leads to the
first explicit example of an entropy current defined by an apparent horizon and
opens the possibility that in the near-equilibrium regime there is preferred
foliation of apparent horizons for black holes in asymptotically-AdS
spacetimes.
