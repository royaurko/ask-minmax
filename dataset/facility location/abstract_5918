Mirror matter type dark matter can exist on the Earth's surface, potentially
in enhanced concentrations at various anomalous impact sites. Mirror matter
fragments can draw in heat from the ordinary matter environment, radiate mirror
photons and thereby cool the surrounding ordinary matter. We quantify this
effect and suggest that it could be used to help locate mirror matter deposits.
This method, together with the centrifuge technique, seems to provide the most
promising means to experimentally detect mirror matter type dark matter in the
Earth.
