We have calculated the pair correlation functions of a fluid interacting via
the Gay-Berne(n-6) pair potentials using the \PY integral equation theory and
have shown how these correlations depend on the value of n which measures the
sharpness of the repulsive core of the pair potential. These results have been
used in the density-functional theory to locate the freezing transitions of
these fluids. We have used two different versions of the theory known as the
second-order and the modified weighted density-functional theory and examined
the freezing of these fluids for $8 \leq n \leq 30$ and in the reduced
temperature range lying between 0.65 and 1.25 into the nematic and the smectic
A phases. For none of these cases smectic A phase was found to be stabilized
though in some range of temperature for a given $n$ it appeared as a metastable
state. We have examined the variation of freezing parameters for the
isotropic-nematic transition with temperature and $n$. We have also compared
our results with simulation results wherever they are available. While we find
that the density-functional theory is good to study the freezing transitions in
such fluids the structural parameters found from the \PY theory need to be
improved particularly at high temperatures and lower values of $n$.
