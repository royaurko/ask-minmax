The 16th BCS-FACS Refinement Workshop was co-located with iFM 2013 held in
Turku, Finland on June 11th, 2013. This volume contains the 6 papers selected
for presentation at the workshop following a peer review process. The papers
cover a wide range of topics in the theory and application of refinement.
Refinement is one of the cornerstones of a formal approach to software
engineering: the process of developing a more detailed design or implementation
from an abstract specification through a sequence of mathematically-based steps
that maintain correctness with respect to the original specification.
