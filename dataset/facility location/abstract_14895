(Abridged) We discuss multiple VLBI continuum and spectral line observations
and WSRT spectroscopy of NGC 1052. Sub-parsec scale features move outward at
approximately 0.26c in bi-symmetric jets, most likely oriented near the plane
of the sky. Absorption and emission signatures reveal ionised, atomic, and
molecular components of the surrounding medium.
  Seven-frequency (1.4 to 43 GHz) VLBA observations show free-free absorption
in the inner parsec, probably together with synchrotron self-absorption. There
is apparently a geometrically thick but patchy structure oriented roughly
orthogonal to the jets. The western jet is receding: it is covered more deeply
and extensively. HI spectral line VLBI reveals atomic gas in front of both
jets. There appear to be three velocity systems. The deepest, at "high
velocities" (receding by 125 to 200 km/s), seems restricted to a shell 1 to 2
pc away from the core, within which this gas might be largely ionised. WSRT
spectroscopy has revealed 1667 and 1665 MHz OH absorption with their line ratio
varying roughly from 1:1 to 2:1 between -35 and 200 km/s. In the high velocity
system the OH profiles are similar to HI, suggesting co-location of that atomic
and molecular gas, and leaving unclear the connection to the H2O masing gas
seen elsewhere. We have also detected both 18cm OH satellite lines in the high
velocity system. They have conjugate profiles: 1612 MHz is in absorption, and
1720 MHz in emission.
