A new sample of very powerful radio galaxies is defined from the Molonglo
Reference Catalogue, according to the criteria S (408 MHz) > 5 Jy, -30 < Dec <
10 degrees, |b| > 10 degrees. The sample is selected to have similar properties
to the northern 3CR revised sample, and to be visible to a combination of
existing northern telescopes such as the Very Large Array radio interferometer
and large southern hemisphere telescope facilities. The sample contains 178
sources, of which spectroscopic redshifts are available in the literature for
128. For the remaining 50 sources, new radio imaging, optical imaging and
spectroscopic observations are presented to identify the host galaxies and
determine their redshifts. With these new observations the total sample is 100%
optically identified and redshifts are available for 174 (98%) of the sources.
The sample consists of one starburst galaxy, one Seyfert galaxy, 127 radio
galaxies and 49 quasars. Basic properties of the sample, such as the
distributions of the quasar and radio galaxy populations in redshift and their
locations on the radio power versus linear size (P-D) diagram, show no
significant differences from the revised 3CR sample. The equatorial location
and the high spectroscopic completeness of this sample make it a valuable
resource for detailed studies of the nature and environments of these important
objects with the new generation of southern hemisphere telescopes.
