We present the catalog of RR Lyrae stars from 2.4 square degrees of central
parts of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The photometric data were collected
during four years of the OGLE-II microlensing survey. Photometry of each star
was obtained using the Difference Image Analysis (DIA) method. The catalog
contains 571 objects, including 458 RRab, 56 RRc variables, and 57 double mode
RR Lyr stars (RRd). Additionally we attach a list of variables with periods
between 0.18-0.26 days, which are probably delta Sct stars. Period, BVI
photometry, astrometry, amplitude, and parameters of the Fourier decomposition
of the I-band light curve are provided for each object. We also present the
Petersen diagram for double mode pulsators.
  We found that the SMC RR Lyr stars are fairly uniformly distributed over the
studied area, with no clear correlation to any location. The most preferred
periods for RRab and RRc stars are 0.589 and 0.357 days, respectively. We
noticed significant excess of stars with periods of about 0.29 days, which
might be second-overtone RR Lyr stars (RRe). The mean extinction free
magnitudes derived for RRab stars are 18.97, 19.45 and 19.73 mag for the I, V
and B-band, respectively.
  All presented data, including individual BVI observations, are available from
the OGLE Internet archive.
