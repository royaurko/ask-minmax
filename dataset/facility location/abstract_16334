Detailed dependence of resonant spin-flavor (RSF) conversion of supernova
neutrinos on electron mole fraction Ye is investigated. Supernova explosion
forms a hot-bubble and neutrino-driven wind region of which electron mole
fraction exceeds 0.5 in several seconds after the core collapse. When a higher
resonance of the RSF conversion is located in the innermost region, flavor
change of the neutrinos strongly depends on the sign of 1-2Ye. At an adiabatic
high RSF resonance the flavor conversion of bar{nu}_e -> nu_{mu,tau} occurs in
Ye < 0.5 and normal mass hierarchy or in Ye > 0.5 and inverted mass hierarchy.
In other cases of Ye values and mass hierarchies, the conversion of nu_e ->
bar{nu}_{mu,tau} occurs. The final bar{nu}_e spectrum is evaluated in the cases
of Ye < 0.5 and Ye > 0.5 taking account of the RSF conversion. Based on the
obtained result, time variation of the event number ratios of low bar{nu}_e
energy to high bar{nu}_e energy is discussed. In normal mass hierarchy, an
enhancement of the event ratio should be seen in the period when the electron
fraction in the innermost region exceeds 0.5. In inverted mass hierarchy, on
the other hand, a dip of the event ratio should be observed. Therefore, the
time variation of the event number ratio is useful to investigate the effect of
the RSF conversion.
