The FLASH L-band (1.3 GHz) superconducting accelerator facility at DESY has a
Low Level RF (LLRF) system that is similar to that envisioned for ILC. This
system has extensive monitoring capability and was used to gather performance
data relevant to ILC. In particular, waveform data were recorded with beam off
for three, 8-cavity cryomodules to evaluate the input rf stability,
perturbations to the SC cavity frequencies and the rf overhead required to
achieve constant gradient during the 800 microseconds pulses. In this paper, we
discuss the measurements and data analysis procedures and present key findings
on the pulse-to-pulse input rf and cavity field stability.
