Using exact numerical techniques we investigate the nature of excitonic
(electron-hole) bound states and the development of exciton coherence in the
one-dimensional half-filled extended Falicov-Kimball model. The ground-state
phase diagram of the model exhibits, besides band insulator and staggered
orbital ordered phases, an excitonic insulator (EI) with power-law
correlations. The criticality of the EI state shows up in the von Neumann
entropy. The anomalous spectral function and condensation amplitude provide the
binding energy and coherence length of the electron-hole pairs which, on their
part, point towards a Coulomb interaction driven crossover from BCS-like
electron-hole pairing fluctuations to tightly bound excitons. We show that
while a mass imbalance between electrons and holes does not affect the location
of the BCS-BEC crossover regime it favors staggered orbital ordering to the
disadvantage of the EI. Within the BEC regime the quasiparticle dispersion
develops a flat valence-band top in accord with the experimental finding for
Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$.
