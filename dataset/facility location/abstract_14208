By means of atomistic tight-binding calculations, we investigate the
transport properties of vertical devices made of two incommensurately
misoriented graphene layers. With a chosen transport direction (Ox-axis), we
define two classes of rotated graphene lattice distinguished by the different
properties of their lattice symmetry and, hence, Brillouin zone, i.e., the two
Dirac cones are located either at the same $k_y$-point ($K_y' = K_y = 0$) or at
different $k_y$-points ($K_y' = -K_y = 2\pi/3L_y$, where $L_y$ is the periodic
length along the Oy axis). As a consequence, a misalignment of Dirac cones of
two layers occurs and a significant energy-gap ($\sim$ a few hundreds of meV)
of transmission is achieved in devices made of two layers of different lattice
classes. We also shown that strain engineering can be used to strongly enlarge
the gap in this type of device.
