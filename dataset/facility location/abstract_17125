This article describes a new class of prior distributions for nonparametric
function estimation. The unknown function is modeled as a limit of weighted
sums of kernels or generator functions indexed by continuous parameters that
control local and global features such as their translation, dilation,
modulation and shape. L\'{e}vy random fields and their stochastic integrals are
employed to induce prior distributions for the unknown functions or,
equivalently, for the number of kernels and for the parameters governing their
features. Scaling, shape, and other features of the generating functions are
location-specific to allow quite different function properties in different
parts of the space, as with wavelet bases and other methods employing
overcomplete dictionaries. We provide conditions under which the stochastic
expansions converge in specified Besov or Sobolev norms. Under a Gaussian error
model, this may be viewed as a sparse regression problem, with regularization
induced via the L\'{e}vy random field prior distribution. Posterior inference
for the unknown functions is based on a reversible jump Markov chain Monte
Carlo algorithm. We compare the L\'{e}vy Adaptive Regression Kernel (LARK)
method to wavelet-based methods using some of the standard test functions, and
illustrate its flexibility and adaptability in nonstationary applications.
