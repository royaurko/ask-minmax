The Bayesian approach to the prediction of particle type given measurements
of particle location is explored, using a parametric model whose prior is based
on the transformation group. Two types of particle are considered, and
locations are expressed in terms of a single spatial coordinate. Several cases
corresponding to different states of prior knowledge are evaluated, including
the effect of measurement uncertainty. Comparisons are made to nearest neighbor
classification and kernel density estimation. How one can evaluate the
reliability of the prediction solely from the available data is discussed.
