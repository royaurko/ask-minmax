Using data obtained from first-principles calculations, we show that the
position of the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) and transition temperature at
MPB in ferroelectric perovskite solutions can be predicted with quantitative
accuracy from the properties of the constituent cations. We find that the mole
fraction of PbTiO$_3$ at MPB in Pb(B$'$B$''$)O$_3$-PbTiO$_3$,
BiBO$_3$-PbTiO$_3$ and Bi(B$'$B$''$)O$_3$-PbTiO$_3$ exhibits a linear
dependence on the ionic size (tolerance factor) and the ionic displacements of
the B-cations as found by density functional theory calculations. This
dependence is due to competition between the local repulsion and A-cation
displacement alignment interactions. Inclusion of first-principles displacement
data also allows accurate prediction of transiton temperatures at the MPB. The
obtained structure-property correlations are used to predict morphotropic phase
boundaries and transition temperatures in as yet unsynthesized solid solutions.
