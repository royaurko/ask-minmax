We found a narrow absorption feature at 0.57keV in the co-added RGS spectrum
of the isolated neutron star RX J0720.4-3125 with an equivalent width of
1.35+/-0.3eV and FWHM ~6.0eV. The feature was identified with an absorption
line of highly ionized oxygen OVII, most probably originating in the ambient
medium of RX J0720.4-3125. An extensive investigation with the photo-ionization
code CLOUDY indicates the possibility that the optical flux excess observed in
the spectrum of RX J0720.4-3125 at least partially originates in a relatively
dense (e.g. nH~10^8 cm^-3) slab, located in the vicinity of the neutron star
(e.g. ~10^10cm).
