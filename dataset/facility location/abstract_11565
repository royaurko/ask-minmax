We show here a component of the meridional circulation developing at
medium-high latitudes (40-50 degrees) before the new solar cycle starts. Like
the torsional oscillation of the zonal flows, this extra circulation seems to
precede the onset of magnetic activity at the solar surface and move slowly
towards lower latitudes. However, the behavior of this component differs from
that of the torsional oscillation regarding location and convergence towards
the equator at the end of the cycle. The observation of this component before
the magnetic regions appear at the solar surface has only been possible due to
the prolonged solar minimum. The results could settle the discussion as to
whether the extra component of the meridional circulation around the activity
belts, which has been known for some time, is or is not an effect of material
motions around the active regions.
