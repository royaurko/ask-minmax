Tor hidden services allow running Internet services while protecting the
location of the servers. Their main purpose is to enable freedom of speech even
in situations in which powerful adversaries try to suppress it. However,
providing location privacy and client anonymity also makes Tor hidden services
an attractive platform for every kind of imaginable shady service. The ease
with which Tor hidden services can be set up has spurred a huge growth of
anonymously provided Internet services of both types. In this paper we analyse
the landscape of Tor hidden services. We have studied Tor hidden services after
collecting 39824 hidden service descriptors on 4th of Feb 2013 by exploiting
protocol and implementation flaws in Tor: we scanned them for open ports; in
the case of HTTP services, we analysed and classified their content. We also
estimated the popularity of hidden services by looking at the request rate for
hidden service descriptors by clients. We found that while the content of Tor
hidden services is rather varied, the most popular hidden services are related
to botnets.
