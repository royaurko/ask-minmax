In an experiment performed at the LISE3 facility of GANIL, we studied the
decay of 22Al produced by the fragmentation of a 36Ar primary beam. A
beta-decay half-life of 91.1 +- 0.5 ms was measured. The beta-delayed one- and
two-proton emission as well as beta-alpha and beta-delayed gamma decays were
measured and allowed us to establish a partial decay scheme for this nucleus.
New levels were determined in the daughter nucleus 22Mg. The comparison with
model calculations strongly favours a spin-parity of 4+ for the ground state of
22Al.
