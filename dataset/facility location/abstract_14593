We present Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) All-Sky Monitor observations of
the X-ray binary Circinus X-1 which illustrate the variety of intensity
profiles associated with the 16.55 d flaring cycle of the source. We also
present eight observations of Cir X-1 made with the RXTE Proportional Counter
Array over the course of a cycle wherein the average intensity of the flaring
state decreased gradually over ~12 days. Fourier power density spectra for
these observations show a narrow quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) peak which
shifts in frequency between 6.8 Hz and 32 Hz, as well as a broad QPO peak that
remains roughly stationary at ~4 Hz. We identify these as Z-source horizontal
and normal branch oscillations (HBOs/NBOs) respectively. Color-color and
hardness-intensity diagrams (CDs/HIDs) show curvilinear tracks for each of the
observations. The properties of the QPOs and very low frequency noise allow us
to identify segments of these tracks with Z-source horizontal, normal, and
flaring branches which shift location in the CDs and HIDs over the course of
the 16.55 d cycle. These results contradict a previous prediction, based on the
hypothesis that Cir X-1 is a high-Mdot atoll source, that HBOs should never
occur in this source (Oosterbroek et al. 1995; van der Klis 1994).
