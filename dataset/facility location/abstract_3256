We discuss the observational properties of a remarkably faint triply-imaged
galaxy revealed in a deep z-band ACS observation of the lensing cluster A2218.
A well-constrained mass model for the cluster, which incorporates the outcome
of recent Keck spectroscopic campaigns, suggests that the triple system arises
via a z>6 source viewed at high magnification (~x25). Optical and IR photometry
from HST and Keck confirms the lensing hypothesis and suggests a significant
discontinuity occurs in the spectral energy distribution within 9250-9850A. If
this break is associated with Gunn-Peterson absorption from neutral
hydrogen,6.6<z<7.1 is inferred. Deep Keck spectroscopy conducted using both
optical and IR spectrographs fails to reveal any prominent emission lines in
this region. However, an IR stellar continuum is detected whose decline below
9800A suggests a spectroscopic redshift of z~7. Regardless of the precise
redshift, the source is remarkably compact (<1 kpc) and faint (z=28.0) yet is
undergoing vigorous star formation at a rate ~2.6 Mo/yr. An intriguing property
is the steep slope of the UV continuum implied by the photometry which may
suggest that the source is representative of an early population of galaxies
responsible for cosmic reionization. Independent verification of these results
is highly desirable but our attempts highlight the difficulty of studying such
sources with present facilities and the challenges faced in pushing back the
frontiers of the observable universe beyond z~6.5.
