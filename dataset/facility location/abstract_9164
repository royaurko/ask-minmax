PICsIT (Pixellated Imaging CaeSium Iodide Telescope) is the high energy
detector of the IBIS telescope on-board the INTEGRAL satellite. PICsIT operates
in the gamma-ray energy range between 175 keV and 10 MeV, with a typical energy
resolution of 10% at 1 MeV, and an angular resolution of 12 arcmin within a
\~100 square degree field of view, with the possibility to locate intense point
sources in the MeV region at the few arcmin level. PICsIT is based upon a
modular array of 4096 independent CsI(Tl) pixels, ~0.70 cm^2 in cross-section
and 3 cm thick. In this work, the PICsIT on-board data handling and science
operative modes are described. This work presents the in-flight performances in
terms of background count spectra, sensitivity limit, and imaging capabilities.
