We report a search for radio continuum emission from the gamma-ray pulsar
Geminga. We have used the VLA to image the location of the optical counterpart
of Geminga at 74 and 326 MHz. We detect no radio counterpart. We derive upper
limits to the pulse-averaged flux density of Geminga, taking diffractive
scintillation into account. We find that diffractive scintillation is probably
quenched at 74 MHz and does not influence our upper limit, S < 56 mJy
(2\sigma), but that a 95% confidence level at 326 MHz is S < 5 mJy. Owing to
uncertainties on the other low-frequency detections and the possibility of
intrinsic variability or extrinsic variability (refractive interstellar
scintillation) or both, our non-detections are nominally consistent with these
previous detections.
