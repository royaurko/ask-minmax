We have investigated the problem of the distribution of both masses and
orbital radii of planets resulting from the gas-accretion, gas-capture model.
First we followed the evolution of gas and solids from the moment where all
solids are in the form of small grains to the stage when most of them are in
the form of planetesimals for a set of different initial masses and sizes of
protoplanetary disks. Based on that we performed Monte Carlo calculations
describing the formation of giant places at different locations. We included
the effects of type II migration and growth of the mass of the planet after the
gap opened. We discuss how these effects influence the final distribution of
giant planets. We show that when the giant planets are not able to migrate or
grow in mass after the gap opens, their distribution is mainly determined by
the properties of the gaseous disk. However, with those two effects included,
reproducing the parameters of the gaseous disks from the distribution of
planets becomes difficult. We also checked the roles of both the material of
which the solids consist and the mass of the central star. The main result is
that, in disks around less massive stars, giant planets at the given location
tend to be less massive. At the same time, the giant planets with the given
mass tend to form closer to the less massive stars.
