We investigate recently proposed method for locating critical temperatures
and introduce some modifications which allow to formulate exact criterion for
any self-dual model. We apply the modified method for the Ashkin-Teller model
and show that the exact result for a critical temperature is reproduced. We
test also a two-layer Ising model for the presence of eventual self-duality.
