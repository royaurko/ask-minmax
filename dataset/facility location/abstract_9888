The close similarity between the hierarchies of multiple-point correlation
functions for the diffusion-limited coalescence and annihilation processes has
caused some recent confusion, raising doubts as to whether such hierarchies
uniquely determine an infinite particle system. We elucidate the precise
relations between the two processes, arriving at the conclusion that the
hierarchy of correlation functions does provide a complete representation of a
particle system on the line. We also introduce a new hierarchy of probability
density functions, for finding particles at specified locations and none in
between. This hierarchy is computable for coalescence, through the method of
empty intervals, and is naturally suited for questions concerning the ordering
of particles on the line.
