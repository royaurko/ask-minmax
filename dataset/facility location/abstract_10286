We investigate the chiral phase transition of a QCD-like theory, based the
shape change of the effective potential near the critical point. The potential
is constructed with the auxiliary field method, and a source term coupled to
the field is introduced in order to compute the potential shape numerically. We
also generalize the potential so as to have two independent order parameters,
the quark scalar density and the number density. We find a tri-critical point
locating at (T,mu)=(97, 203) MeV, and visualize it as the merging point of
three potential minima.
