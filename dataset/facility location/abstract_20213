We perform a study on the optical and infrared photometric properties of
known luminous blue variables (LBVs) in M31 using the sample of LBV candidates
from the Local Group Galaxy Survey (Massey et al. 2007). We find that M31 LBV
candidates show photometric variability ranging from 0.375 to 1.576 magnitudes
in rP1 during a three year time-span observed by the Pan-STARRS 1 Andromeda
survey (PAndromeda). Their near-infrared colors also follow the distribution of
Galactic LBVs as shown by Oksala et al. (2013). We use these features as
selection criteria to search for unknown LBV candidates in M31. We thus devise
a method to search for candidate LBVs using both optical color from the Local
Group Galaxy Survey and infrared color from Two Micron All Sky Survey, as well
as photometric variations observed by PAndromeda. We find four sources
exhibiting common properties of known LBVs. These sources also exhibit UV
emission as seen from GALEX, which is one of the previously adopted method to
search for LBV candidates. The locations of the LBVs are well aligned withM31
spiral arms as seen in the UV light, suggesting they are evolved stars at young
age given their high-mass nature. We compare these candidates with the latest
Geneva evolutionary tracks, which show that our new M31 LBV candidates are
massive evolved stars with an age of 10 to 100 million years.
