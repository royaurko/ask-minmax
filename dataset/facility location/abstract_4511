We present VLA 3.5 cm continuum observations of the Serpens cloud core. 22
radio continuum sources are detected. 16 out of the 22 cm sources are suggested
to be associated with young stellar objects (Class 0, Class I, flat-spectrum,
and Class II) of the young Serpens cluster. The rest of the VLA sources
plausibly are background objects. Most of the Serpens cm sources likely
represent thermal radio jets; on the other hand, the radio continuum emission
of some sources could be due to a gyrosynchroton mechanism arising from
coronally active young stars. The Serpens VLA sources are spatially distributed
into two groups; one of them located towards the NW clump of the Serpens core,
where only Class 0 and Class I protostars are found to present cm emission, and
a second group located towards the SE clump, where radio continuum sources are
associated with objects in evolutionary classes from Class 0 to Class II. This
subgrouping is similar to that found in the near IR, mid-IR and mm wavelength
regimes.
