Detailed $^{195}$Pt- and $^{171}$Yb nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies
on the heterogeneous mixed valence system YbPtGe$_2$ are reported. The
temperature dependence of the $^{195}$Pt-NMR shift $^{195}K(T)$ indicates the
opening of an unusual magnetic gap below 200\,K. $^{195}K(T)$ was analyzed by a
thermal activation model which yields an isotropic gap $\Delta/k_B \approx
200$\,K. In contrast, the spin-lattice relaxation rate $^{195}$($1/T_1$) does
not provide evidence for the gap. Therefore, an intermediate-valence picture is
proposed while a Kondo-insulator scenario can be excluded. Moreover,
$^{195}$($1/T_1$) follows a simple metallic behavior, similar to the reference
compound YPtGe$_2$. A well resolved NMR line with small shift is assigned to
divalent $^{171}$Yb. This finding supports the proposed model with two sub-sets
of Yb species (di- and trivalent) located on the Yb2 and Yb1 site of the
YbPtGe$_2$ lattice.
