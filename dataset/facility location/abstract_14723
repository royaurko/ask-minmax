A survey is presented of the Galactic plane in the J=1-0 transition of
(13)CO. About 73,000 spectra were obtained with the 7 m telescope at Bell
Laboratories over a ten-year period. The coverage of survey is (l, b) = (-5 to
117, -1 to +1), or 244 square degrees, with a grid spacing of 3' for |b| < 0.5,
and a grid spacing of 6' for |b| > 0.5. The data presented here have been
resampled onto a 3' grid. For 0.68 km/s channels, the rms noise level of the
survey is 0.1 K on the $T_R^*$ scale. The raw data have been transformed into
FITS format, and all the reduction processes, such as correcting for emission
in the reference positions, baseline removal and interpolation were conducted
within IRAF using the FCRAO task package and additional programs. The reduced
data are presented here in the form of longitude-velocity color maps at each
latitude. These data allow identification and classification of molecular
clouds with masses in excess of ~ 1,000 solar masses throughout the first
quadrant of the Galaxy. Spiral structure is manifested by the locations of the
largest and brightest molecular clouds.
