We present optical spectrophotometric monitoring of four active T Tauri stars
(DG Tau, RY Tau, XZ Tau, RW Aur A) at high spectral resolution ($R \ga 1 \times
10^4$), to investigate the correlation between time variable mass ejection seen
in the jet/wind structure of the driving source and time variable mass
accretion probed by optical emission lines. This may allow us to constrain the
understanding of the jet/wind launching mechanism, the location of the
launching region, and the physical link with magnetospheric mass accretion. In
2010, observations were made at six different epochs to investigate how daily
and monthly variability might affect such a study. We perform comparisons
between the line profiles we observed and those in the literature over a period
of decades and confirm the presence of time variability separate from the daily
and monthly variability during our observations. This is so far consistent with
the idea that these line profiles have a long term variability (3-20 years)
related to episodic mass ejection suggested by the structures in the extended
flow components. We also investigate the correlations between equivalent widths
and between luminosities for different lines. We find that these correlations
are consistent with the present paradigm of steady magnetospheric mass
accretion and emission line regions that are close to the star.
