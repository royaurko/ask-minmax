CCAT will be a 25m diameter sub-millimeter telescope capable of operating in
the 0.2 to 2.1mm wavelength range. It will be located at an altitude of 5600m
on Cerro Chajnantor in northern Chile near the ALMA site. The anticipated first
generation instruments include large format (60,000 pixel) kinetic inductance
detector (KID) cameras, a large format heterodyne array and a direct detection
multi-object spectrometer. The paper describes the architecture of the CCAT
software and the development strategy.
