An ideal gas of twodimensional Dirac fermions in the background of a
pointlike magnetic vortex with arbitrary flux is considered. We find that this
system acquires fractional electric charge at finite temperatures and determine
the functional dependence of the thermal average and quadratic fluctuation of
the charge on the temperature, the vortex flux, and the continuous parameter of
the boundary condition at the location of the vortex.
