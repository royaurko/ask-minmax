The discovery of a relatively light Higgs opens up the possibility of
circular e+e- Higgs factories. LEP3 is such a machine with emphasis on low
cost, since it re-uses most of the LHC infrastructure, including the tunnel,
cryogenics, and the two general-purpose LHC experiments Atlas and CMS, with
some modifications. The energy reach of LEP3 is 240GeV in the centre of mass,
close to the ZH production maximum. Alternative tunnel diameters and locations
are possible, including a Higgs factory housed in the UNK tunnel, UNK-L, and a
machine located in a new 80 km tunnel in the Geneva region, TLEP, than can
further house a very high energy pp collider. The design merits further
consideration and a detailed study should be performed, so that LEP3 can be one
more option available to the community for the next step in High Energy
Physics.
