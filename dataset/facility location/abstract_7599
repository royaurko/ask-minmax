The main-sequence solar-type star HD69830 has an unusually large amount of
dusty debris orbiting close to three planets found via the radial velocity
technique. In order to explore the dynamical interaction between the dust and
planets, we have performed multi-epoch photometry and spectroscopy of the
system over several orbits of the outer dust. We find no evidence for changes
in either the dust amount or its composition, with upper limits of 5-7% (1
$\sigma$ per spectral element) on the variability of the {\it dust spectrum}
over 1 year, 3.3% (1 $\sigma$) on the broad-band disk emission over 4 years,
and 33% (1 $\sigma$) on the broad-band disk emission over 24 years. Detailed
modeling of the spectrum of the emitting dust indicates that the dust is
located outside of the orbits of the three planets and has a composition
similar to main-belt, C-type asteroids asteroids in our solar system.
Additionally, we find no evidence for a wide variety of gas species associated
with the dust. Our new higher SNR spectra do not confirm our previously claimed
detection of H$_2$O ice leading to a firm conclusion that the debris can be
associated with the break-up of one or more C-type asteroids formed in the dry,
inner regions of the protoplanetary disk of the HD69830 system. The modeling of
the spectral energy distribution and high spatial resolution observations in
the mid-infrared are consistent with a $\sim$ 1 AU location for the emitting
material.
