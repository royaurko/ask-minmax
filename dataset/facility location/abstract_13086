Magnetic susceptibility and microscopic magnetic model of the mineral
clinoclase Cu3(AsO4)(OH)3 are reported. This material can be well described as
a combination of two nonequivalent spin dimers with the sizable magnetic
couplings of J about 700 K and J(D2) about 300 K. Based on density functional
theory calculations, we pinpoint the location of dimers in the crystal
structure. Surprisingly, the largest coupling operates between the structural
Cu2O6 dimers. We investigate magnetostructural correlations in Cu2O6 structural
dimers, by considering the influence of the hydrogen position on the magnetic
coupling. Additionally, we establish the hydrogen positions that were not known
so far and analyze the pattern of hydrogen bonding.
