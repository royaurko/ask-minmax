We study a $\nu=1$ topological system with one twisting edge-state band and
one normal edge-state band. For the twisting edge-state band, Fermi energy goes
through the band three times, thus, having three edge states on one side of the
sample; while the normal edge band contributes only one edge state on the other
side of the sample. In such a system, we show that it consists of both
topologically protected and unprotected edge states, and as a consequence, its
Hall resistance depends on the location where the Hall measurement is done even
for a translationally invariant system. This unique property is absent in a
normal topological insulator.
