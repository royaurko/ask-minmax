Performance problems are often observed in embedded software systems. The
reasons for poor performance are frequently not obvious. Bottlenecks can occur
in any of the software components along the execution path. Therefore it is
important to instrument and monitor the different components contributing to
the runtime behavior of an embedded software system. Performance analysis tools
can help locate performance bottlenecks in embedded software systems by
monitoring the software's execution and producing easily understandable
performance data. We maintain and further develop a tool for analyzing the
performance of Nokia mobile phone software. The user can select among four
performance analysis reports to be generated: average processor load, processor
utilization, task execution time statistics, and task execution timeline. Each
of these reports provides important information about where execution time is
being spent. The demo will show how the tool helps to identify performance
bottlenecks in Nokia mobile phone software and better understand areas of poor
performance.
