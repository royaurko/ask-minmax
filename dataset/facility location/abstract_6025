We study the definition of perturbations in the presence of a submanifold,
like e.g. a brane. In the standard theory of cosmological perturbations, one
compares quantities at the same coordinate points in the non-perturbed and the
perturbed manifolds, identified via a (non-unique) mapping between the two
manifolds. In the presence of a physical submanifold one needs to modify this
definition in order to evaluate perturbations of quantities at the submanifold
location. As an application, we compute the perturbed metric and the extrinsic
curvature tensors at the brane position in a general gauge.
