Modern avalanche photodiodes (APDs) with high gain are good device candidates
for light readout from detectors applied in relativistic heavy ion collisions
experiments. The results of the investigations of the APDs properties from
Zecotek, Ketek and Hamamatsu manufacturers after irradiation using secondary
neutrons from cyclotron facility U120M at NPI of ASCR in \v{R}e\v{z} are
presented. The results of the investigations can be used for the design of the
detectors for the experiments at NICA and FAIR.
