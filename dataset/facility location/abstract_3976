This guide presents, in a uniform manner, all the information collected by
the IUE satellite on normal galaxies. It contains information on 274 galaxies
and it supersedes the previous IUE guide to normal galaxies (Longo & Capaccioli
1992). The data shown here are restricted to galaxies defined as ``normal'' by
the observer, and entered as such in the IUE data file header. The information
is also restricted to low-dispersion spectra obtained through the large
apertures of IUE. For the first time, we provide spectral information from
well-defined and identifiable locations in the target galaxies. These are
mostly located close to the photocenter of each object, although there are few
exceptions. Each representative spectrum of a galaxy consists of a short-wave
(SW) and a long-wave (LW) IUE low-dispersion spectrum (where available)
combined into a single spectrum covering the wavelength range 1150 A to 3350 A.
We selected the two spectra to be combined so as to be, preferably, the deepest
exposures available in the INES archive. Each representative spectrum is
accompanied by two images of the galaxy, on which the locations of the SW
entrance aperture and the LW entrance aperture are marked. The guide is
