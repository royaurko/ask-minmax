Author offers conclusions from his research of a revolutionary new idea -
transferring electric energy in the hard vacuum of outer space wirelessly,
using a plasma power cord as an electric cable (wire). He shows that a certain
minimal electric currency creates a compressed force that supports the plasma
cable in the compacted form. A large energy can be transferred hundreds of
millions of kilometers by this method. The required mass of the plasma cable is
only hundreds of grams. He computed the macroprojects: transference of hundreds
kilowatts of energy to Earth Space Station, transferring energy to the Moon or
back, transferring energy to a spaceship at distance 100 million of kilometers,
the transfer energy to Mars when one is located at opposed side of the distant
Sun, transfer colossal energy from one of Earth's continents to another
continent (for example, between Europe-USA) wirelessly-using Earth ionosphere
as cable, using Earth as gigantic storage of electric energy, using the plasma
ring as huge MagSail for moving of spaceships. He also demonstrates that
electric currency in a plasma cord can accelerate or brake spacecraft and space
apparatus.
