We investigate the graviton propagator in the type IIB supergravity
background which is dual to 4 dimensional noncommutative gauge theory. We
assume that the boundary is located not at the infinity but at the
noncommutative scale where the string frame metric exhibits the maximum. We
argue that the Neumann boundary condition is the appropriate boundary condition
to be adopted at the boundary. We find that the graviton propagator behaves
just as that of the 4 dimensional massless graviton. On the other hand, the
non-analytic behaviors of the other Kaluza-Klein modes are not significantly
affected by the Neumann boundary condition.
