All galaxies that have been adequately examined so far have shown an extended
stellar halo. To search for such a halo in the LMC we have obtained
low-resolution spectra for 100 LMC RR Lyrae stars, of which 87 are in the field
and 13 in the clusters NGC1835 and NGC2019. We measured radial velocities for
87 LMC RR Lyrae stars, and metallicities for 78 RR Lyrae stars, nearly tripling
the previous sample. These targets are located in 10 fields covering a wide
range of distances, out to 2.5 degrees from the center of the LMC. Our main
result is that the mean velocity dispersion for the LMC RR Lyrae stars is
50+-2km/s. This quantity does not appear to vary with distance from the LMC
center. The metallicity shows a Gaussian distribution, with mean
[Fe/H]=-1.53+-0.02dex, and dispersion 0.20 dex in the Harris metallicity scale,
confirming that they represent a very homogeneous metal-poor population. There
is no dependence between the kinematics and metallicity of the field RR Lyrae
star population. Using good quality low-resolution spectra from FORS1, FORS2
and GEMINI-GMOS we have found that field RR Lyrae stars in the LMC show a large
velocity dispersion and that this indicate the presence of old and metal-poor
stellar halo. All the evidence so far for the halo, however, is from the
spectroscopy of the inner LMC regions, similar to the inner flattened halo in
our Galaxy. Further study is necessary to confirm this important result.
