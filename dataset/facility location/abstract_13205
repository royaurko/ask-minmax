By using Bohmian trajectory method, we investigate the dynamic interference
in diatomic molecular high-order harmonic generation progress. It is
demonstrated that the main characteristics of the molecular harmonic spectrum
can be well reproduced by only two Bohmain trajectories which are located
respectively at the two ions. This is because these two localized trajectories
can receive and store the whole collision information coming from all of the
other recollision trajectories. Therefore, the amplitudes and frequencies of
these two trajectories represent the intensity and frequency distribution of
the harmonic generation. Moreover, the interference between these two
trajectories shows a dip in the harmonic spectrum, which indicates the
molecular structure information. ?
