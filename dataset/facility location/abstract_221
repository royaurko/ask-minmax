A superconducting RF accelerator test facility is currently under
construction at Fermilab. The accelerator will consist of an electron gun, 40
MeV injector, beam acceleration section consisting of 3 TTF-type or ILC-type
cryomodules, and multiple downstream beam lines for testing diagnostics and
performing beam experiments. With 3 cryomodules installed this facility will
initially be capable of generating an 810 MeV electron beam with ILC beam
intensity. The facility can accommodate up to 6 cryomodules for a total beam
energy of 1.5 GeV. This facility will be used to test SRF cryomodules under
high intensity beam conditions, RF power equipment, instrumentation, and LLRF
and controls systems for future SRF accelerators such as the ILC and Project-X.
This paper describes the current status and overall plans for this facility.
