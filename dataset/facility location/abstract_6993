We present a general construction for exact analytic Taylor states in
axisymmetric toroidal geometries. In this construction, the Taylor equilibria
are fully determined by specifying the aspect ratio, elongation, and
triangularity of the desired plasma geometry. For equilibria with a magnetic
X-point, the location of the X-point must also be specified. The flexibility
and simplicity of these solutions make them useful for verifying the accuracy
of numerical solvers and for theoretical studies of Taylor states in laboratory
experiments.
