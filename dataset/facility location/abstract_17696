Clear identifications of Galactic young stellar clusters farther than a few
kpc from the Sun are rare, despite the large number of candidate clusters. We
aim to improve the selection of candidate clusters rich in massive stars with a
multiwavelength analysis of photometric Galactic data that range from optical
to mid-infrared wavelengths. We present a photometric and spectroscopic
analysis of five candidate stellar clusters, which were selected as
overdensities with bright stars (Ks < 7 mag) in GLIMPSE and 2MASS images. A
total of 48 infrared spectra were obtained. The combination of photometry and
spectroscopy yielded six new red supergiant stars with masses from 10 Msun to
15 Msun. Two red supergiants are located at Galactic coordinates
(l,b)=(16.7deg,-0.63deg) and at a distance of about ~3.9 kpc; four other red
supergiants are members of a cluster at Galactic coordinates
(l,b)=(49.3deg,+0.72deg) and at a distance of ~7.0 kpc. Spectroscopic analysis
of the brightest stars of detected overdensities and studies of interstellar
extinction along their line of sights are fundamental to distinguish regions of
low extinction from actual stellar clusters. The census of young star clusters
containing red supergiants is incomplete; in the existing all-sky near-infrared
surveys, they can be identified as overdensities of bright stars with infrared
color-magnitude diagrams characterized by gaps.
