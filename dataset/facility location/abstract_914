We investigate the sensitivities of future neutrino oscillation experiments
for measuring the neutrino mass squared differences and leptonic mixing angles
independently with neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. We update the expected
sensitivities of Neutrino Factories to the "atmospheric" (anti-)neutrino
parameters using an optimized setup. A dedicated beta-Beam facility, in
combination with a SPMIN reactor experiment, could give excellent sensitivities
also to the "solar" parameters, for neutrinos and anti-neutrinos respectively.
A signal of a different mass matrix for neutrinos and anti-neutrinos would
imply CPT violation and non-locality of the underlying particle theory.
