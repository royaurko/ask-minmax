In November 2010, the search for the 4He-{\eta} bound state was per formed
with high statistics and high acceptance with the WASA-at-COSY facility using a
ramped beam technique. The signature of eta - mesic nuclei is searched for in
the measured excitation functions for the two reaction channels: dd ->3He n pi0
and dd ->3He p pi- near the eta production threshold. This report includes the
description of the experimental method and the status of the data analysis.
