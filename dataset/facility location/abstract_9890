We report the in-plane optical measurements on Na$_x$CoO$_2$ with
0.18$\leq$x$\leq$0.92. The crystal growth and characterization were described
in detail. The spectral weight increases monotonically with decreasing x. For
sample with the lowest Na content x$\sim$0.18, the optical conductivity was
strongly suppressed below 2200 $cm^{-1}$ at low temperature. The suppression
becomes weaker with increasing Na content, and disappears in charge-ordered
sample with x$\sim$0.5. At higher Na contents, similar suppression appears
again but locates at higher energy scale near 3300 $cm^{-1}$. Our analysis
indicates that those spectral features are dominated by a combination of
electrons coupling to a bosonic mode and a pseudogap-like phenomenon. We
suggest that the pseudogap-like phenomenon is purely a band structure effect.
The infrared activated phonon modes were discussed in relation with the
structural geometries.
