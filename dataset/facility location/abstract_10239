We explore the usefulness of the existing relations between the $S$-matrix
and time delay in characterizing baryon resonances in pion-nucleon scattering.
We draw attention to the fact that the existence of a positive maximum in time
delay is a necessary criterion for the existence of a resonance and should be
used as a constraint in conventional analyses which locate resonances from
poles of the $S$-matrix and Argand diagrams. The usefulness of the time delay
plots of resonances is demonstrated through a detailed analysis of the time
delay in several partial waves of $\pi N$ elastic scattering.
