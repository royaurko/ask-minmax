Handoff has become an essential criterion in mobile communication system,
specially in urban areas, owing to the limited coverage area of Access Points
(AP). Handover of calls between two Base Stations (BSs) is encountered
frequently and it is essentially required to minimize the delay of the process.
Many solutions attempting to improve this process have been proposed but only a
few use geo-location systems in the management of the handover. Here we propose
to minimize the handoff latency by minimizing the number of APs scanned by the
Mobile Node (MN) during each handoff procedure. We consider the whole
topographical area as a two dimensional plane. By GPS, we can note down the
co-ordinates of the MN at any instant. The average rate of change of its
latitudinal distance and longitudinal distance with a specific time period is
evaluated at the end of the given time period. With the knowledge of the given
parameter, it is possible to determine the latitude and longitude of the MN
after a particular instant of time. Hence, the direction of motion of the MN
can be determined, which in turns gives the AP towards which the MN is
headings. This reduces the number of APs to be scanned. Thus, on an overall
basis, the handoff latency can be reduced by almost half to one third of its
value.
