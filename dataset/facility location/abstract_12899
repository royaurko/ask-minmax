This paper describes the Hangulphabet, a new writing system that should prove
useful in a number of contexts. Using the Hangulphabet, a user can instantly
see voicing, manner and place of articulation of any phoneme found in human
language. The Hangulphabet places consonant graphemes on a grid with the x-axis
representing the place of articulation and the y-axis representing manner of
articulation. Each individual grapheme contains radicals from both axes where
the points intersect. The top radical represents manner of articulation where
the bottom represents place of articulation. A horizontal line running through
the middle of the bottom radical represents voicing. For vowels, place of
articulation is located on a grid that represents the position of the tongue in
the mouth. This grid is similar to that of the IPA vowel chart (International
Phonetic Association, 1999). The difference with the Hangulphabet being the
trapezoid representing the vocal apparatus is on a slight tilt. Place of
articulation for a vowel is represented by a breakout figure from the grid.
This system can be used as an alternative to the International Phonetic
Alphabet (IPA) or as a complement to it. Beginning students of linguistics may
find it particularly useful. A Hangulphabet font has been created to facilitate
switching between the Hangulphabet and the IPA.
