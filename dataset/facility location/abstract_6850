We compute the length and timescales associated with resonant orbits in the
Kerr Metric for all orbital and spin parameters. Resonance induced effects are
potentially observable when the Event Horizon telescope resolves the inner
structure of Sgr A*, space-based gravitational wave detectors record
phase-shifts in the waveform during the resonant passage of a neutron star as
it spirals in to the black hole and in the frequencies of quasi periodic
oscillations for accreting black holes. The onset of geodesic chaos for
non-Kerr spacetimes should occur at the resonance locations quantified here.
