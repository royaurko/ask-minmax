Quench is a common phenomenon in a superconducting cavity and often limits
the accelerating gradient of the cavity. Accurate location of the quench site
can be located by second sound detection. For multi-cell superconducting
cavity, one defect may cause the cell with defect quenches and then the whole
cavity quenches. Now we proposed a new method to eliminate the bad influence of
the quench cell to the whole cavity.
