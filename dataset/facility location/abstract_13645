We propose an architecture for fine-grained visual categorization that
approaches expert human performance in the classification of bird species. Our
architecture first computes an estimate of the object's pose; this is used to
compute local image features which are, in turn, used for classification. The
features are computed by applying deep convolutional nets to image patches that
are located and normalized by the pose. We perform an empirical study of a
number of pose normalization schemes, including an investigation of higher
order geometric warping functions. We propose a novel graph-based clustering
algorithm for learning a compact pose normalization space. We perform a
detailed investigation of state-of-the-art deep convolutional feature
implementations and fine-tuning feature learning for fine-grained
classification. We observe that a model that integrates lower-level feature
layers with pose-normalized extraction routines and higher-level feature layers
with unaligned image features works best. Our experiments advance
state-of-the-art performance on bird species recognition, with a large
improvement of correct classification rates over previous methods (75% vs.
55-65%).
