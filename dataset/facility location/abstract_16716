Fix an integer $ n$ and number $d$, $ 0< d\neq n-1 \leq n$, and two weights $
w$ and $ \sigma $ on $ \mathbb R ^{n}$. We two extra conditions (1) no common
point masses and (2) the two weights separately are not concentrated on a set
of codimension one, uniformly over locations and scales. (This condition holds
for doubling weights.) Then, we characterize the two weight inequality for the
$ d$-dimensional Riesz transform on $ \mathbb R ^{n}$, \begin{equation*}
\sup_{0< a < b < \infty}\left\lVert \int_{a < \lvert x-y\rvert < b} f (y) \frac
{x-y} {\lvert x-y\rvert ^{d+1}} \; \sigma (dy) \right\rVert_{L ^{2}
(\mathbb{R}^n;w)} \le \mathscr N \lVert f\rVert_{L ^2 (\mathbb{R}^n;\sigma)}
\end{equation*} in terms of these two conditions, and their duals: For finite
constants $ \mathscr A_2$ and $ \mathscr T$, uniformly over all cubes $
Q\subset \mathbb R ^{n}$ \begin{gather*} \frac {w (Q)} {\lvert Q\rvert ^{d/n}}
\int_{\mathbb R ^{n}} \frac {\lvert Q\rvert ^{d/n}} {\lvert Q\rvert ^{2d/n}
+{dist}(x, Q) ^{2d/n}} \; \sigma (dx) \leq \mathscr A_2 \\ \int_{Q} \lvert
\mathsf R_{\sigma} \mathbf 1_{Q} (x)\rvert ^2 \; w(dx) \le \mathscr T ^2 \sigma
(Q), \end{gather*} where $ \mathsf R_{\sigma}$ denotes any of the truncations
of the Riesz transform as above, the dual conditions are obtained by
interchanging the roles of the two weights. Examples show that a key step of
the proof fails in absence of the extra geometric condition imposed on the
weights.
