Implementation and commissioning of the EPICS based control system for the
ISAC radioactive beam facility was completed. The target ion source, mass
separator, and low-energy beam-lines started beam production for experiments.
In parallel, controls for the accelerator system, a radio-frequency quadrupole
followed by a drift-tube linac, and several high-energy beam-lines were
implemented and commissioned. The number of controlled devices more than
doubled since the last report. An overview of relational database usage,
software engineering and quality control methods used will be given.
