We analyzed the shapes of Galactic open clusters by the star counting
technique with the 2MASS star catalog database. Morphological parameters such
as the ellipticity and size have been derived via stellar density distribution,
weighed by clustering probability. We find that most star clusters are
elongated, even for the youngest star clusters of a few million years old,
which are located near to the Galactic disk. The shapes of young star clusters
must reflect the conditions in the parental molecular clouds and during the
cluster formation process. As an open cluster ages, stellar dynamics cause the
inner part of the cluster to circularize, but the overall radius gets larger
and the stellar density becomes sparser. We discuss how internal relaxation
process competes with Galactic external perturbation during cluster evolution.
