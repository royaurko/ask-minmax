Presently seven nearby radio-quiet isolated neutron stars discovered in ROSAT
data and characterized by thermal X-ray spectra are known. They exhibit very
similar properties and despite intensive searches their number remained
constant since 2001 which led to their name ``The Magnificent Seven''. Five of
the stars exhibit pulsations in their X-ray flux with periods in the range of
3.4 s to 11.4 s. XMM-Newton observations revealed broad absorption lines in the
X-ray spectra which are interpreted as cyclotron resonance absorption lines by
protons or heavy ions and / or atomic transitions shifted to X-ray energies by
strong magnetic fields of the order of 10^13 G. New XMM-Newton observations
indicate more complex X-ray spectra with multiple absorption lines. Pulse-phase
spectroscopy of the best studied pulsars RX J0720.4-3125 and RBS 1223 reveals
variations in derived emission temperature and absorption line depth with pulse
phase. Moreover, RX J0720.4-3125 shows long-term spectral changes which are
interpreted as due to free precession of the neutron star. Modeling of the
pulse profiles of RX J0720.4-3125 and RBS 1223 provides information about the
surface temperature distribution of the neutron stars indicating hot polar caps
which have different temperatures, different sizes and are probably not located
in antipodal positions.
