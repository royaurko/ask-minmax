Theory of melting of the vortex lattice in type II superconductors in the
framework of Ginzburg - Landau approach is presented. The melting line location
is determined and magnetization and specific heat jumps along it are
calculated. The magnetization of liquid is larger than that of solid by 1.8%
irrespective of the melting temperature, while the specific heat jump is about
6% and decreases slowly with temperature. The magnetization curves agrees with
experimental results on YBCO and Monte Carlo simulations.
