We calculate the meson screening mass in a pion superfluid in the framework
of Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. The minimum of the attractive quark potential is
always located at the phase boundary of pion superfluid. Different from the
temperature and baryon density effect, the potential at finite isospin density
can not be efficiently suppressed and the matter is always in a strongly
coupled phase due to the Goldstone mode in the pion superfluid.
