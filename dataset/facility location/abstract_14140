Recently, noncentrosymmetric superconductor BiPd has attracted considerable
research interest due to the possibility of being a topological superconductor.
Here, we report a systematic high-resolution angle resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) study of the normal state electronic properties of BiPd.
Our experimental results show the presence of a surface state at higher binding
energy with the location of Dirac point at around 700 meV below the Fermi
level. The detailed photon energy and temperature dependent measurements
complemented by our first-principles calculations provide further evidence for
the presence of the topological surface state at high binding energy. The
absence of topological surface states near the Fermi level negates the
possibility of the topological superconducting behavior in the surface of this
material. Our first direct experimental discovery of a topological surface
state in BiPd provides novel information that will guide the future search for
topological superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric materials.
