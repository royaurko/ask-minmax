Since the previous (1990) edition of this meeting enormous progress in the
field of OB associations has been made. Data from X-ray satellites have greatly
advanced the study of the low-mass stellar content of associations, while
astrometric data from the Hipparcos satellite allow for a characterization of
the higher-mass content of associations with unprecedented accuracy. We review
recent work on the OB associations located within 1.5 kpc from the Sun, discuss
the Hipparcos results at length, and point out directions for future research.
