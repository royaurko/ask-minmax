The contribution by massive stars (M > 9 solar masses) to the weak s-process
component of the solar system abundances is primarily due to the 22Ne neutron
source, which is activated near the end of helium-core burning. The residual
22Ne left over from helium-core burning is then reignited during carbon
burning, initiating further s-processing that modifies the isotopic
distribution. This modification is sensitive to the stellar structure and the
carbon burning reaction rate. Recent work on the 12C + 12C reaction suggests
that resonances located within the Gamow peak may exist, causing a strong
increase in the astrophysical S-factor and consequently the reaction rate. To
investigate the effect of an increased rate, 25 solar mass stellar models with
three different carbon burning rates, at solar metallicity, were generated
using the Geneva Stellar Evolution Code (GENEC) with nucleosynthesis
post-processing calculated using the NuGrid Multi-zone Post-Processing Network
code (MPPNP). The strongest rate caused carbon burning to occur in a large
convective core rather than a radiative one. The presence of this large
convective core leads to an overlap with the subsequent convective
carbon-shell, significantly altering the initial composition of the
carbon-shell. In addition, an enhanced rate causes carbon-shell burning
episodes to ignite earlier in the evolution of the star, igniting the 22Ne
source at lower temperatures and reducing the neutron density.
