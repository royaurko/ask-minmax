We present an analysis leading to a conjecture on the exact location of the
multicritical point in the phase diagram of spin glasses in finite dimensions.
The conjecture, in satisfactory agreement with a number of numerical results,
was previously derived using an ansatz emerging from duality and the replica
method. In the present paper we carefully examine the ansatz and reduce it to a
hypothesis on analyticity of a function appearing in the duality relation. Thus
the problem is now clearer than before from a mathematical point of view: The
ansatz, somewhat arbitrarily introduced previously, has now been shown to be
closely related to the analyticity of a well-defined function.
