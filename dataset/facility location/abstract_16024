When the World Wide Web was first conceived as a way to facilitate the
sharing of scientific information at the CERN (European Center for Nuclear
Research) few could have imagined the role it would come to play in the
following decades. Since then, the increasing ubiquity of Internet access and
the frequency with which people interact with it raise the possibility of using
the Web to better observe, understand, and monitor several aspects of human
social behavior. Web sites with large numbers of frequently returning users are
ideal for this task. If these sites belong to companies or universities, their
usage patterns can furnish information about the working habits of entire
populations. In this work, we analyze the properly anonymized logs detailing
the access history to Emory University's Web site. Emory is a medium size
university located in Atlanta, Georgia. We find interesting structure in the
activity patterns of the domain and study in a systematic way the main forces
behind the dynamics of the traffic. In particular, we show that both linear
preferential linking and priority based queuing are essential ingredients to
understand the way users navigate the Web.
