We report the findings of a new search for RR Lyraes in an M31 halo field
located 40 arcminutes from the nucleus of the galaxy along the minor axis. We
detected 37 variable stars, of which 24 are classified as RR Lyraes and the
others are ambiguous. Estimating a completeness fraction of ~24%, we calculate
that there are approximately 100 RR Lyraes in the field, which is consistent
with what is expected from deep HST color-magnitude diagrams. We calculate a
mean magnitude of g=25.15+/ 0.03, which we interpret to mean that the mean
metallicity of RR Lyraes is significantly lower than that of the M31 halo as a
whole. The presence of ancient, metal-poor stars opens the possibility that,
initially, the M31 halo appeared much like the Milky Way halo.
