We use uniform matrix product states (MPS) to study the (1+1)D $O(2)$ and
$O(4)$ rotor models, which are equivalent to the Kogut-Susskind formulation of
matter-free nonabelian lattice gauge theory on a "hawaiian earring" graph for
$U(1)$ and $SU(2)$, respectively. Applying tangent space methods to obtain
ground states and determine the mass gap and the $\beta$-function, we find
excellent agreement with known strong results, locating the BKT transition for
$O(2)$ and successfully entering the asymptotic weak-coupling regime for
$O(4)$. To obtain a finite local Hilbert space, we truncate in the space of
irreducible representations (irreps) of the gauge group, comparing the effects
of different cutoff values. We find that higher irreps become important in the
crossover and weak-coupling regimes of the nonabelian theory, where
entanglement also suddenly increases. This could have important consequences
for TNS studies of Yang-Mills on higher dimensional graphs.
