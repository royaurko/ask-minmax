There are observational facts and theoretical arguments for an origin of
gamma-ray bursts in molecular clouds in distant galaxies. If this is true, one
could detect a significant flux of GRB prompt and early afterglow X-ray
radiation scattered into our line of sight by the molecular and atomic matter
located within tens of parsecs of the GRB site long after the afterglow has
faded away. The scattered flux directly measures the typical density of the GRB
ambient medium. Furthemore, if the primary emission is beamed, the scattered
X-ray flux will be slowly decreasing for several months to years before falling
off rapidly. Therefore, it should be possible to estimate the collimation angle
of a burst from the light curve of its X-ray echo and a measured value of the
line-of-sight absorption column depth. It is shown that detection of such an
echo is for the brightest GRBs just within the reach of the Chandra and
XMM-Newton observatories.
