This volume contains the papers presented at the fifth workshop on Answer Set
Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2012) held on September 4th,
2012 in Budapest, co-located with the 28th International Conference on Logic
Programming (ICLP 2012). It thus continues a series of previous events
co-located with ICLP, aiming at facilitating the discussion about crossing the
boundaries of current ASP techniques in theory, solving, and applications, in
combination with or inspired by other computing paradigms.
