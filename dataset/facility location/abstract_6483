Theoretical calculations locate the QCD critical point at energies accessible
at the CERN SPS. Several observables were suggested to look for it. Here, we
present the system size dependence and the energy dependence of event-by-event
mean transverse momentum and multiplicity fluctuations, as well as the energy
dependence of anti-baryon to baryon ratios.
