The 46Ti* compound nucleus, as populated by the fusion-evaporation reaction
27Al+19F at the bombarding energy of E_lab=144 MeV, has been investigated by
charged particle spectroscopy using the multidetector array ICARE at the
VIVITRON tandem facility of the IReS (Strasbourg). The light charged particles
and high-energy gamma-rays from the GDR decay have been measured in coincidence
with selected evaporation residues. The CACARIZO code, a Monte Carlo
implementation of the statistical-model code CASCADE, has been used to
calculate the spectral shapes of evaporated alpha-particles which are compared
with the experimental coincident spectra. This comparison indicates the
signature of large deformations (possibly superdeformed and hyperdeformed
shapes) present in the compound nucleus decay. The occurrence of the Jacobi
shape transition is also discussed in the framework of a newly developed
rotating liquid drop model.
