We have observed the diffraction of a Bose-Einstein condensate of rubidium
atoms on a vibrating mirror potential. The matter wave packet bounces back at
normal incidence on a blue-detuned evanescent light field after a 3.6 mm free
fall. The mirror vibrates at a frequency of 500 kHz with an amplitude of 3.0
nm. The atomic carrier and sidebands are directly imaged during their ballistic
expansion. The locations and the relative weights of the diffracted atomic wave
packets are in very good agreement with the theoretical prediction of Carsten
Henkel et al. [1].
