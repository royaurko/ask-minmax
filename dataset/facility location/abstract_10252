The Earth matter effects on supernova (SN) neutrinos can be identified at a
single detector through peaks in the Fourier transform of their ``inverse
energy'' spectrum. The positions of these peaks are independent of the SN
models and therefore the peaks can be used as a robust signature of the Earth
matter effects, which in turn can distinguish between different neutrino mixing
scenarios. Whereas only one genuine peak is observable when the neutrinos
traverse only the Earth mantle, traversing also the core gives rise to multiple
peaks. We calculate the strengths and positions of these peaks analytically and
explore their features at a large scintillation detector as well as at a
megaton water Cherenkov detector through Monte Carlo simulations. We propose a
simple algorithm to identify the peaks in the actual data and quantify the
chances of a peak identification as a function of the location of the SN in the
sky.
