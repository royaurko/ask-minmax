Here is presented a new magneto-vortex dynamo model for modeling & predicting
of a processes in Solar plasma convection zone. Solar convection zone is
located above the level r > 0,6-0,7 R, where R is a Solar radius. A key feature
of such a model is that equation of Solar plasma motion as well as equation of
magnetic fields evolution - are reduced to Helmholtz's vortex equation, which
is up-graded in according with alpha-effect (Coriolis force forms an additional
vorticity field or magnetic field due to Sun's differential rotation). Such an
additional vorticity or magnetic field are proved to be concentrated at the
proper belt in Solar convection zone under the influence of Coriolis force (at
the middle latitudes of the Sun in respect to equator). Besides, such an an
additional vorticity & magnetic fields are to be the basic sources of
well-known phenomena "Maunder's butterfly" diagram.
