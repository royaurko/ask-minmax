Temperature dependent EPR studies were performed on a single crystal of
CuSiO3.This recently discovered compound is isostructural with the spin-Peierls
compound CuGeO3. The EPR signals show different characteristics than those of
CuGeO3 and aredue to Cu2+ spins located along quasi one-dimensional chains. For
T > 8.2K the spin susceptibility closely follows the predictions of a S=1/2
one-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet with J/kB = 21K. Below T = 8.2K the
spin susceptibility immediately drops to zero indicating long range magnetic
order.
