We demonstrate advantages of non-standard grading for computing cohomology of
restricted Hamiltonian and Poisson algebras. These algebras contain the inner
grading element in the properly defined symmetric grading compatible with the
symplectic structure. Using modulo p analog of the theorem on the structure of
cohomology of Lie algebra with inner grading element, we show that all
nontrivial cohomology classes are located in the grades which are the multiples
of the characteristic p. Besides, this grading implies another symmetries in
the structure of cohomology. These symmetries are based on the Poincare duality
and symmetry with respect to transpositions of conjugate variables of the
symplectic space. Some results obtained by computer program utilizing these
peculiarities in the cohomology structure are presented.
