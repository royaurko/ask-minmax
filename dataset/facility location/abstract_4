We consider the {\em lower-bounded facility location} (\lbfl) problem (also
sometimes called {\em load-balanced facility location}), which is a
generalization of {\em uncapacitated facility location} (\ufl), where each open
facility is required to serve a certain {\em minimum} amount of demand. More
formally, an instance $\I$ of \lbfl is specified by a set $\F$ of facilities
with facility-opening costs $\{f_i\}$, a set $\D$ of clients, and connection
costs $\{c_{ij}\}$ specifying the cost of assigning a client $j$ to a facility
$i$, where the $c_{ij}$s form a metric. A feasible solution specifies a subset
$F$ of facilities to open, and assigns each client $j$ to an open facility
$i(j)\in F$ so that each open facility serves {\em at least $M$ clients}, where
$M$ is an input parameter. The cost of such a solution is $\sum_{i\in
F}f_i+\sum_j c_{i(j)j}$, and the goal is to find a feasible solution of minimum
cost. The current best approximation ratio for \lbfl is 448 \cite{Svitkina08}.
We substantially advance the state-of-the-art for \lbfl by devising an
approximation algorithm for \lbfl that achieves a significantly-improved
approximation guarantee of 82.6. Our improvement comes from a variety of ideas
in algorithm design and analysis, which also yield new insights into \lbfl.
