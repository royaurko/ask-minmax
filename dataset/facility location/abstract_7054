We use the Bethe-Peierls method combined with the belief propagation
algorithm to study the arctic curves in the six vertex model on a square
lattice with domain-wall boundary conditions, and the six vertex model on a
rectangular lattice with partial domain-wall boundary conditions. We show that
this rather simple approximation yields results that are remarkably close to
the exact ones when these are known, and allows one to estimate the location of
the phase boundaries with relative little effort in cases in which exact
results are not available.
