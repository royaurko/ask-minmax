The rapid development of wireless technology, the extensive use of mobile
phones and the availability of location information are facilitating
personalized location-based applications. Easy to carry, easy to use and easy
to buy, smart phones with certain software are of great advantage.
Consequently, mobile social networking (MSN) systems have emerged rapidly,
being a revolution for our everyday life. Based on the analysis of general
requirements of MSN and location-based services (LBS), this paper presents the
design of iZone, a mobile social networking system, as well as a prototype
implementation. This platform exploits mobile GIS (Geographic Information
Systems), LBS and J2ME technologies, combining geographical data to display map
on mobile phones. It can provide a number of social networking services via
smartphones.
