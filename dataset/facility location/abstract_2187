We have developed a micro-tpc using a pixelized bulk micromegas coupled to
dedicated acquisition electronics as a read-out allowing to reconstruct the
three dimensional track of a few keV recoils. The prototype has been tested
with the Amande facility at the IRSN-Cadarache providing monochromatic
neutrons. The first results concerning discrimination of a few keV electrons
and proton recoils are presented.
