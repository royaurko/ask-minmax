Adding a column of numbers produces "carries" along the way. We show that
random digits produce a pattern of carries with a neat probabilistic
description: the carries form a one-dependent determinantal point process. This
makes it easy to answer natural questions: How many carries are typical? Where
are they located? We show that many further examples, from combinatorics,
algebra and group theory, have essentially the same neat formulae, and that any
one-dependent point process on the integers is determinantal. The examples give
a gentle introduction to the emerging fields of one-dependent and determinantal
point processes.
