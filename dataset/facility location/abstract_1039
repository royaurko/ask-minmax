This document reports the x-ray powder diffraction main reflections
(intensity threshold >= 100) for possible Fe-related phases forming during the
metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) growth of Fe in NH_3/H_2 mixture on
wurtzite-GaN/sapphire. The 2\theta values are given for Cu K\alpha_1 radiation
(1.5406 \AA) in the range 25-100 deg (ordered by increasing 2\theta). The
GaN(000l) and Al_2O_3(000l) are also reported for reference.
