Between July 2012 and February 2013, NuSTAR and XMM-Newton performed four
long-look joint obser- vations of the type 1.8 Seyfert, NGC 1365. We have
analyzed the variable absorption seen in these observations in order to
characterize the geometry of the absorbing material. Two of the observations
caught NGC 1365 in an unusually low absorption state, revealing complexity in
the multi-layer absorber which had previously been hidden. We find the need for
three distinct zones of neutral absorption in addition to the two zones of
ionized absorption and the Compton-thick torus previously seen in this source.
The most prominent absorber is likely associated with broad line region clouds
with column densities of around $\sim\,$10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a highly clumpy
nature as evidenced by an occultation event in February 2013. We also find
evidence of a patchy absorber with a variable column around $\sim\,10^{22}$
cm$^{-2}$ and a line of sight covering fraction of 0.3$-$0.9 which responds
directly to the intrinsic source flux, possibly due to a wind geometry. A
full-covering, constant absorber with a low column density of $\sim\,1 \times$
10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ is also present, though the location of this low density
haze is unknown.
