We analyze the existence and stability of bright, dark, and gap matter-wave
solitons in optical superlattices. Then, using these properties, we show that
(time-dependent) ``dynamical superlattices'' can be used to controllably place,
guide, and manipulate these solitons. In particular, we use numerical
experiments to displace solitons by turning on a secondary lattice structure,
transfer solitons from one location to another by shifting one superlattice
substructure relative to the other, and implement solitonic ``path-following'',
in which a matter wave follows the time-dependent lattice substructure into
oscillatory motion.
