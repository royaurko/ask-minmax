Utilizing data available from the Kentucky Geonet (KYGeonet.ky.gov) the
fossil fuel mining locations created by the Kentucky Geological Survey
geo-locating oil and gas wells are mapped using ESRI ArcGIS in Kentucky single
plain 1602 ft projection. This data was then exported into a spreadsheet
showing latitude and longitude for each point to be used for modeling at
different scales to determine the fractal dimension of the set. Following the
porosity and diffusivity studies of Tarafdar and Roy1 we extract fractal
dimensions of the fossil fuel mining locations and search for evidence of
scaling laws for the set of deposits. The Levy index is used to determine a
match to a statistical mechanically motivated generalized probability function
for the wells. This probability distribution corresponds to a solution of a
dynamical anomalous diffusion equation of fractional order that describes the
Levy paths which can be solved in the diffusion limit by the Fox H function
ansatz.
