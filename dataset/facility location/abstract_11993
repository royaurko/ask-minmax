The ideal (i.e. noninteracting), homogeneous Fermi gas, with its
characteristic sharp Fermi surface in the momentum distribution, is a
fundamental concept relevant to the behavior of many systems. With trapped
Fermi gases of ultracold atoms, one can realize and probe a nearly ideal Fermi
gas, however these systems have a nonuniform density due to the confining
potential. We show that the effect of the density variation, which typically
washes out any semblance of a Fermi surface step in the momentum distribution,
can be mitigated by selectively probing atoms near the center of a trapped gas.
With this approach, we have directly measured a Fermi surface in momentum space
for a nearly ideal gas, where the average density and temperature of the probed
portion of the gas can be determined from the location and sharpness of the
Fermi surface.
