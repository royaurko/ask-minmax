We present an analysis of heterogeneous dynamics in molecular dynamics
simulations of a thin polymeric film, supported by an absorbing structured
surface. Near the glass transition "immobile" domains occur throughout the
film, yet the probability of their occurrence decreasing with larger distance
from the surface. Still, enough immobile domains are located near the free
surface to cause them to percolate in the direction perpendicular to surface,
at a temperature near the glass transition temperature. This result is in
agreement with a recent theoretical model of glass transition.
