We propose that the degree of sweeling of the 30nm chromatin fiber (a
"measure" of its transcriptional activity) is mainly determined by the
short-ranged electrostatical interaction between different sections of the
"folded" DNA chain. These sections constitute only a small fraction of the
chain and they are located close to the entry-exit points of the DNA chain at
the nucleosome core particles. We present a model that allows to estimate the
degree of swelling of chromatin fibers as a function of salt concentration,
charge density of the strands etc. Different mechanisms by which the state of
chromatin can be controlled in vitro and in vivo are discussed.
