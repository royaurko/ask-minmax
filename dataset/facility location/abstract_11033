Soft x-ray emission and absorption spectroscopy of the O K-edge are employed
to investigate the electronic structure of wurtzite ZnO(0001). A quasiparticle
band structure calculated within the GW approximation agrees well with the
data, most notably with the energetic location of the Zn3d - O2p hybridized
state and the anisotropy of the absorption spectra. Dispersion in the band
structure is mapped using the coherent k-selective part of the resonant x-ray
emission spectra. We show that a more extensive mapping of the bands is
possible in the case of crystalline anisotropy such as that found in ZnO.
