Recent studies of the electronic properties of graphite have produced
conflicting results regarding the positions of the different carrier types
within the Brillouin zone, and the possible presence of Dirac fermions. In this
paper we report a comprehensive study of the de Haas-van Alphen, Shubnikov-de
Haas and Hall effects in a sample of highly orientated pyrolytic graphite, at
temperatures in the range 30 mK to 4 K and magnetic fields up to 12 T. The
transport measurements confirm the Brillouin-zone locations of the different
carrier types assigned by Schroeder et al.: electrons are at the K-point, and
holes are near the H-points. We extract the cyclotron mass and scattering time
for both carrier types from the temperature- and magnetic-field-dependences of
the magneto-oscillations. Our results indicate that the holes experience
stronger scattering and hence have a lower mobility than the electrons. We
utilise phase-frequency analysis and intercept analysis of the 1/B positions of
magneto-oscillation extrema to identify the nature of the carriers in graphite,
whether they are Dirac or normal (Schrodinger) fermions. These analyses
indicate normal holes and electrons of indeterminate nature.
