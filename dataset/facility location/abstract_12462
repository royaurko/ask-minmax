We study the zero temperature superfluid-insulator transition for a
two-dimensional model of interacting, lattice bosons in the presence of
quenched disorder and particle-hole symmetry. We follow the approach of a
recent series of papers by Altman, Kafri, Polkovnikov, and Refael, in which the
strong disorder renormalization group is used to study disordered bosons in one
dimension. Adapting this method to two dimensions, we study several different
species of disorder and uncover universal features of the superfluid-insulator
transition. In particular, we locate an unstable finite disorder fixed point
that governs the transition between the superfluid and a gapless, glassy
insulator. We present numerical evidence that this glassy phase is the
incompressible Mott glass and that the transition from this phase to the
superfluid is driven by percolation-type process. Finally, we provide estimates
of the critical exponents governing this transition.
