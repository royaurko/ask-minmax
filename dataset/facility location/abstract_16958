We propose to study the open charm effects in $e^+ e^-\to J/\psi\eta$,
$J/\psi\pi^0$ and $\phi\eta_c$. We show that the exclusive cross section
lineshapes of these processes would be strongly affected by the open charm
effects. Since the final state light meson productions are through soft gluon
radiations, we assume a recognition of this soft process via charmed meson
loops at hadronic level. A unique feature among these three reactions is that
the $D\bar{D^*}+c.c.$ open channel is located in a relatively isolated energy,
i.e. $\sim 3.876$ GeV, which is sufficiently far away from the known charmonia
$\psi(3770)$ and $\psi(4040)$. Therefore, the cross section lineshapes of these
reactions may provide an opportunity for singling out the open charm effects
with relatively well-defined charmonium contributions. In particular, we find
that reaction $e^+ e^-\to J/\psi\pi^0$ is sensitive to the open charm
$D\bar{D^*}+c.c.$ Due to the dominance of the isospin-0 component at the
charmonium energy region, we predict an enhanced model-independent cusp effect
between the thresholds of $D^0\bar{D}^0+c.c.$ and $D^+ D^{*-}+c.c.$ This study
can also help us to understand the X(3900) enhancement recently observed by
Belle Collaboration in $e^+ e^-\to D\bar{D}+c.c.$
