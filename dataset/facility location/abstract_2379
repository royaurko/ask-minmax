Protostellar jets are present in the later stages of the stellar formation.
Non-thermal radio emission has been detected from the jets and hot spots of
some massive protostars, indicating the presence of relativistic electrons
there. We are interested in exploring if these non-thermal particles can emit
also at gamma-rays. In the present contribution we model the non-thermal
emission produced in the jets associated with the massive protostar IRAS
18162-2048. We obtain that the gamma-ray emission produced in this source is
detectable by the current facilities in the GeV domain.
