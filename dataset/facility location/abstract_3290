We present optical and X-ray identifications for the sixty-four radio sources
in the GOODS-S ACS field revealed in the ATCA 1.4 GHz survey of the Chandra
Deep Field South. Optical identifications are made using the ACS images and
catalogs, while the X-ray view is provided by the Chandra X-ray Observatory 1
Ms observations. Redshifts for the identified sources are drawn from publicly
available catalogs of spectroscopic observations and multi-band
photometric-based estimates. Using this multiwavelength information we provide
a first characterization of the faint radio source population in this region.
The sample contains a mixture of star-forming galaxies and active galactic
nuclei, as identified by their X-ray properties and optical spectroscopy. A
large number of morphologically disturbed galaxies is found, possibly related
to the star-formation phenomena. In spite of the very deep optical data
available in this field, seven of the sixty-four radio sources have no optical
identification to z(850)~28 mag. Only one of these is identified in the X-rays.
