A scintillating fibre tracker is proposed to measure elastic proton
scattering at very small angles in the ATLAS experiment at CERN. The tracker
will be located in so-called Roman Pot units at a distance of 240 m on each
side of the ATLAS interaction point. An initial validation of the design
choices was achieved in a beam test at DESY in a relatively low energy electron
beam and using slow off-the-shelf electronics. Here we report on the results
from a second beam test experiment carried out at CERN, where new detector
prototypes were tested in a high energy hadron beam, using the first version of
the custom designed front-end electronics. The results show an adequate
tracking performance under conditions which are similar to the situation at the
LHC. In addition, the alignment method using so-called overlap detectors was
studied and shown to have the expected precision.
