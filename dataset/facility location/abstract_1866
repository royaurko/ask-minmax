Using JAVA for process control requires the access to I/O-Hardware. This
problem is addressed in several ongoing standardisation efforts for Real Time
Java. A spin-off of these standardisation efforts is the Siemens product JFPC
(Java for Process Control), which is based on the ideas of OPC (OLE for Process
Control). It is available under the proprietary RT kernel RMOS and under
Windows NT. Based on a contract with Siemens, ZEL - the central electronics
facility of Forschungszentrum Juelich - has implemented JFPC under Linux.
Additionally, several JFPC providers, e.g for accessing industrial components
via PROFIBUS DP have been implemented.
