Radio giant pulses provide a unique opportunity to study the pulsar radio
emission mechanism in exquisite detail. Previous studies have revealed a wide
range of properties and phenomena, including extraordinarily high brightness
temperatures, sub-nanosecond emission features, and banded dynamic spectra. New
measurements of giant pulse characteristics can help guide and test theoretical
emission models. To this end, an extensive observation campaign has begun which
will provide more than 500 hours on the Crab with a 34-meter antenna located in
California, USA. The observations are being done as part of an educational
outreach program called the Goldstone-Apple Valley Radio Telescope (GAVRT).
This antenna has a novel wide bandwidth receiver which provides up to 8 GHz of
instantaneous bandwidth in the range of 2.5 to 14 GHz. These observations will
provide detailed information about the variability, amplitude distribution, and
detailed frequency structure of radio giant pulses. In addition, a database of
pulses from these observations and others of the Crab pulsar is being created
which will simplify multiwavelength correlation analysis.
