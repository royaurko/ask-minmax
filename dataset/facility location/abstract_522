The VST (VLT Survey Telescope) is a 2.6 m class Alt-Az telescope to be
installed on Cerro Paranal in the Atacama desert, Northern Chile, in the
European Southern Observatory (ESO) site. The VST is a wide-field imaging
facility planned to supply databases for the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT)
science and carry out stand-alone observations in the UV to I spectral range.
So far no telescope has been dedicated entirely to surveys; the VST will be the
first survey telescope to start the operation, as a powerful survey facility
for the VLT observatory. This paper will focus on the axes motion control
system. The dynamic model of the telescope will be analyzed, as well as the
effect of the wind disturbance on the telescope performance. Some algorithms
for the telescope position control will be briefly discussed.
