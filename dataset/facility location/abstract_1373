Near-infrared $JHK'$ imaging photometry was obtained of 331 AGNs consisting
mainly of Seyfert 1 AGNs and quasars (QSOs). This sample was selected to cover
a range of radio emission strength, redshift from $z=0$ to 1, and absolute
$B$-magnitude from $M_B=-29$ mag to -18 mag. Among low-$z$ AGNs with $z<0.3$,
Seyfert $1-1.5$ AGNs are distributed over a region from a location typical of
``galaxies'' to a location typical of ``QSOs'' in the two-color $J-H$ to $H-K'$
diagram, but Seyfert $1.8-2$ AGNs are distributed around the location of
``galaxies''. Moreover, bright AGNs with respect to absolute $B$-magnitude are
distributed near the location of ``QSOs'', while faint AGNs are near the
location of ``galaxies''. The distribution of such low-$z$ AGNs in this diagram
was found to have little dependence on their 6 cm radio flux. The near-infrared
colors of the AGNs observed with an aperture of 7 pixels ($7.49''$) are more
QSO-like than those observed with larger apertures up to 15 pixels ($16.1''$).
This aperture effect may be explained by contamination from the light of host
galaxies within larger apertures. This effect is more prominent for less
luminous AGNs.
