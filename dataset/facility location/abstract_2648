The Fermilab Antiproton source is to be repurposed to provide an 8 kW proton
beam to the Mu2e experiment by 1/3 integer, slow resonant extraction. Shielding
provided by the existing facility must be supplemented with in-tunnel shielding
to limit the radiation effective dose rate above the shield in the AP30 service
building. In addition to the nominal radiation shield calculations, radiation
skyshine calculations were required to ensure compliance with Fermilab
Radiological Control Manual. A complete model of the slow resonant extraction
system including magnets, electrostatic septa, magnetic fields, tunnel
enclosure with shield, and a nearby exit stairway are included in the model.
The skyshine model extends above the beam enclosure surface to 10 km vertically
and 5 km radially.
