The content of extremely high energy (EHE) photons in the highest energy
cosmic rays can be investigated by analyzing showers arriving from directions
where the perpendicular component of the Earth's magnetic field is high or
showers arriving from the region surrounding the Sun. We perform Monte Carlo
simulations of cascades initiated by photons with parameters of the highest
energy showers observed by the past and present detectors (AGASA, Fly's Eye,
Yakutsk, Haverah Park). The purpose is to find out which events should cascade
with high probability if initiated by photons. It is shown that EHE photons
arriving from directions towards the magnetic poles cascade with higher
probability. Alternatively, the lowest probabilities of cascading are expected
for photons arriving from directions of the equator at the zenith angles equal
to the angle between location of the specific observatory and the magnetic
pole. We show that very unusual showers should arrive from direction of the Sun
due to cascading of photons in the Sun's magnetosphere if EHE photons are
numerous at the highest energies. The rate of such showers is estimated on
about one per ten years. However extraordinary lateral distribution of
secondary particles of such showers in the Earth's atmosphere may help to
distinguish them from the ordinary showers arriving isotropically from the sky.
