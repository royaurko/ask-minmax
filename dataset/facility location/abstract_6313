The separable state closest to a given entangled state in the relative
entropy measure is called the closest disentangled state. We provide an
analytical formula connecting the entangled state and the closest disentangled
state in two qubits. Using this formula, when any disentangled state ($\sigma$)
located at the entangle-disentangle boundary is given, entangled states to
which $\sigma$ is closest can be obtained analytically. Further, this formula
naturally defines the direction normal to the boundary surface. The direction
is uniquely determined by $\sigma$ in almost all cases.
