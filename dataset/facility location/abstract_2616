This paper designs and implements a high availability clusters and
incorporated with load balance infrastructure of web servers. The paper
described system can provide full facilities to the website hosting provider
and large business organizations. This system can provide continuous service
though any system components fail uncertainly with the help of Linux Virtual
Server (LVS) loadbalancing cluster technology and combined with virtualization
as well as shared storage technology to achieve the three-tier architecture of
Web server clusters. This technology not only improves availability, but also
affects the security and performance of the application services being
requested. Benefits of the system include node failover overcome; network
failover overcome; storage limitation overcome and load distribution.
