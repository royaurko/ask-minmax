This paper summarizes a presentation given on the occasion of the
inauguration of the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Gamma-ray Observatory
in Puebla, Mexico in March 2015. The inauguration of a new facility for the
study of astrophysical gamma-rays provides an excellent opportunity to review
the technical evolution and the scientific achievements of VERITAS (the Very
Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System) since its own inauguration
in 2007. HAWC and VERITAS are separated by only 14 degrees in longitude, and so
can view much of the same sky at the same time. In combination with other
ground-based facilities, and with the instruments onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope, VERITAS and HAWC will give an unprecedented view of the
gamma-ray sky. We provide an overview of VERITAS, and discuss the
complementarity of the two observatories for future gamma-ray observations.
