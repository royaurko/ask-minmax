We firstly demonstrate physically-prepared compliant PVA hydrogel electrodes
as a promising supplement in dielectric elastomer actuators. They are capable
of conducting high voltages over 5 kV without electrolysis by an electrical
double layer effect. The hydrogel electrodes adhere tightly to the dielectric
layer, which ensures its structural stability during actuation. All-polymeric
actuators fabricated by these electrodes exhibited excellent consecutive
working performance over 2960 cycles. The actuation was influenced by applied
voltage, ramp rate, electrode elastic modulus and moisture content. A maximum
areal strain over 78% was achieved. Tunable transparency, good
biocompatibility, long lifetime, low cost and facile fabrication make PVA
hydrogel electrode another promising candidate in the fields of sensors,
artificial muscles and optical applications.
