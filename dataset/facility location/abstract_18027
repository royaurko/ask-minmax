A flare and fast coronal mass ejection originated between solar active
regions NOAA 11514 and 11515 on July 1, 2012 in response to flux emergence in
front of the leading sunspot of the trailing region 11515. Analyzing the
evolution of the photospheric magnetic flux and the coronal structure, we find
that the flux emergence triggered the eruption by interaction with overlying
flux in a non-standard way. The new flux neither had the opposite orientation
nor a location near the polarity inversion line, which are favorable for strong
reconnection with the arcade flux under which it emerged. Moreover, its flux
content remained significantly smaller than that of the arcade (approximately
40 %). However, a loop system rooted in the trailing active region ran in part
under the arcade between the active regions, passing over the site of flux
emergence. The reconnection with the emerging flux, leading to a series of jet
emissions into the loop system, caused a strong but confined rise of the loop
system. This lifted the arcade between the two active regions, weakening its
downward tension force and thus destabilizing the considerably sheared flux
under the arcade. The complex event was also associated with supporting
precursor activity in an enhanced network near the active regions, acting on
the large-scale overlying flux, and with two simultaneous confined flares
within the active regions.
