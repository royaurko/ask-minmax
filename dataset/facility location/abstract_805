The range of neutralino-proton cross sections for R-parity preserving
supergravity models with GUT scale unification of the gauge coupling constants
is examined. The models considered here are mSUGRA, models with non universal
soft breaking and D-brane models. It is found that the current dark matter
detectors are sampling significant parts of the SUSY parameter space and future
detectors could sample almost the entire space. The special regions of
parameter space that may be inaccessible to future detectors are seen to have a
squark/gluino spectra beyond 1 TeV, but observable at the LHC.
