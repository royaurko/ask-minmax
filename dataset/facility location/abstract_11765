We consider acceleration of protons in a cavity with such dimensions as
length l = 10 m, width b = 20 m, height a = 1.01 m, located between two bending
(180)degree magnets with isochronous magnetic field. The cavity is loaded with
rows of drift plates (tubes), being excited by a wave of E110 type at the
frequency fo = 148.5 MHz, excitation power P1 = 5.65 MW. Additionally, the
cavity is fed with the power P2 = 8 MW, transmitted into a beam of protons with
such parameters as the final energy 0.8 GeV, pulse beam current I = 10 mA,
pulse width 25 microseconds, repetition rate 10 Hz. We discuss the possibility
of creating a pulsed neutron source with the intensity In = 3e14 neutrons /s on
the basis of such an accelerator.
