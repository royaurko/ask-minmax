Recently the AGASA Collaboration presented data suggesting a significant
clustering of ultra-high energy cosmic rays coming from the outer Galaxy
region. In this paper we calculate expected cosmic ray arrival distributions
for several simple, limiting source location scenarios and investigate the
possibility of clustering and correlation effects. The role of the Galactic
magnetic field is discussed in detail.
