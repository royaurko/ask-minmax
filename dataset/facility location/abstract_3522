The MAGIC I telescope produces currently around 100TByte of raw data per year
that is calibrated and reduced on-site at the Observatorio del Roque de los
Muchachos (La Palma). Since February 2007 most of the data have been stored and
further processed in the Port d'Informacio Cientifica (PIC), Barcelona. This
facility, which supports the GRID Tier 1 center for LHC in Spain, provides
resources to give the entire MAGIC Collaboration access to the reduced
telescope data. It is expected that the data volume will increase by a factor 3
after the start-up of the second telescope, MAGIC II. The project to improve
the MAGIC Data Center to meet these requirements is presented. In addition, we
discuss the production of high level data products that will allow a more
flexible analysis and will contribute to the international network of
astronomical data (European Virtual Observatory). For this purpose, we will
have to develop a new software able to adapt the analysis process to different
data taking conditions, such as different trigger configurations or mono/stereo
telescope observations.
