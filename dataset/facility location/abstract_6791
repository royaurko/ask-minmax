We consider the several phenomena which are taking place in Quantum Dots (QD)
and Quantum Rings (QR): The connection of the Quantum Chaos (QC) with the
reflection symmetry of the QD, Disappearance of the QC in the tunnel coupled
chaotic QD, electron localization and transition between Double Concentric QR
in the transverse magnetic field, transition of electron from QR to the QD
located in the center of QR. Basis of this consideration is the effective
Schr\"odinger equation for the corresponding systems.
