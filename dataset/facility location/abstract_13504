The realization of Kitaev spin liquid, where spins on a honeycomb lattice are
coupled ferromagnetically by bond-dependent anisotropic interactions, has been
a sought-after dream. 5d iridium oxides $\alpha$-Li2IrO3 and $\alpha$-Na2IrO3
with a honeycomb lattice of Jeff = 1/2 moments recently emerged as a possible
materialization. Strong signature of Kitaev physics, however, was not captured.
Here we report the discovery of a complex iridium oxide $\beta$-Li2IrO3 with
Jeff = 1/2 moments on "hyper-honeycomb" lattice, a three-dimensional analogue
of honeycomb lattice. A positive Curie-Weiss temperature $\theta_{CW}$ ~ 40 K
indicated dominant ferromagnetic interactions among Jeff = 1/2 moments in
$\beta$-Li2IrO3. A magnetic ordering with a small entropy change was observed
at Tc = 38 K, which, with the application of magnetic field of only 3 T,
changed to a fully polarized state of Jeff = 1/2 moments. Those results imply
that hyper-honeycomb beta-Li2IrO3 is located in the vicinity to a Kitaev spin
liquid.
