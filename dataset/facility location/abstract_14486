Halpha and UBV photometry of the inner kpc of M33 are used to study the
distribution of OB stars and HII regions in the galaxy and to determine whether
individual regions of the galaxy are in a state of ionization balance. Based on
the surface brightness of the Halpha emission, we identify three distinct
ionized gas environments (bright, halo and field). We find that 50% of the OB
stars are located in the field, so that 1/2 of the lifetime of OB stars must be
spent outside recognizable HII regions. If OB stars escape from bright HII
regions by destroying their parent molecular clouds, this result would imply
that molecular cloud lifetimes after forming OB stars could be as low as 5e6
yrs or 1/2 the typical lifetime of OB stars. Halpha fluxes predicted from
ionization models reveal that none of the regions are in ionization balance:
predicted fluxes are a factor of 3-7 greater than observed. The heaviest loss
of ionizing photons appears to be taking place in the field. Our results
suggest that star formation rates obtained from Halpha luminosities must
underestimate the true star formation rate in these regions of M33.
