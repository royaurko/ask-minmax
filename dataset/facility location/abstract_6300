Transfer-RNA genes in archaea often have introns intervening between exon
sequences. The structural motif at the boundary between exon and intron is the
bulge-helix-bulge. Computational investigations of these boundary structures in
H. marismortui lead us to propose that tRNA-isoleucine and tRNA-tryptophan
genes are co-located. Precise insilico identification of the splice-sites on
the bulges at the exon-intron boundaries conduce us to infer that a single
intron-containing composite tRNA-gene can give rise to more than one gene
produc.
