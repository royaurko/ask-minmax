Theoretically, the electric field becomes infinite at corners of two and
three dimensions and edges of three dimensions. Conventional finite-element and
boundary element methods do not yield satisfactory results at close proximity
to these singular locations. In this paper, we describe the application of a
fast and accurate BEM solver (which usesexact analytic expressions to compute
the effect of source distributions on flatsurfaces) to compute the electric
field near three-dimensional corners and edges. Results have been obtained for
distances as close as 1$\mu m$ near the corner/edge and good agreement has been
observed between the present results and existing analytical solutions.
