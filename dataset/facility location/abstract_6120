We show that the A4 discrete symmetry that naturally leads to tri-bimaximal
neutrino mixing can be simply obtained as a result of an orbifolding starting
from a model in 6 dimensions. This particular orbifolding has four fixed points
where 4 dimensional branes are located and the tetrahedral symmetry of A4
connects these branes. In this approach A4 appears after the reduction from six
to four dimensions as a remnant of the 6D space-time symmetry. A previously
discussed supersymmetric version of A4 is reinterpreted along these lines.
