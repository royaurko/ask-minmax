The Perseus molecular cloud complex is a ~30pc long chain of molecular clouds
most well-known for the two star-forming clusters NGC1333 and IC348 and the
well-studied outflow source in B5. However, when studied at mid- to
far-infrared wavelengths the region is dominated by a ~10pc diameter shell of
warm dust, likely generated by an HII region caused by the early B-star
HD278942. Using a revised calibration technique the COMPLETE team has produced
high-sensitivity temperature and column-density maps of the Perseus region from
IRAS Sky Survey Atlas (ISSA) 60 and 100um data. In this paper, we combine the
ISSA based dust-emission maps with other observations collected as part of the
COMPLETE Survey, along with archival H-alpha and MSX observations. Molecular
line observations from FCRAO and extinction maps constructed by applying the
NICER method to the 2MASS catalog provide independent estimates of the ``true''
column-density of the shell. H-alpha emission in the region of the shell
confirms that it is most likely an HII region located behind the cloud complex,
and 8um data from MSX indicates that the shell may be interacting with the
cloud. Finally, the two polarisation components previously seen towards
background stars in the region can be explained by the association of the
stronger component with the shell. If confirmed, this would be the first
observation of a parsec-scale swept-up magnetic field.
