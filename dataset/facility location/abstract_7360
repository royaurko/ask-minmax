We consider a fluid of hard spheres bearing one or two uniform circular
adhesive patches, distributed so as not to overlap. Two spheres interact via a
``sticky'' Baxter potential if the line joining the centers of the two spheres
intersects a patch on each sphere, and via a hard sphere potential otherwise.
We analyze the location of the fluid-fluid transition and of the percolation
line as a function of the size of the patch (the fractional coverage of the
sphere's surface) and of the number of patches within a virial expansion up to
third order and within the first two terms (C0 and C1) of a class of closures
Cn hinging on a density expansion of the direct correlation function. We find
that the locations of the two lines depend sensitively on both the total
adhesive coverage and its distribution. The treatment is almost fully
analytical within the chosen approximate theory. We test our findings by means
of specialized Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and find the main qualitative
features of the critical behaviour to be well captured in spite of the low
density perturbative nature of the closure. The introduction of anisotropic
attractions into a model suspension of spherical particles is a first step
towards a more realistic description of globular proteins in solution.
