In current theoretical models of the blazar subclass of active galaxies, the
broadband emission consists of two components: a low-frequency synchrotron
component with a peak in the IR to X-ray band, and a high-frequency inverse
Compton component with a peak in the gamma-ray band. In such models, the
gamma-ray spectral index should be correlated with the location of the
low-energy peak, with flatter gamma-ray spectra expected for blazars with
synchrotron peaks at higher photon energies and vice versa. Using the
EGRET-detected blazars as a sample, we examine this correlation and possible
uncertainties in its construction.
