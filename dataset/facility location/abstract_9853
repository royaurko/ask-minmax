It was recently suggested by Blythe and Evans that a properly defined steady
state normalisation factor can be seen as a partition function of a fictitious
statistical ensemble in which the transition rates of the stochastic process
play the role of fugacities. In analogy with the Lee-Yang description of phase
transition of equilibrium systems, they studied the zeroes in the complex plane
of the normalisation factor in order to find phase transitions in
nonequilibrium steady states. We show that like for equilibrium systems, the
``densities'' associated to the rates are non-decreasing functions of the rates
and therefore one can obtain the location and nature of phase transitions
directly from the analytical properties of the ``densities''. We illustrate
this phenomenon for the asymmetric exclusion process. We actually show that its
normalisation factor coincides with an equilibrium partition function of a walk
model in which the ``densities'' have a simple physical interpretation.
