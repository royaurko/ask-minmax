We reexamine the prospects of searching for a neutral Higgs boson in the
intermediate-mass range, using the proton- and ion-beam facilities of the LHC
to study coherent two-photon processes. Considering realistic design
luminosities for the different ion beams, we find that beams of light-to-medium
size ions like calcium will give the highest production rates. With a suitable
trigger and assuming a b-quark identification efficiency of $30\%$ and a
$b{\bar b}$ mass resolution of 10 GeV one could expect to see a Higgs signal in
the $b{\bar b}$ channel with a 3-4 $\sigma$ statistical significance in the
first phase of operation of the LHC with beams of calcium.
