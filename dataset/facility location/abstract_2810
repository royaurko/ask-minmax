To regulate a particular gene, a transcription factor (TF) needs to bind a
specific genome location. How is this genome address specified amid the
presence of ~10^6-10^9 decoy sites? Our analysis of 319 known TF binding motifs
clearly demonstrates that prokaryotes and eukaryotes use strikingly different
strategies to target TFs to specific genome locations; eukaryotic TFs exhibit
widespread nonfunctional binding and require clustering of sites in regulatory
regions for specificity.
