Red supergiants are a short-lived stage in the evolution of moderately
massive stars (10-25Mo), and as such their location in the H-R diagram provides
an exacting test of stellar evolutionary models. Since massive star evolution
is strongly affected by the amount of mass-loss a star suffers, and since the
mass-loss rates depend upon metallicity, it is highly desirable to study the
physical properties of these stars in galaxies of various metallicities. Here
we identify a sample of red supergiants in M31 (the most metal-rich of the
Local Group galaxies) and derive their physical properties by fitting MARCS
atmosphere models to moderate resolution optical spectroscopy, and from V-K
photometry.
