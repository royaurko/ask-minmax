We present a deep Chandra observation of the extremely massive spiral galaxy
2MASX J23453268-0449256, the first X-ray observation of this very rare system
which features the largest known relativistic jets from a spiral galaxy. We
detect extended X-ray emission from the hot halo surrounding the galaxy,
reaching out to 80 kpc in radius. The hot halo is elongated along the plane of
the spiral galaxy, and one possibility is that the powerful relativistic jets
have disrupted the hot halo gas located perpendicular to the disk. Our
calculations indicate that it is energetically feasible that the AGN feedback
in this system could have uplifted or completely expelled a significant
fraction of the gas in the 20-80 kpc radial range. We also detect extended
emission which appears to be associated with the inner and outer southern radio
lobes, and is possibly the result of inverse Compton emission. Using the
observed X-ray and radio luminosity of the central AGN, the fundamental plane
of Gultekin et al. predicts a black hole mass of 5x10^8 M_solar, with a range
of 1x10^8 - 3x10^9 M_solar when the scatter in the fundamental plane relation
is taken into account. This is consistent with the possibility that an
exceptionally massive (>10^9 M_solar) black hole lies at the centre of this
galaxy, as suggested by the M_BH-sigma scaling relation, but a tighter
constraint cannot be made.
