We calculate the pre-main-sequence HZ for stars of spectral classes F to M.
The spatial distribution of liquid water and its change during the
pre-main-sequence phase of protoplanetary systems is important in understanding
how planets become habitable. Such worlds are interesting targets for future
missions because the coolest stars could provide habitable conditions for up to
2.5 billion years post-accretion. Moreover, for a given star type, planetary
systems are more easily resolved because of higher pre-main-sequence stellar
luminosities, resulting in larger planet to star separation for cool stars than
is the case for the traditional main-sequence (MS) habitable zone (HZ). We use
1D radiative-convective climate and stellar evolutionary models to calculate
pre-main-sequence HZ distances for F1 to M8 stellar types. We also show that
accreting planets that are later located in the traditional MS HZ orbiting
stars cooler than a K5 (including the full range of M-stars) receive stellar
fluxes that exceed the runaway greenhouse threshold, and thus may lose
substantial amounts of water initially delivered to them. We predict that
M-star planets need to initially accrete more water than Earth did or,
alternatively, have additional water delivered later during the long
pre-main-sequence phase to remain habitable. Our findings are also consistent
with recent claims that Venus lost its water during accretion.
