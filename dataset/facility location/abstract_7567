We performed the check of supposition about the possibility of manifestation
of the previously observed phenomenon of central symmetry of the celestial
sphere through existence of the opposite quasars. We discovered the existence
of some pairs of quasars located opposite each other with close by form
profiles magnitudes of luminosity in the ranges u, g, r, i, z, when correlation
coefficient close to 1. We discovered that the percentage of the pairs with
correlation coefficients Rxy>0.98 for the opposite located quasars is
significantly higher than that for the random pairs.
  The analysis of the dependence of this exceedance from the artificial
breaking of the central symmetry has shown, that it practically disappears with
symmetry breaking by more than 0.05 degrees. Thus we can confirmed the
manifestation of the central symmetry of celestial sphere through existence of
the central symmetrical pairs of quasars, which can be interpreted as the pairs
of images of the same object.
  We shown the possibility of a theoretical modeling of the observed
dependencies in the closed Universe model. It can be supposed, that a
relatively small amount of the discovered pairs of the opposite quasars is
conditioned by the fact, that the opposite objects for most of the quasars are
galaxies, which are not included to the chosen as initial source of data quasar
catalog SDSS-DR5.
