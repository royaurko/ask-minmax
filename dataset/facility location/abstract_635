X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) has become an important and powerful
tool because it allows the study of material properties in combination with
elemental specificity, chemical state specificity, and magnetic specificity. A
new soft X-ray magnetic circular dichroism apparatus has been developed at the
Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). The apparatus combines three
experimental conditions: ultra-high-vacuum environment, moderate magnetic
fields and in-situ sample preparation to measure the absorption signal. We
designed a C type dipole electromagnet that provides magnetic fields up to 0.5T
in parallel (or anti-parallel) direction relative to the incoming X-ray beam.
The performances of the electromagnet are measured and the results show good
agreement with the simulation ones. Following film grown in situ by evaporation
methods, XMCD measurements are performed. Combined polarization corrections,
the magnetic moments of the Fe and Co films determined by sum rules are
consistent with other theoretical predictions and experimental measurements.
