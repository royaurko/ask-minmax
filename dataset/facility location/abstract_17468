Robust and semiparametric statistics are of the same historical origin and
largely employ the same locally asymptotically normal framework. In our talk,
we consider he following more intrinsic connections of both fields:
  1) Robust influence curves for semiparametric models with infinite
dimensional nuisance parameter; for example, for semiparametric regression
(Cox), and mixture models (Neyman--Scott).
  2) Adaptiveness in the sense of Stein's necessary condition of robust
neighborhood models and estimators with respect to a finite dimensional
nuisance parameter; for example, location, linear regression, and ARMA.
  3) Semiparametric treatment of gross error deviations from an ideal model as
an infinite dimensional nuisance parameter, by projection on balls; for
testing, an asymptotic version of the Huber--Strassen maximin result is thus
obtained.
  4) Uniform and nonuniform asymptotic normality of robust and adaptive
estimators, respectively, in regression and time series models.
  5) Fragility of optimal one-sided tests and confidence limits obtained for
convex tangent cones, by projection on cones, as opposed to stability of
corresponding procedures, even two-sided, for linear tangent spaces.
  6) The unknown neighborhood radius as a nuisance parameter in robustness.
  The investigation relies on asymptotic techniques and on numerical
evaluations of robust estimates.
  The construction under 1) of robust estimates which are adaptive, an
appropriate LAM estimation bound for balls under 3), and the minimization of
the norm under 5) on a certain restricted set of differences of tangents from a
cone are examples of challenging open problems.
