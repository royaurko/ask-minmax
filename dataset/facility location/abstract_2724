The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), a ground-based facility for
very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray astronomy, will operate as an open
observatory, serving a wide scientific community to explore and to study the
non-thermal universe. Open community access is a novelty in this domain,
putting a challenge on the implementation of services that make VHE gamma-ray
astronomy as accessible as any other waveband. We present here the design of
the CTA Observer Access system that comprises support of scientific users,
dissemination of data and software, tools for scientific analysis, and the
system to submit observing proposals. We outline the scientific user workflows
and provide the status of the current developments.
