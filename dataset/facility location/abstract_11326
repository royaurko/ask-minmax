A method to improve l1 performance of the CS (Compressive Sampling) for
A-scan SFCW-GPR (Stepped Frequency Continuous Wave-Ground Penetrating Radar)
signals with known spectral energy density is proposed. Instead of random
sampling, the proposed method selects the location of samples to follow the
distribution of the spectral energy. Samples collected from three different
measurement methods; the uniform sampling, random sampling, and energy
equipartition sampling, are used to reconstruct a given monocycle signal whose
spectral energy density is known. Objective performance evaluation in term of
PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) indicates empirically that the CS
reconstruction of random sampling outperform the uniform sampling, while the
energy equipartition sampling outperforms both of them. These results suggest
that similar performance improvement can be achieved for the compressive SFCW
(Stepped Frequency Continuous Wave) radar, allowing even higher acquisition
speed.
