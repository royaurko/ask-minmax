We present evidence for X-ray line emitting and absorbing gas in the nucleus
of the Broad-Line Radio Galaxy (BLRG), 3C 445. A 200ks Chandra LETG observation
of 3C 445 reveals the presence of several highly ionized emission lines in the
soft X-ray spectrum, primarily from the He and H-like ions of O, Ne, Mg and Si.
Radiative recombination emission is detected from O VII and O VIII, indicating
that the emitting gas is photoionized. The He-like emission appears to be
resolved into forbidden and intercombination line components, which implies a
high density of >10^{10} cm^{-3}, while the Oxygen lines are velocity broadened
with a mean width of ~2600 km s^{-1} (FWHM). The density and widths of the
ionized lines indicate an origin of the gas on sub-parsec scales in the Broad
Line Region (BLR).The X-ray continuum of 3C 445 is heavily obscured either by a
partial coverer or by a photoionized absorber of column density N_{H}=2x10^{23}
cm^{-2} and ionization parameter log(xi)=1.4 erg cm s^{-1}. However the view of
the X-ray line emission is unobscured, which requires the absorber to be
located at radii well within any parsec scale molecular torus. Instead, we
suggest that the X-ray absorber in 3C 445 may be associated with an outflowing,
but clumpy, accretion disk wind with an observed outflow velocity of ~10000
km/s.
