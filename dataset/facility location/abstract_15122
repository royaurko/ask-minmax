We present a semi-analytical approach for modeling circumstellar emission
from rotating hot stars with a strong dipole magnetic field tilted at an
arbitrary angle to the rotation axis. By assuming the rigid-field limit in
which material driven (e.g., in a wind outflow) from the star is forced to
remain in strict rigid-body co-rotation, we are able to solve for the effective
centrifugal-plus-gravitational potential along each field line, and thereby
identify the location of potential minima where material is prone to
accumulate. Applying basic scalings for the surface mass flux of a radiatively
driven stellar wind, we calculate the circumstellar density distribution that
obtains once ejected plasma settles into hydrostatic stratification along field
lines. The resulting accumulation surface resembles a rigidly rotating, warped
disk, tilted such that its average surface normal lies between the rotation and
magnetic axes. Using a simple model of the plasma emissivity, we calculate
time-resolved synthetic line spectra for the disk. Initial comparisons show an
encouraging level of correspondence with the observed rotational phase
variations of Balmer-line emission profiles from magnetic Bp stars like sigma
Ori E.
