Ground based extensive air showers arrays can observe GRBs in the 1-1000 GeV
energy range using the "single particle" techique. The sensitivity to detect a
GRB as a function of the burst parameters and the detector characteristics are
discussed. The rate of possible observations is evaluated, making reasonable
assumptions on the high energy emission, the absorbtion of gamma-rays in the
intergalactic space, the distribution of the sources in the universe and the
bursts luminosity function. We show that a large area detector located at high
mountain altitude has good prospects for positive detections, providing useful
informations on the high energy components of GRBs.
