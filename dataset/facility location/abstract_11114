The use of microscopic discrete fluid volumes (i.e., droplets) as
microreactors for digital microfluidic applications often requires mixing
enhancement and control within droplets. In this work, we consider a
translating spherical liquid droplet to which we impose a time periodic
rigid-body rotation which we model using the superposition of a Hill vortex and
an unsteady rigid body rotation. This perturbation in the form of a rotation
not only creates a three-dimensional chaotic mixing region, which operates
through the stretching and folding of material lines, but also offers the
possibility of controlling both the size and the location of the mixing. Such a
control is achieved by judiciously adjusting the three parameters that
characterize the rotation, i.e., the rotation amplitude, frequency and
orientation of the rotation. As the size of the mixing region is increased,
complete mixing within the drop is obtained.
