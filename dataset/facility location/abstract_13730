In this work, we construct suitable generating functions for vortices of
alternating signs in the realm of Bose-Einstein condensates. In addition to the
vortex-vortex interaction included in earlier fluid dynamics constructions of
such functions, the vortices here precess around the center of the trap. This
results in the generating functions of the vortices of positive charge and of
negative charge satisfying a modified, so-called, Tkachenko differential
equation. From that equation, we reconstruct collinear few-vortex equilibria
obtained in earlier work, as well as extend them to larger numbers of vortices.
Moreover, particular moment conditions can be derived e.g. about the sum of the
squared locations of the vortices for arbitrary vortex numbers. Furthermore,
the relevant differential equation can be generalized appropriately in the
two-dimensional complex plane and allows the construction e.g. of polygonal
vortex ring and multi-ring configurations, as well as ones with rings
surrounding a vortex at the center that are again connected to earlier
bibliography.
