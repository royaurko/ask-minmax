We report the discovery of eleven new ZZ Cetis using telescopes at OPD
(Observat\'orio do Pico dos Dias/LNA) in Brazil, the 4.1 m SOAR (Southern
Astrophysical Research) telescope at Cerro Pachon, Chile, and the 2.1 m Otto
Struve telescope at McDonald observatory. The candidates were selected from the
SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) and SPY (ESO SN Ia progenitor survey), based on
their Teff obtained from optical spectra fitting. This selection criterion
yields the highest success rate of detecting new ZZ Cetis, above 90% in the
Teff range from 12000 to 11000 K. We also report on a DA not observed to vary,
with a Teff placing the star close to the blue edge of the instability strip.
Among our new pulsators, one is a little bit cooler than this star for which
pulsations were not detected. Our observations are an important constraint on
the location of the blue edge of the ZZ Ceti instability strip.
