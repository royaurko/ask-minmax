The electronic structure of FeSe thin films grown on SrTiO3 substrate is
studied by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We reveal the
existence of Dirac cone band dispersions in FeSe thin films thicker than 1 Unit
Cell below the nematic transition temperature, whose apex are located -10 meV
below Fermi energy. The evolution of Dirac cone electronic structure for FeSe
thin films as function of temperature, thickness and cobalt doping is
systematically studied. The Dirac cones are found to be coexisted with the
nematicity in FeSe, disappear when nematicity is suppressed. Our results
provide some indication that the spin degrees of freedom may play some kind of
role in the nematicity of FeSe.
