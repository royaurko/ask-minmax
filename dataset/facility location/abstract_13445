We present a generalized Newtonian description of particle dynamics valid for
any spherically symmetric, static black hole spacetime. This approach is
derived from the geodesic motion of test particles in the low-energy limit. It
reproduces exactly the location of the marginally stable, marginally bound, and
photon circular orbits; the radial dependence of the energy and angular
momentum of circular orbits; parabolic motion; pericentre shift; and the
spatial projection of general trajectories. As explicit examples of the new
prescription, we apply it to the Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-de Sitter,
Reissner-Nordstr\"om, Ay\'on Beato-Garc\'ia, and Kehagias-Sfetsos spacetimes.
In all of these examples, the orbital and epicyclic frequencies are reproduced
to better than 10%. The resulting equations of motion can be implemented easily
and efficiently within existing Newtonian frameworks.
