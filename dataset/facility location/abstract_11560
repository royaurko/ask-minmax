The long-term habitability of Earth-like planets requires low orbital
eccentricities. A secular perturbation from a distant stellar companion is a
very important mechanism in exciting planetary eccentricities, as many of the
extrasolar planetary systems are associated with stellar companions. Although
the orbital evolution of an Earth-like planet in a stellar binary is well
understood, the effect of a binary perturbation to a more realistic system
containing additional gas giant planets has been very little studied. Here we
provide analytic criteria confirmed by a large ensemble of numerical
integrations that identify the initial orbital parameters leading to eccentric
orbits. We show that an extra-solar earth is likely to experience a broad range
of orbital evolution dictated by the location of a gas-giant planet,
necessitating more focused studies on the effect of eccentricity on the
potential for life.
