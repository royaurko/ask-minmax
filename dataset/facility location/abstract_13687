Self-avoiding walks are a simple and well-known model of long, flexible
polymers in a good solvent. Polymers being pulled away from a surface by an
external agent can be modelled with self-avoiding walks in a half-space, with a
Boltzmann weight $y = e^f$ associated with the pulling force. This model is
known to have a critical point at a certain value $y_c$ of this Boltzmann
weight, which is the location of a transition between the so-called free and
ballistic phases. The value $y_c=1$ has been conjectured by several contributors
using numerical estimates. We provide a relatively simple proof of this result,
and show that further properties of the free energy of this system can be
determined by re-interpreting existing results about the two-point function of
self-avoiding walks.
