The superconducting cavities in the continuous wave (CW) linacs of LCLS-II
are designed to operate at 2 K, where cooling costs are very expensive. One
source of heat is presented by the higher order mode (HOM) power deposited by
the beam. Due to the very short bunch length--especially in L3 the final
linac--the LCLS-II beam spectrum extends into the terahertz range. Ceramic
absorbers, at 70 K and located between cryomodules, are meant to absorb much of
this power. In this report we perform two kinds of calculations to estimate the
effectiveness of the absorbers and the amount of beam power that needs to be
removed at 2 K.
