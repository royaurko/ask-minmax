Investigating the spectral and temporal characteristics of the X-rays coming
from Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is essential to our development of a more complete
understanding of the emission mechanisms in this supermassive black hole
located at the center of our Galaxy. Several X-ray flares with varying
durations and spectral features have already been observed from this object.
Here we present the results of two long XMM-Newton observations of the Galactic
nucleus carried out in 2004, for a total exposure time of nearly 500 ks. During
these observations we detected two flares from Sgr A* with peak 2-10 keV
luminosities about 40 times (L ~ 9x10^34 erg s&#8722;1) above the quiescent
luminosity: one on 2004 March 31 and another on 2004 August 31. The first flare
lasted about 2.5 ks and the second about 5 ks. The combined fit on the Epic
spectra yield photon indeces of about 1.5 and 1.9 for the first and second
flare respectively. This hard photon index strongly suggests the presence of an
important population of non-thermal electrons during the event and supports the
view that the majority of flaring events tend to be hard and not very luminous.
