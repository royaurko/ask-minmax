We report on the discovery of an outburst from a previously unknown high-
latitude CV we designate ROTSE3 J015118.59-022300.1. The object was first
detected on 2001 Oct 13.291 at m-ROTSE3=14.71+-0.06, after which it faded by
more than 2 magnitudes over 13 d. Spectral analysis confirms a Galactic
location, despite unusual properties that render classification difficult.
