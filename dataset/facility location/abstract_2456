A potentially important feature in a divertor design for a high-power tokamak
is an extended and expanded divertor leg. The upgrade to MAST will allow a wide
range of such divertor leg geometries to be produced, and hence will allow the
roles of greatly increased connection length and flux expansion to be
experimentally tested. This will include testing the potential of the Super-X
configuration [1]. The design process for the upgrade has required analysis of
producing and controlling the magnetic configurations, and has included
consideration of the roles that divertor closure and increasing magnetic
connection length will play.
