We report the discovery of a new hot-Jupiter, KOI-196b, transiting a
solar-type star with an orbital period of 1.855558 days\pm0.6s thanks to public
photometric data from the Kepler space mission and new radial velocity
observations obtained by the SOPHIE spectrograph mounted on the 1.93-m
telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, France. The planet KOI-196b,
with a radius of 0.841\pm0.032 Rjup and a mass of 0.49\pm0.09 Mjup, orbits a
G2V star with R* = 0.996\pm0.032 Rsun, M*= 0.94\pm0.09 Msun, [Fe/H] =
-0.10\pm0.16 dex, Teff= 5660\pm100 K and an age of 7.7\pm3.4 Gy. KOI-196b is
one the rare close-in hot-Jupiters with a radius smaller than Jupiter
suggesting a non-inflated planet. The high precision of the Kepler photometry
permits us to detect the secondary transit with a depth of 64 +10/-12 ppm as
well as the optical phase variation. We find a geometric albedo of Ag =
0.30\pm0.08 which is higher than most of the transiting hot-Jupiters with a
measured Ag. Assuming no heat recirculation, we find a day-side temperature of
Tday = 1930\pm80 K. KOI-196b seems to be one of the rare hot-Jupiters located
in the short-period hot-Jupiter desert.
