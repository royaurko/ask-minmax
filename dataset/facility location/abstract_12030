We identified a new X-ray transient CXOM31 004252.457+411631.17 (T13) in M31
during a 2013 June Chandra observation. This system is particularly exciting
because it is located within 100" of M31*; it is thought that this region of
the bulge is sufficiently dense to form X-ray binaries dynamicaly, but only
systems with black hole accretors and/or short periods are expected to survive.
A follow-up XMM-Newton observation yielded a soft spectrum, well described by a
0.39+/-0.02 keV disk blackbody; applying this model to the Chandra observation
yielded an observed 0.3--10 keV luminosity peak of 6.2+/-0.6 E+37 erg/s (4.7
E+36 erg/s in the 2.0--10 keV band). Observing with HST/ACS did not reveal an
optical counterpart, but allowed us to place an upper limit of B >26.9,
corresponding to an absolute V band magnitude >2.0. From the 2--10 keV
luminosity and absolute V magnitude, we estimate an orbital period $<$5 h from
an empirical relation. Fitting a disk blackbody + blackbody model allows us to
reject a neutron star accretor at a 14 sigma level.
