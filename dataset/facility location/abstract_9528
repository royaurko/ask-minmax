The ARGO-YBJ experiment is almost completely installed at the YangBaJing
Cosmic Ray Laboratory (4300 m a.s.l., Tibet, P.R. China). The lower energy
limit of the detector (E $\sim$ 1 GeV) is reached with the scaler mode, i.e.,
recording the single particle rate at fixed time intervals. In this technique,
due to its high altitude location and large area ($\sim$ 6700 m$^2$), this
experiment is the most sensitive among all present and past ground-based
detectors. In the energy range under investigation, signals due to local (e.g.
solar GLEs) and cosmological (e.g. GRBs) phenomena are expected as significant
enhancements of the counting rate over the background. Results on the search
for GRBs in coincidence with satellite detections are presented.
