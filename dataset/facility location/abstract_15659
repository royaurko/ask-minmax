We introduce a search problem called ``mutual search'' where $k$ \agents,
arbitrarily distributed over $n$ sites, are required to locate one another by
posing queries of the form ``Anybody at site $i$?''. We ask for the least
number of queries that is necessary and sufficient. For the case of two \agents
using deterministic protocols we obtain the following worst-case results: In an
oblivious setting (where all pre-planned queries are executed) there is no
savings: $n-1$ queries are required and are sufficient. In a nonoblivious
setting we can exploit the paradigm of ``no news is also news'' to obtain
significant savings: in the synchronous case $0.586n$ queries suffice and
$0.536n$ queries are required; in the asynchronous case $0.896n$ queries
suffice and a fortiori 0.536 queries are required; for $o(\sqrt{n})$ \agents
using a deterministic protocol less than $n$ queries suffice; there is a simple
randomized protocol for two \agents with worst-case expected $0.5n$ queries and
all randomized protocols require at least $0.125n$ worst-case expected queries.
The graph-theoretic framework we formulate for expressing and analyzing
algorithms for this problem may be of independent interest.
