Phenomenon of coherent double-flavor oscillations is discussed. They can
arise when heavy flavored neutral mesons decay with production of neutral
kaons. The oscillations may be used to study detailed properties of the heavy
mesons and their decays. They may give new insight into the problem of
CP-violation. In particular, they provide the only known way to the complete
unambiguous measurements of CP-violating parameters for neutral B-meson decays.
The corresponding experiments seem to be hard, but possible at hadron
facilities.
