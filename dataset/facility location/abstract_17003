To evaluate the effects of variations in the thermal state of the overriding
plate on the slab dip in an ocean-continent subduction system, a 2-D finite
element thermo-mechanical model was implemented. The lithosphere base was
located at the depth of the 1600 K isotherm. Numerical simulations were
performed while taking into account four different initial thicknesses for the
oceanic lithosphere (60, 80, 95 and 110 km) and five different thicknesses of
the overriding plate, as compared in terms of the continental-oceanic plate
thickness ratio (100, 120, 140, 160 and 200% of the oceanic lithosphere
thickness). The results of numerical modeling indicate that a high variability
of the subducting plate geometry occurs for an oceanic lithosphere thickness
ranging from 60 to 80 km, while the variability decreases where the oceanic
plates are thicker (95 and 110 km). Furthermore, the slab dip strongly depends
on the thermal state of the overriding plate, and, in particular, the slab dip
decreases with the increase in the upper plate thickness. The model predictions
also confirm that a direct correlation between the slab dip and the age of the
oceanic lithosphere does not exist, at least for subduction plates thinner that
110 km. These conclusions are supported by the good agreement between the model
results and the natural data referring to worldwide ocean-continent subduction
zones.
