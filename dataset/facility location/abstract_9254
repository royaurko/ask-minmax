We present the results of a search for bright high-redshift galaxies in two
large SCUBA scan-maps of Galactic regions. A Mexican Hat Wavelet technique was
used to locate point sources in these maps, which suffer high foreground
contamination as well as typical scan-map noise signatures. A catalogue of
point source objects was selected and observed again in the submillimetre
continuum, and in HCO+ (3->2) at zero redshift to rule out Galactic sources. No
extragalactic sources were found. Simulations show that the survey was
sensitive to sources with fluxes > 50 mJy, depending on the local background.
These simulations result in upper limits on the 850-micron counts of SCUBA
galaxies of 53 per square degree at 50 mJy and 2.9 per square degree at 100
mJy.
