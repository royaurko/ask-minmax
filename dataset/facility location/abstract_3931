The electromagnetic (EM) emission associated with a gravitational wave (GW)
signal is one of the main goal of future astronomy. Merger of neutron stars
and/or black holes and core-collapse of massive stars are expected to cause
rapid transient electromagnetic signals. The EM follow-up of GW signals will
have to deal with large position uncertainties. The gravitational sky
localization is expected to be tens to hundreds of square degrees. Wide-field
cameras and rapid follow-up observations will be crucial to characterize the EM
candidates for the first EM counterpart identification. We present some of the
activities that we are currently carrying on to optimize the response of the
INAF network of facilities to expected GW triggers. The INAF network will
represent an efficient operational framework capable of fast reaction on large
error box triggers and direct identification and characterization of the
candidates.
