We report a detailed analysis of $\gamma$-ray data of 2FGL J0509.9+1802
observed by the Large Area Telescope on board {\it Fermi} satellite, especially
focusing on April 2013 when extraordinary $\gamma$-ray variability has been
detected. Localization of $\gamma$-ray emission during this epoch suggests that
the $\gamma$-ray source only associates with PKS 0507+17. The $\gamma$-ray
emission of PKS 0507+17 is identified at the first time. The daily peak flux is
over two orders of magnitude higher than the first two-year average flux,
giving an isotropic $\gamma$-ray luminosity of $\simeq4\times10^{48}$ erg $\rm
s^{-1}$. Rapid $\gamma$-ray variability with doubling time of 2-3 hours has
been detected. Such a short doubling timescale has been detected for only a few
bright blazars and indicates a location of $\gamma$-ray emission inside the
broad line region. Together with the bluer-when-brighter $\gamma$-ray spectra,
the variability phenomena could be well explained by the classic flat-spectrum
radio quasar variability model that includes a fast injection of accelerated
electrons and the external Compton cooling process.
