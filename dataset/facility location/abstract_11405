Active galactic nuclei present continuum and line emission. The former is
produced by the accretion disk and the jets, whereas the latter is originated
by gas located close to the super-massive black hole. The small region where
the broad lines are emitted is called the broad-line region. The structure of
this region is not well known, although it has been proposed that it may be
formed by small and dense ionized clouds surrounding the supermassive
black-hole. In this work, we study the interaction of one cloud from the broad
line region with the jet of the active galactic nuclei. We explore the
high-energy emission produced by this interaction close to the base of the jet.
The resulting radiation may be detectable for nearby non-blazar sources as well
as for powerful quasars, and its detection could give important information on
the broad line region and the jet itself.
