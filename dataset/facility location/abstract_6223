We describe wave propagation and soliton localization in photonic lattices
which are induced in a nonlinear medium by an optical interference pattern,
taking into account the inherent lattice deformations at the soliton location.
We obtain exact analytical solutions and identify the key factors defining
soliton mobility, including the effects of gap merging and lattice imbalance,
underlying the differences with discrete and gap solitons in conventional
photonic structures.
