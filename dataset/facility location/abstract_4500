In the search for tidal structure in Galactic satellite systems, we have
conducted a photometric survey over a 10 square degree area centred on the
Fornax dSph galaxy. The survey was made in two colours, and the resulting
colour-magnitude data were used as a mask to select candidate Fornax RGB stars,
thereby increasing the contrast of Fornax stars to background sources in the
outer regions. Previously, we reported the presence of a shell (age 2 Gyr)
located towards the centre of Fornax. In this contribution we reveal a second
shell, significantly larger than the first, located 1.3 degrees NW from the
centre of Fornax, outside the nominal tidal radius. Moreover, the distribution
of Fornax RGB stars reveals two lobes extending to the spatial limit of our
survey, and aligned with the minor axis and with the two shells. These results
support the hypothesis of a merger between Fornax and a gas-rich companion
approximately 2 Gyr ago.
