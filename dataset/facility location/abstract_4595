A wave impinging on a Kerr black hole can be amplified as it scatters off the
hole if certain conditions are satisfied giving rise to superradiant
scattering. By placing a mirror around the black hole one can make the system
unstable. This is the black hole bomb of Press and Teukolsky. We investigate in
detail this process and compute the growing timescales and oscillation
frequencies as a function of the mirror's location. It is found that in order
for the system black hole plus mirror to become unstable there is a minimum
distance at which the mirror must be located. We also give an explicit example
showing that such a bomb can be built. In addition, our arguments enable us to
justify why large Kerr-AdS black holes are stable and small Kerr-AdS black
holes should be unstable.
