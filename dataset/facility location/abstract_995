In Japan, as the first experiment utilizes J-PARC (Japan Proton Accelerator
Research Complex) neutrino facility, T2K (Tokai to Kamioka Long Baseline
Neutrino Experiment) starts operation. T2K is supposed to give critical
information, which guides the future direction of the neutrino physics.
Possible new generation discovery experiment based on T2K outcome is discussed.
Especially, description of J-PARC neutrino beam upgrade plan and discussion on
far detector options to maximize potential of the research are focused.
European participation and CERN commitment on Japanese accelerator based
neutrino experiment is also reported.
