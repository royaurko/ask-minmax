This chapter discusses the dynamical properties of eruptive prominences in
relation to coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The fact that eruptive prominences
are a part of CMEs is emphasized in terms of their physical association and
kinematics. The continued propagation of prominence material into the
heliosphere is illustrated using in-situ observations. The solar-cycle
variation of eruptive prominence locations is discussed with a particular
emphasis on the rush-to-the-pole (RTTP) phenomenon. One of the consequences of
the RTTP phenomenon is polar CMEs, which are shown to be similar to the
low-latitude CMEs. This similarity is important because it provides important
clues to the mechanism by which CMEs erupt. The nonradial motion of CMEs is
discussed, including the deflection by coronal holes that have important space
weather consequences. Finally, the implications of the presented observations
for the modeling CME modeling are outlined.
