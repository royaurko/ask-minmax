The strong GRB of March 1, 1994 was imaged by COMPTEL and found to have an
identical location within the errors as a burst which occurred on July 4, 1993.
This location coincidence had prompted speculations on a possible single source
origin for both bursts. We have performed a ROSAT PSPC mosaic observation
within four weeks of GRB 940301. The results of these observations and the
comparison of the intensities of the detected sources with those detected
during the ROSAT all-sky-survey in September 1990 are presented. We neither
find a flaring X-ray source in the April 1994 observation nor any variability
of the X-ray sources detected in the all-sky-survey. We discuss the
consequences of our negative result on both, the possibility of the location
coincidence being due to a repeating burst source as well as due to two
independent sources. In the former case the source could either be a Soft Gamma
Repeater similar to SGR 1806-20 and SGR 0525-66, or a sofar unknown classical
burst repeater. We conclude that a quiescent luminous X-ray source as is found
for the above mentioned Soft Gamma Repeaters is very unlikely to be present in
the case of GRB 930704 / GRB 940301.
