The transverse current profile in the Next Linear Collider Test Accelerator
(NLCTA) electron beam can be monitored at several locations along the beam line
by means of profile monitors. These consist of insertable phosphor screens,
light collection and transport systems, CID cameras, a frame-grabber, and PC
and VAX based image analysis software. In addition to their usefulness in
tuning and steering the accelerator, the profile monitors are utilized for
emittance measurement. A description of these systems and their performance is
presented.
