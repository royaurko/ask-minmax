Binary collision simulations of high-fluence 1 keV Si ion implantation into 8
nm thick SiO2 films on (001)Si were combined with kinetic Monte Carlo
simulations of Si nanocrystal (NC) formation by phase separation during
annealing. For nonvolatile memory applications, these simulations help to
control size and location of NCs. For low concentrations of implanted Si, NCs
form via nucleation, growth and Ostwald ripening, whereas for high
concentrations Si separates by spinodal decomposition. In both regimes, NCs
form above a thin NC free oxide layer at the SiO2/Si interface. This,
self-adjusted layer has just a thickness appropriate for NC charging by direct
electron tunneling. Only in the nucleation regime the width of the tunneling
oxide and the mean NC diameter remain constant during a long annealing period.
This behavior originates from the competition of Ostwald ripening and Si loss
to the Si/SiO2 interface. The process simulations predict that, for nonvolatile
memories, the technological demands on NC synthesis are fulfilled best in the
nucleation regime.
