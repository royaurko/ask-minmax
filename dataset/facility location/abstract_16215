The structure of the superconducting gap provides important clues on the
symmetry of the order parameter and the pairing mechanism. The presence of
nodes in the gap function imposed by symmetry implies an unconventional order
parameter, other than s-wave. Here we show how measurements of the thermal
conductivity at very low temperature can be used to determine whether such
nodes are present in a particular superconductor, and shed light on their
nature and location. We focus on the residual linear term at T goes to 0. A
finite value in zero magnetic field is strong evidence for symmetry-imposed
nodes, and the dependence on impurity scattering can distinguish between a line
of nodes or point nodes. Application of a magnetic field probes the low-energy
quasiparticle excitations, whether associated with nodes or with a small value
of the gap on some part of the Fermi surface, as in a multi-band
superconductor. We frame our discussion around archetypal materials: Nb for
s-wave, Tl2Ba2CuO(6+\delta) for d-wave, Sr2RuO4 for p-wave, and NbSe2 for
multi-band superconductivity. In that framework, we discuss three heavy-fermion
superconductors: CeIrIn5, CeCoIn5 and UPt3.
