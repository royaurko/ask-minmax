The sample $d_\theta$-median is a robust estimator of the central tendency or
location of an interval-valued random variable. While the interval-valued
sample mean can be highly influenced by outliers, this spatial-type
interval-valued median remains much more reliable. In this paper, we show that
under general conditions the sample $d_\theta$-median is a strongly consistent
estimator of the $d_\theta$-median of an interval-valued random variable.
