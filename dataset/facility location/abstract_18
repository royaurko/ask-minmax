In recent years, a large number of geosynchronous satellites are being
planned to provide augmentation services for enhancing the precision to global
positioning systems, e.g., GPS, in applications such as aircraft landing. In
this paper, we present a scheme for co-locating passive satellite observational
facilities with a radio astronomy facility to open a new possibility of
providing valuable data for radio astronomical imaging, ionospheric studies and
satellite orbit estimation.
