The Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) will revolutionize the study of
dust-obscured star formation in distant galaxies. Although deep images from the
Multiband Imaging Photometer for SIRTF (MIPS) will provide coverage at 24, 70,
and 160 micron, the bulk of MIPS-detected objects may only have accurate
photometry in the shorter wavelength bands due to the confusion noise.
Therefore, we have explored the potential for constraining the total infrared
(IR) fluxes of distant galaxies with solely the 24 micron flux density, and for
the combination of 24 micron and 70 micron data. We also discuss the inherent
systematic uncertainties in making these transitions. Under the assumption that
distant star-forming galaxies have IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that
are represented somewhere in the local Universe, the 24 micron data (plus
optical and X-ray data to allow redshift estimation and AGN rejection)
constrains the total IR luminosity to within a factor of 2.5 for galaxies with
0.4 < z < 1.6. Incorporating the 70 micron data substantially improves this
constraint by a factor < 6. Lastly, we argue that if the shape of the IR SED is
known (or well constrained; e.g., because of high IR luminosity, or low
ultraviolet/IR flux ratio), then the IR luminosity can be estimated with more
certainty.
