In this paper we present time series photometry of 104 variable stars in the
cluster region NGC 1893. The association of the present variable candidates to
the cluster NGC 1893 has been determined by using $(U-B)/(B-V)$ and
$(J-H)/(H-K)$ two colour diagrams, and $V/(V-I)$ colour magnitude diagram.
Forty five stars are found to be main-sequence variables and these could be
B-type variable stars associated with the cluster. We classified these objects
as $\beta$ Cep, slowly pulsating B stars and new class variables as discussed
by Mowlavi et al. (2013). These variable candidates show $\sim$0.005 to
$\sim$0.02 mag brightness variations with periods of $<$ 1.0 d. Seventeen new
class variables are located in the $H-R$ diagram between the slowly pulsating B
stars and $\delta$ Scuti variables. Pulsation could be one of the causes for
periodic brightness variations in these stars. The X-ray emission of present
main-sequence variables associated with the cluster lies in the saturated
region of X-ray luminosity versus period diagram and follows the general trend
by Pizzolato et al. (2003).
