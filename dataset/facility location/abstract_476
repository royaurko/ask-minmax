We outline several directions for future investigations of the
three-dimensional structure of nucleon, including multiparton correlations,
color transparency, and branching processes at hadron colliders and at hadron
factories. We also find evidence that pQCD regime for non-vacuum Regge
trajectories sets in for $-t\ge 1 {GeV}^2$ leading to nearly t-independent
trajectories.
