A neutron detector based on EJ301 liquid scintillator has been employed at
EAST to measure the neutron energy spectrum for D-D fusion plasma. The detector
was carefully characterized in different quasi-monoenergetic neutron fields
generated by a 4.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator. In recent experimental
campaigns, due to the low neutron yield at EAST, a new shielding device was
designed and located as close as possible to the tokamak to enhance the count
rate of the spectrometer. The fluence of neutrons and gamma-rays was measured
with the liquid neutron spectrometer and was consistent with 3He proportional
counter and NaI (Tl) gamma-ray spectrometer measurements. Plasma ion
temperature values were deduced from the neutron spectrum in discharges with
lower hybrid wave injection and ion cyclotron resonance heating. Scattered
neutron spectra were simulated by the Monte Carlo transport Code, and they were
well verified by the pulse height measurements at low energies.
