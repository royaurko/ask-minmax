We investigate the triggering mechanisms of plasma eruptions in the solar
atmosphere due to interactions between emerging flux and coronal arcade fields
by using two-dimensional MHD simulations. We perform parameter surveys with
respect to arcade field height, magnetic field strength, and emerging flux
location. Our results show that two possible mechanisms exist, and which
mechanism is dominant depends mostly on emerging flux location. One mechanism
appears when the location of emerging flux is close to the polarity inversion
line (PIL) of an arcade field. This mechanism requires reconnection between the
emerging flux and the arcade field, as pointed out by previous studies. The
other mechanism appears when the location of emerging flux is around the edge
of an arcade field. This mechanism does not require reconnection between the
emerging flux and the arcade field but does demand reconnection in the arcade
field above the PIL. Furthermore, we found that the eruptive condition for this
mechanism can be represented by a simple formula.
