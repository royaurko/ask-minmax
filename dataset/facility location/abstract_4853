We explicitly prove the horizon-entropy increase law for both causal and
quasi-locally defined horizons in scalar-tensor and $f(R)$ gravity theories.
Contrary to causal event horizons, future outer trapping horizons are not
conformally invariant and we provide a modification of trapping horizons to
complete the proof, using the idea of generalised entropy. This modification
means they are no longer foliated by marginally outer trapped surfaces but
fixes the location of the horizon under a conformal transformation. We also
discuss the behaviour of horizons in "veiled" general relativity and show,
using this new definition, how to locate cosmological horizons in flat
Minkowski space with varying units, which is physically identified with a
spatially flat FLRW spacetime.
