We consider defining time as a function of a cyclical field, an abstraction
of a clock. The definition of time corresponds to a novel interpretation of the
relationship between space-time coordinates of observers at different locations
in space. As a first test of the utility of this definition, we show that it
leads to a Lorentz covariant description of space-time. This derivation of
Lorenz covariance provides a starting point for considering more general
constructions that relate to physical laws. The definition of time couples time
to space, making time not orthogonal to space, and making dynamics a result of
geometry, providing a vehicle for curved space-time theories that generalize
general relativity.
