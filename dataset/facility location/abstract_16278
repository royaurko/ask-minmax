The faint radio supernova remnant SNR G315.9-0.0 is notable for a long and
thin trail that extends outward perpendicular from the edge of its
approximately circular shell. In a search with the Parkes telescope we have
found a young and energetic pulsar that is located at the tip of this
collimated linear structure. PSR J1437-5959 has period P = 61 ms,
characteristic age tau_c = 114 kyr, and spin-down luminosity dE/dt = 1.4e36
erg/s. It is very faint, with a flux density at 1.4 GHz of about 75 uJy. From
its dispersion measure of 549 pc/cc, we infer d ~ 8 kpc. At this distance and
for an age comparable to tau_c, the implied pulsar velocity in the plane of the
sky is V_t = 300 km/s for a birth at the center of the SNR, although it is
possible that the SNR/pulsar system is younger than tau_c and that V_t > 300
km/s. The highly collimated linear feature is evidently the pulsar wind trail
left from the supersonic passage of PSR J1437-5959 through the interstellar
medium surrounding SNR G315.9-0.0.
