Mass spectrometry provides a high-throughput approach to identify proteins in
biological samples. A key step in the analysis of mass spectrometry data is to
identify the peptide sequence that, most probably, gave rise to each observed
spectrum. This is often tackled using a database search: each observed spectrum
is compared against a large number of theoretical "expected" spectra predicted
from candidate peptide sequences in a database, and the best match is
identified using some heuristic scoring criterion. Here we provide a more
principled, likelihood-based, scoring criterion for this problem. Specifically,
we introduce a probabilistic model that allows one to assess, for each
theoretical spectrum, the probability that it would produce the observed
spectrum. This probabilistic model takes account of peak locations and
intensities, in both observed and theoretical spectra, which enables
incorporation of detailed knowledge of chemical plausibility in peptide
identification. Besides placing peptide scoring on a sounder theoretical
footing, the likelihood-based score also has important practical benefits: it
provides natural measures for assessing the uncertainty of each identification,
and in comparisons on benchmark data it produced more accurate peptide
identifications than other methods, including SEQUEST. Although we focus here
on peptide identification, our scoring rule could easily be integrated into any
downstream analyses that require peptide-spectrum match scores.
