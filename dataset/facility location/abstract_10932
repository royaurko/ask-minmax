We discuss brane webs preserving eight supercharges and derive geometries
produced by them. Consistency conditions of supergravity are shown to impose
certain requirements on the locations of the sources, and these restrictions
are found to be in a perfect agreement with results of the probe analysis. In
particular, solutions of IIB SUGRA describing (p,q) stings are inconsistent,
unless the web consists of straight line segments whose orientation is
correlated with charges of the string. The geometries produced by membranes and
D3 branes are only consistent if brane profiles are holomorphic. Using
perturbation theory, we show that a unique gravity solution exists for any
allowed distribution of sources. We also revisit 1/4-BPS geometries with AdS_p
x S^q asymptotics and derive the boundary conditions leading to regular
geometries. All degenerate limits of regular solutions are shown to agree with
expectations from the brane probe analysis.
