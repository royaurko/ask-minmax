We present an analysis of archival Spitzer images and new ground-based and
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) near-infrared (IR) and optical images of the field
of M83 with the goal of identifying rare, dusty, evolved massive stars. We
present point source catalogs consisting of 3778 objects from $Spitzer$
Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) Band 1 (3.6 $\mu$m) and Band 2 (4.5 $\mu$m), and
975 objects identified in Magellan 6.5m FourStar near-IR $J$ and $K_{\rm s}$
images. A combined catalog of coordinate matched near- and mid-IR point sources
yields 221 objects in the field of M83. Using this photometry we identify 185
massive evolved stellar candidates based on their location in color-magnitude
and color-color diagrams. We estimate the background contamination to our
stellar candidate lists and further classify candidates based on their
appearance in $HST$ Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) observations of M83. We find 49
strong candidates for massive stars which are very promising objects for
spectroscopic follow-up. Based on their location in a $B-V$ versus $V-I$
diagram, we expect at least 24, or roughly 50%, to be confirmed as red
supergiants.
