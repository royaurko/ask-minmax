In this paper,We present a simple relativistic approach to analyze the flux
striking the disk which is possibly from a source up the Black hole.The X-ray
source is locate above an accretion disc orbiting around the black hole,this
assumption is invoked by recent studies about iron k$\alpha$. we compute and
arguing that due to the light bending effect near black hole, the flux striking
the disk surface may be very concentrated,which will undoubtable change the
disk's ionization state hence change the iron line's ionization state and
emissivity.Also,Our model may explain the steep power law when modelling the
lines.
