Because the planets of a system form in a flattened disk, they are expected
to share similar orbital inclinations at the end of their formation. The
high-precision photometric monitoring of stars known to host a transiting
planet could thus reveal the transits of one or more other planets. We
investigate here the potential of this approach for the M dwarf GJ 1214 that
hosts a transiting super-Earth. For this system, we infer the transit
probabilities as a function of orbital periods. Using Monte-Carlo simulations
we address both the cases for fully coplanar and for non-coplanar orbits, with
three different choices of inclinations distribution for the non-coplanar case.
GJ 1214 reveals to be a very promising target for the considered approach.
Because of its small size, a ground-based photometric monitoring of this star
could detect the transit of a habitable planet as small as the Earth, while a
space-based monitoring could detect any transiting habitable planet down to the
size of Mars. The mass measurement of such a small planet would be out of reach
for current facilities, but we emphasize that a planet mass would not be needed
to confirm the planetary nature of the transiting object. Furthermore, the
radius measurement combined with theoretical arguments would help us to
constrain the structure of the planet.
