We propose a co-ordinated multi-observatory survey at the North Ecliptic
Pole. This field is the natural extragalactic deep field location for most
space observatories (e.g. containing the deepest Planck, WISE and eROSITA
data), is in the continuous viewing zones for e.g. Herschel, HST, JWST, and is
a natural high-visibility field for the L2 halo orbit of SPICA with deep and
wide-field legacy surveys already planned. The field is also a likely deep
survey location for the forthcoming Euclid mission. It is already a
multi-wavelength legacy field in its own right (e.g. AKARI, LOFAR, SCUBA-2):
the outstanding and unparalleled continuous mid-IR photometric coverage in this
field and nowhere else enables a wide range of galaxy evolution diagnostics
unachievable in any other survey field, by spanning the wavelengths of
redshifted PAH and silicate features and the peak energy output of AGN hot
dust. We argue from the science needs of Euclid and JWST, and from the
comparative multiwavelength depths, that the logical approach is (1) a deep
(H-UDF) UV/optical tile in the NEP over ~10 square arcminutes, and (2) an
overlapping wide-field UV/optical HST survey tier covering >100 square
arcminutes, with co-ordinated submm SPIRE mapping up to or beyond the submm
point source confusion limit over a wider area and PACS data over the shallower
HST tier.
