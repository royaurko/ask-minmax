We present multiwavelength linear polarimetric observations of 104 stars
towards the region of young open cluster NGC 6823. The polarization towards NGC
6823 is dominated by foreground dust grains and we found the evidence for the
presence of several layers of dust towards the line of sight. The first layer
of dust is located approximately within 200 pc towards the cluster, which is
much closer to the Sun than the cluster (~ 2.1 kpc). The radial distribution of
the position angles for the member stars are found to show a systematic change
while the polarization found to reduce towards the outer parts of the cluster
and the average position angle of coronal region of the cluster is very close
to the inclination of the Galactic parallel (~ 32 degree). The size
distribution of the grains within NGC 6823 is similar to those in general
interstellar medium. The patchy distribution of foreground dust grains are
suggested to be mainly responsible for the both differential reddening and
polarization towards NGC 6823. The majority of the observed stars do not show
the evidence of intrinsic polarization in their light.
