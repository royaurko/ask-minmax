Three-body resonances in atomic systems are calculated as complex-energy
solutions of Faddeev-type integral equations. The homogeneous Faddeev-Merkuriev
integral equations are solved by approximating the potential terms in a
Coulomb-Sturmian basis. The Coulomb-Sturmian matrix elements of the three-body
Coulomb Green's operator has been calculated as a contour integral of two-body
Coulomb Green's matrices. This approximation casts the integral equation into a
matrix equation and the complex energies are located as the complex zeros of
the Fredholm determinant. We calculated resonances of the e-Ps system at higher
energies and for total angular momentum L=1 with natural and unnatural parity
