ANDES (Agua Negra Deep Experiment Site) is a unique opportunity to build a
deep underground laboratory in the southern hemisphere. It will be built in the
Agua Negra tunnel planned between Argentina and Chile, and operated by the
CLES, a Latin American consortium. With 1750m of rock overburden, and no close-
by nuclear power plant, it will provide an extremely radiation quiet
environment for neutrino and dark matter experiments. In particular, its
location in the southern hemisphere should play a major role in understanding
dark matter modulation signals.
