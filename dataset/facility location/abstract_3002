We consider a single band approximation to the random Schroedinger operator
in an external magnetic field. The spectrum of such an operator has been
characterized in the case where delta impurities are located on the sites of a
lattice. In this paper we generalize these results by letting the delta
impurites have random positions as well as strengths; they are located in
squares of a lattice with a general bounded distribution. We characterize the
entire spectrum of this operator when the magnetic field is sufficiently high.
We show that the whole spectrum is pure point, the energy coinciding with the
first Landau level is infinitely degenerate and that the eigenfunctions
corresponding to other Landau band energies are exponentially localized.
