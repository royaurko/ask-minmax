We present evidence for the dramatically different morphology between the
rest frame UV and 7micron mid-IR emission of VV114 and Arp299, two nearby (z~0)
violently interacting infrared luminous galaxies (LIRGs). Nearly all LIRGs are
interacting systems and it is currently accepted that they dominate the IR
emission at z>1. Luminous IR galaxies located at z=1-2 could easily be detected
as unresolved sources in deep optical/near-IR ground based surveys, as well as
in upcoming 24micron surveys with the Space Infrared Telescope Facility. We
demonstrate that the spatial resolution of these surveys will result in
blending of the emission from unresolved interacting components. An increased
scatter will thus be introduced in the observed optical to mid-IR colors of
these galaxies, leading to a systematic underestimation of their dust content.
