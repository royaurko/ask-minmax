Markov chains have long been used for generating random variates from spatial
point processes. Broadly speaking, these chains fall into two categories:
Metropolis-Hastings type chains running in discrete time and spatial
birth-death chains running in continuous time. These birth-death chains only
allow for removal of a point or addition of a point. In this paper it is shown
that the addition of transitions where a point is moved from one location to
the other can aid in shortening the mixing time of the chain. Here the mixing
time of the chain is analyzed through coupling, and use of the swap moves
allows for analysis of a broader class of chains. Furthermore, these swap moves
can be employed in perfect sampling algorithms via the dominated coupling from
the past procedure of Kendall and M{\o}ller. This method can be applied to any
pairwise interaction model with repulsion. In particular, an application to the
Strauss process is developed in detail, and the swap chains are shown to be
much faster than standard birth-death chains.
