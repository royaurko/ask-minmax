Neuronal cells change their growth properties in response to external
physical stimuli such as variations in external temperature, stiffness of the
growth substrate, or topographical guidance cues. Detailed knowledge of the
mechanisms that control these biomechanical responses is necessary for
understanding the basic principles that underlie neuronal growth and
regeneration. Here, we present elasticity maps of living cortical neurons
(embryonic rat) as a function of temperature, and correlate these maps to the
locations of internal structural components of the cytoskeleton. Neurons
display a significant increase in the average elastic modulus upon a decrease
in ambient temperature from 37{\deg}C to 25{\deg}C. We demonstrate that the
dominant mechanism by which the elasticity of the neurons changes in response
to temperature is the stiffening of the actin components of the cytoskeleton
induced by myosin II. We also report a reversible shift in the location and
composition of the high-stiffness areas of the neuron cytoskeleton with
temperature. At 37{\deg}C the areas of the cell displaying high elastic modulus
overlap with the tubulin-dense regions, while at 25{\deg}C these high-stiffness
areas correspond to the actin-dense regions of the cytoskeleton. These results
demonstrate the importance of considering temperature effects when
investigating cytoskeletal dynamics in cells.
