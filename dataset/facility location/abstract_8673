We present in this work secondary catalogs up to $m_{Val} \sim 13$ based on
the Tycho reference frame (ESA, 1997) for 12 selected low-extinction fields
towards the galactic bulge. The observations have been performed with the
Askania-Zeiss Meridian Circle equiped with a CCD camera, located at the
Abrah\~ao de Moraes Observatory (Valinhos, Brazil) and operated by the
Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics, S\~ao Paulo University. The presented
catalog, though not complete, has been designed to help in intensive search
programmes (e.g. microlensing and variable searches) and therefore the selected
standards have a high astrometric and photometric ($V$ band, approximately)
quality. The mean precisions obtained were $0.0018^{s}$ in $\alpha$, 0.013'' in
$\delta$, 0.030 for the standard deviation in magnitude and 0.0042 for the
magnitude when weighted with the error bars in each night (in the mean, 42
stars for the catalog of each window). Tables B.1 to B.12 are also available in
eletronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr
(130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/Abstract.html.
