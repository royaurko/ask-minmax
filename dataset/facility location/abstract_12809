We report the electrical resistivity measurements under pressure for the
recently discovered BiS2-based layered superconductors Bi4O4S3 and La(O,F)BiS2.
In Bi4O4S3, the transition temperature Tc decreases monotonically without a
distinct change in the metallic behavior in the normal state. In La(O,F)BiS2,
on the other hand, Tc initially increases with increasing pressure and then
decreases above ? 1 GPa. The semiconducting behavior in the normal state is
suppressed markedly and monotonically, whereas the evolution of Tc is
nonlinear. The strong suppression of the semiconducting behavior without doping
in La(O,F)BiS2 suggests that the Fermi surface is located in the vicinity of
some instability. In the present study, we elucidate that the superconductivity
in the BiS2 layer favors the Fermi surface at the boundary between the
semiconducting and metallic behaviors.
