We demonstrate a method for quantitatively comparing gamma-ray pulsar light
curves with magnetosphere beaming models. With the Fermi LAT providing many
pulsar discoveries and high quality pulsar light curves for the brighter
objects, such comparison allows greatly improved constraints on the emission
zone geometry and the magnetospheric physics. Here we apply the method to Fermi
LAT light curves of a set of bright pulsars known since EGRET or before. We
test three approximate models for the magnetosphere structure and two popular
schemes for the location of the emission zone, the Two Pole Caustic (TPC) model
and the Outer Gap (OG) model. We find that OG models and relatively physical B
fields approximating force-free dipole magnetospheres are preferred at high
statistical significance. An application to the full LAT pulsar sample will
allow us to follow the emission zone's evolution with pulsar spindown.
