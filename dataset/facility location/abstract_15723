Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton theory possesses sequences of neutral static
spherically symmetric black hole solutions. The solutions depend on the dilaton
coupling constant $\gamma$ and on the horizon. The SU(2) solutions are labelled
by the number of nodes $n$ of the single gauge field function, whereas the
SO(3) solutions are labelled by the nodes $(n_1,n_2)$ of both gauge field
functions. The SO(3) solutions form sequences characterized by the node
structure $(j,j+n)$, where $j$ is fixed. The sequences of magnetically neutral
solutions tend to magnetically charged limiting solutions. For finite $j$ the
SO(3) sequences tend to magnetically charged Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton
solutions with $j$ nodes and charge $P=\sqrt{3}$. For $j=0$ and $j \rightarrow
\infty$ the SO(3) sequences tend to Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton solutions with
magnetic charges $P=\sqrt{3}$ and $P=2$, respectively. The latter also
represent the scaled limiting solutions of the SU(2) sequence. The convergence
of the global properties of the black hole solutions, such as mass, dilaton
charge and Hawking temperature, is exponential. The degree of convergence of
the matter and metric functions of the black hole solutions is related to the
relative location of the horizon to the nodes of the corresponding regular
solutions.
