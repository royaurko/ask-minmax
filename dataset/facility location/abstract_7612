In this paper, we present a computer-assisted method for facial
reconstruction. This method provides an estimation of the facial shape
associated with unidentified skeletal remains. Current computer-assisted
methods using a statistical framework rely on a common set of extracted points
located on the bone and soft-tissue surfaces. Most of the facial reconstruction
methods then consist of predicting the position of the soft-tissue surface
points, when the positions of the bone surface points are known. We propose to
use Latent Root Regression for prediction. The results obtained are then
compared to those given by Principal Components Analysis linear models. In
conjunction, we have evaluated the influence of the number of skull landmarks
used. Anatomical skull landmarks are completed iteratively by points located
upon geodesics which link these anatomical landmarks, thus enabling us to
artificially increase the number of skull points. Facial points are obtained
using a mesh-matching algorithm between a common reference mesh and individual
soft-tissue surface meshes. The proposed method is validated in term of
accuracy, based on a leave-one-out cross-validation test applied to a
homogeneous database. Accuracy measures are obtained by computing the distance
between the original face surface and its reconstruction. Finally, these
results are discussed referring to current computer-assisted reconstruction
facial techniques.
