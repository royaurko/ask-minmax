Microlensing surveys search for the transient brightening of a background
star that is the signature of gravitational lensing by a foreground compact
object. This technique is an elegant way to search for astrophysical candidates
that might comprise the dark matter halo of the Milky Way. While the current
projects have successfully detected the phenomenon of microlensing and have
reported many important results, the relatively large event rate reported
towards the LMC remains a puzzle. The first step in resolving this mystery is
determining the location of the excess lensing population. This will require a
microlensing survey with an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity over
current projects. I summarize the present status of microlensing surveys, and
present (and advocate!) a next-generation project that should be capable of
unambiguously determining whether the dark halo of the Galaxy is indeed made up
of MACHOs, or whether the observed events are due to previously unappreciated
ordinary stellar populations.
