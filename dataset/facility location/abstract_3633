We present a compilation of spectral energy distributions of 35 weak AGNs in
LINERs using recent data from the published literature. We make use of
previously published compilations of data, after complementing and extending
them with more recent data. The main improvement in the recent data is afforded
by high-spatial resolution observations with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and
high-spatial resolution radio observations utilizing a number of facilities. In
addition, a considerable number of objects have been observed with the HST in
the near-IR through near-UV bands since the earlier compilations were
published. The data include upper limits resulting from either non-detections
or observations at low spatial resolution that do not isolate the AGN. For the
sake of completeness, we also compute and present a number of quantities from
the data, such as alpha-ox, bolometric corrections, bolometric luminosities,
Eddington ratios, and the average SED. We anticipate that these data will be
useful for a number of applications. In a companion paper, we use a subset of
these data ourselves to assess the energy budgets of LINERs.
