This paper proposes a technique to specify and verify whether a loop can be
parallelised. Our approach can be used as an additional step in a parallelising
compiler to verify user annotations about loop dependences. Essentially, our
technique requires each loop iteration to be specified with the locations it
will read and write. From the loop iteration specifications, the loop
(in)dependences can be derived. Moreover, the loop iteration specifications
also reveal where synchronisation is needed in the parallelised program. The
loop iteration specifications can be verified using permission-based separation
logic.
