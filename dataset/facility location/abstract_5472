We have selected the positions of 54 6.7GHz methanol masers from the Methanol
Multibeam Survey catalogue, covering a range of longitudes between $20^{\circ}$
and $34^{\circ}$ of the Galactic Plane. These positions were mapped in the
J=3-2 transition of both the $\rm{^{13}CO}$ and $\rm{C^{18}O}$ lines. A total
of 58 $\rm{^{13}CO}$ emission peaks are found in the vicinity of these maser
positions. We search for outflows around all $\rm{^{13}CO}$ peaks, and find
evidence for high-velocity gas in all cases, spatially resolving the red and
blue outflow lobes in 55 cases. Of these sources, 44 have resolved kinematic
distances, and are closely associated with the 6.7GHz masers, a sub-set
referred to as Methanol Maser Associated Outflows (MMAOs). We calculate the
masses of the clumps associated with each peak using 870 $\rm{\mu m}$ continuum
emission from the ATLASGAL survey. A strong correlation is seen between the
clump mass and both outflow mass and mechanical force, lending support to
models in which accretion is strongly linked to outflow. We find that the
scaling law between outflow activity and clump masses observed for low-mass
objects, is also followed by the MMAOs in this study, indicating a commonality
in the formation processes of low-mass and high-mass stars.
