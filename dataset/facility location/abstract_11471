Aims: We determine the steady-state of an axisymmetric thin accretion disc
with an internal dynamo around a magnetised star.
  Methods: Starting from the vertically integrated equations of
magnetohydrodynamics we derive a single ordinary differential equation for a
thin accretion disc around a massive magnetic dipole and integrate this
equation numerically from the outside inwards.
  Results: Our numerical solution shows that the torque between the star and
the accretion disc is dominated by the contribution from the dynamo in the
disc. The location of the inner edge of the accretion disc varies between
$R_{\rm A}$ and $10R_{\rm A}$ depending mainly on the strength and direction of
the magnetic field generated by the dynamo in the disc
