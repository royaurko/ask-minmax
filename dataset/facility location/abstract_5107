The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has achieved its reputation by
providing a multi-scale time-frequency representation of nonlinear and/or
nonstationary signals. To extend this method to vector-valued signals (VvS) in
multidimensional (multi-D) space, a multivariate EMD (MEMD) has been designed
recently, which employs an ensemble projection to extract local extremum
locations (LELs) of the given VvS with respect to different projection
directions. This idea successfully overcomes the problems of locally defining
extrema of VvS. Different from the MEMD, where vector-valued envelopes (VvEs)
are interpolated based on LELs extracted from the 1-D projected signal, the
vector-valued EMD (VEMD) proposed in this paper employs a novel back projection
method to interpolate the VvEs from 1-D envelopes in the projected space.
Considering typical 4-D coordinates (3-D location and time), we show by
numerical simulations that the VEMD outperforms state-of-art methods.
