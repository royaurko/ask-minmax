We present an analysis of experimentally accessible magnetic Feshbach
resonances in ultra-cold hetero-nuclear 85Rb-87Rb and 6Li-87Rb mixtures. Using
recent experimental measurements of the triplet scattering lengths for 6Li-87Rb
and 7Li-87Rb mixtures and Feshbach resonances for one combination of atomic
states, we create model potential curves and fine tune them to reproduce the
measured resonances and to predict the location of several experimentally
relevant resonances in Li-Rb collisions. To model 85Rb-87Rb collisions, we use
accurate Rb_2 potentials obtained previously from the analysis of experiments
on 87Rb-87Rb collisions. We find resonances that occur at very low magnetic
fields, below 10 G, which may be useful for entanglement generation in optical
lattices or atom chip magnetic traps.
