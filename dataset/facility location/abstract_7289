In order to provide a firm identification of the newly discovered Galactic
TeV sources, a search for counterparts in a broad band from soft X-ray to soft
gamma-rays is crucial as data in these wavebands allow us to distinguish
between different types of suggested models (for example leptonic versus
hadronic) and, in turn, to disentangle their nature. In this paper, we report
the results of a set of follow-up observations performed by the Swift/X-Ray
Telescope (XRT) on seven sources recently discovered by HESS, in the range from
few hundred GeV to about 10 TeV, during the inner Galaxy survey (Aharonian et
al. 2006). In all, but one case, we detect X-ray sources inside or close-by the
extended TeV emitting region. All these putative X-ray counterparts have
accurate arc-second location and are consistent with being point sources. The
main result of our search is the discovery that three of them are located at
the center of the diffuse radio emission of the supernova remnants, which have
been spatially associated to these TeV objects. HESS J1640-465, HESS J1834-087
and HESS J1813-178 show this evidence, suggestive of a possible Pulsar Wind
Nebula association.
