We have used the new extended A configuration of the IRAM Plateau de Bure
interferometer to study the dense molecular gas in the nucleus of the nearby
spiral galaxy NGC6946 at unprecedented spatial resolution in the HCN(1-0) and
CO(2-1) lines. The gas distribution in the central 50pc has been resolved and
is consistent with a gas ring or spiral driven by the inner 400pc long stellar
bar. For the first time, it is possible to directly compare the location of
(dense) giant molecular clouds with that of (optically) visible HII regions in
space-based images. We use the 3mm continuum and the HCN emission to estimate
in the central 50pc the star formation rates in young clusters that are still
embedded in their parent clouds and hence are missed in optical and near-IR
surveys of star formation. The amount of embedded star formation is about 1.6
times as high as that measured from HII regions alone, and appears roughly
evenly split between ongoing dust-obscured star formation and very young giant
molecular cloud cores that are just beginning to form stars. The build-up of
central mass seems to have continued over the past > 10 Myrs, to have occurred
in an extended (albeit small) volume around the nucleus, and to be closely
related to the presence of an inner bar.
