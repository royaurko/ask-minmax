The detection of high contrast companions at small angular separation appears
feasible in conventional direct images using the self-calibration properties of
interferometric observable quantities. The friendly notion of closure-phase,
which is key to the recent observational successes of non-redundant aperture
masking interferometry used with Adaptive Optics, appears to be one example of
a wide family of observable quantities that are not contaminated by
phase-noise. In the high-Strehl regime, soon to be available thanks to the
coming generation of extreme Adaptive Optics systems on ground based
telescopes, and already available from space, closure-phase like information
can be extracted from any direct image, even taken with a redundant aperture.
These new phase-noise immune observable quantities, called kernel-phases, are
determined a-priori from the knowledge of the geometry of the pupil only.
Re-analysis of archive data acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS
instrument, using this new kernel-phase algorithm demonstrates the power of the
method as it clearly detects and locates with milli-arcsecond precision a known
companion to a star at angular separation less than the diffraction limit.
