Let $\theta$ and $\mu$ denote the location and the size of the mode of a
probability density. We study the joint convergence rates of semirecursive
kernel estimators of $\theta$ and $\mu$. We show how the estimation of the size
of the mode allows to measure the relevance of the estimation of its location.
We also enlighten that, beyond their computational advantage on nonrecursive
estimators, the semirecursive estimators are preferable to use for the
construction on confidence regions.
