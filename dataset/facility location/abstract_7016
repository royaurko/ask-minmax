The self-propulsion of a sphere immersed in a polar liquid or ferrofluid is
studied on the basis of ferrohydrodynamics. In the electrical case an
oscillating charge density located inside the sphere generates an electrical
field which polarizes the fluid. The lag of polarization with respect to the
electrical field due to relaxation generates a time-independent electrical
torque density acting on the fluid causing it to move. The resulting propulsion
velocity of the sphere is calculated in perturbation theory to second order in
powers of the charge density.
