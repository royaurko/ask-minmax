The double polarization (beam-recoil) observables Ox and Oz have been
measured for the reaction gamma p -> K Lambda from threshold production to
Egamma = 1500 MeV. The data were obtained with the linearly polarized beam of
the GRAAL facility. Values for the target asymmetry T could also be extracted
despite the use of an unpolarized target. Analyses of our results by two isobar
models tend to confirm the necessity to include new or poorly known resonances
in the 1900 MeV mass region.
