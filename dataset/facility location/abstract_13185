We apply topological and measure theoretic methods to study the (topological)
singularities of functions defined (on dense subsets of) "data spaces" and
taking values in spaces with nontrivial homology. At least in this book, data
spaces are usually compact manifolds. The purpose is to gain insight into the
numerical conditioning of statistical description, data summarization, and
inference and learning methods. We prove general results that can often be used
to bound below the dimension of the singular set. We apply our topological
results to develop lower bounds on Hausdorff measure of the singular set. We
apply these methods to the study of plane fitting and measuring location of
data on spheres.
  This is just a draft. When the "final" version is finished then I plan to
create a "short" version for publication in a journal.
