TITAN (TRIUMF's Ion Traps for Atomic and Nuclear science) is an online
facility designed to carry out high-precision mass measurements on singly and
highly charged radioactive ions. The TITAN Penning trap has been built and
optimized in order to perform such measurements with an accuracy in the sub
ppb-range. A detailed characterization of the TITAN Penning trap is presented
and a new compensation method is derived and demonstrated, verifying the
performance in the range of sub-ppb.
