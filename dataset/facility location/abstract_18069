The systems V949 Cen, V358 Pup, and V1055 Sco are triples comprised of an
eclipsing binary orbiting with a distant visual component on a much longer
orbit. The first detailed photometric analysis of these interesting systems was
performed using also the archival data from Hipparcos, ASAS, SuperWASP, OMC,
and Pi Of The Sky surveys. The system V358~Pup was also analysed using the
archival ESO spectra and the radial velocities were derived. The analyses of
their light curves revealed the physical properties of the eclipsing
components, while the interferometric data for these systems obtained during
the last century show that the binaries are also weakly gravitationally bounded
with the third components on much longer orbits. The photometry was carried out
with the robotic telescope FRAM (part of the Pierre Auger Cosmic Ray
Observatory), located in Argentina. The BVRI light curves were analysed with
the PHOEBE program, yielding the basic physical parameters of the systems and
their orbits. V949 Cen and V358 Pup were found to be detached systems, while
V1055 Sco is probably a semi-detached one. V358 Pup shows a slow apsidal
motion, while for V1055 Sco we detected some period variation probably due to
the third body in the system, which cannot easily be attributed to the close
visual companion. Therefore, we speculate that V1055 Sco can be a quadruple
system. For V949 Cen a new orbit was computed, having the orbital period of
about 855 yr.
