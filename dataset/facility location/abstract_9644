We derive a self-duality relation for a one-dimensional model of branching
and annihilating random walkers with an even number of offsprings. With the
duality relation and by deriving exact results in some limiting cases involving
fast diffusion we obtain new information on the location and nature of the
phase transition line between an active stationary state (non-zero density) and
an absorbing state (extinction of all particles), thus clarifying some so far
open problems. In these limits the transition is mean-field-like, but on the
active side of the phase transition line the fluctuation in the number of
particles deviates from its mean-field value. We also show that well within the
active region of the phase diagram a finite system approaches the absorbing
state very slowly on a time scale which diverges exponentially in system size.
