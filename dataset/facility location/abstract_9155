We present rotational and astrometric parameters of three millisecond pulsars
located near the center of the globular cluster NGC 6266 (M62) resulting from
timing observations with the Parkes radio telescope. Their accelerations toward
the cluster center yield values of the cluster central density and
mass-to-light ratio consistent with those derived from optical data. The three
pulsars are in binary systems. One (spin period P=5.24 ms) is in a 3.5-day
orbit around a companion of minimum mass 0.2 Msun. The other two millisecond
pulsars (P=3.59 ms and 3.81 ms) have shorter orbital periods (3.4 hr and 5.0
hr) and lighter companions (minimum mass 0.12 Msun and 0.07 Msun respectively).
The pulsar in the closest system is the fifth member of an emerging class of
millisecond pulsars displaying irregular radio eclipses and having a relatively
massive companion. This system is a good candidate for optical identification
of the companion star. The lack of known isolated pulsars in NGC 6266 is also
discussed.
