We report on the detection of a new low-mass stellar companion of HD75289, a
G0V star that harbors one known radial-velocity planet (Udry et al. 2000).
Comparing an image of 2MASS with an image we obtained with SofI at the ESO
3.58m NTT three years later, we detected a co-moving companion located
21.465+-0.023arcsecs (621+-10AU at 29pc) east of HD75289. A second SofI image
taken 10 months later confirmed the common proper motion of HD75289B with its
host star. The infrared spectrum and colors of the companion are consistent
with an M2 to M5 main-sequence star at the distance of HD75289. No further
(sub)stellar companion down to H = 19mag could be detected. With the SofI
detection limit we can rule out additional stellar companions beyond 140AU and
substellar companions with masses m > 0.050Msun from 400AU up to 2000AU.
