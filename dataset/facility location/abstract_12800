The idea of holography in gravity arose from the fact that the entropy of
black holes is given by their surface area. The holography encountered in
gauge/gravity duality has no such relation however; the boundary surface can be
placed at an arbitrary location in AdS space and its area does not give the
entropy of the bulk. The essential issues are also different between the two
cases: in black holes we get Hawking radiation from the `holographic surface'
which leads to the information issue, while in gauge/gravity duality there is
no such radiation from the boundary surface. To resolve the information paradox
we need to show that there are real degrees of freedom at the horizon of the
hole; this is achieved by the fuzzball construction. While the fuzzball has no
interior to the horizon, we argue that an auxiliary spacetime can be
constructed to continue the collective dynamics of fuzzball for times of order
the crossing time; this is an analogue of `complementarity'.
