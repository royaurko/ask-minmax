The effect that dipole-dipole interactions have on the magneto-optical (MO)
properties of magnetoplasmonic dimers is theoretically studied. The specific
plasmonic versus magnetoplasmonic nature of the dimer's metallic components and
their specific location within the dimer plays a crucial role on the
determination of these properties. We find that it is possible to generate an
induced MO activity in a purely plasmonic component, even larger than that of
the MO one, therefore dominating the overall MO spectral dependence of the
system. Adequate stacking of these components may allow obtaining, for specific
spectral regions, larger MO activities in systems with reduced amount of MO
metal and therefore with lower optical losses. Theoretical results are
contrasted and confirmed with experiments for selected structures.
