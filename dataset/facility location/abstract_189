The New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) is a 1 meter vacuum solar telescope
that aims to observe the fine structures on the Sun. The main tasks of NVST are
high resolution imaging and spectral observations, including the measurements
of solar magnetic field. NVST is the primary ground-based facility of Chinese
solar community in this solar cycle. It is located by the Fuxian Lake of
southwest China, where the seeing is good enough to perform high resolution
observations. In this paper, we first introduce the general conditions of
Fuxian Solar Observatory and the primary science cases of NVST. Then, the basic
structures of this telescope and instruments are described in detail. Finally,
some typical high resolution data of solar photosphere and chromosphere are
also shown.
