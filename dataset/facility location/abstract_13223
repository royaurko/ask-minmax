This paper presents the analysis of ionospheric effects in the region close
to the Chelyabinsk meteorite explosion at 03:20UT 2013 February 15 from the
Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics of Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of
Sciences (ISTP SB RAS) EKB radar data, and from the Institute of Geophysics of
Ural Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences (IG UB RAS) PARUS ionosonde data.
Both instruments are located within the IG UB RAS Arti Observatory
approximately 200 km northward from the estimated explosion site. According to
the data obtained, the ionospheric disturbance caused by the meteorite flyby,
explosion, and impact had high dynamics and amplitude. However, it obviously
did not lead to a variation in the ionosphere mean parameters in the region
above the disturbance center during the first 2 hours. Essential effects,
however, were observed at more than 100-200 km from the explosion site and
farther up to 1500 km.
