A critical point symmetry for the prolate to oblate shape phase transition is
introduced, starting from the Bohr Hamiltonian and approximately separating
variables for $\gamma=30^{\rm o}$. Parameter-free (up to overall scale factors)
predictions for spectra and B(E2) transition rates are found to be in good
agreement with experimental data for 194-Pt, which is supposed to be located
very close to the prolate to oblate critical point, as well as for its
neighbours (192-Pt, 196-Pt).
