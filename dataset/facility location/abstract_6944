Finite-context modeling is a powerful tool for compressing and hence for
representing DNA sequences. We describe an algorithm to detect genomic
regularities, within a blind discovery strategy. The algorithm uses information
profiles built using suitable combinations of finite-context models. We used
the genome of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe strain 972 h- for
illustration, unveilling locations of low information content, which are
usually associated with DNA regions of potential biological interest.
