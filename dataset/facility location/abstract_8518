Wavelet analysis is proposed as a new tool for studying the large-scale
structure formation of the universe. To reveal its usefulness, the wavelet
decomposition of one-dimensional cosmological density fluctuations is
performed. In contrast with the Fourier analysis, the wavelet analysis has
advantage of its ability to keep the information for location of local density
peaks in addition to that for their scales. The wavelet decomposition of
evolving density fluctuations with various initial conditions is examined. By
comparing the wavelet analysis with the usual Fourier analysis, we conclude
that the wavelet analysis is promising as the data analysis method for the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey and COBE.
