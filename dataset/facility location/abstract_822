We discuss the possibility of testing the weak currents and, in particular,
the weak magnetism term through the measurement of the electron anti-neutrinos
capture by protons at a low energy beta-beam facility. We analyze the
sensitivity using both the total number of events and the angular distribution
of the positrons emitted in a water Cerenkov detector. We show that the weak
magnetism form factor might be determined with better than several percent
accuracy using the angular distribution. This offers a new way of testing the
Conserved Vector Current hypothesis.
