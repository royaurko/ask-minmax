It is well known that the general transcription factors (GTF) specifically
recognize correct TATA boxes, distinguishing them from many others. Employing
the principles of determinacy analysis (mathematical theory of rules) we
analyzed a fragment of human chromosome 1 DNA sequence and identified specific
genetic markers (IG-markers = Irreducible Genetic markers) in the nearest
proximity to TATAAA motifs. The IG-markers enable determining the exact
location of any TATAAA motif within the investigated DNA fragment. Based on our
data we hypothesize that the GTF recognize the
{\guillemotleft}true{\guillemotright} transcriptional start TATA box by means
of IG-markers. The math method described here is universal and can be used to
find IG-markers that will provide, like a global navigation satellite system,
for the specific location of any distinct sequence motif within larger DNA
sequence content.
