This paper contains the fifth part of the Catalog of Variable Stars created
from the V-band photometric data collected by 9x9 deg camera of the All Sky
Automated Survey. Preliminary list of variable stars found in the fields
located between declination 0 and +28 deg of the northern hemisphere is
presented. 11,509 stars brighter than V=15 were found to be variable (2,482
eclipsing, 1,397 regularly pulsating, 318 Mira and 7,310 other stars).
Automated algorithm taking into account light curve properties (period, fourier
coefficients) and other available data (2MASS colors, IRAS fluxes) was applied
to roughly classify objects. Basic photometric properties are presented in the
tables and thumbnail light curves are made available for reference. All the
photometric data are available over the INTERNET at
