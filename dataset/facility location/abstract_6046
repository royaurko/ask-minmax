We study the phase structure and the chiral limit of $4d$ compact lattice QED
with Wilson fermions (both dynamical and quenched). We use the standard Wilson
gauge action and also a modified one suppressing lattice artifacts. Different
techniques and observables to locate the chiral limit are discussed.
