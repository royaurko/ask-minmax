We study the interplay between synchronization and extinction of a species.
Using a general model we show that under a common external forcing, the species
with a quadratic saturation term in the population dynamics first undergoes
spatial synchronization and then extinction, thereby avoiding the rescue
effect. This is because the saturation term reduces the synchronization time
scale but not the extinction time scale. The effect can be observed even when
the external forcing acts only on some locations provided there is a
synchronizing term in the dynamics. Absence of the quadratic saturation term
can help the species to avoid extinction.
