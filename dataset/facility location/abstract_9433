A bright, long gamma-ray burst (GRB) was detected and localized by the
instruments on board the High Energy Transient Explorer 2 satellite (HETE-2) at
02:44:19.17 UTC (9859.17 s UT) on 2002 August 13. The location was reported to
the GRB Coordinates Network (GCN) about 4 min after the burst. In the prompt
emission, the burst had a duration of approximately 125 s, and more than four
peaks. We analyzed the time-resolved 2-400 keV energy spectra of the prompt
emission of GRB 020813 using the Wide Field X-Ray Monitor (WXM) and the French
Gamma Telescope (FREGATE) in detail. We found that the early part of the burst
(17-52 s after the burst trigger) shows a depletion of low-energy photons below
about 50 keV. It is difficult to explain the depletion with by either
synchrotron self-absorption or Comptonization. One possibility is that the
low-energy depletion may be understood as a mixture of ``jitter'' radiation the
usual synchrotron radiation component.
