In this paper, harmony search algorithm is applied to curriculum-based course
timetabling. The implementation, specifically the process of improvisation
consists of memory consideration, random consideration and pitch adjustment. In
memory consideration, the value of the course number for new solution was
selected from all other course number located in the same column of the Harmony
Memory. This research used the highest occurrence of the course number to be
scheduled in a new harmony. The remaining courses that have not been scheduled
by memory consideration will go through random consideration, i.e. will select
any feasible location available to be scheduled in the new harmony solution.
Each course scheduled out of memory consideration is examined as to whether it
should be pitch adjusted with probability of eight procedures. However, the
algorithm produced results that were not comparatively better than those
previously known as best solution. With proper modification in terms of the
approach in this algorithm would make the algorithm perform better on
curriculum-based course timetabling.
