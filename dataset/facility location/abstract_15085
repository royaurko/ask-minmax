The Hubble Deep Field-North (HDF-N) is one of the best studied extragalactic
fields, and ultra-deep optical, radio, X-ray, and mid-infrared wide-field
images are available for this area. Here we present an 850 um survey around the
HDF-N, covering most of the area imaged by the Advanced Camera for Surveys as a
part of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. Our map has 0.4-4 mJy
sensitivities (1 sigma) over an area ~110 arcmin^2 and there are 45 sources
detected at >3 sigma. After correcting the effects of noise, confusion,
incompleteness, and the Eddington bias using Monte Carlo simulations, we find
that the detected 850 $\mu$m sources with fluxes greater than 2 mJy have a
surface density of 3200^+1900_-1000 deg^-2 and account for about 24% to 34% of
the far-infrared extragalactic background light. Using the deep radio
interferometric image and the deep X-ray image, we are able to accurately
locate ~60% of the bright submillimeter (submm) sources. In addition, by
assuming the Arp 220 spectral energy distribution in the submm and radio, we
estimate millimetric redshifts for the radio detected submm sources, and
redshift lower limits for the ones not detected in the radio. Using the
millimetric redshifts of the radio identified sources and spectroscopic and
optical photometric redshifts for galaxies around the submm positions, we find
a median redshift of 2.0 for 11 possibly identified sources, or a lower limit
of 2.4 for the median redshift of our 4 sigma sample.
