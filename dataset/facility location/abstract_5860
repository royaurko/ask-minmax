Fermi surface of the two-dimensional t-J model is studied using the
variational Monte Carlo method. We study the Gutzwiller projected d-wave
superconducting state with an additional variational parameter t'_v
corresponding to the next-nearest neighbor hopping term. It is found that the
finite t'_v<0 gives the lowest variational energy in the wide range of
hole-doping rates. The obtained momentum distribution function shows that the
Fermi surface deforms spontaneously. It is also shown that the van Hove
singularity is always located very close to the Fermi energy. Using the
Gutzwiller approximation, we show that this spontaneous deformation is due to
the Gutzwiller projection operator or the strong correlation.
