With the increasing emphasis on how mobile technologies are experienced in
everyday life, researchers are increasingly emphasizing the use of in-situ
methods such as Experience Sampling and Day Reconstruction. In our line of
research we explore the concept of Technology-Assisted Reconstruction, in which
passively logged behavior data assist in the later reconstruction of daily
experiences. In this paper we introduce Footprint tracker, a web application
that supports participants in reviewing lifelogs and reconstructing their daily
experiences. We focus on three kinds of data: visual (as captured through
Microsoft's sensecam), location, and context (i.e., SMS and calls received and
made). We describe how Footprint Tracker supports the user in reviewing these
lifelogs and outline a field study that attempts to inquire into whether and
how this data support reconstruction from memory.
