Once mixed in the ambient galactic plane stellar population, young stars are
virtually indiscernible because neither their global photometric properties nor
the presence of nearby gas can help to disentangle them from older ones.
Nevertheless, the study of the RasTyc sample revealed 4 lithium-rich field
stars displaying the same space motion, which are located within a few degrees
from each other on the celestial sphere near the Cepheus-Cassiopeia complex and
at a similar distance from the Sun. Both physical and kinematical indicators
show that all these stars are young, with ages in the range 10-30 Myr. Using
multivariate analysis methods, we selected optical counterparts of ROSAT
All-Sky Survey / XMM-Newton X-ray sources cross-identified with late-type stars
around these 4 young stars. Recent spectroscopic observations of this sample
allowed us to discover additional lithium-rich sources. Our preliminary results
showed that some of them share the same space motion as the 4 young comoving
stars. They have properties rather similar to the members of the TW Hydrae
association, although they seem to be slightly older and are located in the
northern hemisphere. Nearby young stars in the field are of great importance to
understand the recent local history of star formation, as well as to give new
insight into the process of star formation outside standard star-forming
regions and to study the evolution of circumstellar discs.
