We report on the BeppoSAX observations of four "extreme" BL Lacs, selected to
have high synchrotron peak frequencies. All have been detected also in the PDS
band. For 1ES 0120+340, PKS 0548-322 and H 2356-309 the spectrum is well fitted
by a convex broken power-law, thus locating the synchrotron peak around 1 - 4
keV. 1ES 1426+428 presents a flat energy spectral index (alpha_x= 0.92) up to
100 keV, thus constraining the synchrotron peak to lie near or above that
value. For their extreme properties, all sources could be strong TeV emitters.
