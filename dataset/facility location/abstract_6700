Using fluorescent microthermal imaging we have investigated the origin of
"two-step" behavior in I-V curves for a current-carrying YBa_2Cu_3O_x
superconducting bridge. High resolution temperature maps reveal that as the
applied current increases the first step in the voltage corresponds to local
dissipation (hot spot), whereas the second step is associated with onset of
global dissipation throughout the entire bridge. A quantitative explanation of
the experimental results is provided by a simple model for an inhomogeneous
superconductor, assuming that the hot spot nucleates at a location with
slightly depressed superconducting properties.
