The use of a TPC in future collider experiments needs significant research
and development. Within the EUDET program an infrastructure has been designed
and built to allow the efficient testing of TPC prototypes under realistic
conditions. The infrastructure consists of a test beam facility, located at
DESY Hamburg, and a multi-purpose TPC field cage.
