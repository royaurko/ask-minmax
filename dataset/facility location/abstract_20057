The KASCADE-Grande experiment, located at KIT-Karlsruhe, Germany, consists of
a large scintillator array for measurements of charged particles, N_ch, and of
an array of shielded scintillation counters used for muon counting, N_mu.
KASCADE-Grande is optimized for cosmic ray measurements in the energy range 10
PeV to 1000 PeV, thereby enabling the verification of a knee in the iron
spectrum expected at approximately 100 PeV. Exploring the composition in this
energy range is of fundamental importance for understanding the transition from
galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays. Following earlier studies of elemental
spectra reconstructed in the knee energy range from KASCADE data, we have now
extended these measurements to beyond 100 PeV. By analysing the two-dimensional
shower size spectrum N_ch vs. N_mu, we reconstruct the energy spectra of
different mass groups by means of unfolding methods. The procedure and its
results, giving evidence for a knee-like structure in the spectrum of iron
nuclei, will be presented.
