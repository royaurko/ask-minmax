We present an ab-initio study of the spin-resolved optical conductivity of
two-dimensional (2D) group-VIB transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). We
carry out fully-relativistic density-functional-theory calculations combined
with maximally localized Wannier functions to obtain band manifolds at
extremely high resolutions and focus on the photo-response of 2D TMDs to
circularly-polarized light in a wide frequency range. We present extensive
numerical results for monolayer TMDs involving molybdenum and tungsten combined
with sulphur and selenium. Our numerical approach allows us to locate with a
high degree of accuracy the positions of the points in the Brillouin zone that
are responsible for van Hove singularities in the optical response.
Surprisingly, some of the saddle points do not occur exactly along
high-symmetry directions in the Brillouin zone, although they happen to be in
their close proximity.
