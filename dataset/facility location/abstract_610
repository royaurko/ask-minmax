Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory is constructing an Advanced Accelerator
Research and Development facility at New Muon Lab. The cryogenic infrastructure
in support of the initial phase of the facility consists of two Tevatron style
standalone refrigerators, cryogenic distribution system as well as an ambient
temperature pumping system to achieve 2 K operations with supporting
purification systems. During this phase of the project a single Type III plus
1.3 GHz cryomodule was installed, cooled and tested. Design constraints of the
cryomodule required that the cryomodule individual circuits be cooled at
predetermined rates. These constraints required special design solutions to
achieve. This paper describes the initial cooldown and operational experience
of a 1.3 GHz cryomodule using the New Muon Lab cryogenic system.
