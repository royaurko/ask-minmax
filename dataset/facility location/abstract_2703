Results of detailed Monte Carlo energy deposition and radiological studies
performed for the LBNF hadron absorber with the MARS15 code are described. The
model of the entire facility, that includes a pion-production target, focusing
horns, target chase, decay channel, hadron absorber system - all with
corresponding radiation shielding - was developed using the recently
implemented ROOT-based geometry option in the MARS15 code. Both normal
operation and accidental conditions were studied. Results of detailed thermal
calculations with the ANSYS code helped to select the most viable design
options.
