When laser intensity exceeds 10^22W/cm^2, photons with energy above MeV can
be generated from high-order harmonics process in the laser-plasma interaction.
We find that under such laser intensity, QED effect plays a dominating role in
the radiation pattern. Contrast to the gas and relativistic HHG processes, both
the occurrence and energy of gamma-ray emission produced by QED harmonics are
random and QED harmonics are usually not coherent, while the property of high
intensity and ultra-short duration is conserved. Our simulation shows that the
period of gamma-ray train is half of the laser period and the peak intensity is
1.4e22W/cm^2. This new harmonic production with QED effects are crucial to
light-matter interaction in strong field and can be verified in experiments by
10PW laser facilities in the near future.
