The z=2.286 IRAS galaxy F10214+4724 remains one of the most luminous galaxies
in the Universe, despite its gravitational lens magnification. We present
optical and near-infrared spectra of F10214+4724, with clear evidence for three
distinct components: lines of width ~1000 km/s from a Seyfert-II nucleus; <~200
km/s lines which are likely to be associated with star formation; and a broad
~4000 km/s CIII] 1909ang emission line which is blue-shifted by ~1000 km/s with
respect to the Seyfert-II lines. Our study of the Seyfert-II component leads to
several new results, including: (i) From the double-peaked structure in the Ly
alpha line, and the lack of Ly beta, we argue that the Ly alpha photons have
emerged through a neutral column of N_H ~ 2.5 x 10^{25}/m^2, possibly located
within the AGN narrow-line region as argued in several high redshift
radiogalaxies. (ii) The resonant O VI 1032,1036ang doublet (previously
identified as Ly beta) is in an optically thick (1:1) ratio. At face value this
implies an an extreme density (n_e ~ 10^{17}/m^3) more typical of broad line
region clouds. However, we attribute this instead to the damping wings of Ly
beta from the resonant absorption. (iii) A tentative detection of HeII 1086
suggests little extinction in the rest-frame ultraviolet.
