Pedestrian classifiers decide which image windows contain a pedestrian. In
practice, such classifiers provide a relatively high response at neighbor
windows overlapping a pedestrian, while the responses around potential false
positives are expected to be lower. An analogous reasoning applies for image
sequences. If there is a pedestrian located within a frame, the same pedestrian
is expected to appear close to the same location in neighbor frames. Therefore,
such a location has chances of receiving high classification scores during
several frames, while false positives are expected to be more spurious. In this
paper we propose to exploit such correlations for improving the accuracy of
base pedestrian classifiers. In particular, we propose to use two-stage
classifiers which not only rely on the image descriptors required by the base
classifiers but also on the response of such base classifiers in a given
spatiotemporal neighborhood. More specifically, we train pedestrian classifiers
using a stacked sequential learning (SSL) paradigm. We use a new pedestrian
dataset we have acquired from a car to evaluate our proposal at different frame
rates. We also test on a well known dataset: Caltech. The obtained results show
that our SSL proposal boosts detection accuracy significantly with a minimal
impact on the computational cost. Interestingly, SSL improves more the accuracy
at the most dangerous situations, i.e. when a pedestrian is close to the
camera.
