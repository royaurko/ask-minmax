The Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) is a high throughput Fabry-Perot facility
developed specifically to detect and explore the warm, ionized component of the
interstellar medium at high spectral resolution. It began operating at Kitt
Peak, Arizona in 1997 and has recently completed the WHAM Northern Sky Survey
(WHAM-NSS), providing the first global view of the distribution and kinematics
of the warm, diffuse H II in the Milky Way. This H-alpha survey reveals a
complex spatial and kinematic structure in the warm ionized medium and provides
a foundation for studies of the temperature and ionization state of the gas,
the spectrum and strength of the ionizing radiation, and its relationship to
other components of the interstellar medium and sources of ionization and
heating within the Galactic disk and halo. More information about WHAM and the
Survey can be found at http://www.astro.wisc.edu/wham/.
