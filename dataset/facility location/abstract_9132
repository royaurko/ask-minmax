We present CCD UBVI photometry of the intermediate age open cluster NGC 6939
for three TNG-DOLORES fields. The fields A and B cover the center of the
cluster; the third one is located about 30 arcmin away, and is used for field
stars decontamination.
  The V-I, B-V and U-B color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), obtained joining very
different exposures show: i) a Main Sequence (MS) extending down to V = 24,
much deeper (~ 5 magnitudes) than any previous study; ii) a clearly defined
Turn Off (TO) and iii) a well populated Red Giant Clump (RC) at about V = 13.
