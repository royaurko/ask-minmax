Pioneering experiments on production of hypernuclei can be performed with
nuclotron beams on fixed targets, and at the future NICA facility. The
peripheral collisions of relativistic ions are very promising for searching
mutli-strange and exotic hypernuclei which are not easy accessible with other
experimental methods. In these experiments one can also get information on the
Equation of State of hyper-matter around nuclear saturation density at low and
moderate temperatures.
