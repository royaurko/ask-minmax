We present CCD BVI photometry of the old open cluster Berkeley 29, located in
the anticentre direction. Using the synthetic Colour - Magnitude Diagrams
technique we estimate at the same time its age, reddening, distance, and
approximate metallicity using three types of stellar evolutionary tracks. The
best solutions give: age=3.4 or 3.7 Gyr, (m-M)_0 = 15.6 or 15.8 with E(B-V) =
0.13 or 0.10, and metallicity lower than solar (Z=0.006 or 0.004), depending on
the adopted stellar models. Using these derived values, Be 29 turns out to be
the most distant open cluster known, with Galactocentric distance R_GC= 21.4 to
22.6 kpc.
  Hence, Be 29 qualitatively follows both the age-metallicity relation and the
metal abundance gradient typical of Galactic disc objects. The cluster position
and radial velocity, however, appear to link Be 29 to the family of the Canis
Major debris.
