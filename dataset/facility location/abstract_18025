Nairobi is one of the fastest growing metropolitan cities and a major
business and technology powerhouse in Africa. However, Nairobi currently lacks
monitoring technologies to obtain reliable data on traffic and road
infrastructure conditions. In this paper, we investigate the use of mobile
crowdsourcing as means to gather and document Nairobi's road quality
information. We first present the key findings of a city-wide road quality
survey about the perception of existing road quality conditions in Nairobi.
Based on the survey's findings, we then developed a mobile crowdsourcing
application, called CommuniSense, to collect road quality data. The application
serves as a tool for users to locate, describe, and photograph road hazards. We
tested our application through a two-week field study amongst 30 participants
to document various forms of road hazards from different areas in Nairobi. To
verify the authenticity of user-contributed reports from our field study, we
proposed to use online crowdsourcing using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to
verify whether submitted reports indeed depict road hazards. We found 92% of
user-submitted reports to match the MTurkers judgements. While our prototype
was designed and tested on a specific city, our methodology is applicable to
other developing cities.
