One of the main drivers for new waveforms in future 5G wireless communication
systems is to handle efficiently the variety of traffic types and requirements.
In this paper, we introduce a new random access within the standard acquisition
procedures to support sporadic traffic as an enabler of the Internet of Things
(IoT). The major challenge hereby is to cope with the highly asynchronous
access of different devices and to allow transmission of control signaling and
payload "in one shot". We address this challenge by using a waveform design
approach based on bi-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing where transmit
orthogonality is replaced in favor of better temporal and spectral properties.
We show that this approach allows data transmission in frequencies that
otherwise have to remain unused. More precisely, we utilize frequencies
previously used as guard bands, located towards the standard synchronous
communication pipes as well as in between the typically small amount of
resources used by each IoT device. We demonstrate the superiority of this
waveform approach over the conventional random access using a novel
mathematical approach and numerical experiments.
