We have analyzed solar-like oscillations in ~1700 stars observed by the
Kepler Mission, spanning from the main-sequence to the red clump. Using
evolutionary models, we test asteroseismic scaling relations for the frequency
of maximum power (nu_max), the large frequency separation (Delta_nu) and
oscillation amplitudes. We show that the difference of the Delta_nu-nu_max
relation for unevolved and evolved stars can be explained by different
distributions in effective temperature and stellar mass, in agreement with what
is expected from scaling relations. For oscillation amplitudes, we show that
neither (L/M)^s scaling nor the revised scaling relation by Kjeldsen & Bedding
(2011) are accurate for red-giant stars, and demonstrate that a revised scaling
relation with a separate luminosity-mass dependence can be used to calculate
amplitudes from the main-sequence to red-giants to a precision of ~25%. The
residuals show an offset particularly for unevolved stars, suggesting that an
additional physical dependency is necessary to fully reproduce the observed
amplitudes. We investigate correlations between amplitudes and stellar
activity, and find evidence that the effect of amplitude suppression is most
pronounced for subgiant stars. Finally, we test the location of the cool edge
of the instability strip in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram using solar-like
oscillations and find the detections in the hottest stars compatible with a
domain of hybrid stochastically excited and opacity driven pulsation.
