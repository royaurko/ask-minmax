This document describes the Gloss software currently implemented. The
description of the Gloss demonstrator for multi-surface interaction can be
found in D17. The ongoing integration activity for the work described in D17
and D8 constitutes our development of infrastructure for a first smart space.
In this report, the focus is on infrastructure to support the implementation of
location aware services. A local architecture provides a framework for
constructing Gloss applications, termed assemblies, that run on individual
physical nodes. A global architecture defines an overlay network for linking
individual assemblies. Both local and global architectures are under active
development.
