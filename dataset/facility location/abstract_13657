The stability of the $\beta$-equilibrated dense nuclear matter is analyzed
with respect to the thermodynamic stability conditions. Based on the density
dependent M3Y effective nucleon-nucleon interaction, the effects of the nuclear
incompressibility on the proton fraction in neutron stars and the location of
the inner edge of their crusts and core-crust transition density and pressure
are investigated. The high-density behavior of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear
matter satisfies the constraints from the observed flow data of heavy-ion
collisions. The neutron star properties studied using $\beta$-equilibrated
neutron star matter obtained from this effective interaction for a pure
hadronic model agree with the recent observations of the massive compact stars.
The density, pressure and proton fraction at the inner edge separating the
liquid core from the solid crust of neutron stars are determined to be
$\rho_t=$ 0.0938 fm$^{-3}$, P$_t=$ 0.5006 MeV fm$^{-3}$ and x$_{p(t)}=$ 0.0308,
respectively.
