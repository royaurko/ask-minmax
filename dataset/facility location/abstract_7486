Site measurements were collected at Mount John University Observatory in 2005
and 2007 using a purpose-built scintillation detection and ranging system.
$C_n^2(h)$ profiling indicates a weak layer located at 12 - 14 km above sea
level and strong low altitude turbulence extending up to 5 km. During calm
weather conditions, an additional layer was detected at 6 - 8 km above sea
level. $V(h)$ profiling suggests that tropopause layer velocities are nominally
12 - 30 m/s, and near-ground velocities range between 2 -- 20 m/s, dependent on
weather. Little seasonal variation was detected in either $C_n^2(h)$ and $V(h)$
profiles. The average coherence length, $r_0$, was found to be $7 \pm 1$ cm for
the full profile at a wavelength of 589 nm. The average isoplanatic angle,
$\theta_0$, was $1.0 \pm 0.1$ arcsec. The mean turbulence altitude,
$\bar{h_0}$, was found to be $2.0\pm0.7$ km above sea level. No average in the
Greenwood frequency, $f_G$, could be established due to the gaps present in the
\vw\s profiles obtained. A modified Hufnagel-Valley model was developed to
describe the $C_n^2(h)$ profiles at Mount John, which estimates $r_0$ at 6 cm
and $\theta_0$ at 0.9 arcsec. A series of $V(h)$ models were developed, based
on the Greenwood wind model with an additional peak located at low altitudes.
Using the $C_n^2(h)$ model and the suggested $V(h)$ model for moderate ground
wind speeds, $f_G$ is estimated at 79 Hz.
