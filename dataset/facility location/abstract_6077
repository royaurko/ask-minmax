The Debye screening mass for a quark-gluon plasma at high temperature is
calculated to next-to-leading order in the QCD coupling constant from the
correlator of two Polyakov loops. The result agrees with the screening mass
defined by the location of the pole in the gluon propagator as calculated by
Rebhan. It is logarithmically sensitive to nonperturbative effects associated
with the screening of static chromomagnetic fields.
