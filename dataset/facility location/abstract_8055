We present the first deep, optical, wide-field imaging survey of the young
open cluster Collinder 359, complemented by near-infrared follow-up
observations. This study is part of a large programme aimed at examining the
dependence of the mass function on environment and time. We have surveyed 1.6
square degrees in the cluster, in the I and z filters, with the CFH12K camera
on the Canada-France-Hawaii 3.6-m telescope down to completeness and detection
limits in both filters of 22.0 and 24.0 mag, respectively. Based on their
location in the optical (I-z,I) colour-magnitude diagram, we have extracted new
cluster member candidates in Collinder 359 spanning 1.3-0.03 Msun assuming an
age of 60 Myr and a distance of 450 pc for the cluster. We have used the 2MASS
database as well as our own near-infrared photometry to examine the membership
status of the optically-selected cluster candidates. Comparison of the location
of the most massive members in Collinder 359 in a (B-V,V) diagram with
theoretical isochrones suggests that Collinder 359 is older than Alpha Per but
younger than the Pleiades. We discuss the possible relationship between
Collinder 359 and IC 4665 as both clusters harbour similar parameters,
including proper motion, distance, and age.
