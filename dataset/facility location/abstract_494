General problems in analyzing information in a probabilistic database are
considered. The practical difficulties (and occasional advantages) of storing
uncertain data, of using it conventional forward- or backward-chaining
inference engines, and of working with a probabilistic version of resolution
are discussed. The background for this paper is the incorporation of uncertain
reasoning facilities in MRS, a general-purpose expert system building tool.
