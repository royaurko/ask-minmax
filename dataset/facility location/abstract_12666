The preferred shape for the primordial spectrum of curvature perturbations is
determined by performing a Bayesian model selection analysis of cosmological
observations. We first reconstruct the spectrum modelled as piecewise linear in
\log k between nodes in k-space whose amplitudes and positions are allowed to
vary. The number of nodes together with their positions are chosen by the
Bayesian evidence, so that we can both determine the complexity supported by
the data and locate any features present in the spectrum. In addition to the
node-based reconstruction, we consider a set of parameterised models for the
primordial spectrum: the standard power-law parameterisation, the spectrum
produced from the Lasenby & Doran (LD) model and a simple variant
parameterisation. By comparing the Bayesian evidence for different classes of
spectra, we find the power-law parameterisation is significantly disfavoured by
current cosmological observations, which show a preference for the LD model.
