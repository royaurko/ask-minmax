This paper deals with the dynamical behavior of phantom field near five
dimensional charged black hole. We formulate equations of motion for
steady-state spherically symmetric flow of phantom fluids. It is found that
phantom energy accretes onto black holes for $u<0$. Further, the location of
critical point of accretion are evaluated that leads to mass to charge ratio
for 5D charged black hole. This ratio implies that accretion cannot transform a
black hole into a naked singularity. We would like to mention here that this
work is an irreducible extension of 4D charged black hole.
