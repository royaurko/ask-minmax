We present a new approach for electronic control of optical tweezers. The key
technique, called 'space-time-wavelength mapping', involves time-domain
modulation which is translated onto spatial domain by diffraction and enables
direct control of location and polarity of force hot-spots created by Lorentz
force (gradient force). In this study 150 fs optical pulses are dispersed in
time and space to achieve a focused elliptical beam that is ~20 {\mu}m long and
~2 {\mu}m wide. In order to manipulate the intensity gradient along the beam at
the focal spot, we use an electro-optic modulator to modulate power spectral
distribution of the femtosecond beam after temporal dispersion. The
electro-optic modulator is supplied with a chosen RF waveform that dictates the
manipulation of the power spectral distribution. By choosing the appropriate RF
waveform, it is possible to create force fields for cell stretching and
compression as well as multiple hot spots (of > 200 pN force) for attractive or
repulsive forces. We present a detailed theoretical model and simulation
results from a proposed experimental setup. This approach is significantly more
advantageous in terms of flexibility and control, compared to conventional
optical tweezers that require mechanical steering or holographic optical
tweezers that produce undesired 'ghost traps'. The technique can also be
extended to two dimensions and tunable 2-D force field distributions can be
created using 2-D space-time-wavelength mapping.
