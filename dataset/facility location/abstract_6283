On the basis of our mixed-signal simulations we report significant stochastic
resonance induced input-output signal improvement in the double-well system for
aperiodic input types. We used a pulse train with randomised pulse locations
and a band-limited noise with low cut-off frequency as input signals, and
applied a cross-spectral measure to quantify their noise content. We also
supplemented our examinations with simulations in the Schmitt trigger to show
that the signal improvement we obtained is not a result of a potential
filtering effect due to the limited response time of the double-well dynamics.
