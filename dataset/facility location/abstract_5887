Acoustic propagation and scattering in water containing many parallel
air-filled cylinders is studied. Two situations are considered and compared:
(1) wave propagating through the array of cylinders, imitating a traditional
experimental setup, and (2) wave transmitted from a source located inside the
ensemble. We show that waves can be blocked from propagation by disorders in
the first scenario, but the inhibition does not necessarily imply wave
localization. Furthermore, the results reveal the phenomenon of wave
localization in a range of frequencies.
