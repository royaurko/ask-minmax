We investigate the potential of short-baseline experiments in order to
measure the dispersion relation of the (muon) neutrino, with a prospect of
eventually measuring the neutrino mass. As a byproduct, the experiment would
help to constrain parameters of Lorentz-violating effects in the neutrino
sector. The potential of a high-flux laser-accelerated proton beam (e.g., at
the upcoming ELI facility), incident on a thick target composed of a light
element to produce pions, with a subsequent decay to muons and muon-neutrinos,
is discussed. We find a possibility for a muon neutrino mass measurement of
unprecedented accuracy.
