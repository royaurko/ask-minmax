We study the thermal breakage of a discrete one-dimensional string, with open
and fixed ends, in the heavily damped regime. Basing our analysis on the
multidimensional Kramers escape theory, we are able to make analytical
predictions on the mean breakage rate, and on the breakage propensity with
respect to the breakage location on the string. We then support our predictions
with numerical simulations.
