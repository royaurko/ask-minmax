Recent targeted studies of associated HI absorption in radio galaxies are
starting to map out the location, and potential cosmological evolution, of the
cold gas in the host galaxies of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The observed 21
cm absorption profiles often show two distinct spectral-line components:
narrow, deep lines arising from cold gas in the extended disc of the galaxy,
and broad, shallow lines from cold gas close to the AGN (e.g. Morganti et al.
2011). Here, we present results from a targeted search for associated HI
absorption in the youngest and most recently-triggered radio AGN in the local
universe (Allison et al. 2012b). So far, by using the recently commissioned
Australia Telescope Compact Array Broadband Backend (CABB; Wilson et al. 2011),
we have detected two new absorbers and one previously-known system. While two
of these show both a broad, shallow component and a narrow, deep component (see
Fig. 1), one of the new detections has only a single broad, shallow component.
Interestingly, the host galaxies of the first two detections are classified as
gas-rich spirals, while the latter is an early-type galaxy. These detections
were obtained using a spectral-line finding method, based on Bayesian
inference, developed for future large-scale absorption surveys (Allison et al.
2012a).
