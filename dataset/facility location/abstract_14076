We study the effect of surface adsorption of 27 different adatoms on the
electronic and magnetic properties of monolayer black phosphorus using density
functional theory. Choosing a few representative elements from each group,
ranging from alkali metals (group I) to halogens (group VII), we calculate the
band structure, density of states, magnetic moment and effective mass for the
energetically most stable location of the adatom on monolayer phosphorene. We
predict that group I metals (Li, Na, K), and group III adatoms (Al, Ga, In) are
effective in enhancing the n-type mobile carrier density, with group III
adatoms resulting in lower effective mass of the electrons, and thus higher
mobilities. Furthermore we find that the adatoms of transition metals Ti and
Fe, produce a finite magnetic moment (1.87 and 2.31 $\mu_B$) in monolayer
phosphorene, with different band gap and electronic effective masses (and thus
mobilities), which approximately differ by a factor of 10 for spin up and spin
down electrons opening up the possibility for exploring spintronic
applications.
