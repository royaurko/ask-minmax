We study the zeros of the partition function in the complex beta plane
(Fisher's zeros) in SU(2) and SU(3) gluodynamics. We discuss their effects on
the asymptotic behavior of the perturbative series for the average plaquette.
We present new methods to infer the existence of these zeros in region of the
complex beta plane where MC reweighting is not reliable. These methods are
based on the assumption that the plaquette distribution can be approximated by
a phi^4 type distribution. We give new estimates of the locations for a 4^4
lattice. For SU(2), we found zeros at beta =2.18(1) \pm i0.18(2) (which differs
from previous estimates), and at beta =2.18(1) \pm i0.22(2). For SU(3), we
confirm beta =5.54(2)\pm i0.10(2) and found additional zeros at beta
=5.54(2)\pm i0.16(2). Some of the technical material can be found in recent
preprints, in the following we emphasize the motivations (why it is important
to know the locations of the zeros) and the challenges (why it is difficult to
locate the zeros when the volume increases)
