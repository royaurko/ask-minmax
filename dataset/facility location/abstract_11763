This paper presents the first distance measurement to the massive,
semi-detached, eclipsing binary LMC-SC1-105, located in the LH 81 association
of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Previously determined parameters of the
system are combined with new near-infrared photometry and a new temperature
analysis to constrain the reddening toward the system, and determine a distance
of 50.6+/-1.6 kpc (corresponding to a distance modulus of 18.52+/-0.07 mag), in
agreement with previous eclipsing binary measurements. This is the sixth
distance measurement to an eclipsing binary in the LMC, although the first to
an O-type system. We thus demonstrate the suitability of O-type eclipsing
binaries (EBs) as distance indicators. We suggest using bright, early-type EBs
to measure distances along different sight lines, as an independent way to map
the depth of the LMC and resolve the controversy about its three-dimensional
structure.
