We demonstrate the existence of fundamental and dipole interface solitons in
one-dimensional thermal nonlinear media with a step in linear refractive index.
Fundamental interface solitons are found to be always stable and the stability
of dipole interface solitons depends on the difference in linear refractive
index. The mass center of interface solitons always locates in the side with
higher index. Two intensity peaks of dipole interface solitons are unequal
except some specific conditions, which is different from their counterparts in
uniform thermal media.
