We present the first study of the formation and dissipation of current sheets
at electron scales in a wave-driven, weakly collisional, 3D kinetic turbulence
simulation. We investigate the relative importance of dissipation associated
with collisionless damping via resonant wave-particle interactions versus
dissipation in small-scale current sheets in weakly collisional plasma
turbulence. Current sheets form self-consistently from the wave-driven
turbulence, and their filling fraction is well correlated to the electron
heating rate. However, the weakly collisional nature of the simulation
necessarily implies that the current sheets are not significantly dissipated
via Ohmic dissipation. Rather, collisionless damping via the Landau resonance
with the electrons is sufficient to account for the measured heating as a
function of scale in the simulation, without the need for significant Ohmic
dissipation. This finding suggests the possibility that the dissipation of the
current sheets is governed by resonant wave-particle interactions and that the
locations of current sheets correspond spatially to regions of enhanced
heating.
