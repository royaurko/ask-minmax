We study the dynamics of an active Brownian particle with a nonlinear
friction function located in a spatial cubic potential. For strong but finite
damping, the escape rate of the particle over the spatial potential barrier
shows a nonmonotonic dependence on the noise intensity. We relate this behavior
to the fact that the active particle escapes from a limit cycle rather than
from a fixed point and that a certain amount of noise can stabilize the sojourn
of the particle on this limit cycle.
