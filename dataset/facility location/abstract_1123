Study of high multiplicity events in proton-proton interactions is carried
out at the U-70 accelerator (IHEP, Protvino). These events are extremely rare.
Usually, Monte Carlo codes underestimate topological cross sections in this
region. The gluon dominance model (GDM) was offered to describe them. It is
based on QCD and a phenomenological scheme of a hadronization stage. This model
indicates a recombination mechanism of hadronization and a gluon fission.
Future program of the SVD Collaboration is aimed at studying a long-standing
puzzle of excess soft photon yield and its connection with high multiplicity at
the U-70 and Nuclotron facility at JINR, Dubna.
