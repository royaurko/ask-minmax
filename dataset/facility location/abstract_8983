The detection of TeV gamma-rays from the blazar H 1426+428 at an integral
flux level of (4 +- 2(stat) +- 1(syst)) 10^(-12) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1) above 1 TeV
with the HEGRA imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope system is reported. H
1426+428 is located at a redshift of z=0.129, which makes it the most distant
source detected in TeV gamma-rays so far. The TeV radiation is expected to be
strongly absorbed by the diffuse extragalactic background radiation (DEBRA).
The observed energy spectrum of TeV photons is in good agreement with an
intrinsic power law spectrum of the source ~E^(-1.9) corrected for DEBRA
absorption. Statistical errors as well as uncertainties about the intrinsic
source spectrum, however, do not permit strong statements about the density of
the DEBRA infrared photon field.
