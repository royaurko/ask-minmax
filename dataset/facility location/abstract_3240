The first results of our ongoing near-infrared (NIR) survey of the variable
red giants in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using the Infrared Survey Facility
(IRSF) and the SIRIUS infrared camera, are presented. Many very red stars were
detected and found that most of them are variables. In the observed
colour-magnitude diagram ($J-K, K$) and the stellar $K$ magnitude distribution,
the tip of the first giant branch (TRGB), where helium burning in the core
starts, is clearly seen. Apart from the genuine AGB variables, we found many
variable stars at luminosities around the TRGB. From this result, we infer that
a substantial fraction of them are RGB variables.
