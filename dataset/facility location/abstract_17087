Results from optical photometric observations of the pre-main sequence star
GM Cep are reported in the paper. The star is located in the field of the young
open cluster Trumpler 37 - a region of active star formation. GM Cep shows a
large amplitude rapid variability interpreted as a possible outburst from EXor
type in previous studies. Our data from BVRI CCD photometric observations of
the star are collected from June 2008 to February 2011 in Rozhen observatory
(Bulgaria) and Skinakas observatory (Crete, Greece). A sequence of sixteen
comparison stars in the field of GM Cep was calibrated in the BVRI bands. Our
photometric data for a 2.5 years period show a high amplitude variations (Delta
V ~ 2.3m) and two deep minimums in brightness are observed. The analysis of
collected multicolor photometric data shows the typical of UX Ori variables a
color reversal during the minimums in brightness. On the other hand, high
amplitude rapid variations in brightness typical for the Classical T Tauri
stars also present on the light curve of GM Cep. Comparing our results with
results published in the literature, we conclude that changes in brightness are
caused by superposition of both: (1) magnetically channeled accretion from the
circumstellar disk, and (2) occultation from circumstellar clouds of dust or
from features of a circumstellar disk.
