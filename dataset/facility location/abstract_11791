The Ising approximation of the Heisenberg model in a strong magnetic field,
with two-, and three-spin exchange interactions are studied on a Husimi
lattice. This model can be considered as an approximation of the third layer of
3He absorbed on the surface of graphite (kagome lattice). Using dynamic
approach we have found exact recursion relation for the partition function. For
different values of exchange parameters and temperature the diagrams of
magnetization are plotted and showed that magnetization properties of the model
vary from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic depending from the value of model
parameters. For antiferromagnetic case magnetization plateau at 1/3 of
saturation field is obtained. Lyapunov exponent for recursion relation are
considered and showed absents of bifurcation points in thermodynamic limit. The
Yang-Lee zeros are analyzed in terms of neutral fixed points and showed that
Yang-Lee zeros of the model are located on the arcs of the circle with the
radius R=1.
