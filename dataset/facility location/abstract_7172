A catalog including a set of the most recent Color Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs)
is presented for a sample of 61 Galactic Globular Clusters (GGCs). We used this
data-base to perform an homogeneous systematic analysis of the evolved
sequences (namely, Red Giant Branch (RGB), Horizontal Branch (HB) and
Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)). Based on this analysis, we present: (1) a new
procedure to measure the level of the ZAHB (V_ZAHB) and an homogeneous set of
distance moduli obtained adopting the HB as standard candle; (2) an independent
estimate for RGB metallicity indicators and new calibrations of these
parameters in terms of both spectroscopic ([Fe/H]_CG97) and global metallicity
([M/H], including also the alpha-elements enhancement). The set of equations
presented can be used to simultaneously derive a photometric estimate of the
metal abundance and the reddening from the morphology and the location of the
RGB in the (V,B-V)-CMD. (3) the location of the RGB-Bump (in 47 GGCs) and the
AGB-Bump (in 9 GGCs). The dependence of these features on the metallicity is
discussed. We find that by using the latest theoretical models and the new
metallicity scales the earlier discrepancy between theory and observations
(~0.4 mag) completely disappears.
