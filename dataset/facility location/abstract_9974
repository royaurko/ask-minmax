Density-functional calculations are used to study various plausible
structures of the wurtzite InN $(0001)$ and $(000{\bar 1})$ surfaces. These
structures include the unreconstructed surfaces, surfaces with monolayers of In
or N, several possible coverages and locations of In or N adatoms and
vacancies. The stable structure of the $(0001)$ surface under N-rich conditions
is the unreconstructed, In-terminated, surface, while under In-rich conditions
the stable surface has a 3/4 monolayer of In atoms. The stable structure of the
InN $(000{\bar 1})$ surface corresponds to a full monolayer of In atoms in the
atop sites (directly above the N atoms) over the entire range of accessible In
(or N) chemical potential. The atomic structures of the low-energy structures
are also discussed.
