The multi-frequency `Sedentary Survey' is a deep, statistically complete,
radio flux limited sample comprising 150 BL Lacertae objects distinguished by
their extremely high X-ray to radio flux ratio, ranging from five hundred to
over five thousand times that of typical BL Lacs discovered in radio surveys.
This paper presents the final, 100% identified, catalog together with the
optical, X-ray and broad-band SEDs constructed combining literature
multi-frequency data with non-simultaneous optical observations and BeppoSAX
X-ray data, when available. The SEDs confirm that the peak of the synchrotron
power in these objects is located at very high energies. BeppoSAX wide band
X-ray observations show that, in most cases, the X-ray spectra are convex and
well described by a logarithmic parabola model peaking (in a E f(E) vs E
representation) between 0.02 to several keV. Owing to the high synchrotron
energies involved most of the sources in the catalog are likely to be TeV
emitters, with the closest and brightest ones probably detectable by the
present generation of Cherenkov telescopes. The optical spectrum of about one
fourth of the sources is totally featureless. Because this implies that the
non-thermal emission must be well above that of the host galaxy, these objects
are likely to be the most powerful sources in the survey and therefore be
examples of the yet unreported high radio luminosity-high energy peaked BL
Lacs.
