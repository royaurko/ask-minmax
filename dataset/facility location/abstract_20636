We propose to detect and to study neutrino neutral current coherent
scattering off atomic nuclei with a two-phase emission detector using liquid
xenon as a working medium. Expected signals and backgrounds are calculated for
two possible experimental sites: Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant in the Russian
Federation and Spallation Neutron Source at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
in the USA. Both sites have advantages as well as limitations. However the
experiment looks feasible at either location. Preliminary design of the
detector and supporting R&D program are discussed.
