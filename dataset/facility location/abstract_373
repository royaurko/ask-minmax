Recently, the Turkic Accelerator Complex (TAC) is proposed as a regional
facility for accelerator based fundamental and applied research. The complex
will include linac on ring type electron-positron collider as a phi, charm and
tau factory, linac based free electron laser (FEL), ring based third generation
synchrotron radiation (SR) source and a few GeV proton accelerator. Preliminary
estimations show that integral luminosity of hundred inverse femto-barns per
year can be achieved for factory options. The FEL facility is planned to obtain
laser beam between IR and soft X-ray region. In addition, SR facility will
produce photon beams in UV and X-ray region. The proton accelerator will give
opportunity to produce muon and neutron beams for applied research. The current
status of the conceptual study of the complex is presented.
