A small decaying sunspot was observed with the Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT)
on Tenerife and the Japanese Hinode satellite. We obtained full Stokes scans in
several wavelengths covering different heights in the solar atmosphere. Imaging
time series from Hinode and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) complete our
data sets. The spot is surrounded by a moat flow, which persists also on that
side of the spot where the penumbra already had disappeared. Close to the spot,
we find a chromospheric location with downflows of more than 10 km/s without
photospheric counterpart. The height dependence of the vertical component of
the magnetic field strength is determined in two different ways that yielded
different results in previous investigations. Such a difference still exists in
our present data, but it is not as pronounced as in the past.
