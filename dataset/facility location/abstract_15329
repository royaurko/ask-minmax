The kinematic structure of a sample of planetary nebulae, consisting of 23
[WR] central stars, 21 weak emission line stars (wels) and 57 non-emission line
central stars, is studied. The [WR] stars are shown to be surrounded by
turbulent nebulae, a characteristic shared by some wels but almost completely
absent from the non-emission line stars. The fraction of objects showing
turbulence for non-emission-line stars, wels and [WR] stars is 7%, 24% and 91%,
respectively. The [WR] stars show a distinct IRAS 12-micron excess, indicative
of small dust grains, which is not found for wels. The [WR]-star nebulae are on
average more centrally condensed than those of other stars. On the
age-temperature diagram, the wels are located on tracks of both high and low
stellar mass, while [WR] stars trace a narrow range of intermediate masses.
Emission-line stars are not found on the cooling track. One group of wels may
form a sequence wels--[WO] stars with increasing temperature. For the other
groups both the wels and the [WR] stars appear to represent several,
independent evolutionary tracks. We find a discontinuity in the [WR] stellar
temperature distribution and suggest different evolutionary sequences above and
below the temperature gap. One group of cool [WR] stars has no counterpart
among any other group of PNe and may represent binary evolution. A prime factor
distinguishing wels and [WR] stars appears to be stellar luminosity. We find no
evidence for an increase of nebular expansion velocity with time.
