We have identified 313 nearby galaxies that display the infrared signature of
black hole activity. Of these, eleven lie within a distance of 11 Mpc. Using
the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) All-Sky Release Source Catalog,
we examine the IR colors of a sample of known nearby dwarf galaxies in order to
identify both unobscured (type 1) and obscured (type 2) active galactic nuclei
in these low-mass systems. We estimate the stellar and black hole masses for
our nearby dwarf galaxy sample and find that activity is detected in galaxies
with stellar masses from 10^5 to 10^9 M_sun and that this activity is due to
black holes with masses in the range 10^2-10^6 M_sun. The black hole masses
probed here are several orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported
for centrally located massive black holes. We examine the stellar mass versus
black hole mass relationship in this low galaxy mass regime, and find that the
existing relation extends to these lower masses. These findings indicate that
central massive black holes are present in low-mass galaxies and in the Local
Universe. These results provide new impetus for follow up dynamical studies of
quiescent black holes in local dwarf galaxies.
