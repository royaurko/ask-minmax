Recently, the PVLAS collaboration has reported an anomalously large rotation
of the polarization of light in the presence of a magnetic field. As a possible
explanation they consider the existence of a light pseudoscalar particle
coupled to two photons. In this note, we propose a method of independently
testing this result by using a high-energy photon regeneration experiment (the
X-ray analogue of "invisible light shining through walls") using the
synchrotron X-rays from a free-electron laser (FEL). With such an experiment
the region of parameter space implied by PVLAS could be probed in a matter of
minutes.
