The mass-loss process in Mira stars probably occurs in an asymmetric way
where dust can form in inhomogeneous circumstellar molecular clumps. Following
asymmetries along the pulsation cycle can give us clues about these mass-loss
processes. We imaged the Mira star X Hya and its environnement at different
epochs to follow the evolution of the morphology in the continuum and in the
molecular bands. We observed X Hya with AMBER in J-H-K at low resolution at two
epochs. We modelled squared visibilities with geometrical and physical models.
We also present imaging reconstruction results obtained with MiRA and based on
the physical a priori images. We report on the angular scale change of X Hya
between the two epochs. 1D CODEX profiles allowed us to understand and model
the spectral variation of squared visibilities and constrain the stellar
parameters. Reconstructed model-dependent images enabled us to reproduce
closure phase signals and the azimuthal dependence of squared visibilities.
They show evidence for material inhomogeneities located in the immediate
environment of the star.
