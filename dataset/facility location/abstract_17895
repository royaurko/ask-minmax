Our work is based on the "Bluedisk" project, a program to map the neutral gas
in a sample of 25 HI-rich spirals and a similar number of control galaxies with
the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). In this paper we focus on the
HI properties of the galaxies in the environment of our targeted galaxies. In
total, we extract 65 galaxies from the WSRT cubes with stellar masses between
$10^8M_{\odot}$ and $10^{11}M_{\odot}$. Most of these galaxies are located on
the same HI mass-size relation and "HI-plane" as normal spiral galaxies. We
find that companions around HI-rich galaxies tend to be HI-rich as well and to
have larger R90,HI/R50,HI. This suggests a scenario of "HI conformity", similar
to the colour conformity found by Weinmann et al. (2006): galaxies tend to
adopt the HI properties of their neighbours. We visually inspect the outliers
from the HI mass-size relation and galaxies which are offset from the HI plane
and find that they show morphological and kinematical signatures of recent
interactions with their environment. We speculate that these outliers have been
disturbed by tidal or ram-pressure stripping processes, or in a few cases, by
accretion events.
