Half-space depth (also called Tukey depth or location depth) is one of the
most commonly studied data depth measures because it possesses many desirable
properties for data depth functions. The data depth contours bound regions of
increasing depth. For the sample case, there are two competing definitions of
contours: the rank-based contours and the cover-based contours.
  In this paper, we present three dynamic algorithms for maintaining the
half-space depth of points and contours: The first maintains the half-space
depth of a single point in a data set in $O(\log n)$ time per update
(insertion/deletion) and overall linear space. By maintaining such a data
structure for each data point, we present an algorithm for dynamically
maintaining the rank-based contours in $O(n\cdot\log n)$ time per update and
overall quadratic space. The third dynamic algorithm maintains the cover-based
contours in $O(n\cdot \log^2 n)$ time per update and overall quadratic space.
  We also augment our first algorithm to maintain the local cover-based
contours at data points while maintaining the same complexities. A corollary of
this discussion is a strong structural result of independent interest
describing the behavior of dynamic cover-based contours near data points.
