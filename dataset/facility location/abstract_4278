From the analysis of superhump eclipses of Z Cha it is found that the
location of the superhump light source coincides with the overflowing parts of
the stream. This implies that superhumps are due to modulated mass transfer
rate resulting in periodically enhanced dissipation of the kinetic energy of
the stream.
