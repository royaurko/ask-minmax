Time evolution of the parametric X-Ray radiation, produced by a relativistic
charged particle passing through a crystal, is studied. The most attention is
given to the cases when the radiation lasts much longer (t_{PXR} ~0.1 ns) than
the the time t_p of the particle flight through the crystal (t_p ~ 1 ps). It is
shown that such long duration of the radiation makes possible the detailed
experimental investigation of the complicated time structure of the parametric
X-ray pulses, generated by electron bunches, which are available with modern
acceleration facilities.
