Three different algorithms used for eye pupil location were described and
tested. Algorithm efficiency comparison was based on human faces images taken
from the BioID database. Moreover all the eye localisation methods were
implemented in a dedicated application supporting eye movement based computer
control. In this case human face images were acquired by a webcam and processed
in a real-time.
