We present high-resolution, long-slit spectroscopic observations of five
compact ($\leq$ 10 arcsec) planetary nebulae located close to the galactic
bulge region and for which no high spatial resolution images are available. The
data have been drawn from the San Pedro M\'artir kinematic catalogue of
galactic planetary nebulae (L\'opez et al. 2012). The central star in four of
these objects (M 1-32, M 2-20, M 2-31 and M 3-15) is of WR-type and the fifth
object (M 2-42) has a wels type nucleus. These observations reveal the presence
in all of them of a dense and thick equatorial torus-like component and
high-speed, collimated, bipolar outflows. The code SHAPE is used to investigate
the main morpho-kinematic characteristics and reproduce the 3-D structure of
these objects assuming a cylindrical velocity field for the bipolar outflows
and a homologous expansion law for the torus/ring component. The deprojected
expansion velocities of the bipolar outflows are found to be in the range of 65
to 200 km $\rm{s^{-1}}$, whereas the torus/ring component shows much slower
expansion velocities, in the range of 15 to 25 km $\rm{s^{-1}}$. It is found
that these planetary nebulae have very similar structural components and the
differences in their emission line spectra derive mostly from their different
projections on the sky. The relation of their morpho-kinematic characteristics
with the WR-type nuclei deserves further investigation.
