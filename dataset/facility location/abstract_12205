Motivated by experiments on ion irradiated graphene, we compute the
resistivity of graphene with dilute impurities. In the local moment regime we
employ the perturbation theory up to third order in the exchange coupling to
determine the behavior at high temperatures within the Kondo model. Resistivity
due to charge fluctuations is obtained within the mean field approach on the
Anderson impurity model. Due to the linear spectrum of the graphene the Kondo
behavior is shown to depend on the gate voltage applied. The location of the
impurity on the graphene sheet is an important variable determining its effect
on the Kondo scale and resistivity. Our results show that for chemical
potential nearby the node the charge fluctuations is responsible for the
observed temperature dependence of resistivity while away from the node the
spin fluctuations take over. Quantitative agreement with experimental data is
achieved if the energy of the impurity level varies linearly with the chemical
potential.
