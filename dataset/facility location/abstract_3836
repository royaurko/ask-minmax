We present a study on the discoverability of temporarily captured orbiters
(TCOs) by present day or near-term anticipated ground-based and space-based
facilities. TCOs (Granvik et al. 2012) are potential targets for spacecraft
ren- dezvous or human exploration (Chyba et al. 2014) and provide an
opportunity to study the population of the smallest asteroids in the solar
system. We find that present day ground-based optical surveys such as
Pan-STARRS and ATLAS can discover the largest TCOs over years of operation. A
targeted survey conducted with the Subaru telescope can discover TCOs in the
0.5 m to 1.0 m diameter size range in about 5 nights of observing. Furthermore,
we discuss the application of space-based infrared surveys, such as NEOWISE,
and ground-based meteor detection systems such as CAMS, CAMO and ASGARD in
discovering TCOs. These systems can detect TCOs but at a uninteresting rate.
Finally, we discuss the application of bi-static radar at Arecibo and Green
Bank to discover TCOs. Our radar simulations are strongly dependent on the
rotation rate distribution of the smallest asteroids but with an optimistic
distribution we find that these systems have > 80% chance of detecting a > 10
cm diameter TCO in about 40 h of operation.
