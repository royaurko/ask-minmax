Using time-resolved measurements of local magnetization in the molecular
magnet Mn12-ac, we report studies of the propagation of magnetic avalanches
(fast magnetization reversals) that originate from points inside the crystals
rather than at the edges. The curved nature of the fronts produced by
avalanches is reflected in the time-of-arrival at micro-Hall sensors placed at
the surface of the sample. Assuming that the avalanche interface is a spherical
bubble that grows with a radius proportional to time, we are able to locate the
approximate ignition point of each avalanche in a two-dimensional cross-section
of the crystal. For the samples used in these studies, avalanches in a given
crystal are found to originate in a small region with a radius of roughly 150
microns.
