We have calculated the Gamow-Teller strength distributions for the ground
states and first excited states in 55Co and 56Ni. These calculations have been
performed by shell model diagonalization in the pf shell using the KB3
interaction. The Gamow-Teller distributions are used to calculate the electron
capture rates for typical presupernova conditions. Our 55Co rate is noticeably
smaller than the presently adopted rate as it is dominated by weak low-lying
transitions rather than the strong Gamow-Teller (GT) resonance which is located
at a higher excitation energy in the daughter than usually parametrized.
Although our 56Ni rate agrees with the presently adopted rate, we do not
confirm the conventional parametrization of the GT centroid. Our results
support general trends suggested on the basis of shell model Monte Carlo
calculations.
