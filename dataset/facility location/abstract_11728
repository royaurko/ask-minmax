The Calar Alto Observatory, located at 2168m height above the sea level in
continental Europe, holds a signi?cant number of astronomical telescopes and
experiments, covering a large range of the electromagnetic domain, from
gamma-ray to near-infrared. It is a very well characterized site, with
excellent logistics. Its main telescopes includes a large suite of instruments.
At the present time, new instruments, namely CAFE, PANIC and Carmenes, are
under development. We are also planning a new operational scheme in order to
optimize the observatory resources.
