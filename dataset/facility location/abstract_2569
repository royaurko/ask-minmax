We study channeling radiation from electron beams with energies under 100
MeV. We introduce a phenomenological model of dechanneling, correct
non-radiative transition rates from thermal scattering, and discuss in detail
the population dynamics in low order bound states. These are used to revisit
the X-ray properties measured at the ELBE facility in Forschungszentrum
Dresden-Rosenstock (FZDR), extract parameters for dechanneling states, and
obtain satisfactory agreement with measured photon yields. The importance of
rechanneling phenomena in thick crystals is emphasized. The model is then used
to calculate the expected X-ray energies, linewidths and brilliance for
forthcoming channeling radiation experiments at Fermilab's ASTA photoinjector.
