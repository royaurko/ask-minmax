The DREsden Sodium facility for DYNamo and thermohydraulic studies (DRESDYN)
is intended as a platform both for large scale experiments related to geo- and
astrophysics as well as for experiments related to thermohydraulic and safety
aspects of liquid metal batteries and liquid metal fast reactors. The most
ambitious projects in the framework of DRESDYN are a homogeneous hydromagnetic
dynamo driven solely by precession and a large Taylor-Couette type experiment
for the combined investigation of the magnetorotational instability and the
Tayler instability. In this paper we give a short summary about the ongoing
preparations and delineate the next steps for the realization of DRESDYN.
