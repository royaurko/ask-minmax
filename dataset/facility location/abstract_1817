Differential cross sections for exclusive 16O(e,e'pp)14C processes are
computed within a distorted-wave framework which includes central short-range
correlations and intermediate \Delta+ excitations. The cross sections are
compared to high-resolution data from the MAMI facility at Mainz for a central
energy and momentum transfer of \omega=215 MeV and q=316 MeV respectively. A
fair agreement between the numerical calculations and data is reached when
using spectroscopic information extracted from a 15N(d,3He)14C experiment. The
comparison between the calculations and the data provides additional evidence
that short-range correlations exclusively affect nucleon pairs with a small
center-of-mass momentum residing in a relative S state.
