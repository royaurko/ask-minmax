Cosmic rays scatter off magnetic irregularities (Alfven waves) with which
they are resonant, that is waves of wavelength comparable to their gyroradii.
These waves may be generated either by the cosmic rays themselves, if they
stream faster than the Alfven speed, or by sources of MHD turbulence. Waves
excited by streaming cosmic rays are ideally shaped for scattering, whereas the
scattering efficiency of MHD turbulence is severely diminished by its
anisotropy. We show that MHD turbulence has an indirect effect on cosmic ray
propagation by acting as a damping mechanism for cosmic ray generated waves.
The hot (``coronal'') phase of the interstellar medium is the best candidate
location for cosmic ray confinement by scattering from self-generated waves. We
relate the streaming velocity of cosmic rays to the rate of turbulent
dissipation in this medium, for the case in which turbulent damping is the
dominant damping mechanism. We conclude that cosmic rays with up to 10^2 GeV
could not stream much faster than the Alfven speed, but that 10^6 GeV cosmic
rays would stream unimpeded by self-generated waves unless the coronal gas were
remarkably turbulence-free.
