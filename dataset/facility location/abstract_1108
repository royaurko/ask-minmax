The most ambitious project within the DREsden Sodium facility for DYNamo and
thermohydraulic studies (DRESDYN) at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf
(HZDR) is the set-up of a precession-driven dynamo experiment. After discussing
the scientific background and some results of water pre-experiments and
numerical predictions, we focus on the numerous structural and design problems
of the machine. We also outline the progress of the building's construction,
and the status of some other experiments that are planned in the framework of
DRESDYN.
