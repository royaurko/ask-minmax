We have succeeded in synthesizing single-phase polycrystalline samples of
oxygen-deficient oxypnictide superconductors, LnFeAsO1-y (Ln: lanthanide
elements) with Ln=La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb and Dy using high-pressure
synthesis technique. It is found out that the synthesis pressure is the most
important parameter for synthesizing single-phase samples, in particular for
the heavier Ln?s, such as Tb and Dy. The lattice parameters systematically
decrease with the atomic number of Ln, reflecting the shrinkage of Ln ionic
radius. For the lighter Ln?s (La, Ce, Pr, Nd), Tc increases monotonously with
decreasing the lattice parameters from 26K for Ln=La to 54K for Ln=Nd, then
stays at the constant value around 53K for the heavier counterpart (Nd, Sm, Gd,
Tb and Dy). The results suggest the intimate relationship between the crystal
structural parameters and the superconductivity on the one hand, as well as the
possible existence of the inherent maximum Tc on the other, which is located
around 50 K in the LnFeAsO based materials.
