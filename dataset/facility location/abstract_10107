Quasiequilibrium sequences of binary neutron stars are numerically calculated
in the framework of the Isenberg-Wilson-Mathews (IWM) approximation of general
relativity. The results are presented for both rotation states of synchronized
spins and irrotational motion, the latter being considered as the realistic one
for binary neutron stars just prior to the merger. We assume a polytropic
equation of state and compute several evolutionary sequences of binary systems
composed of different-mass stars as well as identical-mass stars with adiabatic
indices gamma=2.5, 2.25, 2, and 1.8. From our results, we propose as a
conjecture that if the turning point of binding energy (and total angular
momentum) locating the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) is found in
Newtonian gravity for some value of the adiabatic index gamma_0, that of the
ADM mass (and total angular momentum) should exist in the IWM approximation of
general relativity for the same value of the adiabatic index.
