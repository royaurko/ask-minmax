For a RS model, with SM fields in the bulk and the Higgs boson on the
TeV-brane, we suggest two specific structures for the Yukawa couplings, one
based on a permutation symmetry and the other on the Universal Strength of
Yukawa couplings hypothesis (USY). In USY, all Yukawa couplings have equal
strength and the difference in the Yukawa structure lies in some complex phase.
In both scenarios, all Yukawa couplings are of the same order of magnitude.
Thus, the main features of the fermion hierarchies are explained through the RS
geometrical mechanism, and not because some Yukawa coupling is extremely small.
We find that the RS model is particularly appropriate to incorporate the
suggested Yukawa configurations. Indeed, the RS geometrical mechanism of
fermion locations along the extra dimension, combined with the two Yukawa
scenarios, reproduces all the present experimental data on fermion masses and
mixing angles. It is quite remarkable that in the USY case, only two complex
phases of definite value +-Pi/2 are sufficient to generate the known neutrino
mass differences, while at same time, permitting large leptonic mixing in
agreement with experiment.
