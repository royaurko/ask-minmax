Time-series data taken with the Hubble Space Telescope of three fields
covering the central part of the globular cluster M22 have been analyzed in
search of variable objects. We report identification of 11 periodic variables
of which 8 are new discoveries. The sample includes 5 certain contact binaries
as well as 1 SX Phe star. Two objects with periods longer than 1 day are
preliminarily classified as either spotted variables of BY Dra type or
ellipsoidal variables. The most unusual of the identified variables, M22_V11,
has I_C=19.9 and is located far to the red of the main sequence in the cluster
color-magnitude diagram. It shows variability with a period as short as P=0.066
days or alternatively with P=0.132 days. We propose that it may be an
ellipsoidal variable harboring a degenerate component.
