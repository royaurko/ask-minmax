Author suggests and researches a new revolutionary method for changing the
climates of entire countries or portions thereof, obtaining huge amounts of
cheap water and energy from the atmosphere. In this paper is presented the idea
of cheap artificial inflatable mountains, which may cardinally change the
climate of a large region or country. Additional benefits: The potential of
tapping large amounts of fresh water and energy. The mountains are inflatable
semi-cylindrical constructions from thin film (gas bags) having heights of up
to 3 - 5 km. They are located perpendicular to the main wind direction.
Encountering these artificial mountains, humid air (wind) rises to crest
altitude, is cooled and produces rain (or rain clouds). Many natural mountains
are sources of rivers, and other forms of water and power production - and
artificial mountains may provide these services for entire nations in the
future. The film of these gasbags is supported at altitude by small additional
atmospheric overpressure and may be connected to the ground by thin cables. The
contributor has shown (in previous works about the AB-Dome) that this closed AB-Dome
allows full control of the weather inside the Dome (the day is always fine, the
rain is only at night, no strong winds) and influence to given region. This is
a realistic and cheap method of economical irrigation, getting energy and
virtual weather control on Earth at the current time.
