Long-range correlation and multifractal nature of the global monthly mean
temperature anomaly time series over the period 1850-2012 are studied in terms
of the multifractal detrended moving average (MFDMA) method. We try to address
the source(s) of multifractality in the time series by comparing the results
derived from the actual series with those from a set of shuffled and surrogate
series. It is seen that the newly developed MFDMA method predicts a
multifractal structure of the temperature anomaly time series that is more or
less similar to that observed by other multifractal methods. In our analysis
the major contribution of multifractality in the temperature records is found
to be stemmed from long-range temporal correlation among the measurements,
however the contribution of fat-tail distribution function of the records is
not negligible. The results of the MFDMA analysis, which are found to depend
upon the location of the detrending window, tend towards the observations of
the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA), if the detrending
window is chosen in such a way that 70% of it is covered by the forward
(future) records and 30% by the backward (past) with respect to the record
(measurement) to be detrended.
