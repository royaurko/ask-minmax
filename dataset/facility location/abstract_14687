We present low-resolution optical spectra of each component of 10 T Tauri
(TT) binary systems with separations ranging from 0.9" to 3.5" and located in
the Taurus star-forming region. We derive the spectral type and Halpha
equivalent width of each component. Complementing these results with those of
Monin et al. (1999) yields a sample of 14 binaries and one triple system, with
resolved spectroscopy and/or near-infrared photometry. We find that mixed
binaries (CTTS+WTTS) are rare, representing only 15-20% of the systems in the
separation range of 0.8" to 3''. Supplementing these results with those of
Hartigan et al. (1994) and Prato & Simon (1997), we show that the trend of
binary TTS to be twins holds to separations up to 13''. This is unlikely to be
the result of random pairing, and confirms previous results that both stars in
young binaries accrete over the same time span. In binary systems where both
stars are still accreting, our measurements show that the most massive star is
usually the component with the largest accretion rate by up to a factor of 10,
as determined from the Halpha luminosity.
