The ability to predict social interactions between people has profound
applications including targeted marketing and prediction of information
diffusion and disease propagation. Previous work has shown that the location of
an individual at any given time is highly predictable. This study examines the
predictability of social interactions between people to determine whether
interaction patterns are similarly predictable. I find that the locations and
times of interactions for an individual are highly predictable; however, the
other person the individual interacts with is less predictable. Furthermore, I
show that knowledge of the locations and times of interactions has almost no
effect on the predictability of the other person. Finally I demonstrate that a
simple Markov chain model is able to achieve close to the upper bound in terms
of predicting the next person with whom a given individual will interact.
