We compute the force acting on a free, static electric charge outside a
uniform dielectric sphere. We view this force as a self-interaction force, and
compute it by applying the Lorentz force directly to the charge's electric
field at its location. We regularize the divergent bare force using two
different methods: A direct application of the Quinn-Wald Comparison Axiom, and
Mode-Sum Regularization.
