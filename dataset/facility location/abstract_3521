Charged particle and gamma decays in 24Mg* are investigated for excitation
energies where quasimolecular resonances appear in 12C+12C collisions. Various
theoretical predictions for the occurence of superdeformed and hyperdeformed
bands associated with resonance structures with low spin are discussed within
the measured 24Mg* excitation energy region. The inverse kinematics reaction
24Mg+12C is studied at E_lab(24Mg) = 130 MeV, an energy which enables the
population of 24Mg states decaying into 12C+12C resonant break-up states.
Exclusive data were collected with the Binary Reaction Spectrometer in
coincidence with EUROBALL IV installed at the VIVITRON Tandem facility at
Strasbourg. Specific structures with large deformation were selectively
populated in binary reactions and their associated gamma decays studied.
Coincident events associated with inelastic and alpha-transfer channels have
been selected by choosing the excitation energy or the entry point via the
two-body Q-values. The analysis of the binary reaction channels is presented
with a particular emphasis on 24Mg-gamma, 20Ne-gamma and 16O-gamma
coincidences. New information (spin and branching ratios) is deduced on
high-energy states in 24Mg and 16O, respectively.
