We extend the technique of asymptotic
series matching to exponential asymptotics expansions (transseries) and show
that the extension provides a method of finding singularities of solutions of
nonlinear differential equations, using asymptotic information. This
transasymptotic matching method is applied to Painlev\'e's first equation. The
solutions of P1 that are bounded in some direction towards infinity can be
expressed as series of functions, obtained by generalized Borel summation of
formal transseries solutions; the series converge in a neighborhood of
infinity. We prove (under certain restrictions) that the boundary of the
region of convergence contains actual poles of the associated solution. As a
consequence, the position of these exterior poles is derived from asymptotic
data. In particular, we prove that the location of the outermost pole $x_p(C)$
on $\RR^+$ of a solution is monotonic in a parameter $C$ describing its
asymptotics on antistokes lines$^1$, and obtain rigorous bounds for $x_p(C)$.
We also derive the behavior of $x_p(C)$ for large $C\in\CC$. The appendix
gives a detailed classical proof that the only singularities of solutions of
P1 are poles.
