We have obtained high resolution mid-infrared images of the high mass
protostar NGC 7538 IRS 1 using Michelle on Gemini North and find that the
circumstellar dust associated with this source is extended on both large and
small scales. The large-scale mid-infrared emission is asymmetric about the
peak of IRS 1, being more extended to the northwest than the southeast. The
position angle of the mid-infrared emission is similar to the position angle of
the linearly distributed methanol masers at this location which are thought to
trace a circumstellar disk. However, this position angle is also very similar
to that of the CO outflow in this region which appears to be centered on IRS 1.
We suggest that the large-scale extended mid-infrared emission is coming from
dust heated on the walls of the outflow cavities near the source. IRS 1 is also
elongated in the mid-infrared on a smaller scale, and this elongation is near
PERPENDICULAR to the axis of the CO outflow (and the linearly distributed
methanol masers). Because of its orientation with respect to the outflow and
its estimated size (R_disk~450AU at 11.7um), we propose that the small-scale
elongation seen in the mid-infrared is a circumstellar disk that may be
collimating the outflow from IRS 1.
