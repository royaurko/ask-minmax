We study the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between two
adatom magnetic impurities placed on zigzag silicene nanoribbon (ZSNR) in the
presence of the out-of-plane electric field. We calculate the interaction
mediated by the charge carriers of the pristine ZSNR at half filling. We show
that the rotation of the spin of the itinerant electrons due to the exchange
interaction causes a twisted RKKY interaction between localized spins which
consists of the Heisenberg, Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya, and Ising interactions and
explore the tunability of the RKKY interaction terms in respect with the
perpendicular electric field. We numerically find that, due to the zero-energy
edge state of ZSNR, the RKKY coupling is significantly enhanced when impurities
are located on the zigzag edges. We also examine the RKKY interaction in
different electric fields and explore that, in the topological insulator phase,
the RKKY interaction is much greater than that when the system is in the band
insulator region.
