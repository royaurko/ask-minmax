After the development of a radiating electron model by P. A. M. Dirac in
1938, many contributors have tried to reformulate this model so-called radiation
reaction. Recently, this effect has become important in ultra-intense
laser-electron (plasma) interactions. In our recent research, we found the
stabilization method of radiation reaction by the QED vacuum fluctuation [PTEP
2014, 043A01 (2014), PTEP 2015, 023A01 (2015)]. On the other hand, the
modification of the radiated field by highly intense incoming laser fields
should be taken into account when the laser intensity is higher than 1022W/cm2,
which could be achieved by the next generation ultra-short pulse 10PW lasers,
like the ones under construction for the ELI-NP facility. In this paper, I
propose the running charge-mass method for the description of the QED-based
synchrotron radiation by high-intensity external fields with the stabilization
by the QED vacuum fluctuation as an extension to the model by Dirac.
