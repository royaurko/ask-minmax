We explore the effect of magnetorotational turbulence on the dynamics and
concentrations of boulders in local box simulations of a sub-Keplerian
protoplanetary disc. The solids are treated as particles each with an
independent space coordinate and velocity. We find that the turbulence has two
effects on the solids. 1) Meter and decameter bodies are strongly concentrated,
locally up to a factor 100 times the average dust density, whereas decimeter
bodies only experience a moderate density increase. The concentrations are
located in large scale radial gas density enhancements that arise from a
combination of turbulence and shear. 2) For meter-sized boulders, the
concentrations cause the average radial drift speed to be reduced by 40%. We
find that the densest clumps of solids are gravitationally unstable under
physically reasonable values for the gas column density and for the dust-to-gas
ratio due to sedimentation. We speculate that planetesimals can form in a dust
layer that is not in itself dense enough to undergo gravitational
fragmentation, and that fragmentation happens in turbulent density fluctuations
in this sublayer.
