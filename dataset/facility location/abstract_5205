This paper presents the CFH12K-VIRMOS survey: a deep B, V, R and I imaging
survey in four fields totalling more than 17 deg^2, conducted with the 30x40
arcmin^2 field CFH-12K camera. The survey is intended to be a multi-purpose
survey used for a variety of science goals, including surveys of very high
redshift galaxies and weak lensing studies.
  Four high galactic latitude fields, each 2x2 deg^2, have been selected along
the celestial equator: 0226-04, 1003+01, 1400+05, and 2217+00. The 16 deg^2 of
the "wide" survey are covered with exposure times of 2h, 1.5h, 1h, 1h, while
the 1.3x1 deg^2 area of the "deep" survey at the center of the 0226-04 field is
covered with exposure times of 7h, 4.5h, 3h, 3h, in B,V,R and I respectively.
  The data is pipeline processed at the Terapix facility at the Institut
d'Astrophysique de Paris to produce large mosaic images. The catalogs produced
contain the positions, shape, total and aperture magnitudes for the 2.175
million objects. The depth measured (3sigma in a 3 arc-second aperture) is
I_{AB}=24.8 in the ``Wide'' areas, and I_{AB}=25.3 in the deep area. Careful
quality control has been applied on the data as described in joint papers.
  These catalogs are used to select targets for the VIRMOS-VLT Deep Survey, a
large spectroscopic survey of the distant universe (Le F\`evre et al., 2003).
First results from the CFH12K-VIRMOS survey have been published on weak lensing
(e.g. van Waerbeke & Mellier 2003).
  Catalogs and images are available through the VIRMOS database environment
under Oracle ({\tt http://www.oamp.fr/virmos}). They will be open for general
use on July 1st, 2003.
