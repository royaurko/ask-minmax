A recent report from the Milagro collaboration included an all-sky map
created using one year of data from Milagro (peak sensitivity at 3-4 TeV for
Crab-like spectra). This map included an unidentified excess that was brighter
than the Crab and was the second brightest spot on the map. The hot spot was
within the error box of the EGRET unidentified source 3EG J0520+2556. No strong
and steady emission was detected by the Whipple telescope at, or in the
vicinity of, either position. The 95% confidence level flux upper limits from
Whipple observations at the locations of the Milagro hot spot and the EGRET
UnID position are 0.09 Crabs and 0.14 Crabs, respectively.
