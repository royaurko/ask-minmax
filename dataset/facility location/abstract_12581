The effect of dipolar interaction and local uniaxial anisotropy on the
magnetic response of small spin clusters where spins are located on the
vertices of icosahedron, cuboctahedron, tetrahedron and square geometry have
been investigated. We consider the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin-1/2
and spin-1 Heisenberg model with uniaxial anisotropy and dipolar interaction
and apply numerical exact diagonalization technique in order to study the
influence of frustration and anisotropy on the ground state properties of the
spin-clusters. The ground state magnetization, spin-spin correlation and
several thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and specific heat are
calculated as a function of temperature and magnetic field.
