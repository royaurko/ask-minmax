Local gauge symmetries cannot break spontaneously, according to Elitzur's
theorem, but this leaves open the possibility of breaking some global subgroup
of the local gauge symmetry, which is typically the gauge symmetry remaining
after certain (e.g. Coulomb or Landau) gauge choices. We show that in an SU(2)
gauge-Higgs system such symmetries do indeed break spontaneously, but the
location of the breaking in the phase diagram depends on the choice of global
subgroup. The implication is that there is no unique broken gauge symmetry, but
rather many symmetries which break in different places. The problem is to
decide which, if any, of these gauge symmetry breakings is associated with a
transition between physically different, confining and non-confining phases.
Several proposals - Kugo-Ojima, Coulomb, and monopole condensate - are
discussed.
