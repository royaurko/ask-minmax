Locating-dominating sets and identifying codes are two closely related
notions in the area of separating systems. Roughly speaking, they consist in a
dominating set of a graph such that every vertex is uniquely identified by its
neighbourhood within the dominating set. In this paper, we study the size of a
smallest locating-dominating set or identifying code for graphs of girth at
least 5 and of given minimum degree. We use the technique of vertex-disjoint
paths to provide upper bounds on the minimum size of such sets, and construct
graphs who come close to meet these bounds.
