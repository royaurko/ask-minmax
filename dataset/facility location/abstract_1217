We report a first year seminar course on nanoengineering, which provides a
unique opportunity to get exposed to the bottom-up approach and novel
nanotechnology applications in an informal small class setting early in the
undergraduate engineering education. Our objective is not only to introduce the
fundamentals and applications of nanoengineering but also the issues related to
ethics, environmental and societal impact of nanotechnology used in
engineering. To make the course more interactive, laboratory tours for
microfabrication facility, microscopy facility, and nanoscale laboratory at the
University of Iowa are included, which inculcate the practical feel of the
technology. The course also involves active student participation through
weekly student presentations, highlighting topics of interest to this field,
with the incentive of "nano is everywhere" Final term papers submitted by the
students involve a rigorous technology analysis through various perspectives.
Furthermore, a student based peer review process is developed which helps them
to improve technical writing skills, as well as address the ethical issues of
academic honesty while reviewing and getting introduced to a new aspect of the
area presented by their colleagues. Based on the chosen paper topics and
student ratings, the student seemed motivated to learn about the novel area
introduced to them through theoretical, computational and experimental aspects
of the bottom-up approach.
