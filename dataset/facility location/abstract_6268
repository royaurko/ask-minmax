We report the phenomenon of symmetry breaking in ants escaping under panic.
Ants confined into a cell with two symmetrically located exits use both exits
in approximately equal proportions to abandon the cell in normal conditions,
but prefer one of the exits if panic is created by adding a repellent fluid.
This finding is consistent with the predictions of recent theoretical models
for the escape of humans in panic conditions, indicating that some features of
the collective behaviour of humans and ants can be similar when escaping under
panic.
