We present Dejavu, a system that uses standard cell-phone sensors to provide
accurate and energy-efficient outdoor localization suitable for car navigation.
Our analysis shows that different road landmarks have a unique signature on
cell-phone sensors; For example, going inside tunnels, moving over bumps, going
up a bridge, and even potholes all affect the inertial sensors on the phone in
a unique pattern. Dejavu employs a dead-reckoning localization approach and
leverages these road landmarks, among other automatically discovered abundant
virtual landmarks, to reset the accumulated error and achieve accurate
localization. To maintain a low energy profile, Dejavu uses only
energy-efficient sensors or sensors that are already running for other
purposes. We present the design of Dejavu and how it leverages crowd-sourcing
to automatically learn virtual landmarks and their locations. Our evaluation
results from implementation on different android devices in both city and
highway driving show that Dejavu can localize cell phones to within 8.4m median
error in city roads and 16.6m on highways. Moreover, compared to GPS and other
state-of-the-art systems, Dejavu can extend the battery lifetime by 347%,
achieving even better localization results than GPS in the more challenging
in-city driving conditions.
