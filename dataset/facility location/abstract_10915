Collaborative beamforming enables nodes in a wireless network to transmit a
common message over long distances in an energy efficient fashion. However, the
process of making available the same message to all collaborating nodes
introduces delays. The contributors recently proposed a MAC-PHY cross-layer scheme
that enables collaborative beamforming with significantly reduced collaboration
overhead. The method requires knowledge of node locations and internode channel
coefficients. In this paper, the performance of that approach is studied
analytically in terms of average beampattern and symbol error probability (SEP)
under realistic conditions, i.e., when imperfect channel estimates are used and
when there are phase errors in the contributions of the collaborating nodes at
the receiver.
