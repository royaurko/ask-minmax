We summarize the current status and future prospects for low energy (weak
scale) supersymmetry. In particular, we evaluate the capabilities of various
$e^+e^-$, $p\bar p$ and $pp$ colliders to discover evidence for supersymmetric
particles. Furthermore, assuming supersymmetry is discovered, we discuss
capabilities of future facilities to dis-entangle the anticipated spectrum of
super-particles, and, via precision measurements, to test mass and coupling
parameters for comparison with various theoretical expectations. We comment
upon the complementarity of proposed hadron and $e^+e^-$ machines for a
comprehensive study of low energy supersymmetry.
