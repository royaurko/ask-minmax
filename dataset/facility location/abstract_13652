According to current prognosis studies of pancreatic cancer, survival rate
nowadays is still as low as 6% mainly due to late detections. Taking into
account the location of the disease within the body and making use of the level
of miniaturization in radiation detectors that can be achieved at the present
time, EndoTOFPET-US collaboration aims at the development of a multimodal
imaging technique for endoscopic pancreas exams that combines the benefits of
high resolution metabolic information from Time-Of- Flight (TOF) Positron
Emission Tomography (PET) and anatomical information from ultrasound (US). A
system with such capabilities calls for an application-specific
high-performance Data Acquisition System (DAQ) able to control and readout data
from two different detectors.
