We present high resolution, mid-infrared images toward three hot molecular
cores signposted by methanol maser emission; G173.49+2.42 (S231, S233IR),
G188.95+0.89 (S252, AFGL-5180) and G192.60-0.05 (S255IR). Each of the cores was
targeted with Michelle on Gemini North using 5 filters from 7.9 to 18.5
microns. We find each contains both large regions of extended emission and
multiple, luminous point sources which, from their extremely red colours
(F[18.5]/F[7.9] >= 3), appear to be embedded young stellar objects. The closest
angular separations of the point sources in the three regions are 0.79, 1.00
and 3.33 arcseconds corresponding to linear separations of 1,700, 1,800 and
6,000AU respectively. The methanol maser emission is found closest to the
brightest MIR point source (within the assumed 1 arcsecond pointing accuracy).
Mass and luminosity estimates for the sources range from 3-22 Msol and
50-40,000 Lsol. Assuming the MIR sources are embedded objects and the observed
gas mass provides the bulk of the reservoir from which the stars formed, it is
difficult to generate the observed distributions for the most massive cluster
members from the gas in the cores using a standard form of the IMF.
