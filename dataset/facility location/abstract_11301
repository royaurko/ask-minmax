Employing first-principles calculations we study the structural, electronic
and magnetic properties of the [Sc$_{1-x}$V$_x$]C and [Sc$_{1-x}$V$_x$]Si
alloys. In their equilibrium rocksalt structure all alloys are non-magnetic.
The zincblende and wurtzite structures are degenerated with respect to the
total energy. For all concentrations the alloys in these lattice structures are
half-metallic with the gap located in the spin-down band. The total spin moment
follows the Slater-Pauling behavior varying linearly between the -1 $\mu_B$ of
the perfect ScC and ScSi alloys and the +1 $\mu_B$ of the perfect VC and VSi
alloys. For the intermediate concentrations V and Sc atoms have antiparallel
spin magnetic moments and the compounds are half-metallic ferrimagnets. At the
critical concentration, both [Sc$_{0.5}$V$_{0.5}$]C and [Sc$_{0.5}$V$_{0.5}$]Si
alloys present zero total spin-magnetic moment but the C-based alloy shows a
semiconducting behavior contrary to the Si-based alloys which is a
half-metallic antiferromagnet.
