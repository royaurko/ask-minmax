We investigate the possibilities that pulsars act as the lens in
gravitational microlensing events towards the galactic bulge or a spiral arm.
Our estimation is based on expectant survey and observations of FAST (Five
hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope) and SKA (Square Kilometer Array),
and two different models of pulsar distribution are used. We find that the
lensing rate is > 1 event/decade, being high enough to search the real events.
Therefore, the microlensing observations focusing on pulsars identified by FAST
or SKA in the future are meaningful. As an independent determination of pulsar
mass, a future detection of microlensing pulsars should be significant in the
history of studying pulsars, especially in constraining the state of matter
(either hadronic or quark matter) at supra-nuclear densities. The observations
of such events by using advanced optical facilities (e.g., the James Webb Space
Telescope and the Thirty Meter Telescope) in future are highly suggested.
