Double peak kHz QPO frequencies in neutron star sources varies in time by a
factor of hundreds Hz while in microquasar sources the frequencies are fixed
and located at the line \nu_2 = 1.5 \nu_1 in the frequency-frequency plot. The
crucial question in the theory of twin HFQPOs is whether or not those observed
in neutron-star systems are essentially different from those observed in black
holes. In black hole systems the twin HFQPOs are known to be in a 3:2 ratio for
each source. At first sight, this seems not to be the case for neutron stars.
For each individual neutron star, the upper and lower kHz QPO frequencies,
\nu_2 and \nu_1, are linearly correlated, \nu_2=A \nu_1 + B, with the slope A <
1.5, i.e., the frequencies definitely are not in a 1.5 ratio. In this
contribution we show that when considered jointly on a frequency-frequency
plot, the data for the twin kHz QPO frequencies in several (as opposed to one)
neutron stars uniquely pick out a certain preferred frequency ratio that is
equal to 1.5 for the six sources examined so far.
