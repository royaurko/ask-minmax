Many socioeconomic studies have been carried out to explain the phenomenon of
gentrification. Although results of these works shed light on the process
around this phenomenon, a perspective which focuses on the relationship between
city form and gentrification is still missing. With this paper we try to
address this gap by studying and comparing, through classic methods of
mathematical statistics, morphological features of five London gentrified
neighbourhoods. Outcomes confirm that areas which have undergone gentrification
display similar and recognizable morphological patterns in terms of urban type
and geographical location of main and local roads as well as businesses. These
initial results confirm findings from previous research in urban sociology, and
highlight the role of urban form in contributing to shape dynamics of
non-spatial nature in cities.
