Stereoscopic white-light imaging of a large portion of the inner heliosphere
has been used to track interplanetary coronal mass ejections. At large
elongations from the Sun, the white-light brightness depends on both the local
electron density and the efficiency of the Thomson-scattering process. To
quantify the effects of the Thomson-scattering geometry, we study an
interplanetary shock using forward magnetohydrodynamic simulation and synthetic
white-light imaging. Identifiable as an inclined streak of enhanced brightness
in a time-elongation map, the travelling shock can be readily imaged by an
observer located within a wide range of longitudes in the ecliptic. Different
parts of the shock front contribute to the imaged brightness pattern viewed by
observers at different longitudes. Moreover, even for an observer located at a
fixed longitude, a different part of the shock front will contribute to the
imaged brightness at any given time. The observed brightness within each
imaging pixel results from a weighted integral along its corresponding
ray-path. It is possible to infer the longitudinal location of the shock from
the brightness pattern in an optical sky map, based on the east-west asymmetry
in its brightness and degree of polarization. Therefore, measurement of the
interplanetary polarized brightness could significantly reduce the ambiguity in
performing three-dimensional reconstruction of local electron density from
white-light imaging.
