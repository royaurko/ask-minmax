I summarize the use of the ROSAT satellite over the last months for the
investigation of well localized GRB error boxes. In particular, I report about
the attempts for and results of quick follow-up observations (including the
GRBs localized with BeppoSAX and RXTE) with ROSAT with its capability to
achieve 10 arcsec locations of X-ray afterglow sources.
