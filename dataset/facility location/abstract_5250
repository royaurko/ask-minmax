A high statistics measurement of the pp --> ppeta reaction at an excess
energy of Q = 15.5 MeV has been performed at the internal beam facility
COSY-11. The stochastically cooled proton beam and the used detection system
allowed to determine the momenta of the outgoing protons with a precision of 4
MeV/c (sigma) in the center-of-mass frame. The determination of the
four-momentum vectors of both outgoing protons allowed to derive the complete
kinematical information of the ppeta-system.
  An unexpectedly large enhancement of the occupation density in the
kinematical regions of low proton-eta relative momenta is observed. A
description taking the proton-proton and the eta-proton interaction into
account and assuming an on-shell incoherent pairwise interaction among the
produced particles fails to explain this strong effect. Its understanding will
require a rigorous three-body approach to the ppeta system and the precise
determination of contributions from higher partial waves.
  We also present an invariant mass spectrum of the proton-proton system
determined at Q = 4.5 MeV. Interestingly, the enhancement at large relative
momenta between protons is visible also at such a small excess energy.
  In contrast to all other determined angular distributions, the orientation of
the emission plane with respect to the beam direction is extracted to be
anisotropic.
