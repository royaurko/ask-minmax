The (778) Theobalda asteroid family attracted little attention so far, but
our study shows that it is important in several aspects. In this paper we
investigate the origin and evolution of Theobalda family. Firstly, we identify
the family as a statistically relevant group in the space of synthetic proper
elements. Using the hierarchical clustering method and adopted cut-off velocity
of d_{cutoff}=85 m/s we found that Theobalda family currently consists of 128
members. This family is located in the outer belt, near proper semi-major axis
a_{p}~3.175 au. This region is crossed by several three-body mean motion
resonances which give rise to significant chaotic zones. Consequently, the
majority of family members reside on chaotic orbits. Using two independent
methods, chaotic chronology and backward integration, we found Theobalda family
to be only 6.9 +/- 2.3 Myr old. We have also estimated, that the family was
likely produced by the cratering impact on a parent body of diameter D_{PB}~78
+/- 9 km.
