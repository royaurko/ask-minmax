Subsurface radioactivity may be due to transport of radionuclides from a
contaminated surface into the solid volume, as occurs for radioactive fallout
deposited on soil, or from fast neutron activation of a solid volume, as occurs
in concrete blocks used for radiation shielding. For purposes including fate
and transport studies of radionuclides in the environment, decommissioning and
decontamination of radiation facilities, and nuclear forensics, an in situ,
nondestructive method for ascertaining the subsurface distribution of
radioactivity is desired. The method developed here obtains a polynomial
expression for the radioactivity depth profile, using a small set of gamma-ray
count rates measured by a collimated detector directed towards the surface at a
variety of angles with respect to the surface normal. To demonstrate its
capabilities, this polynomial method is applied to the simple case where the
radioactivity is maximal at the surface and decreases exponentially with depth
below the surface, and to the more difficult case where the maximal
radioactivity is below the surface.
