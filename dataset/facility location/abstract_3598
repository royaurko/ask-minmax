We present a description of the Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) ion trap
built as part of the TITAN facility. It consists of a gas-filled, segmented,
linear Paul trap and is the first stage of the TITAN setup with the purpose of
cooling and bunching radioactive ion beams delivered from ISAC-TRIUMF. This is
the first such device to be driven digitally, i.e., using a high voltage
($V_{pp} = \rm{400 \, V}$), wide bandwidth ($0.2 < f < 1.2 \, \rm{MHz}$)
square-wave as compared to the typical sinusoidal wave form. Results from the
commissioning of the device as well as systematic studies with stable and
radioactive ions are presented including efficiency measurements with stable
$^{133}$Cs and radioactive $^{124, 126}$Cs. A novel and unique mode of
operation of this device is also demonstrated where the cooled ion bunches are
extracted in reverse mode, i.e., in the same direction as previously injected.
