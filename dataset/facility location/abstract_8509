We present high-resolution CCD images (FWHM=0.6"-0.7") of the compact
gravitational lens system B0218+35.7 obtained at the Nordic Optical Telescope.
Using aperture and PSF photometry we detect the two closely separated (335 mas)
components A and B as well as the lensing galaxy. In the optical B seems to be
very much brighter than A, opposite to the radio morphology. This suggests that
most of the light from A is absorbed in the lensing galaxy, possibly by a giant
molecular cloud located in the line-of-sight to component A. The lensing galaxy
appears to be a late-type galaxy at a small inclination. For future variability
studies we present calibrated photometry of the system and its immediate
surroundings, even though the relative faintness of A will make it difficult to
obtain an optical time delay even with the Hubble Space Telescope.
