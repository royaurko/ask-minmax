SKA's large field of view and high sensitivity at low frequencies will
provide almost a complete coverage of the very early rising phase of
extragalactic and Galactic transients which undergo a flare or outburst due to
an abrupt accretion onto either supermassive (such as tidal disruption events,
TDEs) or stellar mass black hole transients (such as black hole LMXB) , when
their broadband emission is supposed to be jet-dominated at low luminosities,
allowing SKA to be the first facility to make source discoveries and to send
out alerts for follow-up ground or space observations as compared with the
sensitivity of future X-ray wide-field-view monitoring. On the other hand, due
to extremely large rate-of-change in the mass accretion rate during the rising
phase of TDE flares or transient outbursts, SKA will be able to cover an
extremely large range of the mass accretion rate as well as its rate-of-change
not accessible with observations in persistent black hole systems, which will
shape our understanding of disk-jet coupling in accreting black holes in the
non-stationary accretion regimes.
