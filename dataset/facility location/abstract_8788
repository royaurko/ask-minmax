Results of 2D spectral observations for 4 Sy galaxies with ionization cones
are presented. Images in the [OIII] line, velocity fields of the ionized gas,
stellar velocity and velocity dispersion fields were obtained at the SAO RAS 6m
telescope. Non-circular gas motions and Z-shaped emission filaments could be
explained as helical waves located in the ionization cone. This waves are
generated by the hydrodynamical instability due to the velocity break between
galactic ISM and outflowing matter from the AGN engine. The axis of cone lies
close to the direction of a nuclear mini bar.
