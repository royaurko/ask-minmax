This paper deals with new proposals for the design of passive solutions
adapted to the climate of the highlands of Madagascar. While the strongest
population density is located in the central highlands, the problem of thermal
comfort in buildings occurs mainly during winter time. Currently, people use
raw wood to warm the poorly designed houses. This leads to a large scale
deforestation of the areas and causes erosion and environmental problems. The
methodology used consisted of the identification of a typical building and of a
typical meteorological year. Simulations were carried out using a thermal and
airflow software (CODYRUN) to improve each building component (roof, walls,
windows, and soil) in such a way as to estimate the influence of some technical
solutions on each component in terms of thermal comfort. The proposed solutions
also took into account the use of local materials and the standard of living of
the country.
