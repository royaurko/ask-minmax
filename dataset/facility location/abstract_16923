Superhump amplitudes observed in dwarf novae during their superoutbursts
depend on orbital inclination: the maximum amplitudes in systems with low
inclinations are $A_\circ \approx 0.25$ mag., while at higher inclinations they
increase from $A_\circ \sim 0.3$ to $A_\circ \sim 0.6$ mag.
  The mean maximum superhump amplitudes normalized to the average luminosity of
the disk are: $<A_n>=0.34\pm 0.02$ in low inclination systems and only
$<A_n>=0.17\pm 0.01$ in high inclination systems. This shows that at high
inclinations the superhump lIght source is {\it partly} obscured by the disk
edge and implies that it is located close to the disk surface but extends
sufficiently high above that surface to avoid full obscuration. Superhump
amplitudes in high inclination systems show modulation with beat phase
($\phi_b$), interpreted as being due to azimuth-dependent obscuration effects
in a non-axisymmetric disk. In addition they show modulation with $2\phi_b$
which implies that the orientation of the superhump light source is correlated
with the direction of the stream.
  The dependence of superhump amplitudes on orbital inclination and their
modulation with beat phase eliminate the tidal-resonance model for superhumps.
Instead they support an alternative interpretation of superhumps as being due
to periodically modulated dissipation of the kinetic energy of the stream.
  Superhump amplitudes in permanent superhumpers are $<A>=0.12$, i.e. much
smaller than the maximum amplitudes observed during superoutbursts.
