Mueller matrices are defined with respect to appropriate Cartesian reference
frames for the representation of the states of polarization of the input and
output electromagnetic waves. The polarimetric quantities that are invariant
under rotations of the said reference frames about the respective directions of
propagation (rotation transformations) provide particularly interesting
physical information. Moreover, certain properties are also invariant with
respect to the action of birefringent devices located at both sides of the
medium under consideration (retarder transformations). The polarimetric
properties that remain invariant under rotation and retarder transformations
are analyzed and interpreted, providing significant parameterizations of
Mueller matrices in terms of meaningful physical quantities.
