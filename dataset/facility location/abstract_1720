We carry out a state-of-the-art assessment of long baseline neutrino
oscillation experiments with wide band beams. We describe the feasibility of an
experimental program using existing high energy accelerator facilities, a new
intense wide band neutrino beam (0-6 GeV) and a proposed large detector in a
deep underground laboratory. We find that a decade-long program with 1 MW
operation in the neutrino mode and 2 MW operation in the antineutrino mode, a
baseline as long as the distance between Fermilab and the Homestake mine (1300
km) or the Henderson mine (1500 km), and a water Cherenkov detector with
fiducial mass of about 300 kT has optimum sensitivity to \theta_{13}, the mass
hierarchy and to neutrino CP violation at the 3\sigma C.L. for
\sin^22\theta_{13}>0.008. This program is capable of breaking the eight-fold
degeneracy down to the octant degeneracy without additional external input.
