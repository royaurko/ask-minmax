We use proton-nucleus reaction data at intermediate energies to test the
emerging new generation of chiral nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials. Predictions
from a high quality one-boson-exchange (OBE) force are used for comparison and
evaluation. Both the chiral and OBE models fit NN phase shifts accurately, and
the differences between the two forces for proton-induced reactions are small.
A comparison to a chiral model with a less accurate NN description sets the
scale for the ability of such models to work for nuclear reactions.
