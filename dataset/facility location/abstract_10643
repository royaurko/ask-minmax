In this preliminary study we address the question of the influence of
handedness on the localization of targets perceived through a visuo-auditory
substitution device. Participants hold the device in one hand in order to
explore the environment and to perceive the target. They point to the estimated
location of the target with the other hand. This preliminary results support
our hypothesis that pointing is more accurate when the device is held in the
right dominant hand. Dexterity has to be attributed to the active part of the
perceptive system. This study has obviously to be completed but it shows how
the concept of enaction is important and how it can be experimentaly addressed
in the field of sensory substitution.
