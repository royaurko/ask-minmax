The first locations of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in elliptical galaxies
suggest they are produced by the mergers of double neutron star (DNS) binaries
in old stellar populations. Globular clusters, where the extreme densities of
very old stars in cluster cores create and exchange compact binaries
efficiently, are a natural environment to produce merging NSs. They also allow
some short GRBs to be offset from their host galaxies, as opposed to DNS
systems formed from massive binary stars which appear to remain in galactic
disks. Starting with a simple scaling from the first DNS observed in a galactic
globular, which will produce a short GRB in ~300My, we present numerical
simulations which show that ~10-30% of short GRBs may be produced in globular
clusters vs. the much more numerous DNS mergers and short GRBs predicted for
galactic disks. Reconciling the rates suggests the disk short GRBs are more
beamed, perhaps by both the increased merger angular momentum from the DNS
spin-orbit alignment (random for the DNS systems in globulars) and a larger
magnetic field on the secondary NS.
