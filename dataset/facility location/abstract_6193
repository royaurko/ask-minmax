We are interested in the rate of consistency of kernel density estimators
with respect to the weighted sup-norm determined by some unbounded weight
function. This problem has been considered by Gine, Koltchinskii and Zinn
(2004) for a deterministic bandwidth sequence. We provide "uniform in h"
versions of some of their results, allowing us to determine the corresponding
rates of consistency for kernel density estimators where the bandwidth
sequences may depend on the data and/or the location.
