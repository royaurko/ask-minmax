The Aharonov-Bohm scattering amplitude is calculated in the context of planar
gravity with localized sources which also carry a magnetic flux. These sources
cause space-time to develop conical singularities at their location, thus
introducing novel effects in the scattering of electrically charged particles.
The behaviour of the wave function in the proximity of the classical scattering
directions is analyzed by means of an asymptotic expansion previously
introduced by the contributor. It is found that, in contrast with the Aharonov-Bohm
effect in flat space, integer values of the numerical flux can produce
observable effects.
