Non-radial pulsations (NRPs) are a proposed mechanism for the formation of
decretion disks around Be stars and are important tools to study the internal
structure of stars. NGC 3766 has an unusually large fraction of transient Be
stars, so it is an excellent location to study the formation mechanism of Be
star disks. High resolution spectroscopy can reveal line profile variations
from NRPs, allowing measurements of both the degree, l, and azimuthal order, m.
However, spectroscopic studies require large amounts of time with large
telescopes to achieve the necessary high S/N and time domain coverage. On the
other hand, multi-color photometry can be performed more easily with small
telescopes to measure l only. Here, we present representative light curves of
Be stars and non-emitting B stars in NGC 3766 from the CTIO 0.9m telescope in
an effort to study NRPs in this cluster.
