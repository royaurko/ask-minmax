We study the phase-space dependence of 2p-2h excitations in neutrino
scattering using the relativistic Fermi gas model. We follow a similar approach
to other contributors, but focusing in the phase-space properties, comparing with
the non-relativistic model. A careful mathematical analysis of the angular
distribution function for the outgoing nucleons is performed. Our goals are to
optimize the CPU time of the 7D integral to compute the hadron tensor in
neutrino scattering, and to conciliate the different relativistic and non
relativistic models by describing general properties independently of the
two-body current. For some emission angles the angular distribution becomes
infinite in the Lab system, and we derive a method to integrate analytically
around the divergence. Our results show that the frozen approximation, obtained
by neglecting the momenta of the two initial nucleons inside the integral of
the hadron tensor, reproduces fairly the exact response functions for constant
current matrix elements.
