We compute a series of finite-source parameter inversions of the fault
rupture of the 2004 Parkfield earthquake based on 1 Hz GPS records only. We
confirm that some of the co-seismic slip at shallow depth (<5 km) constrained
by InSAR data processing results from early post-seismic deformation. We also
show 1) that if located very close to the rupture, a GPS receiver can saturate
while it remains possible to estimate the ground velocity (~1.2 m/s) near the
fault, 2) that GPS waveforms inversions constrain that the slip distribution at
depth even when GPS monuments are not located directly above the ruptured areas
and 3) the slip distribution at depth from our best models agree with that
recovered from strong motion data. The 95th percentile of the slip amplitudes
for rupture velocities ranging from 2 to 5 km/s is, 55 +/- 6 cm.
