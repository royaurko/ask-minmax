The W3C's Geolocation API may rapidly standardize the transmission of
location information on the Web, but, in dealing with such sensitive
information, it also raises serious privacy concerns. We analyze the manner and
extent to which the current W3C Geolocation API provides mechanisms to support
privacy. We propose a privacy framework for the consideration of location
information and use it to evaluate the W3C Geolocation API, both the
specification and its use in the wild, and recommend some modifications to the
API as a result of our analysis.
