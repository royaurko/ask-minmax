Sub-arcsecond observations using the Very Large Array (VLA) are presented for
low-luminosity water maser in M82, M51, and NGC4051. New maser features have
been detected within the M82 starburst complex. They are largely associated
with star-forming activity, such as optically identified starburst-driven
winds, H II regions, or the early phase of star formation in the galaxy. The
water maser in M51 consists of blueshifted and redshifted features relative to
thesystemic velocity of the galaxy. The redshifted features are measured to the
northwest of the nuclear radio source, while the location of the blueshifted
counterpart is displaced by about 2" from the radio source. A small velocity
gradient closely aligned with the radio jet is detected from the redshifted
features. The redshifted maser most likely amplifies the background radio
continuum jet, while the blueshifted counterpart marks off-nuclear star
formation in the galaxy. All of the detected maser features in the narrow-line
Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051 remain unresolved by new VLA observations. Due to the
low luminosity of the maser, the maser excitation is not directly related to
the active galactic nucleus.
