The setup, capabilities and operation parameters of the neutron reflectometer
GINA, the recently installed "Grazing Incidence Neutron Apparatus" at the
Budapest Neutron Centre, are introduced. GINA, a dance-floor-type,
constant-energy, angle-dispersive reflectometer is equipped with a 2D
position-sensitive detector to study specular and off-specular scattering.
Wavelength options between 3.2 and 5.7 {\AA} are available for unpolarized and
polarized neutrons. Spin polarization and analysis are achieved by magnetized
transmission supermirrors and radio-frequency adiabatic spin flippers. As a
result of vertical focusing by the five-element (pyrolytic graphite)
monochromator the reflected intensity from a 20x20 mm sample has doubled. GINA
is dedicated to studies of magnetic films and heterostructures, but unpolarized
options for non-magnetic films, membranes and other surfaces are also provided.
Shortly after its startup, reflectivity values as low as 3x10-5 have been
measured on the instrument. The facility is now open for the international user
community, but its development is continuing mainly to establish new sample
environment options, the spin analysis of off-specularly scattered radiation
and further decrease of the background.
