Coverage planning and optimization is one of the most crucial tasks for a
radio network operator. Efficient coverage optimization requires accurate
coverage estimation which relies on geo-located field measurements. These
measurements are gathered today during highly expensive drive tests and will be
reported in the near future by users equipments thanks to the 3GPP MDT feature
(still costly in terms of battery consumption and signaling overhead). In both
cases, predicting the coverage on a location where no measurements are
available remains a key and challenging task. This paper describes a powerful
tool that gives an accurate coverage prediction on the whole area of interest,
i.e. a coverage map, by spatially interpolating geo-located measurements using
Kriging technique. The paper focuses on the reduction of the computational
complexity of the kriging algorithm by applying Fixed Rank Kriging (FRK). The
performance evaluation of the FRK algorithm both on simulated measurements and
real field measurements shows a good trade-off between prediction efficiency
and computational complexity. In order to go a step further towards operational
application of the proposed algorithm, a scenario with multiple cells is
studied. Simulation results show a good performance in terms of coverage
prediction and detection of best serving cell.
