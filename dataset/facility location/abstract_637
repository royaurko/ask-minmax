Transfer and integration of nanostructures onto target substrates is the
prerequisite for their fundamental studies and practical applications.
Conventional transfer techniques that involve stamping, lift-off and/or
striping suffer from the process-specific drawbacks, such as the requirement
for chemical etchant or high-temperature annealing and the introduction of
surface discontinuities and/or contaminations that can greatly hinder the
properties and functions of the transferred materials. Herein, we report a
universal and rapid transfer method implementable at mild conditions.
Nanostructures with various dimensionalities (i.e. nanoparticles, nanowires and
nanosheets) and surface properties (i.e. hydrophilic and hydrophobic) can be
facilely transferred to diverse substrates including hydrophilic, hydrophobic
and flexible surfaces with good fidelity. Importantly, our method ensures the
rapid and clean transfer of two-dimensional (2D) materials, and allows for the
facile fabrication of vertical heterostructures with various compositions used
for electronic devices. We believe that our method can facilitate the
development of nano-electronics by accelerating the clean transfer and
integration of low-dimensional materials into multidimensional structures.
