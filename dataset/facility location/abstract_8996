The kinematics and physical conditions of the bipolar planetary nebula M 2-48
are analysed from high and low dispersion long-slit spectra. Previous CCD
narrow-band optical observations have suggested that this nebula is mainly
formed by a pair of symmetric bow-shocks, an off-center semi-circular shell,
and an internal bipolar structure. The bipolar outflow has a complex structure,
characterised by a series of shocked regions located between the bright core
and the polar tips. There is an apparent kinematic discontinuity between the
bright bipolar core and the outer regions. The fragmented ring around the
bright bipolar region presents a low expansion velocity and could be associated
to ejection in the AGB-PN transition phase, although its nature remains
unclear. The chemical abundances of the central region are derived, showing
that M 2-48 is a Type I planetary nebula (PN).
