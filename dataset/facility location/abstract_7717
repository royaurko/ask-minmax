We study the variation of the shape of the proton intensity-time profiles in
simulated gradual Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events with the relative
observer's position in space with respect to the main direction of propagation
of an interplanetary (IP) shock. Using a three-dimensional (3D)
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code to simulate such a shock, we determine the
evolution of the downstream-to-upstream ratios of the plasma variables at its
front. Under the assumption of an existing relation between the normalized
ratio in speed across the shock front and the injection rate of
shock-accelerated particles, we model the transport of the particles and we
obtain the proton flux profiles to be measured by a grid of 18 virtual
observers located at 0.4 and 1.0 AU, with different latitudes and longitudes
with respect to the shock nose. The differences among flux profiles are the
result of the way each observer establishes a magnetic connection with the
shock front, and we find that changes in the observer's latitude may result in
intensity changes of up to one order of magnitude at both radial distances
considered here. The peak intensity variation with the radial distance for the
pair of observers located at the same angular position is also derived. This is
the first time that the latitudinal dependence of the peak intensity with the
observer's heliocentric radial distance has been quantified within the
framework of gradual SEP event simulations.
