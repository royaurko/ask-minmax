The broad-line region (BLR) is an important component of blazars, especially
for the flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). The soft photons arising from the
BLR will substantially affect the transparency of the gamma-ray photons
produced in the relativistic jet. In the paper, we study the effect of the
geometrical structure of the BLR on the absorption of gamma-rays. We find that
the gamma-ray optical depth strongly depends on the geometrical structure of
the BLR. For a "flat" geometry of the BLR, the gamma-ray photons with specified
energies could escape transparently even their emission region locates inside
the cavity of the BLR.
