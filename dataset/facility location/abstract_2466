We present Herschel observations of water isotopologues in the atmosphere of
the Jupiter-family comet 45P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajdusakova. No HDO emission is
detected, with a 3 sigma upper limit of 2.0 10-4 for the D/H ratio. This value
is consistent with the earlier Herschel measurement in the Jupiter-family comet
103P/Hartley 2. The canonical value of 3 10-4 measured pre-Herschel in a sample
of Oort-cloud comets can be excluded at a 4.5 sigma level. The observations
presented here further confirm that a diversity of D/H ratios exists in the
comet population and emphasize the need for additional measurements with future
ground-based facilities, such as CCAT, in the post-Herschel era.
