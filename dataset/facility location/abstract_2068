We discuss a possible generation of radio bursts preceding final stages of
binary neutron star mergings which can be accompanied by short gamma-ray
bursts. Detection of such bursts appear to be advantageous in the low-frequency
radio band due to a time delay of ten to several hundred seconds required for
radio signal to propagate in the ionized intergalactic medium. This delay makes
it possible to use short gamma-ray burst alerts to promptly monitor specific
regions on the sky by low-frequency radio facilities, especially by LOFAR. To
estimate the strength of the radio signal, we assume a power-law dependence of
the radio luminosity on the total energy release in a magnetically dominated
outflow, as found in millisecond pulsars. Based on the planned LOFAR
sensitivity at 120 MHz, we estimate that the LOFAR detection rate of such radio
transients could be about several events per month from redshifts up to
$z\sim1.3$ in the most optimistic scenario. The LOFAR ability to detect such
events would crucially depend on exact efficiency of low-frequency radio
emission mechanism.
