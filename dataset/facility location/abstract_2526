The CALICE Semi-digital hadronic calorimeter built in 2011, was installed and
tested during two periods of two weeks each in 2012 at CERN SPS facilities. The
detector has more than 450000 channels with a semi-digital readout distributed
on 48 layers with efficiency exceeding 95%. It has been run using the
trigger-less and power pulsing modes. Data have been collected with muon,
electron and hadron beams in the energy range between 5 and 80 GeV. This
contribution focuses on the performances, the shower selection methods and on
the first results on the calibration using pions.
