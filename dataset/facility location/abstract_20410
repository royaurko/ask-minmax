The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) has detected over 1400 Gamma-Ray
Bursts (GRBs) since it began science operations in July, 2008. We use a subset
of over 300 GRBs localized by instruments such as Swift, the Fermi Large Area
Telescope, INTEGRAL, and MAXI, or through triangulations from the
InterPlanetary Network (IPN), to analyze the accuracy of GBM GRB localizations.
We find that the reported statistical uncertainties on GBM localizations, which
can be as small as 1 degree, underestimate the distance of the GBM positions to
the true GRB locations and we attribute this to systematic uncertainties. The
distribution of systematic uncertainties is well represented (68% confidence
level) by a 3.7 degree Gaussian with a non-Gaussian tail that contains about
10% of GBM-detected GRBs and extends to approximately 14 degrees. A more
complex model suggests that there is a dependence of the systematic uncertainty
on the position of the GRB in spacecraft coordinates, with GRBs in the
quadrants on the Y-axis better localized than those on the X-axis.
