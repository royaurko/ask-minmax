We present results from a 38 ks Chandra X-ray observation of the z=0.059
galaxy cluster A1991. The cluster has a bright X-ray core and a central
temperature gradient that declines inward from 2.7 keV at 130 kpc to
approximately 1.6 keV at the cluster center. The radiative cooling time of the
gas in the inner 10 kpc is about 0.5 Gyr, and rises to 1 Gyr at a radius of 20
kpc. The cooling rate of the gas within the latter radius is less than about 25
solar mass/yr. The Chandra ACIS-S3 image shows that the intracluster medium has
an asymmetric surface brightness distribution with respect to the central
galaxy. Bright knots of soft X-ray emission embedded in a cometary structure
are located approximately 10 arcsec north of the optical center of the cD
galaxy. Unlike the structures seen in other cooling flow clusters, the knots
have no obvious association with the radio source. The structure's temperature
of 0.83 keV makes it nearly 1 keV cooler than its surroundings, and its mass is
3.4E+09 solar masses. Based on its bow-shaped appearance and modest
overpressure with respect to its surroundings, we interpret the structure as a
cool mass concentration that is breaking apart as it travels northward through
the center of the cluster.
