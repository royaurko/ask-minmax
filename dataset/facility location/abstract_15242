The Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) is one of 3 instruments on the Swift MIDEX
spacecraft to study gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The BAT first detects the GRB and
localizes the burst direction to an accuracy of 1-4 arcmin within 20 sec after
the start of the event. The GRB trigger initiates an autonomous spacecraft slew
to point the two narrow field-of-view (FOV) instruments at the burst location
within 20-70 sec so to make follow-up x-ray and optical observations. The BAT
is a wide-FOV, coded-aperture instrument with a CdZnTe detector plane. The
detector plane is composed of 32,768 pieces of CdZnTe (4x4x2mm), and the
coded-aperture mask is composed of approximately 52,000 pieces of lead
(5x5x1mm) with a 1-m separation between mask and detector plane. The BAT
operates over the 15-150 keV energy range with approximately 7 keV resolution,
a sensitivity of approximately 10E-8 erg*cm^-2*s^-1, and a 1.4 sr (half-coded)
FOV. We expect to detect >100 GRBs/yr for a 2-year mission. The BAT also
performs an all-sky hard x-ray survey with a sensitivity of approximately 2
mCrab (systematic limit) and it serves as a hard x-ray transient monitor.
