We report the identification of SH $\Delta v=1$ ro-vibrational lines in the
published high-resolution infrared spectrum of the S-type star, R And. This is
the first astronomical detection of this molecule. The lines show inverse
P-Cygni profiles, indicating infall motion of the molecular layer due to
stellar pulsation. A simple spherical shell model with a constant infall
velocity is adopted to determine the condition of the layer. It is found that a
single excitation temperature of 2200 K reproduces the observed line
intensities satisfactory. SH is located in a layer from 1.0 to ~1.1 stellar
radii, which is moving inward with a velocity of 9 km s-1. These results are
consistent with the previous measurements of CO $\Delta v=3$ transitions. The
estimated molecular abundance SH/H is 1x10^-7, consistent with a thermal
equilibrium calculation.
