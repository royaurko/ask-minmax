The explosion of people networking in cyberspace, disseminating terabytes of
information, is being promoted through the use of broadband, bluetooth
technology, and wireless mobile computing facilities. New communities within
such venues as virtual chat rooms discussion groups, newsgroups etc are being
created daily and even hourly. This is raising issues of cyberethics concerning
privacy,security, crime, human needs, e-business, e-healthcare, e-government
and intellectual property among others that need to be evaluated and reflected
upon. With this new freedom come new moral and ethical responsibilities, which
raise questions as to whether anything can be published or whether there should
be restrictions. This paper addresses one specific area, that has come into the
public eye, the closure by Microsoft of all of its free chat rooms.
