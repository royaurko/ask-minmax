Recent achievements at the EVN MkIV data processor at JIVE include decreasing
the read-out time for the whole correlator to 0.25 seconds (or 0.125 s for half
the correlator), improving the end quality of user data (e.g., applying an
improved 2-bit van Vleck correction), developing new astronomical capabilities
(e.g., oversampling to x 4, wider-field mapping), and strengthening liaison
procedures with PIs (e.g., pipelining, the EVN Archive facility). At the same
time, the move to a disk-based EVN and regular incorporation of FTP
fringe-checks is well underway, resulting in more reliable data quality. We
will review these developments, highlighting how they may broaden the kinds of
astronomy you can do. We'll also go over some measures you can take to help you
get the most out of these new/improved features.
