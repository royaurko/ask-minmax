We present our first results from a high-contrast imaging search for
planetary mass companions around stars with gapped debris disks, as inferred
from the stars' bright infrared excesses. For the six considered stars, we
model the disks' unresolved infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in
order to derive the temperature and location of the disk components. With
VLT/NaCo Apodizing Phase Plate coronagraphic L'-band imaging, we search for
planetary mass companions that may be sculpting the disks. We detect neither
disks nor companions in this sample, confirmed by comparing plausible point
sources with archival data. In order to calculate our mass sensitivity limit,
we revisit the stellar age estimates. One target, HD 17848, at 540$\pm$100 Myr
old is significantly older than previously estimated. We then discuss our
high-contrast imaging results with respect to the disk properties.
