We define a ghost D-brane in superstring theories as an object that cancels
the effects of an ordinary D-brane. The supergroups U(N|M) and OSp(N|M) arise
as gauge symmetries in the supersymmetric world-volume theory of D-branes and
ghost D-branes. A system with a pair of D-brane and ghost D-brane located at
the same location is physically equivalent to the closed string vacuum. When
they are separated, the system becomes a new brane configuration. We generalize
the type I/heterotic duality by including n ghost D9-branes on the type I side
and by considering the heterotic string whose gauge group is OSp(32+2n|2n).
Motivated by the type IIB S-duality applied to D9- and ghost D9-branes, we also
find type II-like closed superstrings with U(n|n) gauge symmetry.
