Rampazzo et al. 2005 (Paper I) presented a data-set of line-strength indices
for 50 early-type galaxies in the nearby Universe. The galaxy sample is biased
toward galaxies showing emission lines, located in environments corresponding
to a broad range of local galaxy densities, although predominantly in low
density environments. The present addendum to Paper I enlarges the above
data-set of line-strength indices by analyzing 18 additional early-type
galaxies (three galaxies, namely NGC 3607, NGC 5077 and NGC 5898 have been
already presented in the previous set). As in Paper I, we measured 25
line-strength indices, defined by the Lick IDS "standard" system (Trager et al.
1998; Worthey & Ottaviani 1997), for 7 luminosity weighted apertures and 4
gradients of each galaxy. This paper presents the line-strength data-set and
compares it with the available data in the literature.
