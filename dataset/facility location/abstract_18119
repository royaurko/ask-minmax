Deep H$\alpha$ images of a faint emission complex 4.0 x 5.5 degrees in
angular extent and located far off the Galactic plane at l = 70.0 degrees,
b=-21.5 degrees reveal numerous thin filaments suggestive of a supernova
remnant's shock emission. Low dispersion optical spectra covering the
wavelength range 4500 - 7500 A show only Balmer line emissions for one filament
while three others show a Balmer dominated spectrum along with weak [N I] 5198,
5200 A, [O I] 6300, 6364 A, [N II] 6583 A, [S II] 6716, 6731 A and in one case
[O III] 5007 A line emission. Many of the brighter H$\alpha$ filaments are
visible in near UV GALEX images presumably due to C III] 1909 A line emission.
ROSAT All Sky Survey images of this region show a faint crescent shaped X-ray
emission nebula coincident with the portion of the H$\alpha$ nebulosity closest
to the Galactic plane. The presence of long, thin Balmer dominated emission
filaments with associated UV emission and coincident X-ray emission suggests
this nebula is a high latitude Galactic supernova remnant despite a lack of
known associated nonthermal radio emission. Relative line intensities of the
optical lines in some filaments differ from commonly observed [S II]/H$\alpha$
> 0.4 radiative shocked filaments and typical Balmer filaments in supernova
remnants. We discuss possible causes for the unusual optical SNR spectra.
