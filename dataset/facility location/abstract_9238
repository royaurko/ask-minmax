The primary objective of the study of unidentified EGRET sources with
INTEGRAL is to locate with a few arcminute accuracy the hard X-ray / soft
gamma-ray counterparts within the EGRET error circle or to determine upper
limits on their emission in the INTEGRAL energy range. The INTEGRAL Galactic
Plane Scan (GPS) and Galactic Centre Deep Exposure (GCDE) data have been
analysed and cross-correlated with the EGRET 3^rd Catalogue to search for
counterparts of EGRET sources. The IBIS detection of a source within the EGRET
error circle of 3EG J1736-2908 is presented and its possible identification
with the active galaxy GRS 1734-292 is discussed. Finally, preliminary results
on the cross-correlation between EGRET unidentified sources and the first data
from the IBIS survey of the Galactic Centre are presented.
