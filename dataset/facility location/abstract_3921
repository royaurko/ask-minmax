We demonstrate a novel experimental implementation to strongly align
molecules at full repetition rates of free-electron lasers. We utilized the
available in-house laser system at the coherent x-ray imaging beamline at the
Linac Coherent Light Source. Chirped laser pulses, i. e., the direct output
from the regenerative amplifier of the Ti:Sa chirped pulse amplification laser
system, were used to strongly align 2,5-diiodothiophene molecules in a
molecular beam. The alignment laser pulses had pulse energies of a few mJ and a
pulse duration of 94 ps. A degree of alignment of
$\left<\cos^2\!\theta_{2D}\right>$ = 0.85 was measured, limited by the
intrinsic temperature of the molecular beam rather than by the available laser
system. With the general availability of synchronized chirped-pulse-amplified
near-infrared laser systems at short-wavelength laser facilities, our approach
allows for the universal preparation of molecules tightly fixed in space for
experiments with x-ray pulses.
