We present a supersymmetric model in which the observed fermion masses and
mixings are generated by localizing the three generations of matter and the two
Higgs fields at different locations in a compact extra dimension. Supersymmetry
is broken by the shining method and the breaking is communicated to standard
model fields via gaugino mediation. Quark masses, CKM mixing angles and the mu
term are generated with all dimensionless couplings of O(1). All dimensionful
parameters are of order the five-dimensional Planck scale except for the size
of the extra dimension which is of order the GUT scale. The superpartner
spectrum is highly predictive and is found to have a neutralino LSP over a wide
range of parameter space. The resulting phenomenology and interesting
extensions of the model are briefly discussed.
