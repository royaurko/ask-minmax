An analytical approach to calculation of the conductivity tensor, $\sigma$,
of a two-dimensional (2D) electron system with Rashba spin-orbit interaction
(SOI) in an orthogonal magnetic field is proposed. The electron momentum
relaxation is assumed to be due to electron scattering by a random field of
short-range impurities, which is taken into account in the Born approximation.
An exact expression for the one-particle Green function of an electron with
Rashba SOI in an arbitrary magnetic field is suggested. This expression allows
us to obtain analytical formulas for the density of states (DOS) and $\sigma$
in the self-consistent Born and ladder approximation, respectively, which hold
true in a wide range of magnetic fields, from the weak ($\omega_{c}\tau << 1$)
up to the quantizing ($\omega_{c}\tau\gtrsim 1$) ones. It is shown that in the
ladder approximation the Rashba SOI has no effect at all on the conductivity
magnitude in the whole range of classical (non quantizing) magnetic fields. The
Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillation period is shown to be related to the total
charge carrier concentration by the conventional formula, irrespective of the
SOI magnitude. A simple equation defining the location of the SdH oscillation
beating nodes is obtained. The results are in good agreement with the
experimental and recent numerical investigations.
