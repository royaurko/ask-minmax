We determine the initial mass function (IMF) of the ``thin disk'' by means of
a direct comparison between synthetic stellar samples (for different matching
choices of IMF, star formation rate SFR and depletion) and a complete
(volume-limited) sample of single stars near the galactic plane (|z| < 25pc),
selected from the Hipparcos catalogue (d < 100pc, M_v < +4.0). Our synthetic
samples are computed from first principles: stars are created with a random
distribution of mass M_* and age t_* which follow a given (genuine) IMF and
SFR(t_*). They are then placed in the HR diagram by means of a grid of
empirically well-tested evolution tracks. The quality of the match (synthetic
versus observed sample) is assessed by means of star counts in specific regions
in the HR diagram. 7 regions are located along the MS (main sequence, mass
sensitive), while 4 regions represent different evolved (age-sensitive) stages
of the stars. The counts of evolved stars, in particular, give valuable
evidence of the history of the ``thin disk'' (apparent) star formation and lift
the ambiguities in models restricted to MS star counts.
