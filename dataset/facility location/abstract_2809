We study the location of the partition function zeros in the complex beta
plane (Fisher's Zeros) for SU(2) lattice gauge theory on L^4 lattices. We
discuss recent attempts to locate complex zeros for L=4 and 6. We compare
results obtained using various polynomial approximations of the logarithm of
the density of states and a straightforward MC reweighting. We conclude that
the method based on a combination of discrete Chebyshev orthogonality and
patching plaquette distributions at different beta provides the more reliable
estimates.
