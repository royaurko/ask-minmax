Narrow absorption lines seen in the 2-10 keV spectra of active galaxies and
Galactic black holes are normally attributed to iron in high velocity outflows
or inflows. We consider the possibility that such features could arise
naturally in the accretion disc. Resonant absorption by highly ionised iron
(e.g. Fe XXVI and Fe XXV) in an optically-thin plasma that is located above the
disc and rotating with it could reproduce narrow features in the reflection
component of the spectrum as it emerges from the disc. Depending on the
inclination of the disc and the exact geometry of the hot plasma (e.g. does it
blanket the disc or a ring) apparently narrow absorption features could be
detected between 4-10 keV. Such an explanation requires no high velocity
outflow/inflow and is consistent with a reflection-based interpretation for
accreting black holes systems.
