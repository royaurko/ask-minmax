A nearby core collapse supernova will produce a burst of neutrinos in several
detectors worldwide. With reasonably high probability, the Earth will shadow
the neutrino flux in one or more detectors. In such a case, for allowed
oscillation parameter scenarios, the observed neutrino energy spectrum will
bear the signature of oscillations in Earth matter. Because the frequency of
the oscillations in energy depends on the pathlength traveled by the neutrinos
in the Earth, an observed spectrum contains also information about the
direction to the supernova. We explore here the possibility of constraining the
supernova location using matter oscillation patterns observed in a detector.
Good energy resolution (typical of scintillator detectors), well known
oscillation parameters, and optimistically large (but conceivable) statistics
are required. Pointing by this method can be significantly improved using
multiple detectors located around the globe. Although it is not competitive
with neutrino-electron elastic scattering-based pointing with water Cherenkov
detectors, the technique could still be useful.
