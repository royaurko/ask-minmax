A classical problem in acoustic (and electromagnetic) scattering concerns the
evaluation of the Green's function for the Helmholtz equation subject to
impedance boundary conditions on a half-space. The two principal approaches
used for representing this Green's function are the Sommerfeld integral and the
(closely related) method of complex images. The former is extremely efficient
when the source is at some distance from the half-space boundary, but involves
an unwieldy range of integration as the source gets closer and closer. Complex
image-based methods, on the other hand, can be quite efficient when the source
is close to the boundary, but they do not easily permit the use of the
superposition principle since the selection of complex image locations depends
on both the source and the target. We have developed a new, hybrid
representation which uses a finite number of real images (dependent only on the
source location) coupled with a rapidly converging Sommerfeld-like integral.
While our method applies in both two and three dimensions, we restrict the
detailed analysis and numerical experiments here to the two-dimensional case.
