We investigate the formation of substructure in spiral galaxies using global
MHD simulations, including gas self-gravity. Our models extend previous local
models by Kim and Ostriker (2002) by including the full effects of curvilinear
coordinates, a realistic log-spiral perturbation, self-gravitational
contribution from 5 radial wavelengths of the spiral shock, and variation of
density and epicyclic frequency with radius. We show that with realistic Toomre
Q values, self-gravity and galactic differential rotation produce filamentary
gaseous structures with kpc-scale separations, regardless of the strength -- or
even presence -- of a stellar spiral potential. However, the growth of sheared
features distinctly associated with the spiral arms, described as spurs or
feathers in optical and IR observations of many spiral galaxies, requires a
sufficiently strong spiral potential in self gravitating models. Unlike
independently-growing ''background'' filaments, the orientation of arm spurs
depends on galactic location. Inside corotation, spurs emanate outward, on the
convex side of the arm; outside corotation, spurs grow inward, on the concave
side of the arm. Based on spacing, orientation, and the relation to arm clumps,
it is possible to distinguish ''true spurs'' that originate as instabilities in
the spiral arms from independently growing ''background'' filaments. Our models
also suggest that magnetic fields are important in preserving grand design
spiral structure when gas in the arms fragments via self-gravity into GMCs.
