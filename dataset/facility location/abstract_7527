This paper introduces a new approach to analyzing spatial point data
clustered along or around a system of curves or "fibres." Such data arise in
catalogues of galaxy locations, recorded locations of earthquakes, aerial
images of minefields and pore patterns on fingerprints. Finding the underlying
curvilinear structure of these point-pattern data sets may not only facilitate
a better understanding of how they arise but also aid reconstruction of missing
data. We base the space of fibres on the set of integral lines of an
orientation field. Using an empirical Bayes approach, we estimate the field of
orientations from anisotropic features of the data. We then sample from the
posterior distribution of fibres, exploring models with different numbers of
clusters, fitting fibres to the clusters as we proceed. The Bayesian approach
permits inference on various properties of the clusters and associated fibres,
and the results perform well on a number of very different curvilinear
structures.
