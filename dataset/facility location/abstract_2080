We study the properties of $\bar K^*$ mesons in nuclear matter using a
unitary approach in coupled channels within the framework of the local hidden
gauge formalism and incorporating the $\bar K \pi$ decay channel in matter. The
in-medium $\bar K^* N$ interaction accounts for Pauli blocking effects and
incorporates the $\bar K^*$ self-energy in a self-consistent manner. We also
obtain the $\bar K^*$ (off-shell) spectral function and analyze its behaviour
at finite density and momentum. At normal nuclear matter density, the $\bar
K^*$ meson feels a moderately attractive potential while the $\bar K^*$ width
becomes five times larger than in free space. We estimate the transparency
ratio of the $\gamma A \to K^+ K^{* -} A^\prime$ reaction, which we propose as
a feasible scenario at present facilities to detect the changes of the
properties of the $\bar K^*$ meson in the nuclear medium.
