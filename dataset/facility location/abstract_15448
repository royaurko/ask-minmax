We present our analysis of the extensive monitoring of SS433 by the RXTE
observatory collected over the period 1996-2005. The difference between energy
spectra taken at different precessional and orbital phases shows the presence
of strong photoabsorption (N_H>10^{23}cm^{-2}) near the optical star, probably
due to its powerful, dense wind. Therefore the size of the secondary deduced
from analysis of X-ray orbital eclipses might be significantly larger than its
Roche lobe size, which must be taken into account when evaluating the mass
ratio from analysis of X-ray eclipses. Assuming that a precessing accretion
disk is geometrically thick, we recover the temperature profile in the X-ray
emitting jet that best fits the observed precessional variations in the X-ray
emission temperature. The hottest visible part of the X-ray jet is located at a
distance of l_0/a~0.06-0.09, or ~2-3*10^{11}cm from the central compact object,
and has a temperature of about T_{max}~30 keV. We discovered appreciable
orbital X-ray eclipses at the ``crossover'' precessional phases (jets are in
the plane of the sky, disk is edge-on), which under model assumptions put a
lower limit on the size of the optical component R/a>0.5 and an upper limit on
a mass ratio of binary companions q=M_x/M_{opt}<0.3-0.35, if the X-ray opaque
size of the star is not larger than 1.2R_{Roche, secondary}.
