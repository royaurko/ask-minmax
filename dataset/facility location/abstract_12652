We present the motivations for and methods we used to create a new
ground-based photometric survey of the field targeted by the NASA Kepler
Mission. The survey contains magnitudes for 4414002 sources in one or more of
the UBV filters, including 1862902 sources detected in all three filters. The
typical completeness limit is U~18.7, B~19.3, and V~19.1 magnitudes, but varies
by location. The area covered is 191 square degrees and includes the areas on
and between the 42 Kepler CCDs as well as additional areas around the perimeter
of the Kepler field. The major significance of this survey is our addition of U
to the optical bandpass coverage available in the Kepler Input Catalog, which
was primarily limited to the redder SDSS griz and D51 filters. The U coverage
reveals a sample of the hottest sources in the field, many of which are not
currently targeted by Kepler, but may be objects of astrophysical interest.
