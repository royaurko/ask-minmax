LOPES is a digital antenna array at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,
Germany, for cosmic-ray air-shower measurements. Triggered by the co-located
KASCADE-Grande air-shower array, LOPES detects the radio emission of air
showers via digital radio interferometry. We summarize the status of LOPES and
recent results. In particular, we present an update on the reconstruction of
the primary-particle properties based on almost 500 events above 100 PeV. With
LOPES, the arrival direction can be reconstructed with a precision of at least
0.65{\deg}, and the energy with a precision of at least 20 %, which, however,
does not include systematic uncertainties on the absolute energy scale. For
many particle and astrophysics questions the reconstruction of the atmospheric
depth of the shower maximum, Xmax, is important, since it yields information on
the type of the primary particle and its interaction with the atmosphere.
Recently, we found experimental evidence that the slope of the radio lateral
distribution is indeed sensitive to the longitudinal development of the air
shower, but unfortunately, the Xmax precision at LOPES is limited by the high
level of anthropogenic radio background. Nevertheless, the developed methods
can be transferred to next generation experiments with lower background, which
should provide an Xmax precision competitive to other detection technologies.
