Spectroscopy of Lambda hypernuclei has recently become one of the most
valuable tools for the experimental investigation of strangeness nuclear
physics. Several new approached are being pursued currently: In Mainz, the
Microtron MAMI has been upgraded to 1.5 GeV electron beam energy and will be
used to produce strange hadronic systems in the near future. The KaoS
spectrometer is being installed for large acceptance, high resolution
strangeness reaction spectroscopy at the existing spectrometer facility.
  The Mainz hypernuclei research programme will be complemented by experiments
on multi-strange systems at the planned FAIR facility at GSI. The gamma-ray
spectroscopy of double Lambda hypernuclei produced via Xi-bar Xi pair
production is one of the four main topics which will be addressed by the PANDA
Collaboration. In this paper the status of the planned experiments and the
future prospects are presented.
