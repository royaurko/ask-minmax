This paper concerns smooth transonic flows of Meyer type in finite de Laval
nozzles, which are governed by an equation of mixed type with degeneracy and
singularity at the sonic state. First we study the properties of sonic curves.
For any $C^2$ transonic flow of Meyer type, the set of exceptional points is
shown to be a closed line segment (may be empty or only one point).
Furthermore, it is proved that a flow with nonexceptional points is unstable
for a $C^1$ small perturbation in the shape of the nozzle. Then we seek smooth
transonic flows of Meyer type which satisfy physical boundary conditions and
whose sonic points are exceptional. For such a flow, its sonic curve must be
located at the throat of the nozzle and it is strongly singular in the sense
that the sonic curve is a characteristic degenerate boundary in the
subsonic-sonic region, while in the sonic-supersonic region all characteristics
from sonic points coincide, which are the sonic curve and never approach the
supersonic region. It is proved that there exists uniquely such a smooth
transonic flow near the throat of the nozzle, whose acceleration is Lipschitz
continuous, if the wall of the nozzle is sufficiently flat.
