Previously, [1207.0458] proposed an astrophysical explanation of narrow
gamma-ray line-like feature(s) at ~100 GeV from Galactic Center region observed
by Fermi/LAT [1205.4700]. The model of [1207.0458] is based on the inverse
Compton scattering of external ultra-violet/X-ray radiation by a cold
ultra-relativistic electron-positron pulsar wind. We show that the extra broad
~30 MeV component should arise from Comptonization of cosmic microwave
background radiation. We estimate the main parameters of this component and
show that it can be detectable with MeV telescopes such as CGRO/COMPTEL. The
location of CGRO/COMPTEL unidentified source GRO J1823-12 close to excess of
105-120 GeV emission (Reg.1 of [1205.4700]) can be interpreted as an argument
in favour of astrophysical model of the narrow feature(s) at ~100 GeV.
