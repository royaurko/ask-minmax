Supernova Remnants (SNRs) are believed to be the acceleration sites of
galactic cosmic rays. As such they are expected to produce Very High Energy
(VHE) gamma-rays through hadronic and/or electromagnetic scenarios, hence they
are natural targets for observations with ground-based Imaging Atmospheric
Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). Currently, VHE emission has been detected from
several SNRs, making them one of the most abundant types of established
galactic VHE sources. The MAGIC telescope, located in the Canary island of La
Palma, has been performing observations of several SNRs over the last two
years. Parameters like age, distance, radio flux, or possible EGRET association
(i.e., criteria matching those already used for previous successful IACT SNR
detections), were used to select candidate targets. Here we summarize the
results of the past two years of observations.
