We present results of numerical studies of the two dimensional XY model with
four and eight fold symmetry breaking fields. This model has recently been
shown to describe hydrogen induced reconstruction on the W(100) surface. Based
on mean-field and renormalization group arguments,we first show how the
interplay between the anisotropy fields can give rise to different phase
transitions in the model. When the fields are compatible with each other there
is a continuous phase transition when the fourth order field is varied from
negative to positive values. This transition becomes discontinuous at low
temperatures. These two regimes are separated by a multicritical point. In the
case of competing four and eight fold fields, the first order transition at low
temperatures opens up into two Ising transitions. We then use numerical methods
to accurately locate the position of the multicritical point, and to verify the
nature of the transitions. The different techniques used include Monte Carlo
histogram methods combined with finite size scaling analysis, the real space
Monte Carlo Renormalization Group method, and the Monte Carlo Transfer Matrix
method. Our numerical results are in good agreement with the theoretical
arguments.
