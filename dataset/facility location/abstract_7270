CCD $BVI$ photometry is presented for 8 previously unstudied star clusters
located in the First and Fourth Galactic Quadrants: AL~1, BH 150, NGC 5764,
Lynga~9, Czernik~37, BH 261, Berkeley~80 and King~25. Color magnitude diagrams
of the cluster regions suggest that several of them (BH 150, Lynga~9,
Czernik~37 and BH 261 and King~25) are so embedded in the dense stellar
population toward the galactic center that their properties, or even their
existence as physical systems, cannot be confirmed. Lynga~9, BH 261 and King~25
appear to be slight enhancements of dense star fields, BH 150 is probably just
a single bright star in a dense field, and Czernik~37 may be a sparse, but real
cluster superimposed on the galactic bulge population. We derive preliminary
estimates of the physical parameters for the remaining clusters. AL~1 appears
to be an intermediate age cluster beyond the solar circle on the far side of
the galaxy and the final two clusters, NGC 5764 and Berkeley 80 are also of
intermediate age but located inside the solar ring. This set of clusters
highlights the difficulties inherent in studying the stellar populations toward
the inner regions of the galaxy.
