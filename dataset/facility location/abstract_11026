The seismicity, which took place at the Methoni seismogenic area, in the time
period of 20/2/2008 - 10/4/2008, is analyzed in terms of its location, time of
occurrence and magnitude. Furthermore, it is compared to the tidal (T=14 days,
T=1 day) lithospheric oscillation and to the epicentral area suggested by the
analysis of the Earth_s electric field registered on 21-22/2/2008 by PYR, ATH
and HIO monitoring sites. Moreover, a comparison is made between the actual
seismic energy released, during the same time period (20/2/2008 - 10/4/2008) in
this specific seismogenic region and the suggested one by the probabilistic
single seismic event suggested that could occur in the time period of 28/2_
1/3/2008.
  The overall analysis of the Methoni seismic event reveals the validity of the
used physical models: of the lithospheric oscillation, of the lithospheric
seismic energy release and the one of the homogeneous Earth used for the
azimuthal intensity vector analysis of the preseismic electric signals
(Thanassoulas, 2007).
