We report on gamma-ray observations of the supernova remnant (SNR) RX
J0852.0-4622 with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope. In the Fermi LAT data, we find a spatially extended source at
the location of the SNR. The extension is consistent with the SNR size seen in
other wavelengths such as X-rays and TeV gamma rays, leading to the
identification of the gamma-ray source with the SNR. The spectrum is well
described as a power law with a photon index of Gamma = 1.85 +/- 0.06 (stat)
(+0.18,-0.19) (sys), which smoothly connects to the H.E.S.S. spectrum in the
TeV energy band. We discuss the gamma-ray emission mechanism based on
multiwavelength data. The broadband data can be fit well by a model in which
the gamma rays are of hadronic origin. We also consider a scenario with inverse
Compton scattering of electrons as the emission mechanism of the gamma rays.
Although the leptonic model predicts a harder spectrum in the Fermi LAT energy
range, the model can fit the data considering the statistical and systematic
errors.
