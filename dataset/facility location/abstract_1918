Using the measured fragmentation cross sections produced from the 48Ca and
64Ni beams at 140 MeV per nucleon on 9Be and 181Ta targets, we find that the
cross sections of unmeasured neutron rich nuclei can be extrapolated using a
systematic trend involving the average binding energy. The extrapolated
cross-sections will be very useful in planning experiments with neutron rich
isotopes produced from projectile fragmentation. The proposed method is general
and could be applied to other fragmentation systems including those used in
other radioactive ion beam facilities.
