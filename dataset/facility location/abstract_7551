Sturm's theorem (1829/35) provides an elegant algorithm to count and locate
the real roots of any real polynomial. In his residue calculus (1831/37) Cauchy
extended Sturm's method to count and locate the complex roots of any complex
polynomial. For holomorphic functions Cauchy's index is based on contour
integration, but in the special case of polynomials it can effectively be
calculated via Sturm chains using euclidean division as in the real case. In
this way we provide an algebraic proof of Cauchy's theorem for polynomials over
any real closed field. As our main tool, we formalize Gauss' geometric notion
of winding number (1799) in the real-algebraic setting, from which we derive a
real-algebraic proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. The proof is
elementary inasmuch as it uses only the intermediate value theorem and
arithmetic of real polynomials. It can thus be formulated in the first-order
language of real closed fields. Moreover, the proof is constructive and
immediately translates to an algebraic root-finding algorithm.
