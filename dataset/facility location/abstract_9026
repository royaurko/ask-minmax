We present the results of a search for submillimetre-luminous host galaxies
of optically dark gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using the Submillimetre Common-User
Bolometer Array (SCUBA) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). We made
photometry measurements of the 850-micron flux at the location of four `dark
bursts', which are those with no detected optical afterglow despite rapid deep
searches, and which may therefore be within galaxies containing substantial
amounts of dust. We were unable to detect any individual source significantly.
Our results are consistent with predictions for the host galaxy population as a
whole, rather than for a subset of dusty hosts. This indicates that optically
dark GRBs are not especially associated with very submillimetre-luminous
galaxies and so cannot be used as reliable indicators of dust-enshrouded
massive star-formation activity. Further observations are required to establish
the relationship between the wider GRB host galaxy population and SCUBA
galaxies.
