We present extragalactic number counts and a lower limit estimate for the
cosmic infrared background at 15 um from AKARI ultra deep mapping of the
gravitational lensing cluster Abell 2218. This data is the deepest taken by any
facility at this wavelength, and uniquely samples the normal galaxy population.
We have de-blended our sources, to resolve photometric confusion, and de-lensed
our photometry to probe beyond AKARI's blank-field sensitivity. We estimate a
de-blended 5 sigma sensitivity of 28.7 uJy. The resulting 15 um galaxy number
counts are a factor of three fainter than previous results, extending to a
depth of ~ 0.01 mJy and providing a stronger lower limit constraint on the
cosmic infrared background at 15 um of 1.9 +/- 0.5 nW m^-2 sr^-1.
