Theoretical transition energies and probabilities for He-, Li- and Be-like
Praseodymium ions are calculated in the framework of the multi-configuration
Dirac-Fock method (MCDF), including QED corrections. These calculated values
are compared to recent experimental data obtained in the Livermore SuperEBIT
electron beam ion trap facility.
