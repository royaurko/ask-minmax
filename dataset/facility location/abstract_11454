Drops of water at room temperature were released in hot oil, which had a
temperature higher than that of the boiling point of water. Initially, the drop
temperature increases slowly mainly due to heat transfer diffusion; convective
heat transfer is small because the motion takes place at a small Reynolds
number. Once the drop reaches the bottom of the container, it sticks to the
surface with a certain contact angle. Then, a part of the drop vaporizes: the
nucleation point may appear at the wall, the interface or the bulk of the drop.
The vapor expands inside the drop and deforms its interface. The way in which
the vapor expands, either smooth or violent, depends on the location of the
nucleation point and oil temperature. Furthermore, for temperatures close to
the boiling point of water, the drops are stable (overheated); the vaporization
does not occur spontaneously but it may be triggered with an external
perturbation. In this case the growth of the vapor bubble is rather violent.
Many visualization for different conditions will be shown and predictions of
the growth rate will be discussed.
