We theoretically propose to directly observe the chiral nature of charge
carriers in graphene mono- and bilayers within a controlled scattering
experiment. The charge located on a capacitively coupled scanning probe
microscope (SPM) tip acts as a scattering center with controllable position on
the graphene sheet. Unambiguous features from the chirality of the particles in
single and bilayer graphene arise in the ballistic transport in the presence of
such a scattering center. To theoretically model the scattering from the smooth
potential created by the SPM tip, we develop the scattering formalism within
first-order Born approximation. We calculate the current through a device with
an SPM tip between two constrictions (quantum point contacts) as a function of
the tip position.
