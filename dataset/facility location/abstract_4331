The 3-2 model of dynamical supersymmetry breaking is revisited, with some
incidentally new observations on the vacuum structure. Extra matter is then
added, and the vacuum structure is further studied. The parametric dependence
of the location of the vacuum provides a consistency check of Seiberg duality.
