We have studied the relationship between the location of EUV nonthermal
broadening and high-energy particles during the large flares by using EUV
imaging spectrometer onboard {\it Hinode}, Nobeyama Radio Polarimeter, Nobeyama
Radioheliograph, and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard {\it Solar Dynamic
Observatory}. We have analyzed the five large flare events which contain
thermal rich, intermediate, and thermal poor flares classified by the
definition discussed in the paper. We found that, in the case of thermal rich
flares, the nonthermal broadening of \ion{Fe}{24} occurred at the top of the
flaring loop at the beginning of the flares. The source of the 17 GHz microwave
is located at the footpoint of the flare loop. On the other hand, in the case
of intermediate/thermal poor flares, the nonthermal broadening of \ion{Fe}{24}
occurred at the footpoint of the flare loop at the beginning of the flares. The
source of the 17 GHz microwave is located at the top of the flaring loop. We
discussed the difference between thermal rich and intermediate/thermal poor
flare based on the spatial information of nonthermal broadening, which may give
a clue for the presence of turbulence playing an important role in the pitch
angle scattering of the high-energy electron.
