We study a spatial Prisoner's dilemma game with two types (A and B) of
players located on a square lattice. Players following either cooperator or
defector strategies play Prisoner's Dilemma games with their 24 nearest
neighbors. The players are allowed to adopt one of their neighbor's strategy
with a probability dependent on the payoff difference and type of the given
neighbor. Players A and B have different efficiency in the transfer of their
own strategy therefore the strategy adoption probability is reduced by a
multiplicative factor (w < 1) from the players of type B. We report that the
motion of the influential payers (type A) can improve remarkably the
maintenance of cooperation even for their low densities.
