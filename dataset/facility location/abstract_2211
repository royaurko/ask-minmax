This is a summary of the discussions that took place in the working group
dedicated to studies of the Local Universe. The contributors are listed in
alphabetical order, after the working group organiser, and are those who gave a
presentation during the week in Crete; their contributions are incorporated
here. During the group discussions we considered the various synergies that
exist between future studies of individual stars and star formation regions at
optical/IR wavelengths that will be possible with the E-ELT and those of the
molecular and neutral gas in similar regions that will be possible with ALMA
and SKA. The primary emphasise was on star formation; both on large and small
scales. New facilities will allow more detailed insights into the properties of
our own Galaxy and also allow us to make detailed comparisons with a range of
more distant systems all forming stars at different rates from different
initial conditions (e.g., metallicity) and with different spatial
distributions.
