We demonstrate a dual-axis accelerometer and gyroscope atom interferometer,
which forms the building blocks of a six-axis inertial measurement unit. By
recapturing the atoms after the interferometer sequence, we maintain a large
atom number at high data-rates of 50 to 100 measurements per second. Two cold
ensembles are formed in trap zones located a few centimeters apart, and are
launched toward one-another. During their ballistic trajectory, they are
interrogated with a stimulated Raman sequence, detected, and recaptured in the
opposing trap zone. We achieve sensitivities at $\mathrm{\mu \mathit{g} /
\sqrt{Hz}}$ and $\mathrm{\mu rad / s / \sqrt{Hz}}$ levels, making this a
compelling prospect for expanding the use of atom interferometer inertial
sensors beyond benign laboratory environments.
