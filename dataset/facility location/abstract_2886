We present the molecular dynamics study of benzene molecules confined into
the single wall carbon nanotube. The local structure and orientational ordering
of benzene molecules are investigated. It is found that the molecules mostly
group in the middle distance from the axe of the tube to the wall. The
molecules located in the vicinity of the wall demonstrate some deviation from
planar shape. There is a tilted orientational ordering of the molecules which
depends on the location of the molecule. It is shown that the diffusion
coefficient of the benzene molecules is very small at the conditions we report
here.
