For the first time, the abundances of a large sample of subgiant and turn-off
region stars in omega Centauri have been measured, the data base being medium
resolution spectroscopy from FORS2 at the VLT. Absolute iron abundances were
derived for about 400 member stars from newly defined line indices with an
accuracy of +/-0.15 dex. The abundances range between -2.2<[Fe/H]<-0.7 dex,
resembling the large metallicity spread found for red giant branch stars. The
combination of the spectroscopic results with the location of the stars in the
colour magnitude diagram has been used to estimate ages for the individual
stars. Whereas most of the metal-poor stars are consistent with a single old
stellar population, stars with abundances higher than [Fe/H]=-1.3 dex are
younger. The total age spread in omega Cent is about 3 Gyr. The monotonically
increasing age-metallicity relation seems to level off above [Fe/H]=-1.0 dex.
Whether the star formation in omega Cen occured continuously or rather
episodically has to be shown by combining more accurate abundances with highest
quality photometry.
