In this paper we present the main ideas and discuss both the feasibility and
the conceptual design of a novel hybrid technique and equipment for an
experimental cancer therapy based on the simultaneous and/or sequential
application of two beams, namely a beam of neutrons and a CW (continuous wave)
or intermittent sub-terahertz wave beam produced by a gyrotron for treatment of
cancerous tumors. The main simulation tools for the development of the computer
aided design (CAD) of the prospective experimental facility for clinical trials
and study of such new medical technology are briefly reviewed. Some tasks for a
further continuation of this feasibility analysis are formulated as well.
