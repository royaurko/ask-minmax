With all the new discoveries being made about nearby young stars, the ability
to find new nearby young stars is as important as ever, and membership
identification codes will continue to perform a vital role in scientific
research. In the process of creating a new moving group membership
identification code - LocAting Constituent mEmbers In Nearby Groups (LACEwING)
- we have discovered a few pointers relevant to astronomers trying to use codes
like LACEwING to locate young stars.
