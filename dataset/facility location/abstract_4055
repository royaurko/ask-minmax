The Wyner model has been widely used to model and analyze cellular networks
due to its simplicity and analytical tractability. Its key aspects include
fixed user locations and the deterministic and homogeneous interference
intensity. While clearly a significant simplification of a real cellular
system, which has random user locations and interference levels that vary by
several orders of magnitude over a cell, a common presumption by theorists is
that the Wyner model nevertheless captures the essential aspects of cellular
interactions. But is this true? To answer this question, we consider both
uplink and downlink transmissions, and both outage-based and average-based
metrics. For the uplink, for both metrics, we conclude that the Wyner model is
in fact quite accurate for systems with a sufficient number of simultaneous
users, e.g. CDMA. Conversely, it is broadly inaccurate otherwise. With
multicell processing, intracell TDMA is shown to be suboptimal in terms of
average throughput, in sharp contrast to predictions using the Wyner model.
Turning to the downlink, the Wyner model is highly inaccurate for outage since
it depends largely on the user locations. However, for average or sum
throughput, the Wyner model serves as an acceptable simplification in certain
special cases if the interference parameter is set appropriately.
