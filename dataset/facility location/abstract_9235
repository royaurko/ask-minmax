Using the deepest and finest resolution images of the Universe acquired with
the Hubble Space Telescope and a similar image taken 7 years later for the
Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey, we have derived proper motions for the
point sources in the Hubble Deep Field--North. Two faint blue objects,HDF2234
and HDF3072, are found to display significant proper motion, 10.0 $\pm$ 2.5 and
15.5 $\pm$ 3.8 mas yr$^{-1}$. Photometric distances and tangential velocities
for these stars are consistent with disk white dwarfs located at $\sim$ 500 pc.
The faint blue objects analyzed by Ibata et al. (1999) and Mendez & Minniti
(2000) do not show any significant proper motion; they are not halo white
dwarfs and they do not contribute to the Galactic dark matter. These objects
are likely to be distant AGN.
