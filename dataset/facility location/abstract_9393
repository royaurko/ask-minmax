CCD BVI photometry of the faint open clusters Berkeley~73, Berkeley~75 and
Berkeley~25 are presented. The two latter are previously unstudied clusters to
our knowledge. While Berkeley~73 is found to be of intermediate-age (about 1.5
Gyr old), Berkeley~75 and Berkeley~25 are two old clusters, with ages larger
than 3.0 Gyr. We provide also estimates of the clusters size. Very
interestingly, all these clusters turn out to lie far away from the Galactic
Center, at $R_{GC} \geq$ 16 kpc, and quite high onto the Galactic plane, at
$|Z_{\odot}| \geq 1.5$ kpc. They are therefore important targets to probe the
properties of the structure of the Galaxy in this direction, where the Canis
Major over-density has been recently discovered to be located.
