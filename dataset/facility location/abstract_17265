The first Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) conducted with
Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) is presented. By consideration of the
basic principles of interferometry, we show that VLBI is efficient at
discriminating between SETI signals and human generated radio frequency
interference (RFI). The target for this study was the star Gliese 581, thought
to have two planets within its habitable zone. On 2007 June 19, Gliese 581 was
observed for 8 hours at 1230-1544 with the Australian Long Baseline Array. The
dataset was searched for signals appearing on all interferometer baselines
above five times the noise limit. A total of 222 potential SETI signals were
detected and by using automated data analysis techniques, were ruled out as
originating from the Gliese 581 system. From our results we place an upper
limit of 7 MW/Hz on the power output of any isotropic emitter located in the
Gliese 581 system, within this frequency range. This study shows that VLBI is
ideal for targeted SETI, including follow-up observations. The techniques
presented are equally applicable to next-generation interferometers, such as
the long baselines of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).
