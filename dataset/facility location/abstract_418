The lattice gauge theory community produces large volumes of data. Because
the data produced by completed computations form the basis for future work, the
maintenance of archives of existing data and metadata describing the
provenance, generation parameters, and derived characteristics of that data is
essential not only as a reference, but also as a basis for future work.
Development of these archives according to uniform standards both in the data
and metadata formats provided and in the software interfaces to the component
services could greatly simplify collaborations between institutions and enable
the dissemination of meaningful results.
  This paper describes the progress made in the development of a set of such
archives at the Fermilab lattice QCD facility. We are coordinating the
development of the interfaces to these facilities and the formats of the data
and metadata they provide with the efforts of the international lattice data
grid (ILDG) metadata and middleware working groups, whose goals are to develop
standard formats for lattice QCD data and metadata and a uniform interface to
archive facilities that store them. Services under development include those
commonly associate with data grids: a service registry, a metadata database, a
replica catalog, and an interface to a mass storage system. All services
provide GSI authenticated web service interfaces following modern standards,
including WSDL and SOAP, and accept and provide data and metadata following
recent XML based formats proposed by the ILDG metadata working group.
