The Gamma-Ray Optical Counterpart Search Experiment (GROCSE) presents new
experimental upper limits on the optical flux from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Our
experiment consisted of a fully-automated very wide-field opto-electronic
detection system that imaged locations of GRBs within a few seconds of
receiving trigger signals provided by BATSE's real-time burst coordinate
distribution network (BACODINE). The experiment acquired ~3800 observing hours,
recording 22 gamma-ray burst triggers within $\sim$30 s of the start of the
burst event. Some of these bursts were imaged while gamma-ray radiation was
being detected by BATSE. We identified no optical counterparts associated with
gamma-ray bursts amongst these events at the m$_V$ $\sim$ 7.0 to 8.5
sensitivity level. We find the ratio of the upper limit to the V-band optical
flux, F$_\nu$, to the gamma-ray fluence, $\Phi_\gamma$, from these data to be
$2 \times 10^{-18} < F_\nu/\Phi_\gamma < 2 \times 10^{-16}$.
