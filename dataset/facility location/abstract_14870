We report on the finding of the strongest H(alpha) emission -pseudoequivalent
width of 705 Angstrom- known so far in a young, late type dwarf. This object,
named as SOri71, is a substellar candidate member of the 1-8 Myr star cluster
sigma Orionis. Due to its overluminous location in color-magnitude diagrams,
SOri71 might be younger than other cluster members, or a binary of similar
components. Its mass is in the range 0.021-0.012 M(sun), depending on
evolutionary models and possible binarity. The broad H(alpha) line of SOri71
appears asymmetric, indicative of high velocity mass motions in the H(alpha)
forming region. The origin of this emission is unclear at the present time. We
discuss three possible scenarios: accretion from a disk, mass exchange between
the components of a binary system, and emission from a chromosphere.
