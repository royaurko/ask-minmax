We calculate the event rates induced by high-intensity radioactive sources of
nu_e (51Cr) and of anti-nu_e (90Sr), to be located near the BOREXINO detector.
Calculations are performed both in the standard case and assuming non-standard
properties of neutrinos, including flavor oscillations, neutrino
electromagnetic interactions, and deviations from the standard vector and axial
couplings in the nu_e-e interaction. It is shown that, in some cases, the
current limits on non-standard neutrino properties can be significantly
improved.
