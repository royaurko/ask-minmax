We have investigated electronic transport of few-layer-graphene (FLG)
connected to superconducting electrodes. The device is prepared by mechanical
exfoliation of graphite. A small mesa of FLG is placed on the surface of an
insulating Alumina layer over silicon substrate, and is connected with two
tungsten electrodes, separated by 2.5 microns, grown by focused ion beam. While
tungsten electrodes are superconducting below 4 K, proximity induced
superconductivity in FLG is observed below 1K with a large differential
resistance drop at low bias. Signatures of multiple Andreev reflections are
observed as peaks located at voltages corresponding to sub-multiple values of
the superconducting gap of the electrodes.
