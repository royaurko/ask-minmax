Author suggests and researches a new revolutionary idea for regional and
global weather control. He offers to cover cities, bad regions of country, full
country or a continent by a thin closed film with control clarity located at a
top limit of the Earth troposphere (4 - 6 km). The film is supported at
altitude by small additional atmospheric pressure and connected to ground by
thin cables. It is known, the troposphere defines the Earth weather. Authors
show this closed dome allows to do a full control of the weather in a given
region (the day is always fine, the rain is only in night, no strong wind). The
average Earth (white cloudy) reflectance equal 0.3 - 0.5. That means the Earth
losses about 0.3 - 0.5 of a solar energy. The dome controls the clarity of film
and converts the cold regions to subtropics and creates the hot deserts,
desolate wildernesses to the prosperous regions with temperate climate. That is
a realistic and the cheapest method of the weather control in the Earth at the
current time.
  Key words: Global weather control, gigantic film dome, converting a cold
region to subtropics, converting desolate wilderness to a prosperous region.
