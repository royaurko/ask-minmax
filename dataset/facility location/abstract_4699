We generalize the description of baryons as instantons of Sakai-Sugimoto
model to the case where the flavor branes are non-anti-podal. The later
corresponds to quarks with a "string endpoint mass". We show that the baryon
vertex is located on the flavor branes and hence the generalized baryons also
associate with instantons. We calculate the baryon mass spectra, the isoscalar
and axial mean square radii, the isoscalar and isovector magnetic moments and
the axial coupling as a function of the mass scale M_{KK} and the location
\zeta of the tip of U-shaped flavor D8-branes. We determine the values of
M_{KK} and \zeta from a best fit comparison with the experimental data. The
later comes out to be in a forbidden region, which may indicate that the
incorporation of baryons in Sakai-Sugimoto model has to be modified. We discuss
the analogous baryons in a non-critical gravity model. A brief comment on the
single flavor case (N_f=1) is also made.
