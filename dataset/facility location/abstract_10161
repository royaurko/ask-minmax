The NEMO-3 tracking detector is located in the Fr\'ejus Underground
Laboratory. It was designed to study double beta decay in a number of different
isotopes. Presented here are the experimental half-life limits on the double
beta decay process for the isotopes $^{100}$Mo and $^{82}$Se for different
Majoron emission modes and limits on the effective neutrino-Majoron coupling
constants. In particular, new limits on "ordinary" Majoron (spectral index 1)
decay of $^{100}$Mo ($T_{1/2} > 2.7\cdot10^{22}$ y) and $^{82}$Se ($T_{1/2} >
1.5\cdot10^{22}$ y) have been obtained. Corresponding bounds on the
Majoron-neutrino coupling constant are $<g_{ee} > < (0.4-1.9) \cdot 10^{-4}$
and $< (0.66-1.7) \cdot 10^{-4}$.
