During division it is of primary importance for a cell to correctly determine
the site of cleavage. The bacterium Escherichia coli divides in the center,
producing two daughter cells of equal size. Selection of the center as the
correct division site is in part achieved by the Min-proteins. They oscillate
between the two cell poles and thereby prevent division at these locations.
Here, a phenomenological description for these oscillations is presented, where
lateral interactions between proteins on the cell membrane play a key role.
Solutions to the dynamic equations are compared to experimental findings. In
particular, the temporal period of the oscillations is measured as a function
of the cell length and found to be compatible with the theoretical prediction.
