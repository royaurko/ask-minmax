The National Fusion Collaboratory (NFC) project was created to advance
scientific understanding and innovation in magnetic fusion research by enabling
more efficient use of existing experimental facilities through more effective
integration of experiment, theory, and modeling. To achieve this objective, NFC
introduced the concept of "network services", which build on top of
computational Grids, and provide Fusion codes, together with their maintenance
and hardware resources as a service to the community. This mode of operation
requires the development of new contributorization and enforcement capabilities. In
addition, the nature of Fusion experiments places strident quality of service
requirements on codes run during the experimental cycle. In this paper, we
describe Grid computing requirements of the Fusion community, and present our
first experiments in meeting those requirements.
