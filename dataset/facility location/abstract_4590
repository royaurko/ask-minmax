It is shown that the hadronic matter formed at high temperatures, according
to the prescription of the statistical bootstrap principle, develops a critical
point at nonzero baryon chemical potential, associated with the end point of a
first-order, quark-hadron phase-transition line. The location of the critical
point is evaluated as a function of the MIT bag constant.
