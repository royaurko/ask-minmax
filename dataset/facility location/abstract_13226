The structure of six tiles extracted from the erosion and deposition zones
(thin and thick deposition) of the Tore Supra toroidal pump limiter (TPL) have
been analysed in the framework of the DITS campaign using micro-Raman
spectroscopy. This post-mortem analysis gives information on both carbon
structure and D content. We have found that the carbon structure is most often
similar to that of plasma-deposited hard amorphous carbon layers. The role of
the surface temperature during the discharge in the D content is investigated:
in all locations where the temperature does not reach more than 500{\degree}C
the D content seems to be roughly uniform with D/D+C \approx 20%.
