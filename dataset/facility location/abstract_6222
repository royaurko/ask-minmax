Using heuristic arguments based on the trace formulas, we analytically
calculate the semiclassical two-point correlation form factor for a family of
rectangular billiards with a barrier of height irrational with respect to the
side of the billiard and located at any rational position p/q from the side. To
do this, we first obtain the asymptotic density of lengths for each family of
periodic orbits by a Siegel-Veech formula. The result K(0)=1/2+1/q obtained for
these pseudo-integrable, non-Veech billiards is different but not far from the
value of 1/2 expected for semi-Poisson statistics and from values of K(0)
obtained previously in the case of Veech billiards.
