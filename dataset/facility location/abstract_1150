The Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ) is a prominent atmospheric circulation
feature observed during the Asian Summer Monsoon. It is generally assumed that
Tibet is an essential ingredient in determining the location of the TEJ.
However studies have also suggested the importance of latent heating in
determining the jet location. The relative importance of Tibetan orography and
latent heating is explored through simulations with a general circulation
model.
  The simulation of TEJ by the Community Atmosphere Model, version 3.1
(CAM-3.1) has been discussed in detail. Although the simulated TEJ replicated
many observed features of the jet, the jet maximum was located too far to the
west when compared to observation. The precipitation in the control simulation
was high to the west of India and this caused the TEJ to shift westwards by
approximately the same amount. Orography was found to have minimal impact on
the simulated TEJ hence indicating that latent heating is the crucial
parameter. The primacy of latent heating in determining the jet location was
confirmed by additional simulations where the simulated precipitation was
brought closer to observations. This made the TEJ to also shift to the correct
position.
