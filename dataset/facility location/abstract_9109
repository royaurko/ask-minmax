We use recent results from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)
for the locations of peaks and troughs of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
power spectrum, together with constraints from large-scale structure, to study
a quintessence model in which the pure exponential potential is modified by a
polynomial factor. We find that the model is compatible with all the recent
data for a wide range of cosmological and potential parameters. Moreover,
quintessence is favoured compared to $\Lambda$CDM for $n_s\approx 1$ and
relatively high values of the average fraction of dark energy before last
scattering (``early quintessence''); for $n_s<1$, quintessence and $\Lambda$CDM
give similar results, except for high values of early quintessence, in which
case $\Lambda$CDM is favoured.
