We introduce a new velocity selection criterion for fronts propagating into
unstable and metastable states. We restrict these fronts to large finite
intervals in the comoving frame of reference and require their centers be
insensitive to the locations of the ends of the finite intervals, exhibiting
thus effectively an approximate translation invariance. Only one monotonic
front has this behavior and its velocity is the one that is physically
selected. We present analytic results in the case of piecewise parabolic
potentials, and numerical results in other cases.
