This report describes the research, design and implementation work carried
out in building the CLARE system at SRI International, Cambridge, England.
CLARE was designed as a natural language processing system with facilities for
reasoning and understanding in context and for generating cooperative
responses. The project involved both further development of SRI's Core Language
Engine (Alshawi, 1992, MIT Press) natural language processor and the design and
implementation of new components for reasoning and response generation. The
CLARE system has advanced the state of the art in a wide variety of areas, both
through the use of novel techniques developed on the project, and by extending
the coverage or scale of known techniques. The language components are
application-independent and provide interfaces for the development of new types
of application.
