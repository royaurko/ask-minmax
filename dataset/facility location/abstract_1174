The COSY-11 experimental setup is an internal facility installed at the
COoler SYnchrotron COSY in Juelich. It allows to investigate meson production
in free and quasi-free nucleon-nucleon collisions, eg. pp --> pp meson and pd
--> p_sp np meson reactions. Drift chambers and scintillators permit to measure
outgoing protons, separated in magnetic field of COSY-11 dipole. Neutrons are
registered in the neutron modular detector installed downstream the beam.
Recently, the experimental setup has been extended with spectator detector,
deuteron drift chamber and polarization monitoring system, and since then meson
production can be investigated also as a function of spin and isospin of
colliding nucleons.
