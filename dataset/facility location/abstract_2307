The shift towards an energy Grid dominated by prosumers (consumers and
producers of energy) will inevitably have repercussions on the distribution
infrastructure. Today it is a hierarchical one designed to deliver energy from
large scale facilities to end-users. Tomorrow it will be a capillary
infrastructure at the medium and Low Voltage levels that will support local
energy trading among prosumers. In our previous work, we analyzed the Dutch
Power Grid and made an initial analysis of the economic impact topological
properties have on decentralized energy trading. In this paper, we go one step
further and investigate how different networks topologies and growth models
facilitate the emergence of a decentralized market. In particular, we show how
the connectivity plays an important role in improving the properties of
reliability and path-cost reduction. From the economic point of view, we
estimate how the topological evolutions facilitate local electricity
distribution, taking into account the main cost ingredient required for
increasing network connectivity, i.e., the price of cabling.
