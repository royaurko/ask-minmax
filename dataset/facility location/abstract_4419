The gamma-ray burst of 1997 February 28 was localized using the arrival-time
analysis method with the Ulysses, BeppoSAX, and WIND spacecraft. The result is
a plus-or-minus 31.5 arcsec (3 sigma) wide annulus of possible arrival
directions which intersects both the position of the burst determined
independently by the SAX Wide Field Camera, and the position of a fading X-ray
source detected by the SAX focussing X-ray telescopes, and reduces these source
location areas by factors of 7 and 1.5 respectively. The combination of the
annulus and the SAX locations, a 0.76 square arcminute error box, is consistent
with that of an optical transient source and an extended object, possibly a
galaxy. We also present the time history, peak flux, and fluence of this event,
and derive a model-independent lower limit to the source distance of ~11000 AU.
