The Gamow-Teller strength distribution function, B(GT), for the odd Z parent
$^{51}$V, $N-Z$ =5, up to 30 MeV of excitation energy in the daughter $^{51}$Ti
is calculated in the domain of proton-neutron Quasiparticle Random Phase
Approximation (pn-QRPA) theory. The pn-QRPA results are compared against other
theoretical calculations, (n, p) and high resolution (d, $^{2}$He) reaction
experiments. For the case of (d, $^{2}$He) reaction the calibration was
performed for $0\leq E_{j} \leq 5.0$ MeV, where the contributors stressed that
within this excitation energy range the $\Delta L = 0$ transition strength can
be extracted with high accuracy for $^{51}$V. Within this energy range the
current pn-QRPA total B(GT) strength 0.75 is in good agreement with the (d,
$^{2}$He) experiment's total strength of 0.9 $\pm$ 0.1. The pn-QRPA calculated
Gamow-Teller centroid at 4.20 MeV in daughter $^{51}$Ti is also in good
agreement with high resolution (d, $^{2}$He) experiment which placed the
Gamow-Teller centroid at 4.1 $\pm$ 0.4 MeV in daughter $^{51}$Ti. The low
energy detailed Gamow-Teller structure and Gamow-Teller centroid play a
sumptuous role in associated weak decay rates and consequently affect the
stellar dynamics. The stellar weak rates are sensitive to the location and
structure of these low-lying states in daughter $^{51}$Ti. The calculated
electron capture rates on $^{51}$V in stellar matter are also in good agreement
with the large scale shell model rates.
