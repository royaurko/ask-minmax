The Sc galaxy M99 in the Virgo cluster has been strongly affected by tidal
interactions and recent close encounters, responsible for an asymmetric spiral
pattern and a high star formation rate. Our XMM-Newton study shows that the
inner disk is dominated by hot plasma at kT ~ 0.30 keV, with a total X-ray
luminosity ~ 10^{41} erg/s in the 0.3--12 keV band. At the outskirts of the
galaxy, away from the main star-forming regions, there is an ultraluminous
X-ray source (ULX) with an X-ray luminosity ~ 2 x 10^{40} erg/s and a hard
spectrum well fitted by a power law of photon index Gamma ~ 1.7. This source is
close to the location where a massive HI cloud appears to be falling onto the
M99 disk at a relative speed > 100 km/s. We suggest that there may be a direct
physical link between fast cloud collisions and the formation of bright ULXs,
which may be powered by accreting black holes with masses ~ 100 Msun. External
collisions may trigger large-scale dynamical collapses of protoclusters,
leading to the formation of very massive (>~ 200 Msun) stellar progenitors; we
argue that such stars may later collapse into massive black holes if their
metal abundance is sufficiently low.
