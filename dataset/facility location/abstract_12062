We demonstrate sub-wavelength sectioning on biological samples with a
conventional confocal microscope. This optical sectioning is achieved by the
phenomenon of supercritical angle fuorescence, wherein only a fluorophore next
to the interface of a refractive index discontinuity can emit propagating
components of radiation into the so-called forbidden angles. The simplicity of
this technique allows it to be integrated with a high numerical aperture
confocal scanning microscope by only a simple modi?cation on the detection
channel. Confocal-SAF microscopy would be a powerful tool to achieve high
resolution surface imaging, especially for membrane imaging in biological
samples
