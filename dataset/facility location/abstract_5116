Many popular robust estimators are $U$-quantiles, most notably the
Hodges-Lehmann location estimator and the $Q_n$ scale estimator. We prove a
functional central limit theorem for the sequential $U$-quantile process
without any moment assumptions and under weak short-range dependence
conditions. We further devise an estimator for the long-run variance and show
its consistency, from which the convergence of the studentized version of the
sequential $U$-quantile process to a standard Brownian motion follows. This
result can be used to construct CUSUM-type change-point tests based on
$U$-quantiles, which do not rely on bootstrapping procedures. We demonstrate
this approach in detail at the example of the Hodges-Lehmann estimator for
robustly detecting changes in the central location. A simulation study confirms
the very good robustness and efficiency properties of the test. Two real-life
data sets are analyzed.
