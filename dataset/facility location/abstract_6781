We prove a logarithmic estimate in the Hardy-Sobolev space $H^{k, 2}$, $k$ a
positive integer, of the unit disk ${\mathbb D}$. This estimate extends those
previously established by L. Baratchart and M. Zerner in $H^{1,2}$ and by S.
Chaabane and I. Feki in $H^{k,\infty}$. We use it to derive logarithmic
stability results for the inverse problem of identifying Robin's coefficients
in corrosion detection by electrostatic boundary measurements and for a
recovery interpolation scheme in the Hardy-Sobolev space $H^{k, 2}$ with
interpolation points located on the boundary ${\mathbb T}$ of the unit disk.
