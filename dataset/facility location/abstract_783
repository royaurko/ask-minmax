Pentaquark states in lattice QCD probably lie close in energy to two particle
scattering states. Correctly identifying the resonant state is a challenging,
yet tractable, problem given the terascale computing facilities available
today. We summarize the initial round of exploratory lattice calculations and
discuss what should be accomplished in the next round.
