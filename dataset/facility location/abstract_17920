Using the OMNI data for period 1976-2000 we investigate the temporal profiles
of 20 plasma and field parameters in the disturbed large-scale types of solar
wind (SW): CIR, ICME (both MC and Ejecta) and Sheath as well as the
interplanetary shock (IS). To take into account the different durations of SW
types, we use the double superposed epoch analysis (DSEA) method: re-scaling
the duration of the interval for all types in such a manner that, respectively,
beginning and end for all intervals of selected type coincide. As the analyzed
SW types can interact with each other and change parameters as a result of such
interaction, we investigate separately 8 sequences of SW types: (1) CIR, (2)
IS/CIR, (3) Ejecta, (4) Sheath/Ejecta, (5) IS/Sheath/Ejecta, (6) MC, (7)
Sheath/MC, and (8) IS/Sheath/MC. The main conclusion is that the behavior of
parameters in Sheath and in CIR are very similar both qualitatively and
quantitatively. Both the high-speed stream (HSS) and the fast ICME play a role
of pistons which push the plasma located ahead them. The increase of speed in
HSS and ICME leads at first to formation of compression regions (CIR and
Sheath, respectively), and then to IS. The occurrence of compression regions
and IS increases the probability of growth of magnetospheric activity.
