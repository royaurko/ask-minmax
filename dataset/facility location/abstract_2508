The excitation spectra in the deformed nucleus 228Th have been studied by
means of the (p,t)-reaction, using the Q3D spectrograph facility at the Munich
Tandem accelerator. The angular distributions of tritons were measured for
about 110 excitations seen in the triton spectra up to 2.5 MeV. Firm 0+
assignments are made for 17 excited states by comparison of experimental
angular distributions with the calculated ones using the CHUCK3 code.
Assignments up to spin 6+ are made for other states. Sequences of states are
selected which can be treated as rotational bands and as multiplets of
excitations. Moments of inertia have been derived from these sequences, whose
values may be considered as evidence of the two-phonon nature of most 0+
excitations. Experimental data are compared with interacting boson model and
quasiparticle-phonon model calculations and with experimental data for 229Pa.
