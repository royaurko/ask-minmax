The next core-collapse supernova in our Galaxy will be a spectacular event,
with some $10^4$ neutrino detections in total expected among several detectors.
This data will allow unprecedented tests of neutrino properties and new
opportunities in astrophysics. In this paper, I focus on two main topics: (1)
Measurement of the $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$ masses by time-of-flight, with an
emphasis on introducing as little supernova model dependence as possible, and
(2) Methods for locating a supernova by its neutrinos in advance of the light,
which may allow improved astronomical observations. In the latter, I also
discuss the recent result that the positrons from $\bar{\nu}_e + p \to e^+ + n$
are not isotropically emitted, as commonly thought.
