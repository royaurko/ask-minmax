We study how the influence of structural correlations in disordered systems
manifests itself in experimentally measurable magnitudes, focusing on dc
conductance of semiconductor superlattices with general potential profiles. We
show that the existence of bands of extended states in these structures gives
rise to very noticeable peaks in the finite temperature dc conductance as the
chemical potential is moved through the bands or as the temperature is
increased from zero. On the basis of these results we discuss how dc
conductance measurements can provide information on the location and width of
the bands of extended states. Our predictions can be used to demonstrate
experimentally that structural correlations inhibit the localization effects of
disorder.
