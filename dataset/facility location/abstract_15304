We present the unfiltered ROTSE-III light curve of the optical transient
associated with GRB 050319 beginning 4 s after the cessation of gamma-ray
activity. We fit a power-law function to the data using the revised trigger
time given by Chincarini et al. (2005), and a smoothly broken power-law to the
data using the original trigger disseminated through the GCN notices. Including
the RAPTOR data from Wozniak et al. (2005), the best fit power-law indices are
alpha=-0.854 (+/- 0.014) for the single power-law and alpha_1=-0.364 (+/-
0.020), alpha_2= -0.881 (+/- 0.030), with a break at t_b = 418 (+/- 30) s for
the smoothly broken fit. We discuss the fit results with emphasis placed on the
importance of knowing the true start time of the optical transient for this
multi-peaked burst. As Swift continues to provide prompt GRB locations, it
becomes more important to answer the question, "when does the afterglow begin"
to correctly interpret the light curves.
