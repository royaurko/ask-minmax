We present the results of a search for globular clusters in the surroundings
of 15 low surface brightness dwarf galaxies belonging to the Fornax Cluster,
which was carried out on CCD images obtained with the C and T1 filters of the
Washington photometric system. The globular cluster candidates show an extended
and probably bimodal (C-T1) color distribution, which is inconsistent with the
presence of a single population of metal-poor clusters detected in several
dwarf galaxies. The surface number density of these candidates shows no
concentration towards the respective dwarf galaxies, in whose outskirts they
have been identified. On the contrary, if we split the candidates in two groups
according to their projected distances to the center of the Fornax Cluster,
those located closer to the center show a higher projected density than those
located farther from it. These results suggest that the potential globular
clusters might not be bound to the dwarf galaxies. Alternatively, these
globulars could form part of the very peripheral regions of NGC 1399 (the
central galaxy of the Fornax Cluster) or even belong to the intracluster
medium.
