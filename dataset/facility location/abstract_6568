In this paper we describe an architecture which: Permits the deployment and
execution of components in appropriate geographical locations. Provides
security mechanisms that prevent misuse of the architecture. Supports a
programming model that is familiar to application programmers. Permits
installed components to share data. Permits the deployed components to
communicate via communication channels. Provides evolution mechanisms
permitting the dynamic rearrangement of inter-connection topologies the
components that they connect. Supports the specification and deployment of
distributed component deployments.
