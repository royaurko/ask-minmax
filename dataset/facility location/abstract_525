Observations of the standard late type M8 star LHS 2397aA were obtained at
the ESO-VLT 8m telescope ``Yepun'' using the NAOS/CONICA Adaptive Optics
facility. The observations were taken during the NACO commissioning, and the
infrared standard star LHS 2397aA was observed in the H, and Ks broad band
filters. In both bands the brown dwarf companion LHS2397aB was detected. Using
a program recently developed (Bouy et al., 2003) for the detection of stellar
binaries we calculated the principal astrometric parameters (angular binary
separation and position angle P.A.) and the photometry of LHS 2397aA and LHS
2397aB. Our study largely confirms previous results obtained with the
AO-Hokupa'a facility at Gemini-North (Freed et al., 2003); however a few
discrepancies are observed.
