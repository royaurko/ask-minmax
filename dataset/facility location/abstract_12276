We show that a metamaterial slab with arbitrary values of epsilon and mu
behaves as a cloak at a finite frequency for a small object located
sufficiently close to it due to the suppression of the object's optical
excitations by enhanced reflections. Reflections due to propagating components
can partially suppress the excitation while evanescent components can cloak the
object completely. In particular, a Veselago slab with epsilon = mu = -1 + i
delta, as well as a class of anisotropic negative refractive index slabs, can
completely cloak the small object placed within a finite distance from the slab
when delta -> 0.
