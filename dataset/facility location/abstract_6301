This work analyzed genome-wide nucleotide distribution patterns in ten insect
genomes. Two internal measures were applied: (i) GC variation and (ii) third
codon nucleotide preference. Although the genome size and overall GC level did
not show any correlation with insect order, the internal measures usually
displayed higher levels of consistency. GC variations in genomes of
hymenopteran insects, honeybee and wasp, ranked highest among all eukaryotic
genomes analyzed by us. Genomes of honeybee and beetle, insects of different
orders with similar overall GC levels, showed significant internal differences.
Honeybee genome stood out as unusual due to its high GC variation and
'left-handed' gene locations.
