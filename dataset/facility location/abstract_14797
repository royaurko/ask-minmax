We have observed two fields - Field-I (l=3.2 degrees, b=-1.0 degree) and
Field-II (l=356.8 degrees, b=-0.1 degree) with the Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope (GMRT) at 330 MHz. In the first field, we have studied the candidate
supernova remnant (SNR) G3.1-0.6 and based on its observed morphology, spectral
index and polarisation confirmed it to be an SNR. We find this supernova to
have a double ring appearance with a strip of emission on it's western side
passing through it's centre.
  We have discovered two extended curved objects in the second field, which
appears to be part of a large shell like structure. It is possibly the remains
of an old supernova in the region. Three suspected supernova remnants,
G356.3-0.3, G356.6+0.1 and G357.1-0.2 detected in the MOST 843 MHz survey of
the Galactic Centre region appears to be located on this shell like structure.
While both G356.3-0.3 and G356.6+0.1 seem to be parts of this shell, G357.1-0.2
which has a steeper spectrum above 1 GHz, could be a background SNR seen
through the region. Our HI absorption observation towards the candidate SNR
G357.1-0.2 indicates that it is at a distance of more than 6 kpc from us.
