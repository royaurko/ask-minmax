Starting in the summer of 2007, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will collide
proton beams at center-of-mass energies of 14 TeV exceeding by a factor of ten
what was previously achieved. It will be located in the 27km long underground
tunnel, in which the Large Electron Positron collider (LEP) was working until
the year 2000. The Large Hadron Collider is a part of the accelerator complex
of the European Laboratory of Particle Physics (CERN), situated on the
Franco-Swiss border close to Geneva.
