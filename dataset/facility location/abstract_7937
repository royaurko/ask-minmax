The Kiso Supernova Survey (KISS) is a high-cadence optical wide-field
supernova (SN) survey. The primary goal of the survey is to catch the very
early light of a SN, during the shock breakout phase. Detection of SN shock
breakouts combined with multi-band photometry obtained with other facilities
would provide detailed physical information on the progenitor stars of SNe. The
survey is performed using a 2.2x2.2 deg field-of-view instrument on the 1.05-m
Kiso Schmidt telescope, the Kiso Wide Field Camera (KWFC). We take a
three-minute exposure in g-band once every hour in our survey, reaching
magnitude g~20-21. About 100 nights of telescope time per year have been spent
on the survey since April 2012. The number of the shock breakout detections is
estimated to be of order of 1 during our 3-year project. This paper summarizes
the KISS project including the KWFC observing setup, the survey strategy, the
data reduction system, and CBET-reported SNe discovered so far by KISS.
