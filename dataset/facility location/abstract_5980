A unified theory of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is presented for
multi-band ferromagnetic metallic systems with dilute impurities. In the clean
limit, the AHE is mostly due to the extrinsic skew-scattering. When the Fermi
level is located around anti-crossing of band dispersions split by spin-orbit
interaction, the intrinsic AHE to be calculated ab initio is resonantly
enhanced by its non-perturbative nature, revealing the extrinsic-to-intrinsic
crossover which occurs when the relaxation rate is comparable to the spin-orbit
interaction energy.
