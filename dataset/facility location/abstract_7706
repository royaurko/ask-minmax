We have detected bright HC7N J = 21-20 emission toward multiple locations in
the Serpens South cluster-forming region using the K-Band Focal Plane Array at
the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope. HC7N is seen primarily toward cold
filamentary structures that have yet to form stars, largely avoiding the dense
gas associated with small protostellar groups and the main central cluster of
Serpens South. Where detected, the HC7N abundances are similar to those found
in other nearby star forming regions. Toward some HC7N `clumps', we find
consistent variations in the line centroids relative to NH3 (1,1) emission, as
well as systematic increases in the HC7N non-thermal line widths, which we
argue reveal infall motions onto dense filaments within Serpens South with
minimum mass accretion rates of M ~ 2-5 M_sun Myr^-1. The relative abundance of
NH3 to HC7N suggests that the HC7N is tracing gas that has been at densities n
~ 10^4 cm^-3, for timescales t < 1-2 x 10^5 yr. Since HC7N emission peaks are
rarely co-located with those of either NH3 or continuum, it is likely that
Serpens South is not particularly remarkable in its abundance of HC7N, but
instead the serendipitous mapping of HC7N simultaneously with NH3 has allowed
us to detect HC7N at low abundances in regions where it otherwise may not have
been looked for. This result extends the known star-forming regions containing
significant HC7N emission from typically quiescent regions, like the Taurus
molecular cloud, to more complex, active environments.
