This paper presents an on-the-fly uniformization technique for the analysis
of time-inhomogeneous Markov population models. This technique is applicable to
models with infinite state spaces and unbounded rates, which are, for instance,
encountered in the realm of biochemical reaction networks. To deal with the
infinite state space, we dynamically maintain a finite subset of the states
where most of the probability mass is located. This approach yields an
underapproximation of the original, infinite system. We present experimental
results to show the applicability of our technique.
