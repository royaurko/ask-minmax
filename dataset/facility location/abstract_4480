M82 B is an old starburst site located in the eastern part of the M82 disc.
We derive the distributions of age and metallicity of the star clusters located
in this region of M82 by using theoretical evolutionary population synthesis
models. Our analysis is based on the comparison of the $BVIJ$ photometry
obtained by de Grijs et al. (2001) with the colours of single-generation
stellar populations. We show that M82 B went through a chemical enrichment
phase up to super-solar metallicities around the time of the last close
encounter between M82 and its large neighbour galaxy M81. We date and confirm
the event triggering the enhanced cluster formation at about 1 Gyr ago. At
almost the same time an additional, distinct subpopulation of metal-poor
clusters formed in the part of M82 B nearest to the galactic centre. The
formation of these peculiar clusters may be related to infall of circumgalactic
gas onto M82 B.
