Speckle interferometric technique is used to record a series of short
exposure images of several close binary stars with sub-arcsecond separation
through a narrow band filter centred at H$\alpha$ at the Cassegrain focus of
the 2.34 meter Vainu Bappu telescope (VBT), situated at Vainu Bappu Observatory
(VBO), Kavalur. The auto-correlation method is developed under Image Reduction
Analysis Facility (IRAF). Wiener filter is included in the programme to
eliminate spurious high frequency contributions; a few sets of data provide the
optimised results. The auto-correlated image of these stars gives the
separation of the binary components.
