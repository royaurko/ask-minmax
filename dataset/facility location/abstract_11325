Using molecular dynamics we investigate the thermodynamics, dynamics and
structure of 250 diatomic molecules interacting by a core-softened potential.
This system exhibits thermodynamics, dynamics and structural anomalies: a
maximum in density-temperature plane at constante pressure and maximum and
minimum points in the diffusivity and translational order parameter against
density at constant temperature. Starting with very dense systems and
decreasing density the mobility at low temperatures first increases, reach a
maximum, then decreases, reach a minimum and finally increases. In the
pressure-temperature phase diagram the line of maximum translational order
parameter is located outside the line of diffusivity extrema that is enclosing
the temperature of maximum density line. We compare our results with the
monomeric system showing that the anisotropy due to the dumbbell leads to a
much larger solid phase and to the appearance of a liquid crystal phase. the
double ranged thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies.
