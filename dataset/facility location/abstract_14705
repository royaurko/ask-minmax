We present the results of deep ASCA observations of two shell-like radio
supernova remnants (SNRs) located in the direction to the Galactic center (GC)
region. Unlike the radio morphology, G359.1-0.5 shows center-filled X-rays with
prominent K-alpha lines of He-like silicon and H-like sulfur. The plasma
requires at least two temperature components: a silicon-dominated cool plasma
of 0.6keV temperature and a sulfur-dominated higher temperature plasma of
4.4keV. Because the absorption column is ~ 6x10^22 H cm^-2, this SNR would be
near to the GC. The spherical plasma is attributable to supernova ejecta with
the total mass of Si and S being about 0.1 solar mass and 0.3 solar mass,
respectively. X-rays from G359.0-0.9 trace the partial shell structure of the
radio emission. The spectrum is well fitted to a single-temperature plasma of
0.4keV with a non-solar abundance of magnesium or iron. Because the absorption
column is not very large, ~ 1.8x10^22 H cm^-2, G359.0-0.9 would be in front of
the GC region. The total supernova energy, interstellar density near to the
X-ray emitting shell and age of the SNR are estimated to be 1.2x10^51erg,
0.5cm^-3, and 1.8x10^4yr, respectively. We also discuss possible implications
on the origin of the large-scale hot plasma surrounding the GC.
