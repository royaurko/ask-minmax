We investigate the impact of different initial conditions for the initial
density profile and the initial turbulence on the formation process of
protostellar clusters. We study the collapse of dense molecula r cloud cores
with three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations. We focus our
discussion on the distribution of the gas among the protostellar objects in the
turbulent dynamical cores. Despite the large variations in the initial
configurations and the resulting gas and cluster morphology we find that all
stellar clusters follow a very similar gas accretion behaviour. Once secondary
protostars begin to form, the central region of a cluster is efficiently
shielded from further accretion. Hence, objects located close to the centre are
starved of material, as indicated by a strong decrease of the central acc
retion rate. This Fragmentation Induced Starvation occurs not only in
rotationally supported discs and filaments, but also in more spherically
symmetric clusters with complex chaotic motions.
