Recently, the HESS collaboration has reported the detection of gamma-ray
emission above a few hundred GeV from eight new sources located close to the
Galactic Plane. The source HESS J1813-178 has sparked particular interest, as
subsequent radio observations imply an association with SNR G12.82-0.02.
Triggered by the detection in VHE gamma-rays, a positionally coincident source
has also been found in INTEGRAL and ASCA data. In this Letter we present MAGIC
observations of HESS J1813-178, resulting in the detection of a differential
gamma-ray flux consistent with a hard-slope power law, described as dN/(dA dt
dE) = (3.3+/-0.5)*10^{-12} (E/TeV)^{-2.1+/-0.2} cm^(-2)s^(-1)TeV^(-1). We
briefly discuss the observational technique used, the procedure implemented for
the data analysis, and put this detection in the perspective of multifrequency
observations.
