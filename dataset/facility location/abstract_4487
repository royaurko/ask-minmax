The young open star cluster M25 (IC 4725) is located in the direction of the
galactic center in a crowded region, near much irregular absorption features on
Sagittarius arm. This cluster has some difficult observing problems due to its
southern location. The mass data available in the literature have been gathered
to reinvestigate this cluster using most photometric tools to determine its
main photometric parameters. This system is found to be at a distance of 600 pc
from the sun, of -52.82 pc from the galactic plane; and the median age is 9.45
x 10^(7) yr. More than 220 stars with mean reddening of 0.50 mag and absorption
of 1.62 mag are found within the cluster.
