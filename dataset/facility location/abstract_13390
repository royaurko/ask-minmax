Structural excitations of model Lennard-Jones glass systems are investigated
using the Activation-Relaxation-Technique (ART), which explores the potential
energy landscape of a local minimum energy configuration by converging to a
nearby saddle-point configuration. Performing ART results in a distribution of
barrier energies that is single-peaked for well relaxed samples. The present
work characterises such atomic scale excitations in terms of their local
structure and environment. It is found that, at zero applied stress, many of
the identified events consist of chain-like excitations that can either be
extended or ring-like in their geometry. The location and activation energy of
these saddle-point structures are found to correlate with the type of atom
involved, and with spatial regions that have low shear moduli and are close to
the excess free volume within the configuration. Such correlations are however
weak and more generally the identified local structural excitations are seen to
exist throughout the model glass sample. The work concludes with a discussion
within the framework of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ relaxation processes that are
known to occur in the under-cooled liquid regime.
