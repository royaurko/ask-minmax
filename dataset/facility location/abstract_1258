The location of the energy levels of rare-earth (RE) elements in the energy
band diagram of BaF2 and CdF2 crystals is determined. The role of RE3+ and RE2+
ions in the capture of charge carriers, luminescence, and the formation of
radiation defects is evaluated. It is shown that the substantial difference in
the luminescence properties of BaF2:RE and CdF2:RE is associated with the
location of the excited energy levels in the band diagram of the crystals.
