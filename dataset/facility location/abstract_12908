Accurate parameter estimation of gravitational waves from coalescing compact
binary sources is a key requirement for gravitational-wave astronomy.
Evaluating the posterior probability density function of the binary's
parameters (component masses, sky location, distance, etc.) requires computing
millions of waveforms. The computational expense of parameter estimation is
dominated by waveform generation and scales linearly with the waveform
computational cost. Previous work showed that gravitational waveforms from
non-spinning compact binary sources are amenable to a truncated singular value
decomposition, which allows them to be reconstructed via interpolation at fixed
computational cost. However, the accuracy requirement for parameter estimation
is typically higher than for searches, so it is crucial to ascertain that
interpolation does not lead to significant errors. Here we provide a proof of
principle to show that interpolated waveforms can be used to recover posterior
probability density functions with negligible loss in accuracy with respect to
non-interpolated waveforms. This technique has the potential to significantly
increase the efficiency of parameter estimation.
