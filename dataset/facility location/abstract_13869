We report 7Li-NMR studies on LiInCr4O8 and LiGaCr4O8, in which Cr3+ ions with
spin 3/2 form a breathing pyrochlore lattice, a network of tetrahedra with
alternating sizes. In LiInCr4O8 with large alternation, the nuclear relaxation
rate 1/T1 shows an activated temperature (T) dependence down to 18 K,
indicating a singlet ground state with a spin gap. This behavior, however, is
disrupted by an antiferromagnetic (AF) transition at 13 K, which is preceded by
another, most likely structural, transition at 16 K. In contrast, LiGaCr4O8
with small alternation shows no spin gap but exhibits a first-order AF
transition over a distributed T-range 13-20 K. Nevertheless, 1/T1 of the
paramagnetic phase diverges toward 13 K, indicating proximity to a second-order
transition. The results indicate that LiGaCr4O8 is located in the vicinity of a
tricritical point in the phase diagram.
