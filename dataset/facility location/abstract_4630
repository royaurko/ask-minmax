The neutral mutation rate is known to vary widely along human chromosomes,
leading to mutational hot and cold regions. We provide evidence that categories
of functionally-related genes reside preferentially in mutationally hot or cold
regions, the size of which we have measured. Genes in hot regions are biased
toward extra-cellular communication (surface receptors, cell adhesion, immune
response, etc.) while those in cold regions are biased toward essential
cellular processes (gene regulation, RNA processing, protein modification,
etc.). From a selective perspective, this organization of genes could minimize
the mutational load on genes that need to be conserved and allow fast evolution
for genes that must frequently adapt. We also analyze the effect of gene
duplication and chromosomal recombination, which contribute significantly to
these biases for certain categories of hot genes. Overall, our results show
that genes are located non-randomly with respect to hot and cold regions,
offering the possibility that selection acts at the level of gene location in
the human genome.
