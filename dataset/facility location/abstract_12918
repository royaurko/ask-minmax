We present and discuss a new catalogue of 52 compact HII regions in the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and a newly created deep 1420 MHz (\lambda=20 cm)
radio-continuum image of the N19 region located in the southwestern part of the
SMC. The new images were created by merging 1420 MHz radio-continuum archival
data from the Australian Telescope Compact Array. The majority of these
detected radio compact HII regions have rather flat spectral indices which
indicates, as expected, that the dominant emission mechanism is of thermal
nature.
