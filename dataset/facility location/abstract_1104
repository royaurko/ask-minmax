Injection performance of storage ring is one of the important factors for the
light efficiency and quality of Synchrotron Radiation Facility when it is in
top-up mode. To evaluate the injection performance of storage ring at SSRF, we
build a bunch-by-bunch position measuring system based on oscilloscope IOC.
Accurate assessment of energy mismatching, distribution of residual oscillation
and angle error of injection kickers can be achieved by this system.
