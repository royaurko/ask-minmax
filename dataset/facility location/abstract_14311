Technology offers new ways to measure the locations of the players and of the
ball in sports. This translates to the trajectories the ball takes on the field
as a result of the tactics the team applies. The challenge professionals in
soccer are facing is to take the reverse path: given the trajectories of the
ball is it possible to infer the underlying strategy/tactic of a team? We
propose a method based on Dynamic Time Warping to reveal the tactics of a team
through the analysis of repeating series of events. Based on the analysis of an
entire season, we derive insights such as passing strategies for maintaining
ball possession or counter attacks, and passing styles with a focus on the team
or on the capabilities of the individual players.
