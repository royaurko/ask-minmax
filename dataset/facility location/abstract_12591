We prove that a two-spherical split Kac-Moody group over a local field
naturally provides a topological twin building in the sense of Kramer. This
existence result and the local-to-global principle for twin building topologies
combined with the theory of Moufang foundations as introduced and studied by
M\"uhlherr, Ronan, and Tits allows one to immediately obtain a classification
of two-spherical split Moufang topological twin buildings whose underlying
Coxeter diagram contains no loop and no isolated vertices.
