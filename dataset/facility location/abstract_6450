The lateral distribution function of high energy muons in EAS around the knee
($5.9\le \lg N_e \le 7.1$) has been measured for near vertical showers ($\theta
\le 20^{\circ}$, effective muon threshold energy is 230 GeV). The measurements
have been performed at the Baksan Underground Scintillation Telescope (BUST).
The electromagnetic component is measured by the "Andyrchy" EAS array, located
above the BUST. The knee in EAS size spectrum is found to be at $\lg N_e
\approx 6.3$. The experimental results are compared with Monte Carlo
simulations.
