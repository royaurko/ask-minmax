We report on sub-bandgap optoelectronic phenomena of hydrogen-terminated
diamond patterned with a submicron oxidized line. The line acts as an energy
barrier for the two-dimensional hole gas located below the hydrogenated diamond
surface. A photoconductive gain of the hole conductivity across the barrier is
measured for sub-bandgap illumination. The findings are consistent with
photogenerated electrons being trapped in defect levels within the barrier. We
discuss the spatial and energetic characteristics of the optoelectronic
phenomena, as well as possible photocurrent effects.
