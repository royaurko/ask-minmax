It is very difficult to find archival images of solar system objects. While
regular archive searches can find images at a fixed location, they cannot find
images of moving targets. Archival images have become increasingly useful to
galactic and stellar astronomers the last few years but, until now, solar
system researchers have been at a disadvantage in this respect. The Solar
System Object Search (SSOS) at the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre allows users
to search for images of moving objects. SSOS accepts as input either a list of
observations, an object designation, a set of orbital elements, or a
user-generated ephemeris for an object. It then searches for images containing
that object over a range of dates. The user is then presented with a list of
images containing that object from a variety of archives. Initially created to
search the CFHT MegaCam archive, SSOS has been extended to other telescope
archives including Gemini, Subaru/SuprimeCam, HST, several ESO instruments and
the SDSS for a total of 6.5 million images. The SSOS tool is located on the web
