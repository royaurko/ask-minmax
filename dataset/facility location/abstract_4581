In order to detect the rare astrophysical events that generate gravitational
wave (GW) radiation, sufficient stability is required for GW antennas to allow
long-term observation. In practice, seismic excitation is one of the most
common disturbances effecting stable operation of suspended-mirror laser
interferometers. A straightforward means to allow more stable operation is
therefore to locate the antenna, the ``observatory'', at a ``quiet'' site. A
laser interferometer gravitational wave antenna with a baseline length of 20m
(LISM) was developed at a site 1000m underground, near Kamioka, Japan. This
project was a unique demonstration of a prototype laser interferometer for
gravitational wave observation located underground. The extremely stable
environment is the prime motivation for going underground. In this paper, the
demonstrated ultra-stable operation of the interferometer and a well-maintained
antenna sensitivity are reported.
