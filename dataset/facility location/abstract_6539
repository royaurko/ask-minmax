Given a compactly supported probability measure on a Riemannian manifold, we
study the asymptotic speed at which it can be approximated (in Wasserstein
distance of any exponent p) by finitely supported measure. This question has
been studied under the names of ``quantization of distributions'' and, when
p=1, ``location problem''. When p=2, it is linked with Centroidal Voronoi
Tessellations.
