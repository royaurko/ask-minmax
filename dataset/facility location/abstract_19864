We study the electronic states for Ca_{2-x}Sr_{x}RuO_{4} in $0.5\leq x \leq
2$ within the Gutzwiller approximation (GA) on the basis of the three-orbital
Hubbard model for the Ru t_{2g} orbitals. The main effects of the Ca
substitution are taken account as the changes of the $dp$ hybridizations
between the Ru 4d and O 2p orbitals. Using the numerical minimization of the
energy obtained in the GA, we obtain the renormalization factor (RF) of the
kinetic energy and total RF, which estimates the inverse of the mass
enhancement, for three cases with the effective models of x=2 and 0.5 and a
special model. We find that the inverse of the total RF becomes the largest for
the case of x=0.5, and that the van Hove singularity, which is located on
(below) the Fermi level for the special model (the effective model of x=0.5),
plays a secondary role in enhancing the effective mass. Our calculation
suggests that the heavy fermion behavior around x=0.5 comes from the
cooperative effects between moderately strong Coulomb interaction compared to
the total bandwidth and the modification of the electronic structures due to
the rotation of RuO_{6} octahedra (i.e., the variation of the $dp\pi$
hybridizations and the downward shift for the $d_{xy}$ orbital). We propose
that moderately strong electron correlation and the orbital-dependent
modifications of the electronic structures due to the lattice distortions play
important roles in the electronic states for Ca_{2-x}Sr_{x}RuO_{4}.
