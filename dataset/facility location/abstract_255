The Advanced Superconducting Test Acccelerator (ASTA) is being constructed at
Fermilab. The existing New Muon Lab (NML) building is being converted for this
facility. The accelerator will consist of an electron gun, injector, beam
acceleration section consisting of 3 TTF-type or ILC-type cryomodules, multiple
downstream beamlines for testing diagnostics and conducting various beam tests,
and a high power beam dump. When completed, it is envisioned that this facility
will initially be capable of generating a 750-MeV electron beam with ILC beam
intensity. An expansion of this facility was recently completed that will
provide the capability to upgrade the accelerator to a total beam energy of
1.5-GeV. Two new buildings were also constructed adjacent to the ASTA facility
to house a new cryogenic plant and multiple superconducting RF (SRF) cryomodule
test stands. In addition to testing accelerator components, this facility will
be used to test RF power systems, instrumentation, and control systems for
future SRF accelerators such as the ILC and Project-X. This paper describes the
current status and overall plans for this facility.
