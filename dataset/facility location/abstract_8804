We report on the discovery of an unresolved X-ray source inside the supernova
remnant G315.4-2.3 (RCW 86). The source is located 7' to the Southwest of the
geometrical centre and may be close to the actual explosion centre of the
supernova, which makes this a candidate for the stellar remnant associated with
RCW 86. However, the presence of a possible optical counterpart with $V \sim
14$ at 3" from the X-ray position and evidence for long term variability means
that the source is probably an active star. A better X-ray position and better
X-ray spectroscopy along with an identification of the optical source are
needed to exclude the X-ray source as a neutron star candidate.
