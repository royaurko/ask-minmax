A long debate has ensued about the relationship of weather conditions and
Antarctic exploration. In no place on Earth is exploration, human existence,
and scientific research so weather dependent. By using an artificial neural
network simulation, historical (Heroic Age) and modern weather data from manned
and automated stations, placed at different locations of the Ross Ice Shelf,
and the Ross Island, I have examined minimum near surface air temperatures. All
modern meteorological data, as well as historical data of Cherry-Garrard, high
correlations between temperatures at different locations, and artificial neural
network retrodiction of modern and historical temperature data, point out the
oddity of Captain Scott's temperature recordings from February 27 - March 19,
1912. I was able to show that in this period the actual minimum near surface
air temperature was on the average about 13{\deg}F(7{\deg}C) above that
reported by Captain Scott and his party. On the basis of the mentioned evidence
I concluded that the real minimum near surface air temperature data was altered
by Lt. Bowers and Captain Scott to inflate and dramatize the weather
conditions.
