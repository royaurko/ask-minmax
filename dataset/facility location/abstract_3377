Velocity and energy spectra of the light charged particles (protons and
$\alpha$-particles) emitted in the $^{28}$Si(E$_{lab}$ = 112 MeV) + $^{28}$Si
reaction have been measured at the Strasbourg VIVITRON Tandem facility. The
ICARE charged particle multidetector array was used to obtain exclusive spectra
of the light particles in the angular range 15 - 150 degree and to determine
the angular correlations of these particles with respect to the emission angles
of the evaporation residues. The experimental data are analysed in the
framework of the statistical model. The exclusive energy spectra of
$\alpha$-particles emitted from the $^{28}$Si + $^{28}$Si compound system are
generally well reproduced by Monte Carlo calculations using spin-dependent
level densities. This spin dependence approach suggests the onset of large
deformations at high spin. A re-analysis of previous $\alpha$-particle data
from the $^{30}$Si + $^{30}$Si compound system, using the same spin-dependent
parametrization, is also presented in the framework of a general discussion of
the occurrence of large deformation effects in the A$_{CN}$ ~ 60 mass region.
