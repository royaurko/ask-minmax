The multi-MW target proposed for the EURISOL facility will be based on
fission of uranium (or thorium) compounds to produce rare isotopes far from
stability. A two-step process is used for the isotope production. First,
neutrons are generated in a liquid mercury target, irradiated by the 1 GeV
proton or deuteron beam, provided by the EURISOL linac driver. Then, the
neutrons induce fission in a surrounding assembly of uranium carbide. R&D
projects on several aspects of the target assembly are ongoing. Key criteria
for the target design are a maximum beam power capability of 4 MW, a remote
handling system with minimum downtime and maximum reliability, as well as
radiation safety, minimization of hazards and the classification of the
facility. In the framework of the ongoing radiation characterization and safety
studies, radiation transport simulations have been performed to calculate the
prompt radiation dose in the target and surrounding materials, as well as to
determine shielding material and angle-dependent parameters. In this paper, we
report the results of these studies and the proposed radiation shield design
for the multi-MW target area. Furthermore, accurate estimates have been
performed of the amount of fissile elements being produced in the uranium
target assembly, for typical running conditions, in order to understand the
implications for the classification of the facility. The results are reported
and briefly discussed.
