High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has many applications ranging from
thermal ablation of cancer to hemostasis. Although focused ultrasound can seal
a bleeding site, physical mechanisms of acoustic hemostasis are not fully
understood yet. To understand better the interaction between different physical
mechanisms involved in hemostasis a mathematical model of acoustic hemostasis
is developed. This model comprises the nonlinear Westervelt equation and the
bioheat equations in tissue and blood vessel. In the three dimensional domain,
the nonlinear hemodynamic equations are coupled with the acoustic and thermal
equations. Convected cooling and acoustic streaming effects are incorporated in
the modeling study. Several sonication angles and two wound shapes have been
studied. The optimal focal point location is at the rear of the wound and the
optimal angle is 45$^0$.
