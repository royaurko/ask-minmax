We study an extended Skyrme model which includes fourth and sixth-order
terms. We explore some static properties like the $\Delta$-nucleon mass
splitting and investigate the Skyrmion breathing mode in the framework of the
linear response theory. We find that the monopole response function has a
pronounced peak located at $\sim$ 400 MeV, which we identify to the Roper
resonance $N(1440)$. As compared to the standard one, the extended Skyrme model
provides a more accurate description of baryon properties.
