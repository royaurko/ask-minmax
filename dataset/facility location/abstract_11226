In the previous paper \cite{Lazkoz:2006pa} was investigated the phase space
of quintom cosmologies for a class of exponential potentials. This study
suggests that the past asymptotic dynamics of such a model can be approximated
by the dynamics near a hyperbola of critical points. In this paper we obtain a
normal form expansion near a fixed point located on this equilibrium set. We
get computationally treatable system up to fourth order. From the structure of
the unstable manifold (up to fourth order) we see that that the past asymptotic
behavior of this model is given by a massless scalar field cosmology for an
open set of orbits (matching the numerical results given in
\cite{Lazkoz:2006pa}). We complement the results discussed there by including
the analysis at infinity. Although there exists unbounded orbits towards the
past, by examining the orbits at infinity, we get that the sources satisfy the
evolution rates $\dot\phi^2/V\sim\frac{2m^2}{n^2-m^2},
\dot\phi/\dot\varphi\sim-m/n,$ with $H/\dot\phi$ approaching zero.
