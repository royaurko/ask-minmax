It is the aim of the ANKE-COSY spin collaboration to carry out a well
directed programme of internationally competitive experiments involving
polarised beams and targets, using the outstanding facilities available at the
storage ring. These activities, at the same time, are good preparation for our
participation in the PAX@FAIR project.
