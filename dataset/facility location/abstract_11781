The compound FeMnP$_{0.50}$Si$_{0.50}$ has been studied by magnetic
measurements, M\"ossbauer spectroscopy and electronic structure and total
energy calculations. An unexpected high magnetic hyperfine field for Fe atoms
located at the tetrahedral Me(1) site in the Fe$_2$P structure is found. The
saturation moment derived from magnetic measurements corresponds to 4.4
$\mu_B$/f.u. at low temperatures, a value substantially higher than previously
reported, but in accord with the results from our electron structure
calculations. This high saturation moment, a first order nature of the
ferromagnetic transition and a tunable transition temperature make the
Fe$_{2-x}$Mn$_{x}$P$_{1-y}$Si$y$ system promising for magnetocaloric
applications.
