Even if a `complete set' of experimental observables were measured for the
elastic scattering or photo/electroproduction of pseudoscalar mesons,
ambiguities would remain in the extracted partial-wave and isospin decomposed
amplitudes. As these problems are not widely understood, the present work
outlines the way model-dependence enters into analyses of data from both
hadronic and electromagnetic facilities.
