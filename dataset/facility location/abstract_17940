We investigated CeNi9In2 compound, which has been considered as a mixed
valence (MV) system. Electrical resistivity vs. temperature variation was
analysed in terms of the model proposed by Freimuth for systems with unstable
4f shell. At low temperature the resistivity dependence is consistent with a
Fermi liquid state with a contribution characteristic of electron-phonon
interaction. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) studies of the
valence band did not reveal a Kondo peak down to 14 K. A difference of the
spectra obtained with photon energies of low and high photoionization cross
sections for Ce 4f electrons indicated that 4f states are located mainly close
to the Fermi energy. The peaks related to f_{5/2}^1 and f_{7/2}^1 final states
cannot be resolved but form a plateau between -0.3 eV and the Fermi energy.
X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) studies were realized for the cerium 3d
level. The analysis of XPS spectra within the Gunnarsson-Sh\"onhammer theory
yielded a hybridization parameter of 104 meV and non-integer f level
occupation, being close to 3. Calculations of partial densities of states were
realized by a full potential local orbital (FPLO) method. They confirm that the
valence band is dominated by Ni 3d states and are in general agreement with the
experiment except for the behavior of f-electrons.
