We study numerically the phase space of the evolution equation h_t = -(h^n
h_{xxx})_x - B (h^m h_x)_x . Here h(x,t) is nonnegative, n>0 and m is real, and
the Bond number B is positive.
  We pursue three goals: to investigate the nonlinear stability of the positive
periodic and constant steady states; to locate heteroclinic connecting orbits
between these steady states and the compactly supported 'droplet' steady
states; and to determine how these orbits change when the 'mobility' exponents
n and m are changed.
  For example, we change the mobility coefficients in such a way that the
steady states are unchanged and find evidence that heteroclinic orbits between
steady states are perturbed but not broken. We also find that when there appear
to be touch-down singularities, the exponent n affects whether they occur in
finite or infinite time. It also can affect whether there is one touch-down or
two touch-downs per period.
