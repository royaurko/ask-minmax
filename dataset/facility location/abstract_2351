The Pierre Auger Observatory is the largest operating cosmic ray observatory
ever built. Calorimetric measurements of extensive air showers induced by
cosmic rays are performed with a fluorescence detector. Thus, one of the main
challenges is the monitoring of the atmosphere, both in terms of atmospheric
state variables and optical properties. To better understand the atmospheric
conditions, a study of air mass trajectories above the site is presented. Such
a study has been done using an air-modelling program well known in atmospheric
sciences. Its validity has been checked using meteorological radiosonde
soundings performed at the Pierre Auger Observatory. Finally, aerosol
concentration values measured by the Central Laser Facility are compared to
backward trajectories.
