The interface between the insulating oxides LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 exhibits a
superconducting two-dimensional electron system that can be modulated by a gate
voltage. While gating of the conductivity has been probed extensively and
gating of the superconducting critical temperature has been demonstrated, the
question whether, and if so how, the gate tunes the superfluid density and
superconducting order parameter is unanswered. We present local magnetic
susceptibility, related to the superfluid density, as a function of
temperature, gate voltage and location. We show that the temperature dependence
of the superfluid density at different gate voltages collapse to a single curve
characteristic of a full superconducting gap. Further, we show that the dipole
moments observed in this system are not modulated by the gate voltage.
