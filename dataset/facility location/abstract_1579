This paper presents a morphological lexicon for English that handles more
than 317000 inflected forms derived from over 90000 stems. The lexicon is
available in two formats. The first can be used by an implementation of a
two-level processor for morphological analysis. The second, derived from the
first one for efficiency reasons, consists of a disk-based database using a
UNIX hash table facility. We also built an X Window tool to facilitate the
maintenance and browsing of the lexicon. The package is ready to be integrated
into an natural language application such as a parser through hooks written in
Lisp and C.
