We present an update of results from the search for microlensing towards the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) by EROS (Experience de Recherche d'Objets
Sombres). We have now monitored 25 million stars over three years. Because of
the small number of observed microlensing candidates (four), our results are
best presented as upper limits on the amount of dark compact objects in the
halo of our Galaxy. We discuss critically the candidates and the possible
location of the lenses, halo or LMC . We compare our results to those of the
MACHO group. Finally, we combine these new results with those from our search
towards the Small Magellanic Cloud as well as earlier ones from the EROS1 phase
of our survey. The combined data is sensitive to compact objects in the broad
mass range $ 10^{-7} - 10 $ solar masses. The derived upper limit on the
abundance of stellar mass MACHOs rules out such objects as the dominant
component of the Galactic halo if their mass is smaller than 2 solar masses.
