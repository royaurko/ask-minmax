We determine the fundamental parameters of SPB and Beta Cep candidate stars
observed by the Kepler satellite mission and estimate the expected types of
non-radial pulsators by comparing newly obtained high-resolution spectra with
synthetic spectra computed on a grid of stellar parameters assuming LTE and
check for NLTE effects for the hottest stars. For comparison, we determine Teff
independently from fitting the spectral energy distribution of the stars
obtained from the available photometry. We determine Teff, log(g),
micro-turbulent velocity, vsin(i), metallicity, and elemental abundance for 14
of the 16 candidate stars, two of the stars are spectroscopic binaries. No
significant influence of NLTE effects on the results could be found. For hot
stars, we find systematic deviations of the determined effective temperatures
from those given in the Kepler Input Catalogue. The deviations are confirmed by
the results obtained from ground-based photometry. Five stars show reduced
metallicity, two stars are He-strong, one is He-weak, and one is Si-strong. Two
of the stars could be Beta Cep/SPB hybrid pulsators, four SPB pulsators, and
five more stars are located close to the borders of the SPB instability region.
