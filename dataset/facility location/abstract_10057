This paper presents a coordination algorithm for mobile autonomous robots.
Relying upon distributed sensing the robots achieve rendezvous, that is, they
move to a common location. Each robot is a point mass moving in a nonconvex
environment according to an omnidirectional kinematic model. Each robot is
equipped with line-of-sight limited-range sensors, i.e., a robot can measure
the relative position of any object (robots or environment boundary) if and
only if the object is within a given distance and there are no obstacles
in-between. The algorithm is designed using the notions of robust visibility,
connectivity-preserving constraint sets, and proximity graphs. Simulations
illustrate the theoretical results on the correctness of the proposed
algorithm, and its performance in asynchronous setups and with sensor
measurement and control errors.
