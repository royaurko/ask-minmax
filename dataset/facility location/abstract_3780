An upgraded GARFIELD + Ring Counter (RCo) apparatus is presented with
improved performances as far as electronics and detectors are concerned. On one
side fast sampling digital read out has been extended to all detectors,
allowing for an important simplification of the signal processing chain
together with an enriched extracted information. On the other side a relevant
improvement has been made in the forward part of the setup (RCo): an increased
granularity of the CsI(Tl) crystals and a higher homogeneity in the silicon
detector resistivity. The renewed performances of the GARFIELD + RCo array make
it suitable for nuclear reaction measurements both with stable and with
Radioactive Ion Beams (RIB), like the ones foreseen for the SPES facility,
where the Physics of Isospin can be studied.
