This paper describes a novel scheme for integrating a coherent THz source in
the baseline of the LCLS facility. Any method relying on the spent electron
beam downstream of the baseline undulator should provide a way of transporting
the radiation up to the experimental floor. Here we propose to use the dump
area access maze. In this way the THz output must propagate with limited size
at least for one hundred meters in a maze, following many turns, to reach the
near experimental hall. The use of a standard, discrete, open beam-waveguide
formed by periodic reflectors, that is a mirror guide, would lead to
unacceptable size of the system. To avoid these problems, in this paper we
propose an alternative approach based on periodically spaced metallic screens
with holes. This quasi-optical transmission line is referred to as an iris
line. We present complete calculations for the iris line using both analytical
and numerical methods, which we find in good agreement. We present a design of
a THz edge radiation source based on the use of an iris line. The proposed
setup takes almost no cost nor time to be implemented at the LCLS baseline, and
can be used at other facilities as well. The edge radiation source is limited
in maximally achievable field strength at the sample. An extension based on the
use of an undulator in the presence of the iris line, which is feasible at the
LCLS energies, is proposed as a possible upgrade of the baseline THz source.
