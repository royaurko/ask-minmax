Character rigging is a process of endowing a character with a set of custom
manipulators and controls making it easy to animate by the animators. These
controls consist of simple joints, handles, or even separate character
selection windows.This research paper present an automated rigging system for
quadruped characters with custom controls and manipulators for animation.The
full character rigging mechanism is procedurally driven based on various
principles and requirements used by the riggers and animators. The automation
is achieved initially by creating widgets according to the character type.
These widgets then can be customized by the rigger according to the character
shape, height and proportion. Then joint locations for each body parts are
calculated and widgets are replaced programmatically.Finally a complete and
fully operational procedurally generated character control rig is created and
attached with the underlying skeletal joints. The functionality and feasibility
of the rig was analyzed from various source of actual character motion and a
requirements criterion was met. The final rigged character provides an
efficient and easy to manipulate control rig with no lagging and at high frame
rate.
