We report on the results from the analysis of our 114 ks Chandra HETGS
observation of the Galactic core-collapse supernova remnant G292.0+1.8. To
probe the 3D structure of the clumpy X-ray emitting ejecta material in this
remnant, we measured Doppler shifts in emission lines from metal-rich ejecta
knots projected at different radial distances from the expansion center. We
estimate radial velocities of ejecta knots in the range of -2300 <~ v_r <~ 1400
km s^-1. The distribution of ejecta knots in velocity vs. projected-radius
space suggests an expanding ejecta shell with a projected angular thickness of
~90" (corresponding to ~3 pc at d = 6 kpc). Based on this geometrical
distribution of the ejecta knots, we estimate the location of the reverse shock
approximately at the distance of ~4 pc from the center of the supernova
remnant, putting it in close proximity to the outer boundary of the radio
pulsar wind nebula. Based on our observed remnant dynamics and the standard
explosion energy of 10^51 erg, we estimate the total ejecta mass to be <~ 8
M_sun, and we propose an upper limit of <~ 35 M_sun on the progenitor's mass.
