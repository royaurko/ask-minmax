The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, completed in December 2010 and located at
the geographic South Pole, is the largest neutrino telescope in the world.
IceCube includes the more densely instrumented DeepCore subarray, which
increases IceCube's sensitivity at neutrino energies down to 10 GeV. DeepCore
has recently demonstrated sensitivity to muon neutrino disappearance from
atmospheric neutrino oscillation. A further extension is under consideration,
the Precision IceCube Next Generation Upgrade (PINGU) which would lower the
energy threshold below about 10 GeV. In particular, PINGU would be sensitive to
the effects of the neutrino mass hierarchy, which is one of the outstanding
questions in particle physics. Preliminary feasibility studies indicate that
PINGU can make a high significance determination of the mass hierarchy within a
few years of construction.
