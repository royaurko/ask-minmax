The dynamics of a metallic particle confined between charged walls is
studied. One wall is fixed and the other moves smoothly and periodically in
time. Dissipation is considered by assuming a friction produced by the contact
between the particle and a rough surface. We investigate the phase space of the
simplified and complete versions of the model. Our results include (i)
coexistence of islands of regular motion with an attractor located at the low
energy portion of phase space in the complete model; and (ii) coexistence of
attractors with trajectories that present unlimited energy growth in the
simplified model.
