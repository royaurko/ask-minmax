Recent Chandra and XMM X-ray observations of rich clusters of galaxies have
shown that the amount of hot gas which is cooling below ~1 keV is generally
more modest than previous estimates. Yet, the real level of the cooling flows,
if any, remains to be clarified by making observations sensitive to different
temperature ranges. As a follow-up of the FUSE observations reporting a
positive detection of the OVI doublet at 1032, 1038 Angstrom in the cluster of
galaxies Abell 2597, which provided the first direct evidence for ~3x10^5 K gas
in a cluster of galaxies, we have carried out sensitive spectroscopy of two
rich clusters, Abell 2029 and Abell 3112 (z~0.07) located behind low HI
columns. In neither of these clusters could we detect the OVI doublet, yielding
fairly stringent limits of ~27 Msun yr-1 (Abell 2029) and ~25 Msun yr-1 (Abell
3112) to the cooling flow rates using the 10^5-10^6 K gas as a tracer. The
non-detections support the emerging picture that the cooling-flow rates are
much more modest than deduced from earlier X-ray observations.
