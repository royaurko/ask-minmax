Developing an efficient and robust polarimeter for wide spectral ranges and
space applications is a main issue in many projects. As part of the UVMag
consortium created to develop UV facilities in space (e.g. the Arago mission
proposed to ESA), we are studying an innovative concept of polarimeter that is
robust, simple, and efficient on a wide spectral range. The idea, based on the
article by Sparks et al. (2012), is to use polarization scramblers to create a
spatial modulation of the polarization. Along the height of the wedges of the
scramblers, the thickness of the birefringent material crossed by the light,
and thus the retardance, vary continuously. This variation creates an intensity
modulation of the light related to the entrance polarization state. Analyzing
this modulation with a linear polarizer, and dispersing the light spectrally in
the orthogonal spatial direction, enables the measurement of the full Stokes
vector over the entire spectrum. This determination is performed with a
single-shot measurement and without any moving parts in the system. After a
quick introduction to the concept and optical design, this article presents the
tolerancing study of the optical bench using this spectropolarimeter. The
impact of different error sources, such as, birefringence uncertainty or
decenter of the wedges, is investigated.
