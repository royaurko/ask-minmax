We report on the identification of a new soft gamma-ray source, IGR
J12319-0749, detected with the IBIS imager on board the INTEGRAL satellite. The
source, which has an observed 20-100 keV flux of ~8.3 x 10^{-12} erg cm^{-2}
s^{-1}, is spatially coincident with an AGN at redshift z=3.12. The broad-band
continuum, obtained by combining XRT and IBIS data, is flat (Gamma ~ 1.3) with
evidence for a spectral break around 25 keV (100 keV in the source rest frame).
X-ray observations indicate flux variability which is further supported by a
comparison with a previous ROSAT measurement. IGR J12319-0749 is also a radio
emitting object likely characterized by a flat spectrum and high radio
loudness; optically it is a broad-line emitting object with a massive black
hole (2.8 x 10^{9}$ solar masses) at its center. The source Spectral Energy
Distribution is similar to another high redshift blazar, 225155+2217 at
z=3.668: both objects are bright, with a large accretion disk luminosity and a
Compton peak located in the hard X-ray/soft gamma-ray band. IGR J12319-0749 is
likely the second most distant blazar detected so far by INTEGRAL.
