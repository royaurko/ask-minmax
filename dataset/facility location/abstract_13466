We use the combined photometric SDSS + GALEX database to look for populations
of luminous blue star-forming galaxies. These were initially identified from
such a sample at redshifts near 0.4, using SDSS spectra. We make use of the
colour index previously defined to separate stars and QSOs, to locate more of
these unusual galaxies, to fainter limits. They are found in significant
numbers in two different regions of the related colour-magnitude plot. Within
these regions, we use the ensemble 7-colour photometry to estimate the
populations of blue star-forming galaxies at redshift near 0.4, and at redshift
near 1, from a full photometric sample of over half a million, composed mostly
of normal galaxies and QSOs.
