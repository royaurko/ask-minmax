Based on first-principles electron structure calculations and employing the
frozen-magnon approximation we study the exchange interactions in a series of
transition-metal binary alloys crystallizing in the zinc-blende structure and
calculate the Curie temperature within both the mean-field approximation (MFA)
and random-phase approximation (RPA). We study two Cr compounds, CrAs and CrSe,
and four Mn compounds: MnSi, MnGe, MnAs and MnC. MnC, MnSi and MnGe are
isovalent to CrAs and MnAs is isoelectronic with CrSe. Ferromagnetism is
particular stable for CrAs, MnSi and MnGe: All three compounds show Curie
temperatures around 1000 K. On the other hand, CrSe and MnAs show a tendency to
antiferromagnetism when compressing the lattice. In MnC the half-metallic gap
is located in the majority-spin channel contrary to the other five compounds.
The large half-metallic gaps, very high Curie temperatures, the stability of
the ferromagnetism with respect to the variation of the lattice parameter and a
coherent growth on semiconductors make MnSi and CrAs most promising candidates
for the use in spintronics devises.
