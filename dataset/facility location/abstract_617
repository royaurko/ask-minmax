Evolution of the width of the rapidity distribution on beam rapidity has been
studied for a number of produced particles with UrQMD-3.3p1 generated events at
various FAIR (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research) energies. The results
for the width of the rapidity distribution with beam rapidity, obtained with
UrQMD generated events, are compared with the existing experimental data (E802,
E877, E896, E917, NA49). For both UrQMD and experimental data, the width of the
rapidity distribution is found to bear scaling behavior with beam rapidity for
all the hadrons. Such scaling behavior is found to follow separate mass
ordering for the studied mesons and and baryons.
