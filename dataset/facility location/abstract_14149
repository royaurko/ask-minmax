We show in this paper how managed multi-context systems (mMCSs) can be turned
into a reactive formalism suitable for continuous reasoning in dynamic
environments. We extend mMCSs with (abstract) sensors and define the notion of
a run of the extended systems. We then show how typical problems arising in
online reasoning can be addressed: handling potentially inconsistent sensor
input, modeling intelligent forms of forgetting, selective integration of
knowledge, and controlling the reasoning effort spent by contexts, like setting
contexts to an idle mode. We also investigate the complexity of some important
related decision problems and discuss different design choices which are given
to the knowledge engineer.
