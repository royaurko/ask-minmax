The high-mass microquasar Cygnus X-1, the best-established candidate for a
stellar-mass black hole in the Galaxy, has been detected in a flaring state at
very high energies (VHE), E > 200 GeV, by the Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope
MAGIC. The flare occurred at orbital phase 0.91, where phase 1 is the
configuration with the black hole behind the companion high-mass star, when the
absorption of gamma-ray photons by photon-photon annihilation with the stellar
field is expected to be highest. We aim to set up a model for the high-energy
emission and absorption in Cyg X-1 that can explain the nature of the observed
gamma-ray flare. We study the gamma-ray opacity due to pair creation along the
whole orbit, and for different locations of the emitter. Then we consider a
possible mechanism for the production of the VHE emission. We present detailed
calculations of the gamma-ray opacity and infer from these calculations the
distance from the black hole where the emitting region was located. We suggest
that the flare was the result of a jet-clump interaction where the decay
products of inelastic proton-proton collisions dominate the VHE outcome. We are
able to reproduce the spectrum of Cyg X-1 during the observed flare under
reasonable assumptions. The flare may be the first event of jet-cloud
interaction ever detected at such high energies.
