In this paper we formulate our results on the essential spectrum of
many-particle pseudorelativistic Hamiltonians without magnetic and external
potential fields in the spaces of functions, having arbitrary type $\alpha$ of
the permutational symmetry. We discover location of the essential spectrum for
all $\alpha$ and for some cases we establish new properties of the lower bound
of this spectrum, which are useful for study of the discrete spectrum.
