We report a study of the mode-coupling theory (MCT) glass transition line for
the Girifalco model of C60 fullerene. The equilibrium static structure factor
of the model, the only required input for the MCT calculations, is provided by
molecular dynamics simulations. The glass transition line develops inside the
metastable liquid-solid coexistence region and extends down in temperature,
terminating on the liquid sideof the metastable portion of the liquid-vapor
binodal. The vitrification locus does not show re-entrant behavior. A
comparison with previous computer simulation estimates of the location of the
glass line suggests that the theory accurately reproduces the shape of the
arrest line in the density-temperature plane. The theoretical HNC and MHNC
structure factors (and consequently the corresponding MCT glass line) compare
well with the numerical counterpart. These evidences confirm the conclusion
drawn in previous works about the existence of a glassy phase for the fullerene
model at issue.
