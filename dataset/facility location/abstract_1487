We present far-infrared and millimetric observations of a sample of
3C objects. Millimetre data were taken at 1.25 mm with the IRAM 30m antenna
feeding the MPIfR bolometer array. Mid-infrared (MIR) and far-infrared (FIR)
photometry were carried out with the ISOCAM and ISOPHOT cameras on the ISO
Satellite. Additional FIR IRAS observations are also included. We present the
entire Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) from the UV to radio and discuss
the emitting mechanisms. Two composite spectra, one for the radio galaxies and
one for the radio quasars, are built in the object rest frame. While the SEDs
of the two classes differ, they are indistinguishable in the MIR and FIR range
where they probably arise as thermal emission from a dusty torus and a
larger-scale (cooler) dust distribution in the host galaxy.
