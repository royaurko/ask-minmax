New linear polarization measurements (mainly in the V band) are presented for
203 quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). The sample is made up of 94 QSOs located in
the North Galactic Pole (NGP) region and of 109 QSOs in the South Galactic Pole
(SGP) region. First time measurements have been obtained for 184 QSOs. Among
them, 109 known radio-emitters, 42 known Broad Absorption Line (BAL) QSOs, and
1 gravitationally lensed quasi-stellar object. We found high polarization
levels (p > 3%) for 12 QSOs, including the BAL QSO SDSS J1409+0048. For 10
objects, measurements obtained at different epochs do exist. Two of them show
evidence for variability: the highly polarized BL Lac candidate PKS 1216-010
and the radio source PKS 1222+037
