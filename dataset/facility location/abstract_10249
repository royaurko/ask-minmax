Cosmology enters precision testing period with the observational experiments
advancement. We have not arrived to decipher the origin of the dominant dark
energy component of our universe, although we have located some of its
characters. In such a situation the possibilities of a simple four-fermion
interaction model are investigated to describe dark energy characters. We
explicitly calculate the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor
and discuss the results with comparison to the equation of state for dark
energy requirement. It is found that the negative pressure is realized at low
temperature. It is an appropriate property as a dark energy candidate. We also
investigate some cosmological tests for the dark energy via its equation of
state.
