The oscillation spectra of solar-type stars may in the not-too- distant
future be used to constrain certain properties of the stars. The CD diagram of
large versus small frequency separations is one of the powerful tools available
to infer the properties - including perhaps masses and ages - of stars which
display a detectable spectrum of oscillation. Also, the border of a convective
region in a solar-type star gives rise to a characteristic periodic signal in
the star's low-degree p-mode frequencies. Such a signature contains information
about the location and nature of the transition between convective and
non-convective regions in the star. In this work we address some of the
uncertainties associated with the direct use of the CD diagram to evaluate the
mass and age of the star due to the unknown contributions that make the stars
different from the evolutionary models used to construct our reference grid. We
also explore the possibility of combining an amplitude versus period diagram
with the CD diagram to evaluate the properties of convective borders within
solar-type stars.
