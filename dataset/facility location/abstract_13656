Cognitive function is driven by dynamic interactions between large-scale
neural circuits or networks, enabling behavior. Fundamental principles
constraining these dynamic network processes have remained elusive. Here we use
network control theory to offer a mechanistic explanation for how the brain
moves between cognitive states drawn from the network organization of white
matter microstructure. Our results suggest that densely connected areas,
particularly in the default mode system, facilitate the movement of the brain
to many easily-reachable states. Weakly connected areas, particularly in
cognitive control systems, facilitate the movement of the brain to
difficult-to-reach states. Areas located on the boundary between network
communities, particularly in attentional control systems, facilitate the
integration or segregation of diverse cognitive systems. Our results suggest
that structural network differences between the cognitive circuits dictate
their distinct roles in controlling dynamic trajectories of brain network
function.
