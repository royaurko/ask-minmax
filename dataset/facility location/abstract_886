The BiPo project is dedicated to the measurement of extremely low
radioactivity contamination of SuperNEMO source foils (^{208}Tl < 2 \muBq/kg
and ^{214}Bi < 10 \muBq/kg). The R&D phase is started: a modular BiPo prototype
with its shielding test facility is under construction. The goal of this
prototype is to study the background and particularly the surface contamination
of scintillators. The first capsule has been installed in the Canfranc
Underground Laboratory in October, 17th and is now taking data. After 10.7 days
of measurements, a preliminary upper limit on the surface radiopurity of the
scintillators of A(^{208}Tl) < 60 \muBq/m^2 (90% C. L.) has been obtained.
