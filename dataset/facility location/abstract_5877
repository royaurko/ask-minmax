We consider the Mode Coupling Theory (MCT) of Glass transition for a Binary
fluid. The Equations of Nonlinear Fluctuating Hydrodynamics are obtained with a
proper choice of the slow variables corresponding to the conservation laws. The
resulting model equations are solved in the long time limit to locate the
dynamic transition. The transition point from our model is considerably higher
than predicted in existing MCT models for binary systems. This is in agreement
with what is seen in Computer Simulation of binary fluids. fluids.
