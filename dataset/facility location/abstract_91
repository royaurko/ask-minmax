Let (X,d_X) be an n-point metric space. We show that there exists a
distribution D over non-contractive embeddings into trees f:X-->T such that for
every x in X, the expectation with respect to D of the maximum over y in X of
the ratio d_T(f(x),f(y)) / d_X(x,y) is at most C (log n)^2, where C is a
universal constant. Conversely we show that the above quadratic dependence on
log n cannot be improved in general. Such embeddings, which we call maximum
gradient embeddings, yield a framework for the design of approximation
algorithms for a wide range of clustering problems with monotone costs,
including fault-tolerant versions of k-median and facility location.
