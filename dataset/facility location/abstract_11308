We report the detection of oscillatory phenomena associated with a large
bright-point group that is 430,000 square kilometers in area and located near
the solar disk center. Wavelet analysis reveals full-width half-maximum
oscillations with periodicities ranging from 126 to 700 seconds originating
above the bright point and significance levels exceeding 99%. These
oscillations, 2.6 kilometers per second in amplitude, are coupled with
chromospheric line-of-sight Doppler velocities with an average blue shift of 23
kilometers per second. A lack of cospatial intensity oscillations and
transversal displacements rules out the presence of magneto-acoustic wave
modes. The oscillations are a signature of Alfven waves produced by a torsional
twist of +/-22 degrees. A phase shift of 180 degrees across the diameter of the
bright point suggests that these torsional Alfven oscillations are induced
globally throughout the entire brightening. The energy flux associated with
this wave mode is sufficient to heat the solar corona.
