We present our analysis of the Gemini/NICI H-band data of HD 95086, following
the discovery of the planet HD 95086 b in L'. The H-band data reach a contrast
of 12.7 mag relative to the host star at 5 sigma levels in the location of HD
95086 b, and no point source is found. Our non-detection and H-L' color limit
rules out the possibility that the object is a foreground L/T dwarf and that,
if it is bound to HD 95086, it is a genuine planetary mass object. We estimate
a new pre-main-sequence isochronal age for HD 95086 of 17+/-4 Myr, which is
commensurate with previous mean age estimates for the Lower Cen-Crux subgroup.
Adopting an age of 17 Myr, the color limit is inconsistent with the COND model,
marginally consistent with the BT-SETTL model, and consistent with the DUSTY
model.
