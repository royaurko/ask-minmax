Here we report the detection, in Halpha emission, of a radial corrugation in
the velocity field of the spiral galaxy NGC 5427. The central velocity of the
Halpha line displays coherent, wavy-like variations in the vicinity of the
spiral arms. The spectra along three different arm segments show that the
maximum amplitude of the sinusoidal line variations are displaced some 500 pc
from the central part of the spiral arms. The peak blueshifted velocities
appear some 500 pc upstream the arm, whereas the peak redshifted velocities are
located some 500 pc downstream the arm. This kinematical behavior is similar to
the one expected in a galactic bore generated by the interaction of a spiral
density wave with a thick gaseous disk, as recently modeled by Martos & Cox
(1998).
