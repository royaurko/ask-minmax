The MBH - {\sigma}\ast relation has been studied extensively for local
galaxies, but to date there have been scarce few direct measurements of stellar
velocity dispersions for systems beyond the local universe. We investigate
black hole and host galaxy properties of six "post-starburst quasars" at z \sim
0.3. Spectra of these objects simultaneously display features from the active
nucleus including broad emission lines and a host galaxy Balmer absorption
series indicative of the post-starburst stellar population. These are the first
measurements of {\sigma}\ast in such objects, and we significantly increase the
number of directly-measured non-local objects on the MBH - {\sigma}\ast
diagram. The "post-starburst quasars" of our sample fall on or above the
locally defined MBH - {\sigma}\ast relation, a result that is consistent with
previous MBH - {\sigma}\ast studies of samples at z > 0.1. However, they are
generally consistent with the MBH-Lbulge relation. Futhermore, their location
on the Faber-Jackson relation suggests that some of the bulges may be
dynamically peculiar.
