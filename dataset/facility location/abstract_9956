We present the study of magnetic and transport properties of
Pb(1-x-y-z)Mn(x)Sn(y)Eu(z)Te. AC magnetic susceptibility measurements as well
as transport characterization were performed. The obtained results indicate
that the presence of two types of magnetic ions influences magnetic properties
of investigated IV-VI semimagnetic semiconductor. A qualitative analysis and
possible mechanisms of the substantial dependence of the Curie temperature on
the Eu content are presented. The most likely reason of the observed Curie
temperature behaviour is a strong dependence of the location of a heavy mass
Sigma band upon the alloy composition. The theoretical calculations in frame of
simple models confirm this point.
