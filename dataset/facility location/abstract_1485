This paper presents results from high-angular resolution mid-IR imaging of
the Mira AB circumbinary environment using the MIRAC3 camera at the NASA
Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). We resolved the dusty circumstellar
envelope at 9.8, 11.7 and 18 micron around Mira A (o Ceti), and measured the
size of the extended emission. Strong deviations from spherical symmetry are
detected in the images of Mira AB system, including possible dust clumps in the
direction of the companion (Mira B). These observations suggest that Mira B
plays an active role in shaping the morphology of the circumstellar environment
of Mira A as it evolves toward the Planetary Nebula phase.
