The combination of the broad band coverage and moderate spectral resolution
of the LECS and MECS instruments on-board BeppoSAX allow the spectra of AGN to
be studied in unprecedented detail down to 0.1 keV. We describe the calibration
and the performance of the LECS and report on observations of low-energy
absorption features in the spectra of both a low (MCG-6-30-15) and a high
luminosity (3C 273) AGN. These features provide important diagnostics on the
location and nature of the material surrounding the AGN. A comparison of LECS
and ASCA/SIS low energy performance is also presented in the case of 3C 273.
