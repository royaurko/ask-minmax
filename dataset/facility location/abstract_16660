The Hertz and SCUBA polarimeters, working at 350 micron and 850 micron
respectively, have measured the polarized emission in scores of Galactic
clouds. Of the clouds in each dataset, 17 were mapped by both instruments with
good polarization signal-to-noise ratios. We present maps of each of these 17
clouds comparing the dual-wavelength polarization amplitudes and position
angles at the same spatial locations. In total number of clouds compared, this
is a four-fold increase over previous work. Across the entire data-set real
position angle differences are seen between wavelengths. While the distribution
of \phi(850)-\phi(350) is centered near zero (near-equal angles), 64% of data
points with high polarization signal-to-noise (P >= 3\sigma_p) have
|\phi(850)-\phi(350)| > 10 degrees. Of those data with small changes in
position angle (<= 10 degrees) the median ratio of the polarization amplitudes
is P(850)/P(350) = 1.7 +/- 0.6. This value is consistent with previous work
performed on smaller samples and models which require mixtures of different
grain properties and polarization efficiencies. Along with the polarization
data we have also compiled the intensity data at both wavelengths; we find a
trend of decreasing polarization with increasing 850-to-350 micron intensity
ratio. All the polarization and intensity data presented here (1699 points in
total) are available in electronic format.
