We present a study of McNeil's Nebula, a newly appeared reflection nebula in
the L1630 cloud, together with photometry and spectroscopy of its source. New
IR photometry compared to earlier 2MASS data shows that the star has brightened
by about 3 magnitudes in the near-infrared, changing its location in a J-H/H-K
diagram precisely along a reddening vector. A Gemini NIRI K-band spectrum shows
strong CO-bandhead emission and Br-gamma is in emission, indicative of strong
accretion. A Gemini GMOS optical spectrum shows only a red, heavily veiled
continuum, with H-alpha strongly in emission and displaying a pronounced P
Cygni profile, with an absorption trough reaching velocities up to 600 km s-1.
This implies significant mass loss in a powerful wind. However, no evidence is
found for any shocks, as commonly seen in collimated outflows from young stars.
Apparently the eruption has dispersed a layer of extinction and this, together
with the intrinsic brightening of the IRAS source, has allowed an earlier
outflow cavity to be flooded with light, thus creating McNeil's Nebula.
