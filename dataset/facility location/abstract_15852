In this short talk we review our results from the paper hep-th/0604075 with
the main stress on the issues of causality and acoustic metric in eikonal
approximation. In addition we correct the formula for the redshift of sound
signals from our original work. We show that, if there exists a special kind of
Born-Infeld type scalar field, then one can send information from inside a
black hole. This information is encoded in perturbations of the field
propagating in non-trivial scalar field backgrounds, which serve as a "new
ether". Although the action of the theory is manifestly Lorentz-invariant the
non-trivial solutions break this symmetry spontaneously, allowing, the
superluminal propagation of perturbations with respect to this "new ether". We
found the stationary solution for background, which describes the accretion of
the scalar field onto a black hole. Examining the propagation of small
perturbations around this solution we show that the signals emitted inside the
Schwarzschild horizon can reach an observer located outside the black hole.
Thus the accreting field forms a hydrodynamical analog of a black hole whose
horizon is inside of the gravitational black hole drawing in the scalar field.
