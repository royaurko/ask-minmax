The Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) has been used to map class I
methanol masers at 36 and 44 GHz in G309.38-0.13. Maser spots are found at nine
locations in an area of 50''x30'', with both transitions reliably detected at
only two locations. The brightest spot is associated with shocked gas traced by
4.5 micron emission. The data allowed us to make a serendipitous discovery of a
high-velocity 36-GHz spectral feature, which is blue-shifted by about 30 km/s
from the peak velocity at this frequency, but spatially located close to
(within a few arcseconds of) the brightest maser spot. We interpret this as
indicating an outflow parallel to the line of sight. Such a high velocity
spread of maser features, which has not been previously reported in the class I
methanol masers associated with a single molecular cloud, suggests that the
outflow most likely interacts with a moving parcel of gas.
