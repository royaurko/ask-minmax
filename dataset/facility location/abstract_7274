We present SEST-SIMBA 1.2-mm continuum maps and ESO-NTT SOFI JHK images of
the Galactic HII region RCW 79. The millimetre continuum data reveal the
presence of massive fragments located in a dust emission ring surrounding the
ionized gas. The two most massive fragments are diametrically opposite each
other in the ring. The near-IR data, centred on the compact HII region located
at the south-eastern border of RCW 79, show the presence of an IR-bright
cluster containing massive stars along with young stellar objects with near-IR
excesses. A bright near- and mid-IR source is detected towards maser emissions,
1.2 pc north-east of the compact HII region centre. Additional information,
extracted from the Spitzer GLIMPSE survey, are used to discuss the nature of
the bright IR sources observed towards RCW 79. Twelve luminous Class I sources
are identified towards the most massive millimetre fragments. All these facts
strongly indicate that the massive-star formation observed at the border of the
HII region RCW 79 has been triggered by its expansion, most probably by the
collect and collapse process.
