The Indiana University Cyclotron Facility (IUCF) is in the process of
building the Midwest Proton Radiation Institute (MPRI). This involves
refurbishing the 200MeV cyclotron and building new facilities for the purpose
of providing clinical treatment of human cancer tumors. First patients are
expected in the Spring of 2003. This paper presents the design and
implementation to date of the controls, hardware and software, for both
accelerator and treatment areas. Particular attention is placed on issues of
personnel safety and control system security, development of inexpensive VMEbus
boards with emphasis on the use of MicroChip PIC processors, beam diagnostics
and monitoring and the use of commercial robots and vision systems for patient
positioning.
