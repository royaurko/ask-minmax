We report the discovery of a low surface brightness (LSB) object
serendipitously found during deep CCD imaging of a compact group of galaxies,
Seyfert's Sextet, in VR and I bands. The LSB object is located 2.3 arcmin
southwest from the group center. Its surface brightness within the angular
effective radii of r_e(VR)=4.8 arcsec and r_e(I)=4.8 arcsec is very low ---
mu_e(VR)=25.28 mag arcsec-2 and mu_e(I)=24.47 mag arcsec-2, respectively. The
apparent magnitudes are m_AB(VR)=19.87 mag and m(I)=19.06 mag. The object is
most likely a LSB dwarf galaxy, but other possibilities are also discussed.
