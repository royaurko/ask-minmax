A quantitative condition is derived to evaluate the monocular accommodation
in holographic stereograms. We find that the reconstruction can be viewed as
true-3D image when the whole scene is located in the monocular cues area, with
compatible monocular cues and binocular cues. In contrast, it reveals incorrect
monocular cues in the visible multi-imaging area and the lacking information
area. To demonstrate our theoretical predictions, a pupil-function integral
imaging algorithm is developed to simulate the mono-eye observation, and a
holographic printing system is set up to fabricate the full-parallax
holographic stereogram. Both simulation and experimental results match our
theoretical predictions.
