It is widely accepted that strong and variable radiation detected over all
accessible energy bands in a number of active galaxies arises from a
relativistic, Doppler-boosted jet pointing close to our line of sight. The size
of the emitting zone and the location of this region relative to the central
supermassive black hole are, however, poorly known, with estimates ranging from
light-hours to a light-year or more. Here we report the coincidence of a
gamma-ray flare with a dramatic change of optical polarization angle. This
provides evidence for co-spatiality of optical and gamma-ray emission regions
and indicates a highly ordered jet magnetic field. The results also require a
non-axisymmetric structure of the emission zone, implying a curved trajectory
for the emitting material within the jet, with the dissipation region located
at a considerable distance from the black hole, at about 10^5 gravitational
radii.
