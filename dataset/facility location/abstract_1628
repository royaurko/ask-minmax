Methods and ideas to search for new phenomena at existing and future collider
facilities like LEPII and the LHC are analysed. Emphasis is put on the
experimental aspects of discovery strategies for the Higgs Boson of the
Standard Model. This is followed by a critical analysis of search methods for
the extended Higgs sector and the direct detection of Supersymmetric Particles
within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We also discuss methods and
the potential mass reach of the LHC experiments to discover new Bosons and
Fermions.
