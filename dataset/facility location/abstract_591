The Apache Point Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO), in NM, can detect
photon bounces from retro-reflectors on the moon surface to 0.1ns timing
resolution. This facility enables not only the detection of light speed
anisotropy, which defines a local preferred frame of reference - only in that
frame is the speed of light isotropic, but also fluctuations/turbulence
(gravitational waves) in the flow of the dynamical 3-space relative to local
systems/observers. So the APOLLO facility can act as an effective
"gravitational wave" detector. A recently published small data set from
November 5, 2007, is analysed to characterise both the average anisotropy
velocity and the wave/turbulence effects. The results are consistent with some
13 previous detections, with the last and most accurate being from the
spacecraft earth-flyby Doppler-shift NASA data.
