We present the results of a re-examination of a [Ne II] line emission data
cube (\lambda 12.8 \mu m) and discuss the kinematic structure of the inner \sim
3 \times 4 pc of the Galaxy. The quality of [Ne II] as a tracer of ionized gas
is examined by comparing it to radio data. A three dimensional representation
of the data cube allows us to disentangle features which are projected onto the
same location on the sky. A model of gas streams in different planes is fitted
to the data. We find that most of the material is located in a main plane which
itself is defined by the inner edge of the Circum-Nuclear Disk in the Galactic
Center. Finally, we present a possible three dimensional model of the gas
streams.
