We study the effects of surfaces on resistor percolation at the instance of a
semi-infinite geometry. Particularly we are interested in the average
resistance between two connected ports located on the surface. Based on general
grounds as symmetries and relevance we introduce a field theoretic Hamiltonian
for semi-infinite random resistor networks. We show that the surface
contributes to the average resistance only in terms of corrections to scaling.
These corrections are governed by surface resistance exponents. We carry out
renormalization group improved perturbation calculations for the special and
the ordinary transition. We calculate the surface resistance exponents
$\phi_{\mathcal S \mathnormal}$ and $\phi_{\mathcal S \mathnormal}^\infty$ for
the special and the ordinary transition, respectively, to one-loop order.
