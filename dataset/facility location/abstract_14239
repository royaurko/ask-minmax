We experimentally study effect of single circular hole on the critical
current $I_c$ of narrow superconducting strip with width $W$ much smaller than
Pearl penetration depth $\Lambda$. We found nonmonotonous dependence of $I_c$
on the location of a hole across the strip and a weak dependence of $I_c$ on
radius of hole has been found in case of hole with $\xi \ll R \ll W$ ($\xi$ is
a superconducting coherence length) which is placed in the center of strip. The
observed effects are caused by competition of two mechanisms of destruction of
superconductivity - the entrance of vortex via edge of the strip and the
nucleation of the vortex-antivortex pair near the hole. The mechanisms are
clearly distinguishable by difference in dependence of $I_c$ on weak magnetic
field.
