Doppler reflectometry spatial and wavenumber resolution is analyzed within
the framework of the linear Born approximation in slab plasma model. Explicit
expression for its signal backscattering spectrum is obtained in terms of
wavenumber and frequency spectra of turbulence which is assumed to be radially
statistically inhomogeneous. Scattering efficiency for both back and forward
scattering (in radial direction) is introduced and shown to be inverse
proportional to the square of radial wavenumber of the probing wave at the
fluctuation location thus making the spatial resolution of diagnostics
sensitive to density profile. It is shown that in case of forward scattering
additional localization can be provided by the antenna diagram. It is
demonstrated that in case of backscattering the spatial resolution can be
better if the turbulence spectrum at high radial wavenumbers is suppressed. The
improvement of Doppler reflectometry data localization by probing beam focusing
onto the cut-off is proposed and described. The possibility of Doppler
reflectometry data interpretation based on the obtained expressions is shown.
