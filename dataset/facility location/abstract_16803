Combining STEREO, ACE and Hinode observations has presented an opportunity to
follow a filament eruption and coronal mass ejection (CME) on the 17th of
October 2007 from an active region (AR) inside a coronal hole (CH) into the
heliosphere. This particular combination of `open' and closed magnetic
topologies provides an ideal scenario for interchange reconnection to take
place. With Hinode and STEREO data we were able to identify the emergence time
and type of structure seen in the in-situ data four days later. On the 21st,
ACE observed in-situ the passage of an ICME with `open' magnetic topology. The
magnetic field configuration of the source, a mature AR located inside an
equatorial CH, has important implications for the solar and interplanetary
signatures of the eruption. We interpret the formation of an `anemone'
structure of the erupting AR and the passage in-situ of the ICME being
disconnected at one leg, as manifested by uni-directional suprathermal electron
flux in the ICME, to be a direct result of interchange reconnection between
closed loops of the CME originating from the AR and `open' field lines of the
surrounding CH.
