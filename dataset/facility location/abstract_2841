This paper describes a search algorithm to locate values of t where the real
part of the Riemann zeta function, zeta(sigma+it), is negative for sigma>1. The
run-time to execute the search is much less than a brute-force approach and
relies on certain symmetries of congruence equations related to the zeta
function.
