Liquid crystal films have recently been demonstrated as variable thickness,
planar targets for ultra-intense laser matter experiments and applications such
as ion acceleration. By controlling the parameters of film formation, including
liquid crystal temperature and volume, their thickness can be varied on-demand
from 10 $nm$ to above 10 $\mu m$. This thickness range enables for the first
time real-time selection and optimization of various ion acceleration
mechanisms using low cost, high quality targets. Our previous work employed
these targets in single shot configuration, requiring chamber cycling after the
pre-made films were expended. Presented here is a film formation device capable
of drawing films from a bulk liquid crystal source volume to any thickness in
the aforementioned range. This device will form films under vacuum within 2
$\mu m$ of the same location each time, well within the Rayleigh range of even
tight $F/ \#$ systems. The repetition rate of the device exceeds 0.1 $Hz$ for
sub-100 $nm$ films, enabling inexpensive, moderate repetition rate plasma
target insertion for state of the art lasers currently in use or under
development. Characterization tests of the device performed at the Scarlet
laser facility at Ohio State will be presented.
