Forward calorimetry in the PHOBOS detector has been used to study charged
hadron production in d+Au, p+Au and n+Au collisions at sqrt(s_nn) = 200 GeV.
The forward proton calorimeter detectors are described and a procedure for
determining collision centrality with these detectors is detailed. The
deposition of energy by deuteron spectator nucleons in the forward calorimeters
is used to identify p+Au and n+Au collisions in the data. A weighted
combination of the yield of p+Au and n+Au is constructed to build a reference
for Au+Au collisions that better matches the isospin composition of the gold
nucleus. The p_T and centrality dependence of the yield of this improved
reference system is found to match that of d+Au. The shape of the charged
particle transverse momentum distribution is observed to extrapolate smoothly
from pbar+p to central d+Au as a function of the charged particle
pseudorapidity density. The asymmetry of positively- and negatively-charged
hadron production in p+Au is compared to that of n+Au. No significant asymmetry
is observed at mid-rapidity. These studies augment recent results from
experiments at the LHC and RHIC facilities to give a more complete description
of particle production in p+A and d+A collisions, essential for the
understanding the medium produced in high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions.
