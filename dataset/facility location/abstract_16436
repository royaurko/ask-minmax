We have investigated the NMR properties of dilute 3He impurities in solid 4He
contained in a torsional oscillator (TO) by the simultaneous measurement of the
NMR and the torsional oscillator response of the so-called supersolid 4He. From
measurements on samples with one hundred to a few hundred ppm of 3He, we have
found three different states of 3He. The first is the homogeneously distributed
isolated 3He atom in a solid matrix of 4He. The second is the 3He cluster in a
homogeneous 4He matrix, which appears below the phase separation temperature of
a solid mixture. The third is the 3He cluster in some nonuniform part of a 4He
crystal. We find that 3He atoms contained in the third component remain in a
nearby location even above the phase separation temperature. Based on the fact
that even a ppm of 3He affects the supersolid response in a TO below and above
the phase separation temperature, we propose that the nonuniform part of a
crystal that holds the third type of 3He and thus has a higher local
concentration of 3He plays an important role in the supersolid phenomenon in a
TO.
