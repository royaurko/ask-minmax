We investigate LiVS2 and LiVSe2 with a triangular lattice as itinerant
analogues of LiVO2, known for the formation of valence bond solid (VBS) state
out of S = 1 frustrated magnet. LiVS2, which is located at the border between a
metal and a correlated insulator, shows a first ordered transition from a
paramagnetic metal to a VBS insulator at Tc ~ 305 K upon cooling. The presence
of VBS state in the close vicinity of insulator-metal transition may suggest
the importance of itinerancy in the formation of VBS state. We argue that the
high temperature metallic phase of LiVS2 has a pseudo-gap, likely originating
from the VBS fluctuation. LiVSe2 was found to be a paramagnetic metal down to 2
K.
