We have investigated a commercially available polymer for its suitability as
a solid state nuclear track detector (SSNTD). We identified that polymer to be
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and found that it has a higher detection
threshold compared to many other widely used SSNTDs which makes this detector
particularly suitable for rare event search in cosmic rays as it eliminates the
dominant low Z background. Systematic studies were carried out to determine its
charge response which is essential before any new material can be used as an
SSNTD. In this paper we describe the charge response of PET to 129Xe, 78Kr and
49Ti ions from the REX-ISOLDE facility at CERN, present the calibration curve
for PET and characterize it as a nuclear track detector.
