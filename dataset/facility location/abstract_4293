A model of nuclear fusion consisting of a wave packet impinging into a well
located between square one dimensional barriers is treated analytically. The
wave function inside the well is calculated exactly for the assisted tunneling
induced by a perturbation mimicking a constant electric field with arbitrary
time dependence. Conditions are found for the enhancement of fusion.
