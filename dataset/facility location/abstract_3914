We report on the response of microchannel plates (MCPs) to single
relativistic particles and to electromagnetic showers. Particle detection by
means of secondary emission of electrons at the MCP surface has long been
proposed and is used extensively in ion time-of-flight mass spectrometers. What
has not been investigated in depth is their use to detect the ionizing
component of showers. The time resolution of MCPs exceeds anything that has
been previously used in calorimeters and, if exploited effectively, could aid
in the event reconstruction at high luminosity colliders. Several prototypes of
photodetectors with the amplification stage based on MCPs were exposed to
cosmic rays and to 491 MeV electrons at the INFN-LNF Beam-Test Facility. The
time resolution and the efficiency of the MCPs are measured as a function of
the particle multiplicity, and the results used to model the response to
high-energy showers.
