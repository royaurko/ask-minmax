We present radial velocity and new interferometric measurements of the double
star Atlas, which permit, with the addition of published interferometric data,
to precisely derive the orbital parameters of the binary system and the masses
of the components. The derived semi-major axis, compared with its measured
angular size, allows to determine a distance to Atlas of 132+-4 pc in a purely
geometrical way. Under the assumption that the location of Atlas is
representative of the average distance of the cluster, we confirm the distance
value generally obtained through main sequence fitting, in contradiction with
the early Hipparcos result (118.3+-3.5 pc).
