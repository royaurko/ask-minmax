This first ever double pulsar system consists of two pulsars orbiting the
common center of mass in a slightly eccentric orbit of only 2.4-hr duration.
The pair of pulsars with pulse periods of 22 ms and 2.8 sec, respectively,
confirms the long-proposed recycling theory for millisecond pulsars and
provides an exciting opportunity to study the works of pulsar magnetospheres by
a very fortunate geometrical alignment of the orbit relative to our
line-of-sight. In particular, this binary system represents a truly unique
laboratory for relativistic gravitational physics. This contribution serves as
an update on the currently obtained results and their consequences for the test
of general relativity in the strong-field regime. A complete and more
up-to-date report of the timing results will be presented elsewhere shortly.
