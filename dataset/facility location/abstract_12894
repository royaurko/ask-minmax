On the basis of a new photometric analysis of the Local Group dwarf irregular
galaxy NCG 6822 based on observations obtained with the Advanced Camera for
Surveys onboard the Hubble Space Telescope, we have obtained a new estimate of
the extinction of two fields located in the southeast region of the galaxy.
Because of significant differences in the distance estimates to NGC 6822
available in literature, we decided to provide an independent determination of
the distance to this galaxy based on an updated and self-consistent theoretical
calibration of the tip of the red giant branch brightness. As a result we newly
determined the distance to NGC 6822 to be equal to ${\rm(m-M)}_0=23.54\pm
0.05$, and compared our measurement with the most recent determinations of this
distance.
