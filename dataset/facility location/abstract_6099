We discuss the fermion mass hierarchy and the flavor mixings in the fat brane
scenario of a five dimensional SUSY theory. Assuming that the matter fields
lives in the bulk, their zero mode wave functions are Gaussians, and Higgs
fields are localized on the brane, we find simple various types of the matter
configurations generating the mass matrices consistent with experimental data.
Sfermion mass spectrum is also discussed using the matter configurations found
above. Which type of squark mass spectra (the degeneracy, the decoupling and
the alignment) is realized depends on the relative locations of SUSY breaking
brane and the brane where Higgs fields are localized.
