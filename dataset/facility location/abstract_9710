Effect of static charges on charge carrier transport in disordered organic
materials is considered. Long range nature of Coulomb interaction requires to
take into consideration a finite thickness of the transport layer. Presence of
conducting electrodes significantly modifies properties of organic medium,
removes a long range Coulomb divergence, and makes it possible to calculate in
finite form statistical properties of organic medium (with nonzero total charge
density), relevant for transport characteristics. A special attention is paid
to the particular case of charge induced disorder - a disorder originated from
the surface charge located at the rough surface of electrode. We present also a
generalization of 1D model of charge carrier transport to the case of
inhomogeneous energetic disorder that realizes in for charge induced disorder.
