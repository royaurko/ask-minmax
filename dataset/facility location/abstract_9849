High Frequency electron paramagnetic resonance has been used to observe the
magnetic dipole, $\Delta$ M$_s$ = $\pm$ 1, transitions in the $S = 9$ excited
state of the single molecule magnet Fe$_8$Br$_8$. A Boltzmann analysis of the
measured intensities locates it at 24 $\pm$ 2 K above the $S = 10$ ground
state, while the line positions yield its magnetic parameters D = -0.27 K, E =
$\pm$0.05 K, and B$_4^0$ = -1.3$\times$ 10$^{-6}$ K. D is thus smaller by 8%
and E larger by 7% than for $S = 10$. The anisotropy barrier for $S = 9$ is
estimated as 22 K,which is 25% smaller than that for $S = 10$ (29 K). These
data also help assign the spin exchange constants(J's) and thus provide a basis
for improved electronic structure calculations of Fe$_8$Br$_8$.
