Wind is the principal driver in the wind erosion models. The hourly wind
speed data were generally required for precisely wind erosion modeling. In this
study, a simple method to generate hourly wind speed data from daily wind
statistics (daily average and maximum wind speeds together or daily average
wind speed only) was established.
  A typical windy location with 3285 days (9 years) measured hourly wind speed
data were used to validate the downscaling method. The results showed that the
overall agreement between observed and simulated cumulative wind speed
probability distributions appears excellent, especially for the wind speeds
greater than 5 m s-1 range (erosive wind speed). The results further revealed
that the values of daily average erosive wind power density (AWPD) calculated
from generated wind speeds fit the counterparts computed from measured wind
speeds well with high models' efficiency (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient). So that
the hourly wind speed data can be predicted from daily average and maximum wind
speed data or only daily average wind speed data, respectively. Further studies
are needed to examine the findings for inter-site wind data.
