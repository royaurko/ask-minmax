The emergence of Web services in the information space, as well as the
advanced technology of SOA, give tremendous opportunities for users in an
ambient space or distant, empowerment and organizations in various fields
application, such as geolocation, E-learning, healthcare, digital government,
etc.. In fact, Web services are a solution for the integration of distributed
information systems, autonomous, heterogeneous and self-adaptable to the
context. However, as Web services can evolve in a dynamic environment in a
well-defined context and according to events automatically, such as time,
temperature, location, authentication, etc.. We are interested in improving
their SOA to empower the Web services to be self adaptive contexts. In this
paper, we propose a new trend of self adaptability of Web services context.
Then applying these requirements in the architecture of the platform of
adaptability to context WComp, by integrating the workflow. Our work is
illustrated by a case study of authentication.
