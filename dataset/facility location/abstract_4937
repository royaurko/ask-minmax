Practical wireless networks are finite, and hence non-stationary with nodes
typically non-homo-geneously deployed over the area. This leads to a
location-dependent performance and to boundary effects which are both often
neglected in network modeling. In this work, interference in networks with
nodes distributed according to an isotropic but not necessarily stationary
Poisson point process (PPP) are studied. The resulting link performance is
precisely characterized as a function of (i) an arbitrary receiver location and
of (ii) an arbitrary isotropic shape of the spatial distribution. Closed-form
expressions for the first moment and the Laplace transform of the interference
are derived for the path loss exponents $\alpha=2$ and $\alpha=4$, and simple
bounds are derived for other cases. The developed model is applied to practical
problems in network analysis: for instance, the accuracy loss due to neglecting
border effects is shown to be undesirably high within transition regions of
certain deployment scenarios. Using a throughput metric not relying on the
stationarity of the spatial node distribution, the spatial throughput locally
around a given node is characterized.
