A strong outburst of the October Draconid meteor shower was predicted for
October 8, 2011. Here we present the observations obtained by the Canadian
Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR) during the 2011 outburst. CMOR recorded 61
multi-station Draconid echoes and 179 single-station overdense Draconid echoes
(covering the magnitude range of +3 <= MV <= +7) between 16-20h UT on October
8, 2011. The mean radiant for the outburst was determined to be a_g = 261.9o
+/- 0.3o, d_g = +55.3o +/- 0.3o (J2000) from observations of the underdense
multi-station echoes. This radiant location agrees with model predictions to
~1o . The determined geocentric velocity was found to be ~10-15% lower than the
model value (17.0 - 19.1 km s^-1 versus 20.4 km s^-1), a discrepancy we
attribute to undercorrection for atmospheric deceleration of low density
Draconid meteoroids as well as to poor radar radiant geometry during the
outburst peak. The mass index at the time of the outburst was determined to be
~ 1.75 using the amplitude distribution of underdense echoes...
