There have been active efforts in the U.S., Europe, and Japan on the design
of a Neutrino Factory. This type of facility produces intense beams of
neutrinos from the decay of muons in a high energy storage ring. In the U.S., a
second detailed Feasibility Study (FS2) for a Neutrino Factory was completed in
2001. Since that report was published, new ideas in bunching, cooling and
acceleration of muon beams have been developed. We have incorporated these
ideas into a new facility design, which we designate as Study 2B (ST2B), that
should lead to significant cost savings over the FS2 design.
