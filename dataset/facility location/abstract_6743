We briefly report on a crater on the western slope of Mt.Ararat . It is
located in an area closed to foreigners at an altitude around 2100m with
geographic coordinates 39\deg 47' 30"N, 44\deg 14' 40"E. The diameter of the
crater is around 60-70m, the depth is up to 15m. The origin of the crater,
either of meteorite impact or volcanic, including the evaluation of its age,
will need detailed studies.
