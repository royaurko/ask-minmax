Reactions of nuclear multifragmentation of excited finite nuclei can be
interpreted as manifestation of the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition. During
this process the matter at subnuclear density clusterizes into hot primary
fragments, which are located in the vicinity of other nuclear species. In
recent experiments there were found evidences that the symmetry and surface
energies of primary fragments change considerably as compared to isolated cold
or low-excited nuclei. The new modified properties of primary fragments should
be taken into account during their secondary de-excitation.
