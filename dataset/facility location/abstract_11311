Using images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Gemini Telescope
we confirm the disappearance of the progenitors of two Type II supernovae
(SNe), and evaluate the presence of other stars associated with them. We find
that the progenitor of SN 2003gd, an M-supergiant star, is no longer observed
at the SN location, and determine its intrinsic brightness using image
subtraction techniques. The progenitor of SN 1993J, a K-supergiant star, is
also no longer present, but its B-supergiant binary companion is still
observed. The disappearance of the progenitors confirms that these two SNe were
produced by Red Supergiants.
