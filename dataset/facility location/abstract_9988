Electric response of spin polarization in two-dimensional electron gas with
structural inversion asymmetry subjected to a magnetic field was studied by
means of the linear and non-linear theory and numerical simulation with the
disorder effect. It was found by Kubo linear reponse theory that an electric
resonant response of spin polarization occurs when the Fermi surface is located
near the crossing of two Landau levels, which is induced from the competition
between the spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman splitting. The scaling behavior was
investigated with a simplified two-level model by non-linear method, and the
resonant peak value is reciprocally proportional to the electric field at low
temperatures and to temperature for finite electric fields. Finally numerical
simulation illustrated that impurity potential opens an enegy gap near the
resonant point and suppresses the effect gradually with the increasing strength
of disorder. This resonant effect may provide an efficient way to control spin
polarization by an external electric field.
