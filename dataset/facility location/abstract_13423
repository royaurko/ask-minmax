Jupiter Trojans appear to be a key population of small bodies to study and
test the models of the Solar System formation and evolution. Because
understanding the evolution of Trojans can bring strong and unique constraints
on the origins of our planetary system, a significant observational effort has
been undertaken to unveil their physical characteristics. The data gathered so
far are consistent with Trojans having volatile-rich interiors (possibly water
ice) and volatile-poor surfaces (fine grained silicates). Since water ice is
not thermodynamically stable against sublimation at the surface of an object
located at ~5 AU, such layering seems consistent with past outgassing. In this
work, we study the thermal history of Trojans after the formation of a dust
mantle by possible past outgassing, so as to constrain the depth at which water
ice could be stable. We find that it could have survived 100 m below the
surface, even if Trojans orbited close to the Sun for ~10,000 years, as
suggested by the most recent dynamical models. Water ice should be found ~10 m
below the surface in most cases, and below 10 cm in the polar regions in some
cases.
