We present the first spectropolarimetric radio observations that apply
Rotation Measure (RM) Synthesis to interferometric data from the Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 610 MHz. Spectropolarimetry requires
measurement of a large number of instrumental systematics so that their effects
can be calibrated - a technical problem that is currently being faced by the
upcoming SKA pathfinders. Our fully-calibrated data allow for the peak Faraday
depth and polarisation fraction to be measured for sub-mJy compact sources in
the field of M51 at 610 MHz. The diffuse extended emission in the interacting
galaxy pair is shown to be depolarised below the sensitivity limit. A survey of
linear polarisation with the GMRT is now feasible and could be used to place
constraints on the prevailing depolarisation mechanisms at low frequencies -
improving polarised source count estimates and constraining the RM-grid
observable with next generation facilities such as the SKA.
