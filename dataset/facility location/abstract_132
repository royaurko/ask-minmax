The ExTrA facility, located at La Silla observatory, will consist of a
near-infrared multi-object spectrograph fed by three 60-cm telescopes. ExTrA
will add the spectroscopic resolution to the traditional differential
photometry method. This shall enable the fine correction of color-dependent
systematics that would otherwise hinder ground-based observations. With both
this novel method and an infrared-enabled efficiency, ExTrA aims to find
transiting telluric planets orbiting in the habitable zone of bright nearby M
dwarfs. It shall have the versatility to do so by running its own independent
survey and also by concurrently following-up on the space candidates unveiled
by K2 and TESS. The exoplanets detected by ExTrA will be amenable to
atmospheric characterisation with VLTs, JWST, and ELTs and could give our first
peek into an exo-life laboratory.
