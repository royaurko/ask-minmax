We consider the annihilation process of an electron-positron pair into a pair
of heavier fermions when the initial electron and position beams are polarized.
By calculating the polarization of the final-state particles, we discuss in
detail the effect due to the produced particle masses in the $\tau$-charm
energy region at BEPC/BES, and also compare the effect with that at the
B-factory. Such a study is useful for the design of possible polarization
investigation at the BEPC/BES facility and the B-factory.
