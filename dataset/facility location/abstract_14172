Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) constitute a fine-tunable class of
compounds. Morpholinium-based cations are new to the field. They are promising
candidates for electrochemistry, micellization and catalytic applications. We
investigate halogenation (fluorination and chlorination) of the
N-ethyl-N-methylmorpholinium cation from thermodynamics perspective. We find
that substitutional fluorination is much more energetically favorable than
substitutional chlorination, although the latter is also a permitted process.
Although all halogenation at different locations are possible, they are not
equally favorable. Furthermore, the trends are not identical in the case of
fluorination and chlorination. We link the thermodynamic observables to
electron density distribution within the investigated cation. The reported
insights are based on the coupled-cluster technique, which is a highly accurate
and reliable electron-correlation method. Novel derivatives of the
morpholinium-based RTILs are discussed, motivating further efforts in synthetic
chemistry.
