Different countries have different privacy regulatory models. These models
impact the perspectives and laws surrounding internet privacy. However, little
is known about how effective the regulatory models are when it comes to
limiting online tracking and advertising activity. In this paper, we propose a
method for investigating tracking behavior by analyzing cookies and HTTP
requests from browsing sessions originating in different countries. We collect
browsing data from visits to top websites in various countries that utilize
different regulatory models. We found that there are significant differences in
tracking activity between different countries using several metrics. We also
suggest various ways to extend this study which may yield a more complete
representation of tracking from a global perspective.
