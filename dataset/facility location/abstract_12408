Vortices of several condensed matter systems are predicted to have
zero-energy core excitations which are Majorana fermions. These exotic
quasi-particles are neutral, massless, and expected to have non-Abelian
statistics. Furthermore, they make the ground state of the system highly
degenerate. For a large density of vortices, an Abrikosov lattice is formed,
and tunneling of Majorana fermions between vortices removes the energy
degeneracy. In particular the spectrum of Majorana fermions in a triangular
lattice is gapped, and the Hamiltonian which describes such a system is
antisymmetric under time-reversal. We consider Majorana fermions on a
disordered triangular lattice. We find that even for very weak disorder in the
location of the vortices localized sub-gap modes appear. As the disorder
becomes strong, a percolation phase transition takes place, and the gap is
fully closed by extended states. The mechanism that underlies these phenomena
is domain walls between two time-reversed phases, which are created by flipping
the sign of the tunneling matrix elements. The density of states in the
disordered lattice seems to diverge at zero energy.
