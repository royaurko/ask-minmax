This paper unifies and extends results on a class of multivariate Extreme
Value (EV) models studied by Hougaard, Crowder, and Tawn. In these models both
unconditional and conditional distributions are EV, and all lower-dimensional
marginals and maxima belong to the class. This leads to substantial economies
of understanding, analysis and prediction. One interpretation of the models is
as size mixtures of EV distributions, where the mixing is by positive stable
distributions. A second interpretation is as exponential-stable location
mixtures (for Gumbel) or as power-stable scale mixtures (for non-Gumbel EV
distributions). A third interpretation is through a Peaks over Thresholds model
with a positive stable intensity. The mixing variables are used as a modeling
tool and for better understanding and model checking. We study extreme value
analogues of components of variance models, and new time series, spatial, and
continuous parameter models for extreme values. The results are applied to data
from a pitting corrosion investigation.
