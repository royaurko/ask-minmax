The physical interpretation of extensive measurements of electron neutrinos
(in laboratories located on or somewhat below the Earth's surface) often
require geophysical notions concerning the possible neutrino sources. Here, we
discuss the notion that the Earth's core is a substantial source of low energy
electron neutrinos.
