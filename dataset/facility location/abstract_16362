We studied spicular jets over a plage area and derived their dynamic
characteristics using Hinode Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) high-resolution
images. The target plage region was near the west limb of the solar disk. This
location permitted us to study the dynamics of spicular jets without the
overlapping effect of spicular structures along the line of sight.
  In this work, to increase the ease with which we can identify spicules on the
disk, we applied the image processing method `MadMax' developed by Koutchmy et
al. (1989). It enhances fine, slender structures (like jets), over a diffuse
background. We identified 169 spicules over the target plage. This sample
permits us to derive statistically reliable results regarding spicular
dynamics.
  The properties of plage spicules can be summarized as follows: (1) In a plage
area, we clearly identified spicular jet features. (2) They were shorter in
length than the quiet region limb spicules, and followed ballistic motion under
constant deceleration. (3) The majority (80%) of the plage spicules showed the
cycle of rise and retreat, while 10% of them faded out without a complete
retreat phase. (4) The deceleration of the spicule was proportional to the
velocity of ejection (i.e. the initial velocity).
