We have studied the ground state bulk properties of magnesium isotopes using
axially symmetric relativistic mean field formalism. The BCS pairing approach
is employed to take care of the pairing correlation for the open shell nuclei.
The contour plot of the nucleons distribution are analyzed at various parts of
the nucleus, where clusters are located. The presence of an $^{16}$O core along
bubble like $\alpha$-particle(s) and few {\it nucleons} are found in the Mg
isotopes.
