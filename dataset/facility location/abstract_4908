We develop a new approach for the Anderson localization problem. The
implementation of this method yields strong numerical evidence leading to a
(surprising to many) conjecture: The two dimensional discrete random
Schroedinger operator with small disorder allows states that are dynamically
delocalized with positive probability. This approach is based on a recent
result by Abakumov-Liaw-Poltoratski which is rooted in the study of spectral
behavior under rank-one perturbations, and states that every non-zero vector is
almost surely cyclic for the singular part of the operator.
  The numerical work presented is rather simplistic compared to other numerical
approaches in the field. Further, this method eliminates effects due to
boundary conditions.
  While we carried out the numerical experiment almost exclusively in the case
of the two dimensional discrete random Schroedinger operator, we include the
setup for the general class of Anderson models called Anderson-type
Hamiltonians.
  We track the location of the energy when a wave packet initially located at
the origin is evolved according to the discrete random Schroedinger operator.
  This method does not provide new insight on the energy regimes for which
diffusion occurs.
