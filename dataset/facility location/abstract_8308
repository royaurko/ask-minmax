The recovery of cosmic ray Carbon nuclei of energy ~20-125 MeV/nuc in solar
cycle #23 from 2004 to 2010 has been followed at three locations, near the
Earth using ACE data and at V2 between 74-92 AU and also at V1 beyond the
heliospheric termination shock at between 91-113 AU. To describe the observed
intensity changes and to predict the absolute intensities measured at all three
locations we have used a simple spherically symmetric (no drift) two-zone
heliospheric transport model with specific values for the diffusion coefficient
in both the inner and outer zones. The diffusion coefficient in the outer zone
is determined to be ~5-10 times smaller than that in the inner zone out to 90
AU. For both V1 and V2 the calculated C nuclei intensities agree within an
average of \pm 10% with the observed intensities. Because of this agreement
between V1 and V2 observations and predictions there is no need to invoke an
asymmetrical squashed heliosphere or other effects to explain the V2
intensities relative to V1 as is the case for He nuclei. The combination of the
diffusion parameters used in this model and the interstellar spectrum give an
unusually low overall solar modulation parameter \phi = 250 MV to describe the
Carbon intensities observed at the Earth in 2009. At all times both the
observed and calculated spectra are very closely ~ E1.0 as would be expected in
the adiabatic energy loss regime of solar modulation.
