We report the results of the XMM-Newton observation of the Pulsar Wind Nebula
(PWN) in the composite supernova remnant G0.9+0.1 located in the Galactic
Center region. Thanks to the sensitivity of the EPIC cameras, we focus on the
first spectral analysis of large and small-scale structures of this PWN using
MOS and PN data in combination. Our spatially resolved spectral analysis at
large-scale offers a clear indication of a softening of the photon index with
distance from the centroid of the nebula (from
Gamma_{core}=1.12^{+0.45}_{-0.48} to Gamma=2.42^{+0.19}_{-0.19}), as observed
in other known X-ray plerions. A spectral analysis of the small-scale
structures in the central region of this PWN, delineates variations of the
spectral index within the arc-like feature observed with Chandra: the eastern
part has a hard photon index (Gamma ~ 1.2 pm 0.5), while the south-west part
has a softer photon index (Gamma ~ 2.8 pm 0.7).
