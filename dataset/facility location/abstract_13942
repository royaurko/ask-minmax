We use the conformal bootstrap to study conformal field theories with $O(N)$
global symmetry in $d=5$ and $d=5.95$ spacetime dimensions that have a scalar
operator $\phi_i$ transforming as an $O(N)$ vector. The crossing symmetry of
the four-point function of this $O(N)$ vector operator, along with unitarity
assumptions, determine constraints on the scaling dimensions of conformal
primary operators in the $\phi_i \times \phi_j$ OPE. Imposing a lower bound on
the second smallest scaling dimension of such an $O(N)$-singlet conformal
primary, and varying the scaling dimension of the lowest one, we obtain an
allowed region that exhibits a kink located very close to the interacting
$O(N)$-symmetric CFT conjectured to exist recently by Fei, Giombi, and
Klebanov. Under reasonable assumptions on the dimension of the second lowest
$O(N)$ singlet in the $\phi_i \times \phi_j$ OPE, we observe that this kink
disappears in $d =5$ for small enough $N$, suggesting that in this case an
interacting $O(N)$ CFT may cease to exist for $N$ below a certain critical
value.
