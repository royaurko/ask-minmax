We present the methods and first results of a survey of nearby high proper
motion main sequence stars to probe for cool companions with the Gemini camera
at Lick Observatory. This survey uses a sample of old (age > 2 Gyr) stars as
targets to probe for companions down to temperatures of 500 K. Multi-epoch
observations allow us to discriminate comoving companions from background
objects. So far, our survey successfully re-discovers the wide T8.5 companion
to GJ 1263 and discovers a companion to the nearby M0V star GJ 660.1. The
companion to GJ 660.1 (GJ 660.1B) is ~4 magnitudes fainter than its host star
in the J-band and is located at a projected separation of ~120AU. Known
trigonometric parallax and 2MASS magnitudes for the GJ 660.1 system indicate a
spectral type for the companion of M9 +/- 2.
