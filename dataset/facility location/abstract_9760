We investigate the static and dynamic behaviors of a Br adlayer
electrochemically deposited onto single-crystal Ag(100) using an off-lattice
model of the adlayer. Unlike previous studies using a lattice-gas model, the
off-lattice model allows adparticles to be located at any position within a
two-dimensional approximation to the substrate. Interactions with the substrate
are approximated by a corrugation potential. Using Density Functional Theory
(DFT) to calculate surface binding energies, a sinusoidal approximation to the
corrugation potential is constructed. A variety of techniques, including Monte
Carlo and Langevin simulations, are used to study the behavior of the adlayer.
The lateral root-mean-square (rms) deviation of the adparticles from the
binding sites is presented along with equilibrium coverage isotherms, and the
thermally activated Arrhenius barrier-hopping model used in previous dynamic
Monte Carlo simulations is tested.
