We predict the locations of several multicritical points of the Potts spin
glass model on the triangular lattice. In particular, continuous multicritical
lines, which consist of multicritical points, are obtained for two types of
two-state Potts (i.e., Ising) spin glasses with two- and three-body
interactions on the triangular lattice. These results provide us with numerous
examples to further verify the validity of the conjecture, which has succeeded
in deriving highly precise locations of multicritical points for several spin
glass models. The technique, called the direct triangular duality, a variant of
the ordinary duality transformation, directly relates the triangular lattice
with its dual triangular lattice in conjunction with the replica method.
