During about 3 years wide field monitoring of the Galactic Center region by
the WFC telescopes on board the BeppoSAX satellite, a total of 14 type-I X-ray
bursts were detected from the burster 1E 1724-3045 located in the globular
cluster Terzan 2. All the observed events showed evidence for photospheric
radius expansion due to Eddington-limit burst luminosity, thus leading to an
estimate of the source distance (~7.2 kpc). Preliminary results of the analysis
of the bursts are presented.
