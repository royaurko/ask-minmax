New necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the quantization of a
class of periodic second order non-homogeneous ordinary differential equations
in the complex plane in this paper. The problem is studied from the viewpoint
of complex oscillation theory first developed by Bank and Laine (1982, 1983)
and Gundersen and Steinbart (1994). We show that when a solution is complex
non-oscillatory (finite exponent of convergence of zeros) then the solution,
which can be written as special functions, must degenerate. This gives a
necessary and sufficient condition when the Lommel function has finitely many
zeros in every branch and this is a type of quantization for the
non-homogeneous differential equation. The degenerate solutions are of
polynomial/rational-type functions which are of independent interest. In
particular, this shows that complex non-oscillatory solutions of this class of
differential equations are equivalent to the subnormal solutions considered in
a previous paper of the contributors (to appear). In addition to the asymptotics of
special functions, the other main idea we apply in our proof is a classical
result of E. M. Wright which gives precise asymptotic locations of large zeros
of a functional equation.
