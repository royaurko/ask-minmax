I explain the origin of the Vainshtein mechanism in terms of the "gauge"
transformation function $T_0(r,t)$ for the stationary spherically-symmetric
solutions obtained in {\it Prog. Theor. Exp. Phys. 023E02, (2014)}, where the
extra degrees of freedom enter through the spatial dependence of the gauge
transformation function $T_0(r,t)\backsim t+A(r)$. Written in this form, the
Vainshtein mechanism is a way to recover the Birkhoff theorem for scales near
the source and the Cosmic no-hair conjecture for scales near the cosmological
horizon. Additionally, the Vainshtein mechanism is the dual version of the
particle creation process in a black-Hole (radiation). Then if we want to
analyze the Hawking radiation inside dRGT, we have to be careful when some
apparent extra contribution appears. This extra contribution comes from the
dual version of the Vainshtein mechanism, behaving as a particle creation
process from the point of view of an observer located at scales $r>>r_V$, with
$r_V$ being the Vainshtein scale.
