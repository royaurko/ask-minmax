In this article we want to present the EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR) in some
detail, as well as some of the instruments of interest for ionospheric and
magnetospheric research that are located in the vicinity of it. We particularly
describe how this instrument cluster, close to the geomagnetic conjugate point
of the Chinese Antarctic Zhongshan station, can contribute to inter-hemispheric
coordinated studies of the polar Ionosphere.
