In this paper we investigate the possible existence of multi-point
correlation in the arrival direction of the UHECR events detected by the High
Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) stereo detector. Multi-point correlations could
result from the deflection of UHECRs by galactic and intergalactic magnetic
fields, and the subsequent dispersion of arrival directions from point like
sources. The search is performed by calculating the solid angle subtended by
the polygon between triplets and quadruplets of events in the HiRes data. The
resulting distribution of solid angles is then compared to the cumulative
distributions from multiple simulated isotropic data sets to estimate the
significance of any excess. We also looked for potential correlation of the
small solid angle triplets found in the data with the locations of the BL
Lacertae (BL Lac) objects. Neither statistically significant clustering nor
significant correlations with BL Lac objects were found in these studies.
