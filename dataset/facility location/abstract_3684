Precise astronomical spectroscopic analyses routinely assume that individual
pixels in charge-coupled devices (CCDs) have uniform sensitivity to photons.
Intra-pixel sensitivity (IPS) variations may already cause small systematic
errors in, for example, studies of extra-solar planets via stellar radial
velocities and cosmological variability in fundamental constants via quasar
spectroscopy, but future experiments requiring velocity precisions approaching
~1 cm/s will be more strongly affected. Laser frequency combs have been shown
to provide highly precise wavelength calibration for astronomical
spectrographs, but here we show that they can also be used to measure IPS
variations in astronomical CCDs in situ. We successfully tested a laser
frequency comb system on the Ultra-High Resolution Facility spectrograph at the
Anglo-Australian Telescope. By modelling the 2-dimensional comb signal recorded
in a single CCD exposure, we find that the average IPS deviates by <8 per cent
if it is assumed to vary symmetrically about the pixel centre. We also
demonstrate that series of comb exposures with absolutely known offsets between
them can yield tighter constraints on symmetric IPS variations from ~100
pixels. We discuss measurement of asymmetric IPS variations and absolute
wavelength calibration of astronomical spectrographs and CCDs using frequency
combs.
