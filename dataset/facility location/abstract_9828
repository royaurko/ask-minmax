A metastable homogeneous state exists down to zero temperature in systems of
repelling objects. Zero ''fluctuation temperature'' liquid state therefore
serves as a (pseudo) ''fixed point'' controlling the properties of vortex
liquid below and even around melting point. There exists Madelung constant for
the liquid in the limit of zero temperature which is higher than that of the
solid by an amount approximately equal to the latent heat of melting. This
picture is supported by an exactly solvable large $N$ Ginzburg - Landau model
in magnetic field. Based on this understanding we apply Borel - Pade
resummation technique to develop a theory of the vortex liquid in type II
superconductors. Applicability of the effective lowest Landau level model is
discussed and corrections due to higher levels is calculated. Combined with
previous quantitative description of the vortex solid the melting line is
located. Magnetization, entropy and specific heat jumps along it are
calculated. The magnetization of liquid is larger than that of solid by $%
1.8%$ irrespective of the melting temperature. We compare the result with
experiments on high $T_{c}$ cuprates $YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}$, $DyBCO$, low $%
T_{c}$ material $(K,Ba)BiO_{3}$ and with Monte Carlo simulations.
