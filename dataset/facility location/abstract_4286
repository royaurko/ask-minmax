The Barnett effect refers to the magnetization induced by rotation of a
demagnetized ferromagnet. We describe the location and stability of stationary
states in rotating nanostructures using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.
The conditions for an experimental observation of the Barnett effect in
different materials and sample geometries are discussed.
