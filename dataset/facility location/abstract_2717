I introduce batman, a Python package for modeling exoplanet transit light
curves. The batman package supports calculation of light curves for any
radially symmetric stellar limb darkening law, using a new integration
algorithm for models that cannot be quickly calculated analytically. The code
uses C extension modules to speed up model calculation and is parallelized with
OpenMP. For a typical light curve with 100 data points in transit, batman can
calculate one million quadratic limb-darkened models in 30 seconds with a
single 1.7 GHz Intel Core i5 processor. The same calculation takes seven
minutes using the four-parameter nonlinear limb darkening model (computed to 1
ppm accuracy). Maximum truncation error for integrated models is an input
parameter that can be set as low as 0.001 ppm, ensuring that the community is
prepared for the precise transit light curves we anticipate measuring with
upcoming facilities. The batman package is open source and publicly available
at https://github.com/lkreidberg/batman .
