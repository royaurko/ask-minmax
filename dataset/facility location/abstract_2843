Closely following recent ideas of J. Borcea, we discuss various modifications
and relaxations of Sendov's conjecture about the location of critical points of
a polynomial with complex coefficients. The resulting open problems are
formulated in terms of matrix theory, mathematical statistics or potential
theory. Quite a few links between classical works in the geometry of
polynomials and recent advances in the location of spectra of small rank
perturbations of structured matrices are established. A couple of simple
examples provide natural and sometimes sharp bounds for the proposed
conjectures.
