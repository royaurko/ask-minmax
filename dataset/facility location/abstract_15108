We report on the observation of a very small glitch observed for the first
time in a millisecond pulsar, PSR B1821-24 located in the globular cluster M28.
Timing observations were mainly conducted with the Nancay radiotelescope
(France) and confirmation comes from the 140ft radiotelescope at Green Bank and
the new Green Bank Telescope data. This event is characterized by a rotation
frequency step of 3 nHz, or 10^-11 in fractional frequency change along with a
short duration limited to a few days or a week. A marginally significant
frequency derivative step was also found. This glitch follows the main
characteristics of those in the slow period pulsars, but is two orders of
magnitude smaller than the smallest ever recorded. Such an event must be very
rare for millisecond pulsars since no other glitches have been detected when
the cumulated number of years of millisecond pulsar timing observations up to
2001 is around 500 for all these objects. However, pulsar PSR B1821-24 is one
of the youngest among the old recycled ones and there is likely a correlation
between age, or a related parameter, and timing noise. While this event happens
on a much smaller scale, the required adjustment of the star to a new
equilibrium figure as it spins down is a likely common cause for all glitches.
