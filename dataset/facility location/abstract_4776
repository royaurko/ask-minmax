CP Tuc (AX J2315-592) is a polar for which two accretion geometries have been
put forward. They differ in the location of the accretion column on the
white-dwarf surface. In this study, we present new multiband optical
photometric and polarimetric data to study the post-shock position. These data
are used as input for CYCLOPS, our new code for modeling the cyclotron emission
from post-shock regions of polars. CYCLOPS has a full 3-D treatment of the
radiative transfer and is a powerful tool to study the physical properties of
the emitting region. We find reasonable fits for the optical data of CP Tuc in
both scenarios. We suggest that it should be possible to constrain the location
of the base of the accreting column by modeling the X-ray light curves.
