We present HST/STIS observations of ESO 184-G82, the host galaxy of the
gamma-ray burst GRB 980425 associated with the peculiar Type Ic supernova
SN1998bw. ESO 184-G82 is found to be an actively star forming SBc sub-luminous
galaxy. We detect an object consistent with being a point source within the
astrometric uncertainty of 0.018 arcseconds of the position of the supernova.
The object is located inside a star-forming region and is at least one
magnitude brighter than expected for the supernova based on a simple
radioactive decay model. This implies either a significant flattening of the
light curve or a contribution from an underlying star cluster.
