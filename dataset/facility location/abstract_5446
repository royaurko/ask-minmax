The charge form factor of $^$4He has been extracted in the range 29 fm$^{-2}$
$\le Q^2 \le 77$ fm$^{-2}$ from elastic electron scattering, detecting $^4$He
nuclei and electrons in coincidence with the High Resolution Spectrometers of
the Hall A Facility of Jefferson Lab. The results are in qualitative agreement
with realistic meson-nucleon theoretical calculations. The data have uncovered
a second diffraction minimum, which was predicted in the $Q^2$ range of this
experiment, and rule out conclusively long-standing predictions of dimensional
scaling of high-energy amplitudes using quark counting.
