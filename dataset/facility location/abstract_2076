We analyse higher order modes in the 3.9 GHz bunch shaping cavities recently
installed in the FLASH facility at DESY. We report on recent experimental
results on the frequency spectrum from probe based measurements made at CMTB at
DESY. These are compared to those predicted by finite difference and finite
element computer codes. This study is focused mainly on the dipole component of
the multi-pole expansion of the wakefield.. The modes are readily identifiable
as single-cavity modes provided the frequencies of these modes are below the
cut-off of the inter-connecting beam pipes. The modes above cut-off are coupled
to the 4 cavities and are distinct from single cavity modes
