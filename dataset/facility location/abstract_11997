In this paper, we propose an automatic analysis system for the Arabic
handwriting postal addresses recognition, by using the beta elliptical model.
Our system is divided into different steps: analysis, pre-processing and
classification. The first operation is the filtering of image. In the second,
we remove the border print, stamps and graphics. After locating the address on
the envelope, the address segmentation allows the extraction of postal code and
city name separately. The pre-processing system and the modeling approach are
based on two basic steps. The first step is the extraction of the temporal
order in the image of the handwritten trajectory. The second step is based on
the use of Beta-Elliptical model for the representation of handwritten script.
The recognition system is based on Graph-matching algorithm. Our modeling and
recognition approaches were validated by using the postal code and city names
extracted from the Tunisian postal envelopes data. The recognition rate
obtained is about 98%.
