This paper describes the design and development of a location-based mobile
shopping application for bakery product shops. Whole application is deployed on
cloud. The three-tier architecture consists of, front-end, middle-ware and
back-end. The front-end level is a location-based mobile shopping application
for android mobile devices, for purchasing bakery products of nearby places.
Front-end level also displays association among the purchased products. The
middle-ware level provides a web service to generate JSON (JavaScript Object
Notation) output from the relational database. It exchanges information and
data between mobile application and servers in cloud. The back-end level
provides the Apache Tomcat Web server and MySQL database. The application also
uses the Google Cloud Messaging for generating and sending notification of
orders to shopkeeper.
