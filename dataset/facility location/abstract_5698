General properties of the Orion star-forming region are discussed, with a
focus on the dense Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). This cluster contains between
2500 and 4500 objects located within a few parsecs of the eponymous Trapezium
stars. Its members are aged <1 to a few Myr and encompass the full spectrum of
stellar masses <50 Msun, as well as brown dwarfs detected with masses as low as
<0.02 Msun (20 Mjup) thusfar. Recent results from optical, near-infrared, and
x-ray studies of the stellar/sub-stellar population associated with this
cluster are summarized.
