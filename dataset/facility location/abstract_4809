The complex admittance of metal/oxide/pentacene thin film junctions is
investigated under ambient conditions. At low frequencies, a contribution
attributed to proton diffusion through the oxide is seen. This diffusion is
shown to be anomalous and is believed to be also at the origin of the bias
stress effect observed in organic field effect transistors. At higher
frequencies, two dipolar contributions are evidenced, attributed to defects
located one at the organic/oxide interface or within the organic, and the other
in the bulk of the oxide. These two dipolar responses show different dynamic
properties that manifest themselves in the admittance in the form of a Debye
contribution for the defects located in the oxide, and of a Cole-Cole
contribution for the defects related to the organic.
