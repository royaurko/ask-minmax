We analyse the exclusive channel $p\pb\to\gamma \pi^0$, assuming handbag
dominance. The soft parts are parametrized in terms of CGLN amplitudes for the
$q\qb\to\gamma \pi^0$ transition and form factors for the $p\pb\to q\qb$ ones,
the latter represent moments of Generalized Distribution Amplitudes. We present
a combined fit to Fermilab data from E760 taking simultaneously into account
information from other exclusive reactions, especially from $p\pb\to
\gamma\gamma$ data. Overall a nicely consistent picture emerges, such that one
can hope, that our theoretical analysis will be reliable also for the
kinematics of GSI/FAIR, which hopefully will provide much more precise and
complete data. Consequently, data from this facility should improve our
knowledge both on the proton-antiproton distribution amplitudes and the pion
production mechanism.
