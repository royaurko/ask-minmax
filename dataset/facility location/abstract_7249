We report the detection of several new circumstellar disks seen in silhouette
in the outskirts of the Orion nebula and M43, detected as part of our Halpha
survey of Orion with the HST/ACS. Several of the disks show bipolar reflection
nebulae, microjets, or temporal variability. Two disks in our sample are large
and particularly noteworthy: A nearly edge-on disk, d216-0939, is located
several arcminutes northwest of M43 and resembles the famous HH30 disk/jet
system in Taurus. It drives the 0.15 pc long bipolar outflow HH667, and
exhibits a remarkable asymmetric reflection nebula. With a diameter of 1200 AU,
it is as large as the giant edge-on silhouette disk d114-426 in the core of the
Orion Nebula. The large disk d253-1536 is located in a binary system embedded
within an externally-ionized giant proplyd in M43. The disk exhibits
distortions which we attribute to tidal interactions with a companion. The
bipolar jet HH668 emerges orthogonal to the disk, and a bow shock lies 54''
south of this binary system along the outflow axis. Proper motions over 1.4 yr
confirm that these emission knots are moving away from d253-1536, with speeds
as high as 330 km/s in the HH668 microjet, and slower motion farther from the
star.
