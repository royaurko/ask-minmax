We performed Monte Carlo simulations in a bilayer system composed by two thin
films, one ferromagnetic (FM) and the other antiferromagnetic (AFM). Two
lattice structures for the films were considered: simple cubic (sc) and a body
center cubic (bcc). In both lattices structures we imposed an uncompensated
interfacial spin structure, in particular we emulated a FeF2-FM system in the
case of the (bcc) lattice. Our analysis focused on the incidence of the
interfacial strength interactions between the films J_eb and the effect of
thermal fluctuations on the bias field H_EB. We first performed Monte Carlo
simulations on a microscopic model based on classical Heisenberg spin
variables. To analyze the simulation results we also introduced a simplified
model that assumes coherent rotation of spins located on the same layer
parallel to the interface. We found that, depending on the AFM film anisotropy
to exchange ratio, the bias field is either controlled by the intrinsic pinning
of a domain wall parallel to the interface or by the stability of the first AFM
layer (quasi domain wall) near the interface.
