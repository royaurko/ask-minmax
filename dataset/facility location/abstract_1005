A longitudinal space charge amplifier (LSCA), operating in soft x-ray regime,
was recently proposed. Such an amplifier consists of a few amplification
cascades (focusing channel and chicane) and a short radiator undulator in the
end. Broadband nature of LSCA supports generation of few-cycle pulses as well
as wavelength compression. In this paper we consider an application of these
properties of LSCA for generation of attosecond x-ray pulses. It is shown that
a compact and cheap addition to the soft x-ray free electron laser facility
FLASH would allow to generate 60 attosecond (FWHM) long x-ray pulses with the
peak power at 100 MW level and a contrast above 98%.
