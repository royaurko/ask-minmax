The historical interplay between societies are governed by many factors,
including in particular spreading of languages, religion and other symbolic
traits. Cultural development, in turn, is coupled to emergence and maintenance
of information spreading. Strong centralized cultures exist thanks to attention
from their members, which faithfulness in turn relies on supply of information.
Here, we discuss a culture evolution model on a planar geometry that takes into
account aspects of the feedback between information spreading and its
maintenance. Features of model are highlighted by comparing it to cultural
spreading in ancient and medieval Europe, where it in particular suggests that
long lived centers should be located in geographically remote regions.
