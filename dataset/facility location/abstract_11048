We report the resistivity of a series of fluorine-doped SmFeAsO1-xFx
polycrystalline superconductors in magnetic fields up to 60T. For underdoped
samples (x < 0.15), the low temperature resistive state is characterized by
pronounced magneto-resistance and a resistive upturn at low temperatures. The
"insulating behavior" is characterized by a log-T divergence observed over a
decade in temperature. In contrast, the normal state for samples with doping x
> 0.15 display metallic behavior with little magnetoresistance, where intense
magnetic fields broaden the superconducting transition rather than suppress Tc.
The location of the insulator-to metal crossover coincides with the reported
suppression of the structural phase transition (SPT)in the phase diagram for
SmFeAsO1-xFx series.
