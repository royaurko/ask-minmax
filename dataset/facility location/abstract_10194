We discuss the connection between the contributions of large field
configurations and the large order behavior of perturbation theory. For
quenched QCD, the sensitivity of the average plaquette to a removal of large
field configurations has a narrow peak near beta=5.6. Various analysis of the
order 10 weak coupling series for the plaquette give robust indications for a
singularity in the third derivative of the free energy (second derivative of
the plaquette) with respect to beta, near beta = 5.7. We report results of
numerical calculations. The peak in the third derivative of the free energy
present on 4^4 lattices disappears if the size of the lattice is increased
isotropically up to a 10^4 lattice. On the other hand, on 4xL^3 lattices, it
persists when L increases. The location of the peak coincides with the onset of
a non-zero average for the Polyakov loop and seems related to the finite
temperature transition. We also discuss the discrepancy between the
perturbative series and the numerical values of the plaquette.
