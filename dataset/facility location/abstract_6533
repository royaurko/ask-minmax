We applied Frequency Map Analysis (FMA) - a method that is widely used to
explore dynamics of Hamiltonian systems - to beam-beam effects study. The
method turned out to be rather informative and illustrative in the case of a
novel Crab Waist collision approach, when "crab" focusing of colliding beams
results in significant suppression of betatron coupling resonances. Application
of FMA provides visible information about all working resonances, their widths
and locations in the planes of betatron tunes and betatron amplitudes, so the
process of resonances suppression due to the beams crabbing is clearly seen.
