The study of the weather is performed using instruments termed weather
stations. These weather stations are distributed around the world, collecting
the data from the different phenomena. Several weather organizations have been
deploying thousands of these instruments, creating big networks to collect
weather data. These instruments are collecting the weather data and delivering
it for later processing in the collections points. Nevertheless, all the
methodologies used to transmit the weather data are based in protocols non
adapted for this purpose. Thus, the weather stations are limited by the data
formats and protocols used in them, not taking advantage of the real-time data
available on them. We research the weather instruments, their technology and
their network capabilities, in order to provide a solution for the mentioned
problem. OpenWeather is the protocol proposed to provide a more optimum and
reliable way to transmit the weather data. We evaluate the environmental
factors, such as location or bandwidth availability, in order to design a
protocol adapted to the requirements established by the automatic weather
stations. A peer to peer architecture is proposed, providing a functional
implementation of OpenWeather protocol. The evaluation of the protocol is
executed in a real scenario, providing the hints to adapt the protocol to a
common automatic weather station.
