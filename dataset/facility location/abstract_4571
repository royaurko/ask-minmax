It is supposed that in our Universe with compactified extra dimensions (ED)
the domains exist with noncompactified ED. Such domain can be a wormhole-like
solution in multidimensional gravity (MD), located between two null surfaces.
With the availability of compactification mechanism this MD domain can be
joined on null surfaces with two black holes filled by gauge field. Solution of
this kind in MD gravity on the principal bundle with structural group SU(3) is
obtained. This solution is wormhole-like object located between two null
surfaces $ds^2=0$. In some sense these solutions are dual to black holes: they
are statical spherically symmetric solutions under null surfaces whereas black
holes are statical spherically symmetric solutions outside of event horizon.
