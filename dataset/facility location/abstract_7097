The recently demonstrated control over light distribution through turbid
media based on real-time three-dimensional optoacoustic feedback has offered
promising prospects to interferometrically focus light within scattering
objects. Nevertheless, the focusing capacity of the feedback-based approach is
strongly conditioned by the number of effectively resolvable optical modes
(speckles). In this letter, we experimentally tested the light intensity
enhancement achieved with optoacoustic feedback measurements from different
sizes of absorbing microparticles. The importance of the obtained results is
discussed in the context of potential signal enhancement at deep locations
within a scattering medium where the effective speckle sizes approach the
minimum values dictated by optical diffraction.
