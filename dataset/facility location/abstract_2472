Recent lattice QCD calculations from the HAL and NPLQCD Collaborations have
reported evidence for the existence of a bound state with strangeness -2 and
baryon number 2 at quark masses somewhat higher than the physical values. A
controlled chiral extrapolation of these lattice results to the physical point
suggested that the state, identified with the famed H dibaryon, is most likely
slightly unbound (by 13 $\pm$ 14 MeV) with respect to the $\Lambda--\Lambda$
threshold. We report the results of an updated analysis which finds the H
unbound by 26 $\pm$ 11 MeV. Apart from the insight it would give us into how
QCD is realized in Nature, the H is of great interest because of its potential
implications for the equation of state of dense matter and studies of neutron
stars. It may also explain the enhancement above the $\Lambda--\Lambda$
threshold already reported experimentally. It is clearly of great importance
that the latter be pursued in experiments at the new J-PARC facility.
