Localization of a non-cooperative target with binary detectors is considered.
A general expression for the Fisher information for estimation of target
location and power is developed. This general expression is then used to derive
closed-form approximations for the Cramer-Rao bound for the case of
non-coherent detectors. Simulations show that the approximations are quite
consistent with the exact bounds.
