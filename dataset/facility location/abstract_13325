We introduce a self-propelled colloidal hematite docker that can be steered
to a small particle cargo many times its size, dock, transport the cargo to a
remote location, and then release it. The self-propulsion and docking are
reversible and activated by visible light. The docker can be steered either by
a weak uniform magnetic field or by nanoscale tracks in a textured substrate.
The light-activated motion and docking originate from osmotic/phoretic particle
transport in a concentration gradient of fuel, hydrogen peroxide, induced by
the photocatalytic activity of the hematite. The docking mechanism is versatile
and can be applied to various materials and shapes. The hematite dockers are
simple single-component particles and are synthesized in bulk quantities. This
system opens up new possibilities for designing complex micrometer-size
factories as well as new biomimetic systems.
