This talk is a review of our studies of instantons and their properties as
seen in our lattice simulations of SU(2) gauge theory. We have measured the
topological susceptibility and the size distribution of instantons in the QCD
vacuum.
 We have also investigated the properties of quarks moving in instanton
background field configurations, where the sizes and locations of the
instantons are taken from simulations of the full gauge theory. By themselves,
these multi-instanton configurations do not confine quarks, but they induce
chiral symmetry breaking.
