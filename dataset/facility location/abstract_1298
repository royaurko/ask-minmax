We developed a prototype of touch-based survey tool for tablets and conducted
an experiment to compare interaction patterns of touch-based, PC-based, and
paper-based questionnaires. Our findings suggest that a touch-based interface
allows users to complete ranking questions easily, quickly, and accurately
although it can increase the time to complete a location input task for
well-known, prominent locations.
