Recent experimental data and progress in nuclear structure modeling have lead
to improved descriptions of astrophysically important weak-interaction
processes. The review discusses these advances and their applications to
hydrostatic solar and stellar burning, to the slow and rapid neutron-capture
processes, to neutrino nucleosynthesis, and to explosive hydrogen burning.
Special emphasis is given to the weak-interaction processes associated with
core-collapse supernovae. Despite some significant progress, important
improvements are still warranted. Such improvements are expected to come from
future radioactive ion-beam facilities.
