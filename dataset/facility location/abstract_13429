Solar observations from millimeter to ultraviolet wavelengths show that there
is a temperature minimum between photosphere and chromosphere. Analysis based
on semi-empirical models locate this point at about 500 km over the
photosphere. The consistency of these models has been tested by means of
millimeter to infrared observations.
  In the present work, we show that variations of the theoretical radial
temperature profile near the temperature minimum impacts the brightness
temperature at centimeter, submillimeter, and infrared wavelengths, but the
millimeter wavelength emission remains unchanged. We found a region between 500
and 1000 km over the photosphere that remains hidden to observations at the
frequencies under study in this work.
