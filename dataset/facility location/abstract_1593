This paper is in continuation of our previous work on the structural,
electrical and magnetic properties of Ru doped La(0.67)Ca(0.33)MnO(3) compounds
(Ref.: L.Seetha Lakshmi et.al, J. Magn. Magn. Mater. 257, 195 (2003)). Here we
report the results of magnetotransport measurements on
La(0.67)Ca(0.33)Mn(1-x)Ru(x)O(3) (0<x< 0.1) compounds in the light of proposed
magnetic phase separation.
