We simulate the dynamics of H2+ and HD+ by direct solution of the
time-dependent Schroedinger equation for the electronic and nuclear motion for
the interaction of intense femtosecond pulses. On these timescales the
rotational motion, even for such light molecules, is frozen. Therefore it is a
reasonable assumption that the nuclear alignment is fixed during the pulse
interaction and that rotation can be neglected. In terms of vibrational
relaxation, and since the nuclei are light, vibration will be important over
femtosecond timescales. Although homonuclear diatomics are IR-inactive, in an
intense field one can create vibrational excitation through continuum coupling.
To show the effect of vibration, consider a first approximation in which the
nuclei are infinitely massive so they maintain their positions at a fixed bond
length of R=2 a.u., throughout the process.
