We present a new luminous star in M33 located in the nuclear region. The star
shows strong FeII and [FeII] forest, hydrogen emissions in the spectrum, as
well as nebular lines. TiII and SiII lines were detected in absorption, their
radial velocity shifted by ~ -30km/s relative to emission lines. The star is
variable over seven years with 0.5 mag variations over a year. We studied its
spectral energy distribution together with five confirmed Luminous Blue
Variables and Var A in M33 using homogeneous data and methods. We found the
star's bolometric luminosity to be log(L/Lsun)~6.27, a surface temperature of
T~16000K and black body temperatures of two dust components of T~900 and 420K.
The new star has properties intermediate between the LBVs and VarA (probable
cool hypergiant). In the same time it has a hot photosphere, LBV-like
luminosity and an extensive circumstellar material (strong [CaII] lines). In
these seven luminous variables in M33 we find the total range of the hot
component luminosities is 1.0 dex, but that of the dust componets is 2.0 dex.
We conclude that the dust phenomenon in the luminous variables is temporary and
variable, and that dust activity may follow strong eruptions.
