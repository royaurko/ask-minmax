We present the results of deep radio observations with the Australia
Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) of the globular cluster NGC 6388. We show that
there is no radio source detected (with a r.m.s. noise level of 27 uJy) at the
cluster centre of gravity or at the locations of the any of the Chandra X-ray
sources in the cluster. Based on the fundamental plane of accreting black holes
which is a relationship between X-ray luminosity, radio luminosity and black
hole mass, we place an upper limit of 1500 M_sun on the mass of the putative
intermediate-mass black hole located at the centre of NGC 6388. We discuss the
uncertainties of this upper limit and the previously suggested black hole mass
of 5700 M_sun based on surface density profile analysis.
