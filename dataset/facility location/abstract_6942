Micro-blogging through Twitter has made information short and to the point,
and more importantly systematically searchable. This work is the first of a
series in which quotidian observations about Tunisia are obtained using the
micro-blogging site Twitter. Data was extracted using the open source Twitter
API v1.1. Specific tweets were obtained using functional search operators in
particular thematic hash tags, geo-location, date, time and language. The
presence of Tunisia in the international tweet stream, the language of
communication of Tunisian residents through Twitter as well as Twitter usage
across Tunisia are the center of attention of this article.
