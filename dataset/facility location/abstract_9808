The aging of a nanocrystalline equiatomic ZnSe alloy produced by mechanical
alloying was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques. The measured XRD patterns showed that Se
atoms located at interfacial component migrated with aging giving raise to a
crystalline selenium (c-Se) phase. DSC spectra of heat-treated samples at
temperatures above 221oC followed by quenching showed that the c-Se particles
changed to the amorphous state. It was also observed that the as-milled and
aged samples are highly hydrophilic. The lattice parameters and the average
crystallite sizes were calculated as a function of time of aging and
temperature of heat treatment.
