In this Letter we show that if planetesimals form in spiral features in
self-gravitating discs, as previously suggested by the idealised simulations of
Rice et al, then in realistic protostellar discs, this process will be
restricted to the outer regions of the disc (i.e. at radii in excess of several
tens of A.U.). This restriction relates to the requirement that dust has to be
concentrated in spiral features on a timescale that is less than the (roughly
dynamical) lifetime of such features, and that such rapid accumulation requires
spiral features whose fractional amplitude is not much less than unity. This in
turn requires that the cooling timescale of the gas is relatively short, which
restricts the process to the outer disc. We point out that the efficient
conversion of a large fraction of the primordial dust in the disc into
planetesimals could rescue this material from the well known problem of rapid
inward migration at a $\sim$ metre size scale and that in principle the
collisional evolution of these objects could help to re-supply small dust to
the protostellar disc. We also point out the possible implications of this
scenario for the location of planetesimal belts inferred in debris discs around
main sequence stars, but stress that further dynamical studies are required in
order to establish whether the disc retains a memory of the initial site of
planetesimal creation.
