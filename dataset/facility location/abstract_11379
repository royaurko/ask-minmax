We consider the efficiency of chemical energy extraction from the environment
by the growth of a copolymer made of two constituent units in the
entropy-driven regime. We show that the thermodynamic nonlinearity associated
with the information processing aspect is responsible for a branching of the
system properties such as power, speed of growth, entropy production, and
efficiency, with varying affinity. The standard linear thermodynamics argument
which predicts an efficiency of 1/2 at maximum power is inappropriate because
the regime of maximum power is located either outside of the linear regime or
on a separate bifurcated branch, and because the usual thermodynamic force is
not the natural variable for this optimization.
