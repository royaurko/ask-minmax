We present a method to calibrate a high-resolution wavefront-correcting
device with a single, static camera, located in the focal plane; no moving of
any component is needed. The method is based on a localized diversity and
differential optical transfer functions (dOTF) to compute both the phase and
amplitude in the pupil plane located upstream of the last imaging optics. An
experiment with a spatial light modulator shows that the calibration is
sufficient to robustly operate a focal-plane wavefront sensing algorithm
controlling a wavefront corrector with ~40 000 degrees of freedom. We estimate
that the locations of identical wavefront corrector elements are determined
with a spatial resolution of 0.3% compared to the pupil diameter.
