The long gamma-ray burst GRB 060714 was observed to exhibit a series of five
X-ray flares beginning ~70 s after the burst trigger T0 and continuing until T0
+ ~200 s. The first two flares were detected by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)
on the Swift satellite, before Swift had slewed to the burst location, while
the last three flares were strongly detected by the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) but
only weakly detected by the BAT. This burst provides an unusual opportunity to
track a complete sequence of flares over a wide energy range. The flares were
very similar in their light curve morphology, showing power-law rise and fall
components, and in most cases significant sub-structure. The flares also showed
strong evolution with time, both spectrally and temporally. The small time
scale and large amplitude variability observed are incompatible with an
external shock origin for the flares, and support instead late time sporadic
activity either of the central source or of localized dissipation events within
the outflow. We show that the flares in GRB 060714 cannot be the result of
internal shocks in which the contrast in the Lorentz factor of the colliding
shells is very small, and that this mechanism faces serious difficulties in
most Swift GRBs. The morphological similarity of the flares and the prompt
emission and the gradual and continual evolution of the flares with time makes
it difficult and arbitrary to draw a dividing line between the prompt emission
and the flares.
