Various burst origin scenarios require a host object in the burst error box
or near a well-located position. For example, a host galaxy should be present
in the standard cosmological models. We present a methodology which evaluates
whether the observed detections and nondetections of potential host objects in
burst error boxes are consistent with the presence of the host, or whether all
the detections can be attributed to background objects (e.g., unrelated
background galaxies). The host object's flux distribution must be modeled.
Preliminary results are presented for the ``minimal'' cosmological model.
