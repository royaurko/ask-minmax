We report the first results of a low resolution mid-infrared spectroscopic
survey of an unbiased, far-infrared selected sample of 60 ultraluminous
infrared galaxies, using ISOPHOT-S on board ISO. We use the ratio of the 7.7um
`PAH' emission feature to the local continuum as a discriminator between
starburst and AGN activity. About 80% of all the ULIRGs are found to be
predominantly powered by star formation but the fraction of AGN powered objects
increases with luminosity.
  Observed ratios of the PAH features in ULIRGs differ slightly from those in
lower luminosity starbursts. This can be plausibly explained by the higher
extinction and/or different physical conditions in the interstellar medium of
ULIRGs. The PAH feature-to-continuum ratio is anticorrelated with the ratio of
feature-free 5.9um continuum to the IRAS 60um continuum, confirming suggestions
that strong mid-IR continuum is a prime AGN signature. The location of
starburst-dominated ULIRGs in such a diagram is consistent with previous
ISO-SWS spectroscopy which implies significant extinction even in the
mid-infrared.
  We have searched for indications that ULIRGs which are advanced mergers might
be more AGN-like, as postulated by the classical evolutionary scenario. No such
trend has been found amongst those objects for which near infrared images are
available to assess their likely merger status.
