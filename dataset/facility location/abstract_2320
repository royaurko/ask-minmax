This paper has proposed a Graph - semantic based conceptual model for
semi-structured database system, called GOOSSDM, to conceptualize the different
facets of such system in object oriented paradigm. The model defines a set of
graph based formal constructs, variety of relationship types with participation
constraints and rich set of graphical notations to specify the conceptual level
design of semi-structured database system. The proposed design approach
facilitates modeling of irregular, heterogeneous, hierarchical and
non-hierarchical semi-structured data at the conceptual level. Moreover, the
proposed GOOSSDM is capable to model XML document at conceptual level with the
facility of document-centric design, ordering and disjunction characteristic. A
rule based transformation mechanism of GOOSSDM schema into the equivalent XML
Schema Definition (XSD) also has been proposed in this paper. The concepts of
the proposed conceptual model have been implemented using Generic Modeling
Environment (GME).
