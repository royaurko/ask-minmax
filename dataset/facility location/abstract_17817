We introduce Coronal-Line Forest Active Galactic Nuclei (CLiF AGN), AGN which
have a rich spectrum of forbidden high-ionization lines (FHILs, e.g. [FeVII],
[FeX] and [NeV]), as well as relatively strong narrow ($\sim$300 km s$^{-1}$)
H$\alpha$ emission when compared to the other Balmer transition lines. We find
that the kinematics of the CLiF emitting region are similar to those of the
forbidden low-ionization emission-line (FLIL) region. We compare emission line
strengths of both FHILs and FLILs to CLOUDY photoionization results and find
that the CLiF emitting region has higher densities (10$^{4.5}$ $<$ n$_H$ $<$
10$^{7.5}$ cm$^{-3}$) when compared to the FLIL emitting region (10$^{3.0}$ $<$
n$_H$ $<$ 10$^{4.5}$ cm$^{-3}$). We use the photoionization results to
calculate the CLiF regions radial distances (0.04 $<$ R$_{CLiF}$ $<$ 32.5 pc)
and find that they are comparable to the dust grain sublimation distances (0.10
$<$ R$_{SUB}$ $<$ 4.3 pc). As a result we suggest that the inner torus wall is
the most likely location of the CLiF region, and the unusual strength of the
FHILs is due to a specific viewing angle giving a maximal view of the far wall
of the torus without the continuum being revealed.
