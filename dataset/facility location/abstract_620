Tests were performed to pass a 100 MeV, 430 kWatt c.w. electron beam from the
energy-recovery linac at the Jefferson Laboratory's FEL facility through a set
of small apertures in a 127 mm long aluminum block. Beam transmission losses of
3 p.p.m. through a 2 mm diameter aperture were maintained during a 7 hour
continuous run.
