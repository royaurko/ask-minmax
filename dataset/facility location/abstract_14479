We present the results of a search for diffuse x-ray sources in a 65 ksec
ROSAT PSPC exposure of 47 Tuc. There is faint, soft emission on the NE side of
the cluster at a distance of 6 arcmin from the core. The location of this
emission along the direction of proper motion of the cluster suggests that it
might be due to a bow shock. We show that a simple shock model fits the
observed luminosity and temperature. However, a bow shock can only form if the
rotation of the halo gas at the height of 47 Tuc (z = 3.3 kpc) is small
compared to the rotation of the galactic plane. Therefore this observation
provides not only the first x-ray detection of hot gas in a globular cluster,
but also constrains the dynamics of the halo gas. We also find two sources of
diffuse x-ray emission to the NE of the cluster which are brighter and harder.
We consider a variety of models for this emission, including thermal emission
from a high velocity wind from a hot white dwarf, and propose that it is due to
inverse Compton emission from acceleration in the bow shock of low energy
cosmic ray electrons from the population of millisecond pulsars in the cluster.
