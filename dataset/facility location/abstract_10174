We have investigated QCD with two flavors of degenerate fermions using a
Symanzik-improved lattice action for both the gauge and fermion actions. Our
study focuses on the deconfinement transition on an $N_t=4$ lattice. Having
located the thermal transition, we performed zero temperature simulations
nearby in order to compute hadronic masses and the static quark potential. We
find that the present action reduces lattice artifacts present in
thermodynamics with the standard Wilson (gauge and fermion) actions. However,
it does not bring studies with Wilson-type quarks to the same level as those
using the Kogut--Susskind formulation.
