We investigate a double-spin asymmetry for the semi-inclusive $\Lambda$
hyperon production in the longitudinally deep inelastic lepton-proton
scattering, the sign of which can provide us with important information about
the strange quark helicity distribution in the proton.On the basis of the
interpretation of the longitudinal deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering
data as a negative strange quark polarization in the proton and the preliminary
results on the measurement of the longitudinal $\Lambda$ polarization at the
$Z$ resonance in electron-positron annihilation,we predict a minus sign for the
suggested observable. The experimental condition required for our suggestion is
met by the HERA facilities, so the asymmetry considered can be measured by the
HERMES experiments at HERA in the near future.
