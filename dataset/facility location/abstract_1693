Double beta decay is indispensable to solve the question of the neutrino mass
matrix together with $\nu$ oscillation experiments. Recent analysis of the most
sensitive experiment since eight years - the HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW experiment in
Gran-Sasso - yields evidence for the neutrinoless decay mode. This result is
the first evidence for lepton number violation and proves the neutrino to be a
Majorana particle. We give the present status of the analysis in these
Proceedings. It excludes several of the neutrino mass scenarios allowed from
present neutrino oscillation experiments - essentially only degenerate and
partially degenerate mass scenarios survive. This result allows neutrinos to
still play an important role as dark matter in the Universe. To improve the
present result, considerably enlarged experiments are required, such as GENIUS.
A GENIUS Test Facility has just been funded and will come into operation by end
of 2002.
