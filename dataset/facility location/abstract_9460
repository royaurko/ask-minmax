We report a high resolution, far-ultraviolet, STIS E140M spectrum of the
strong, broad Si II, III, and IV features produced by the ejecta of SN1006 seen
in absorption against the background Schweizer-Middleditch star. The spectrum
confirms the extreme sharpness of the red edge of the redshifted Si II 1260 A
feature, supporting the idea that this edge represents the location of the
reverse shock moving into the freely expanding ejecta. The expansion velocity
of ejecta at the reverse shock is measured to be 7026 +-3(relative)
+-10(absolute) km/s. If the shock model is correct, then the expansion velocity
should be decreasing at the observable rate of 2.7 +-0.1 km/s per year. The
pre-shock velocity, post-shock velocity, and post-shock velocity dispersion are
all measured from the Si II 1260 A feature, and consistency of these velocities
with the shock jump conditions implies that there is little or no electron
heating in this fast (2680 km/s) Si-rich shock.
