A report on the spectroscopic and multi-color photometric observations of
high galactic latitude classical nova KT Eridani (Nova Eridani 2009) is
presented. After 12.2 days from maximum light, broad and prominent emission
lines of Balmer series, He I, He II, N II, N III and O I can be seen on the
spectra. The FWHM of H${\alpha}$ line yields an expansion velocity of
approximately 3400 km s$^{-1}$. After 279.4 days from maximum light, we can see
prominent emission lines of He II and [O III] on the spectrum. Among them, [O
III] (4959, 5007) lines show multiple peaks. From the obtained light curve, KT
Eri is classified to be a very fast nova, with a decline rate by two magnitude
of $6.2 \pm 0.3$ days and three of $14.3 \pm 0.7$ days. We tried to estimate
the absolute magnitude ($M_V$) using the Maximum Magnitude versus Rate of
Decline relationship and distance of KT Eri. The calculated $M_V$ is
approximately -9. Accordingly, the distance and galactic height are
approximately 7 kpc and 4 kpc, respectively. Hence, KT Eri is concluded to be
located outside of the galactic disk.
