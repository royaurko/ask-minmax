Records of sunspots and aurora observations in pre-telescopic historical
documents can provide useful information about solar activity in the past. This
is also true for extreme space weather events, as they may have been recorded
as large sunspots observed by the naked eye or as low-latitude auroras. In this
paper, we present the results of a comprehensive survey of records of sunspots
and auroras in the Songshi, a Chinese formal chronicle spanning the tenth to
the thirteenth century. This chronicle contains a record of continuous
observations with well-formatted reports conducted as a policy of the
government. A brief comparison of the frequency of observations of sunspots and
auroras and the observations of radioisotopes as an indicator of the solar
activity during corresponding periods is provided. This paper is the first step
of our project in which we survey and compile the records of sunspots and
aurora in historical documents from various locations and languages, ultimately
providing it to the science community as online data.
