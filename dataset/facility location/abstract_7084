Superconductivity in anti-PbO-type iron chalcogenides Fe1-xTe1-ySey (x = 0,
0.1, y = 0.1 0.4) depends on the amount (x) of interstitial iron atoms located
between the FeTe1-ySey layers. Non-superconducting samples of nominal
Fe1.1Te1-ySey convert to superconductors with critical temperatures up to 14 K
after annealing at 300{\deg}C in an oxygen atmosphere. The process is
irreversible upon subsequent hydrogen annealing. Magnetic measurements are
consistent with the formation of iron oxides suggesting that oxygen annealing
preferably extracts interstitial iron from Fe1-xTe1-ySey which interfere with
superconductivity.
