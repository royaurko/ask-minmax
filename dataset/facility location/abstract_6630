In 1948, W. Hoeffding introduced a large class of unbiased estimators called
U-statistics, defined as the average value of a real-valued m-variate function
h calculated at all possible sets of m points from a random sample. In the
present paper, we investigate the corresponding robust analogue which we call
U-quantile-statistics. We are concerned with the asymptotic behavior of the
sample p-quantile of such function h instead of its average. Alternatively,
U-quantile-statistics can be viewed as quantile estimators for a certain class
of dependent random variables. Examples are given by a slightly modified
Hodges-Lehmann estimator of location and the median interpoint distance among
random points in space.
