In this paper we present an analysis of temperature taken at two telescopes
located at the Observatorio del Roque de Los Muchachos in the Canary Islands.
More than 20 years of measurements at CAMC are included. The analysis of the
data from TNG and CAMC are compared in order to check local variations and long
term trends. Furthermore, the temperatures at different heights are correlated
to the quality of astronomical seeing. We considered the correlation of NAO
Index and annual downtime with mean annual temperatures. The final aim of this
work is to better understand the influence of wide scale parameters on local
meteorological data. The analysis is done using a statistical approach. From
each long series of data we compute the hourly averages and than the monthly
averages in order to reduce the short time fluctuations due to the day/night
cycle. A particular care is used to minimize any effect due to biases in case
of lacking of data. Finally, we compute the annual average from the monthly
ones. The two telescopes show similar trends. There is an increase of
temperatures of about 1.0 deg/10yrs from the annual means and a more rapid
increase of the annual minimums then the maximums. We found that positive NAO
Index reduces the increase of temperatures, and accelerates the decrease.
Moreover, there is no evidence that positive NAO Index corresponds to a lower
number of non-observable nights. Finally, seeing deteriorates when the gradient
of temperatures between 2 and 10 m above the ground is greater than -0.6 deg.
