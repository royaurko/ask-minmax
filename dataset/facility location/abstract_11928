We report serendipitous discovery of three new dwarf novae which eruptions in
2010 were observed by the ongoing microlensing survey OGLE-IV. All three
objects are located in the Galactic bulge fields observed with the highest
cadence of 20 minutes. In the OGLE-III and OGLE-IV data we revealed a total of
23 outbursts for one of the stars. What makes this object most interesting is
the derived superhump period of 2.61 h placing it in the orbital period gap.
The superhump period changed during the superoutburst with a very short
timescale. For two other objects, for which we observed outburst, the orbital
periods of 5.4 h and 9.5 h were measured in the quiescence.
