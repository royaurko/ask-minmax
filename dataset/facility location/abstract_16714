The physical properties and dynamical behavior of Broad Absorption Line (BAL)
outflows are crucial themes in understanding the connections between galactic
centers and their hosts. FeLoBALs (identified with the presence of
low-ionization Fe II BALs) are a peculiar class of quasar outflows that
constitute approximately 1% of the BAL population. With their large column
densities and apparent outflow kinetic luminosities, FeLoBALs appear to be
exceptionally powerful and are strong candidates for feedback in galaxy
evolution. We conducted variability studies of 12 FeLoBAL quasars with emission
redshifts between 0.69 and 1.93, spanning both weekly and multi-year timescales
in the quasar's rest frame. We detected absorption-line variability from
low-ionization species (Fe II, Mg II) in four of our objects, with which we
established a representative upper limit for the distance of the absorber from
the supermassive black hole (SMBH) to be approximately 20 parsecs. Our goals
are to understand the mechanisms producing the variability (e.g. ionization
changes or gas traversing our line of sight) and place new constraints on the
locations, structure, and kinetic energies of the outflows.
