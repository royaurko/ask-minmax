This paper proposes spatial periodic table developed based on classic
electron shell structure model. The periodic table determines location and
chemical properties of superheavy elements. 14 new long-living superheavy
elements found by Proton-21 laboratory and one long-living superheavy element
found by A.Marinov were identified.
