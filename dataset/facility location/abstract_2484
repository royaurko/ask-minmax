In this paper, we study the extent to which CP parity of a Higgs boson, and
more generally its anomalous couplings to gauge bosons, can be measured at the
LHC and a future electron-positron collider. We consider several processes,
including Higgs boson production in gluon and weak boson fusion and production
of a Higgs boson in association with an electroweak gauge boson. We consider
decays of a Higgs boson including $ZZ, WW, \gamma \gamma$, and $Z \gamma$.
Matrix element approach to three production and decay topologies is developed
and applied in the analysis. A complete Monte Carlo simulation of the above
processes at proton and $e^+e^-$ colliders is performed and verified by
comparing it to an analytic calculation. Prospects for measuring various tensor
couplings at existing and proposed facilities are compared.
