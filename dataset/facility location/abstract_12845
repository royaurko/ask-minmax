Aims: We present a detailed study of the supernova remnant (SNR) G296.7-0.9
in the 0.2-12 keV X-ray band.
  Methods: Using data from XMM-Newton we performed a spectro-imaging analysis
of G296.7-0.9 in order to deduce the basic parameters of the remnant and to
search for evidence of a young neutron star associated with it.
  Results: In X-rays the remnant is characterized by a bright arc located in
the south-west direction. Its X-ray spectrum can best be described by an
absorbed non-equilibrium collisional plasma model with a hydrogen density of
N_H=1.24_{-0.05}^{+0.07} x 10^{22} cm^{-2} and a plasma temperature of
6.2^{+0.9}_{-0.8} million Kelvin. The analysis revealed a remnant age of 5800
to 7600 years and a distance of 9.8_{-0.7}^{+1.1} kpc. The latter suggests a
spatial connection with a close-by HII region. We did not find evidence for a
young neutron star associated with the remnant.
