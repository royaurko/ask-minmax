We propose a method for realizing true, real-space imaging of charge dynamics
in a periodic system, with angstrom spatial resolution and attosecond time
resolution. In this method, inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) is carried out
with a coherent, standing wave source, which provides the off-diagonal elements
of the generalized dynamic structure factor, S(q_1,q_2,\omega), allowing
complete reconstruction of the inhomogeneous response function of the system,
\chi(x_1,x_2,t). The quantity \chi has the physical meaning of a propagator for
charge, so allows one to observe - in real time - the disturbance in the
electron density created by a point source placed at a specified location, x_1
(on an atom vs. between atoms, for example). This method may be thought of as a
generalization of x-ray crystallography that allows refinement of the excited
states of a periodic system, rather than just its ground state.
