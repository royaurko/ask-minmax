We consider a scenario that involves a stationary source of acoustic waves
located at the origin of the K(XOY) inertial reference frame and a receiver
that performs the hyperbolic motion at a constant altitude. The observer
measures the proper reception time of successive wave crests. We investigate
its dependence on the propagation speed of the wave and on the altitude at
which the motion takes place.
