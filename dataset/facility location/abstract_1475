We present a brief summary of the ISO survey of AGB stars in 8 populous
intermediate age clusters of the Magellanic Clouds. Totally, more than 100 AGB
and RGB stars were observed at 4.5, 6.7 and 12 $\mu$m. We introduce a new
method to estimate effective temperatures of oxygen-rich AGB stars, and derive
precise bolometric magnitudes and effective temperatures for a large population
of AGB objects in both LMC and SMC. The derived stellar parameters are used to
construct observed HR diagrams which are employed further to estimate cluster
ages using the isochrone fitting. We show that proposed method gives a powerful
tool to study AGB star populations within the Local Group galaxies, especially,
when backed up with the observations from forthcoming mid-IR astronomical space
facilities (IRIS, SIRTF) and large ground-based telescopes (SUBARU, VLT, etc.).
