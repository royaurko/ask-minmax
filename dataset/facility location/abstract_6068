We demonstrate how to locate the critical endpoint of the QCD phase
transition by means of simulations at imaginary \mu. For the three flavor
theory, we present numerical results for the pseudo-critical line as a function
of chemical potential and bare quark mass, as well as the bare quark mass
dependence of the endpoint.
