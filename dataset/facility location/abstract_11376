The MAJORANA collaboration is pursuing the development of the so-called
MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR. The DEMONSTRATOR is intended to perform research and
development towards a tonne-scale germanium-based experiment to search for the
neutrinoless double-beta decay of Ge-76. The DEMONSTRATOR can also perform a
competitive direct dark matter search for light WIMPs in the 1-10 GeV/c^2 mass
range. It will consist of approximately 60-kg of germanium detectors in an
ultra-low background shield located deep underground at the Sanford Underground
Laboratory in Lead, SD. The DEMONSTRATOR will also perform background and
technology studies, and half of the detector mass will be enriched germanium.
This talk will review the motivation, design, technology and status of the
DEMONSTRATOR.
