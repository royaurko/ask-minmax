In this paper, a BeppoSAX observation of the bright Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC6300
is presented. The rapidly variable emission from the active nucleus is seen
through a Compton-thin (NH ~ 3x10^23 atomoms/cm/cm) absorber. A
Compton-reflection component with an unusually high reflection fraction (R ~
4.2), and the comparison with a reflection-dominated spectrum measured by RXTE
two and half years earlier suggest that NGC6300 belongs to the class of
"transient" AGN, undergoing long and repeated periods of low-activity. The
spectral transition provides support to the idea that Compton-thick and
Compton-thin X-ray absorbers in Seyfert 2 galaxies are decoupled, the former
being most likely associated with the "torus", whereas the latter is probably
located at much larger distances.
