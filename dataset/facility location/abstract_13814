The dynamics of regions of the solar corona are investigated using
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 171\AA\ and 193\AA\ data. The coronal
emission from the quiet Sun, coronal loop footprints, coronal moss, and from
above a sunspot is studied. It is shown that the mean Fourier power spectra in
these regions can be described by a power law at lower frequencies that tails
to flat spectrum at higher frequencies, plus a Gaussian-shaped contribution
that varies depending on the region studied. This Fourier spectral shape is in
contrast to the commonly-held assumption that coronal time-series are well
described by the sum of a long time-scale background trend plus
Gaussian-distributed noise, with some specific locations also showing an
oscillatory signal. The implications of this discovery to the field of coronal
seismology and the automated detections of oscillations are discussed. The
power law contribution to the shape of the Fourier power spectrum is
interpreted as being due to the summation of a distribution of exponentially
decaying emission events along the line of sight. This is consistent with the
idea that the solar atmosphere is heated everywhere by small energy deposition
events.
