The condition of radio emission is proposed, on the base of which the theory
of themal radio emission for gaseous disk is developed. This theory explains
the radio emission spectra of known types of extended radio sources, located
beyond the Solar planetary system. Besides, the thermal radio emission spectra
of Venus and Jupiter are explained.
