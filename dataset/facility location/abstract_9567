We present results from ACS and WFPC observations in the low luminosity
galaxy NGC 45. We identified 28 young star cluster candidates. While the exact
values of age, mass, and extinction depend somewhat on the choice of SSP
models, we find no young clusters with masses higher than a few 1000 Msun for
any model choice. We derive the luminosity function of young star clusters and
find a slope of alpha=-1.94+-0.28. We also identified 19 old globular clusters
and we estimate a specific frequency of globular clusters of S_N=1.4-1.9 which
is significantly higher than observed for other late-type galaxies (e.g. SMC,
LMC, M33). Most of these globular clusters appear to belong to a metal-poor
population, although they coincide spatially with the location of the bulge of
NGC 45.
