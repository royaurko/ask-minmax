The absolute flux calibration of the James Webb Space Telescope will be based
on a set of stars observed by the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes. In order
to cross-calibrate the two facilities, several A, G, and white dwarf (WD) stars
are observed with both Spitzer and Hubble and are the prototypes for a set of
JWST calibration standards. The flux calibration constants for the four Spitzer
IRAC bands 1-4 are derived from these stars and are 2.3, 1.9, 2.0, and 0.5%
lower than the official cold-mission IRAC calibration of Reach et al. (2005),
i.e. in agreement within their estimated errors of ~2%. The causes of these
differences lie primarily in the IRAC data reduction and secondarily in the
SEDs of our standard stars. The independent IRAC 8 micron band-4 fluxes of
Rieke et al. (2008) are about 1.5 +/- 2% higher than those of Reach et al. and
are also in agreement with our 8 micron result.
