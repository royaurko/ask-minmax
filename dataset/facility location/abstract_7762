The pervasiveness of mobile devices, which is increasing daily, is generating
a vast amount of geo-located data allowing us to gain further insights into
human behaviors. In particular, this new technology enables users to
communicate through mobile social media applications, such as Twitter, anytime
and anywhere. Thus, geo-located tweets offer the possibility to carry out
in-depth studies on human mobility. In this paper, we study the use of Twitter
in transportation by identifying tweets posted from roads and rails in Europe
between September 2012 and November 2013. We compute the percentage of highway
and railway segments covered by tweets in 39 countries. The coverages are very
different from country to country and their variability can be partially
explained by differences in Twitter penetration rates. Still, some of these
differences might be related to cultural factors regarding mobility habits and
interacting socially online. Analyzing particular road sectors, our results
show a positive correlation between the number of tweets on the road and the
Average Annual Daily Traffic on highways in France and in the UK. Transport
modality can be studied with these data as well, for which we discover very
heterogeneous usage patterns across the continent.
