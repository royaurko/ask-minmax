In this paper, we study a flower population in which self-reproduction is not
permitted. Individuals are diploid, {that is, each cell contains two sets of
chromosomes}, and {distylous, that is, two alleles, A and a, can be found at
the considered locus S}. Pollen and ovules of flowers with the same genotype at
locus S cannot mate. This prevents the pollen of a given flower to fecundate
its {own} stigmata. Only genotypes AA and Aa can be maintained in the
population, so that the latter can be described by a random walk in the
positive quadrant whose components are the number of individuals of each
genotype. This random walk is not homogeneous and its transitions depend on the
location of the process. We are interested in the computation of the extinction
probabilities, {as} extinction happens when one of the axis is reached by the
process. These extinction probabilities, which depend on the initial condition,
satisfy a doubly-indexed recurrence equation that cannot be solved directly.
{Our contribution is twofold : on the one hand, we obtain an explicit, though
intricate, solution through the study of the PDE solved by the associated
generating function. On the other hand, we provide numerical results comparing
stochastic and deterministic approximations of the extinction probabilities.
