In this paper we model by using the Monte Carlo simulation code PENELOPE [1,
2] a Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detector and determine its efficiency. The
simulated geometry consists of a point source located close to the detector as
well as volume sources with cylindrical geometry. A comparison of the
simulation is made to experimental results as well as to analytical
calculations.
