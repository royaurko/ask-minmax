We present absolute proper motions in Kapteyn Selected Area (SA) 103. This
field is located 7 degrees west of the center of the Virgo Stellar Stream (VSS,
Duffau et al. 2006), and has a well-defined main sequence representing the
stream. In SA 103 we identify one RR Lyrae star as a member of the VSS
according to its metallicity, radial velocity and distance. VSS candidate
turnoff stars and subgiant stars have proper motions consistent with that of
the RR Lyrae star. The 3D velocity data imply an orbit with a pericenter of 11
kpc and an apocenter of ~90 kpc. Thus, the VSS comprises tidal debris found
near the pericenter of a highly destructive orbit. Examining the six globular
clusters at distances larger than 50 kpc from the Galactic center, and the
proposed orbit of the VSS, we find one tentative association, NGC 2419. We
speculate that NGC 2419 is possibly the nucleus of a disrupted system of which
the VSS is a part.
