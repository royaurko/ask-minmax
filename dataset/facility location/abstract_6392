We argue that one can see a specific class of "stringy" D-instantons in the
underlying 4D gauge theory as the UV completion of an ordinary gauge instanton
of a completely broken gauge group corresponding to the "empty" cycle the
D-instanton is located on. In this sense, the D-instanton induced
non-perturbative superpotential can be qualitatively inferred directly from
pure field-theory considerations.
