In this paper we consider a single-server, cyclic polling system with
switch-over times and Poisson arrivals. The service disciplines that are
discussed, are exhaustive and gated service. The novel contribution of the
present paper is that we consider the reneging of customers at polling
instants. In more detail, whenever the server starts or ends a visit to a
queue, some of the customers waiting in each queue leave the system before
having received service. The probability that a certain customer leaves the
queue, depends on the queue in which the customer is waiting, and on the
location of the server. We show that this system can be analysed by introducing
customer subtypes, depending on their arrival periods, and keeping track of the
moment when they abandon the system. In order to determine waiting time
distributions, we regard the system as a polling model with varying arrival
rates, and apply a generalised version of the distributional form of Little's
law. The marginal queue length distribution can be found by conditioning on the
state of the system (position of the server, and whether it is serving or
switching).
