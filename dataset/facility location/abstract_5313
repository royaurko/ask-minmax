The asteroid (21) Lutetia is the target of a planned close encounter by the
Rosetta spacecraft in July 2010. To prepare for that flyby, Lutetia has been
extensively observed by a variety of astronomical facilities. We used the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to determine the albedo of Lutetia over a wide
wavelength range, extending from ~150 nm to ~700 nm. Using data from a variety
of HST filters and a ground-based visible light spectrum, we employed synthetic
photometry techniques to derive absolute fluxes for Lutetia. New results from
ground-based measurements of Lutetia's size and shape were used to convert the
absolute fluxes into albedos. We present our best model for the spectral energy
distribution of Lutetia over the wavelength range 120-800 nm. There appears to
be a steep drop in the albedo (by a factor of ~2) for wavelengths shorter than
~300 nm. Nevertheless, the far ultraviolet albedo of Lutetia (~10%) is
considerably larger than that of typical C-chondrite material (~4%). The
geometric albedo at 550 nm is 16.5 +/- 1%. Lutetia's reflectivity is not
consistent with a metal-dominated surface at infrared or radar wavelengths, and
its albedo at all wavelengths (UV-visibile-IR-radar) is larger than observed
for typical primitive, chondritic material. We derive a relatively high FUV
albedo of ~10%, a result that will be tested by observations with the Alice
spectrograph during the Rosetta flyby of Lutetia in July 2010.
