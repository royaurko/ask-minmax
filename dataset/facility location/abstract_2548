Cloud computing is an emerging technology in distributed computing which
facilitates pay per model as per user demand and requirement.Cloud consist of a
collection of virtual machine which includes both computational and storage
facility. The primary aim of cloud computing is to provide efficient access to
remote and geographically distributed resources. Cloud is developing day by day
and faces many challenges, one of them is scheduling. Scheduling refers to a
set of policies to control the order of work to be performed by a computer
system. A good scheduler adapts its scheduling strategy according to the
changing environment and the type of task. In this research paper we presented
a Generalized Priority algorithm for efficient execution of task and comparison
with FCFS and Round Robin Scheduling. Algorithm should be tested in cloud Sim
toolkit and result shows that it gives better performance compared to other
traditional scheduling algorithm.
