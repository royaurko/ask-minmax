We present the serendipitous discovery of 16 ms pulsed X-ray emission from
the Crab-like supernova remnant N157B in the Large Magellanic Cloud. This is
the fastest spinning pulsar associated with a supernova remnant (SNR).
Observations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), centered on the field
containing SN1987A, reveal an X-ray pulsar with a narrow pulse profile.
Archival ASCA X-ray data confirm this detection and locate the pulsar within 1'
of the supernova remnant N157B, 14' from SN1987A. The pulsar manifests evidence
for glitch(es) between the RXTE and ASCA observations which span 3.5 years; the
mean linear spin-down rate is Pdot = 5.126 X 10E-14 s/s. The background
subtracted pulsed emission is similar to other Crab-like pulsars with a power
law of photon index of ~ 1.6. The characteristic spin-down age (~ 5000 years)
is consistent with the previous age estimate of the SNR. The inferred B-field
for a rotationally powered pulsar is ~ 1 X 10E12 Gauss. Our result confirms the
Crab-like nature of N157B; the pulsar is likely associated with a compact X-ray
source revealed by ROSAT HRI observations.
