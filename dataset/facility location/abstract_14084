We present the first known solution to the original supertask, the Thomson
Lamp Paradox.
  We also offer preliminary resources for classifying computational complexity
of various supertasks. In so doing we consider a newly apparent paradox between
the metrical limit and the ordinal limit. We use this distinction between the
metrical and ordinal limits to explain the shortcomings both of Thomson's
original formulation of the Lamp Paradox and Benacerraf's consequent critique.
  We resolve this paradox through a careful consideration of transfinite
ordinals and locate its ambiguity as inherent to the identity relation under
logic with a close reading of Frege's Begriffsschrift. With this close reading
in hand we expose how the identity relation is counter-intuitively polyvalent
and, with supertasks, how the logico-mathematical field operates on the basis
of Deleuzian point-folds. Our results combine resources from philosophy,
mathematics, and computer science to ground the field of hypercomputation for
logically rigorous study.
