This volume contains the post-proceedings of PLACES 2014, the seventh
Workshop on Programming Language Approaches to Concurrency and
Communication-cEntric Software, which was held in Grenoble, France, on April
12th 2014, and co-located with ETAPS, the European Joint Conferences on Theory
and Practice of Software. The PLACES workshop series aims to offer a forum
where researchers from different fields exchange new ideas on one of the
central challenges for programming in the near future: the development of
programming languages, methodologies and infrastructures where concurrency and
distribution are the norm rather than a marginal concern. Previous editions of
PLACES were held in Rome (2013), Tallin (2012), Saarbrueken (2011), Paphos
(2010) and York (2009), all co-located with ETAPS, and the first PLACES was
held in Oslo and co-located with DisCoTec (2008).
  The Program Committee, after a careful and thorough reviewing process,
selected nine papers out of 12 submissions for presentation at the workshop and
inclusion in this post-proceedings. Each submission was evaluated by three
referees (with one paper receiving a fourth review), and the accepted papers
were selected during a week-long electronic discussion. One of the nine
accepted papers was conditionally accepted subject to a process of shepherding
by a PC member, which was successful and led to the paper's full acceptance.
  In addition to the contributed papers, the workshop will feature an invited
talk by Akash Lal, Microsoft Research India, entitled "Finding Concurrency Bugs
Under Imprecise Harnesses".
