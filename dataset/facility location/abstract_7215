We present the first high time resolution light curves for six eclipses of
the magnetic cataclysmic variable EP Dra, taken using the superconducting
tunnel junction imager S-Cam2. The system shows a varying eclipse profile
between consecutive eclipses over the two nights of observation. We attribute
the variable stream eclipse after accretion region ingress to a variation in
the amount and location of bright material in the accretion stream. This
material creates an accretion curtain as it is threaded by many field lines
along the accretion stream trajectory. We identify this as the cause of
absorption evident in the light curves when the system is in a high accretion
state. We do not see direct evidence in the light curves for an accretion spot
on the white dwarf; however, the variation of the stream brightness with the
brightness of the rapid decline in flux at eclipse ingress indicates the
presence of some form of accretion region. This accretion region is most likely
located at high colatitude on the white dwarf surface, forming an arc shape at
the foot points of the many field lines channeling the accretion curtain.
