The electronic structures of ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ structure BaCu$_2$As$_2$ and
SrCu$_2$As$_2$ are investigated using density functional calculations. The Cu
$d$ orbitals are located at 3 eV and higher binding energy, and are therefore
chemically inert with little contribution near the Fermi energy. These
materials are moderate density of states, sp-band metals with large Fermi
surfaces and low anisotropy.
