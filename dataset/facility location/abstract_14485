The Yale stellar evolution code has been modified to use the OPAL equation of
state tables (Rogers 1994). Stellar models and isochrones were constructed for
low metallicity systems ($-2.8 \le [Fe/H] \le -0.6$). Above $M\sim 0.7\,\msun$,
the isochrones are very similar to those which are constructed using an
equation of state which includes the analytical Debye-Huckel correction at high
temperatures. The absolute magnitude of the main sequence turn-off (\mvto) with
the OPAL or Debye-Huckel isochrones is about 0.06 magnitudes fainter, at a
given age, than \mvto derived from isochrones which do not include the
Debye-Huckel correction. As a consequence, globular clusters ages derived using
\mvto are reduced by 6 -- 7\% as compared to the ages determined from the
standard isochrones. Below $M\sim 0.7\,\msun$, the OPAL isochrones are
systematically hotter (by approximately 0.04 in B-V) at a given magnitude as
compared to the standard, or Debye-Huckel isochrones. However, the lower mass
models fall out of the OPAL table range, and this could be the cause of the
differences in the location of the lower main-sequences.
