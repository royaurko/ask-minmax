We present the discovery of the first molecular hot core associated with an
intermediate mass protostar in the CepA HW2 region. The hot condensation was
detected from single dish and interferometric observations of several high
excitation rotational lines (from 100 to 880K above the ground state) of SO2 in
the ground vibrational state and of HC3N in the vibrationally excited states
v7=1 and v7=2. The kinetic temperature derived from both molecules is 160K. The
high-angular resolution observations (1.25'' x 0.99'') of the SO2
J=28(7,21)-29(6,24) line (488K above the ground state) show that the hot gas is
concentrated in a compact condensation with a size of 0.6''(430AU), located
0.4'' (300AU) east from the radio-jet HW2. The total SO2 column density in the
hot condensation is 10E18cm-2, with a H2 column density ranging from 10E23 to 6
x 10E24cm-2. The H2 density and the SO2 fractional abundance must be larger
than 10E7cm-3 and 2 x 10E-7 respectively. The most likely alternatives for the
nature of the hot and very dense condensation are discussed. From the large
column densities of hot gas, the detection of the HC3N vibrationally excited
lines and the large SO2 abundance, we favor the interpretation of a hot core
heated by an intermediate mass protostar of 10E3 Lo. This indicates that the
CepA HW2 region contains a cluster of very young stars.
