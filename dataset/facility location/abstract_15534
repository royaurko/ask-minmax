I argue that the system of interacting bosons at zero temperature and in
random external potential possesses a simple critical point which describes the
proliferation of disorder-induced topological defects in the superfluid ground
state, and which is located at weak disorder close to and above one dimension.
This makes it possible to address the critical behavior at the superfluid-Bose
glass transition in dirty boson systems by expanding around the lower critical
dimension d=1. Within the formulated renormalization procedure near d=1 the
dynamical critical exponent is obtained exactly and the correlation length
exponent is calculated as a Laurent series in the parameter \sqrt{\epsilon},
with \epsilon=d-1: z=d, \nu=1/\sqrt{3\epsilon} for the short range, and z=1,
\nu=\sqrt{2/3\epsilon}, for the long-range Coulomb interaction between bosons.
The identified critical point should be stable against the residual
perturbations in the effective action for the superfluid, at least in
dimensions 1\leq d \leq 2, for both short-range and Coulomb interactions. For
the superfluid-Mott insulator transition in the system in a periodic potential
and at a commensurate density of bosons I find \nu=(1/2\sqrt{\epsilon})+
1/4+O(\sqrt{\epsilon}), which yields a result reasonably close to the known XY
critical exponent in d=2+1. The critical behavior of the superfluid density,
phonon velocity and the compressibility in the system with the short-range
interactions is discussed.
