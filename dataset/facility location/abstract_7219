The bright radio structure of the LINER elliptical galaxy NGC1052 is
dominated by bi-symmetric jets on parsec scales. Features move outward on both
sides of the core at v_{app}~0.26c. We have established the occurrence of
free-free absorption, and suggest the presence of a patchy, geometrically
region oriented roughly orthogonal to the jets; components have a wide range of
spectral shapes and brightness temperatures. We distinguish three velocity
systems in HI absorption. The ``high velocity'' system is the most prominent of
these; it is redshifted from systemic by about 150 km/s. In HI VLBI it is seen
towards both jets, but appears to be restricted to a shell 1 to 2 pc away from
the core. The central hole might be largely ionised, and could be connected to
the free-free absorption. WSRT spectroscopy shows 1667 and 1665 MHz OH main
line absorption over at least the full ~250 km/s velocity range seen in HI. In
the ``high velocity'' system, the profiles of the OH main lines and HI are
similar, which suggests co-location of molecular and atomic gas. The OH
satellite lines are also detected in the ``high velocity'' system: 1612 MHz in
absorption and 1720 MHz in emission, with complementary strength. But we have
no satisfactory model to explain all properties; the connection to H_2O masing
gas at the same velocity but apparently a different location is also unclear.
