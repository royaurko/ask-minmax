The recent advances in angle resolved photoemission techniques allowed the
unambiguous experimental confirmation of spin charge decoupling in quasi one
dimensional (1D) Mott insulators. This opportunity stimulates a quantitative
analysis of the spectral function $A(k,\omega)$ of prototypical one dimensional
correlated models. Here we combine Bethe Ansatz results, Lanczos
diagonalizations and field theoretical approaches to obtain $A(k,\omega)$ for
the 1D Hubbard model as a function of the interaction strength. By introducing
a {\it single spinon approximation}, an analytic expression is obtained, which
shows the location of the singularities and allows, when supplemented by
numerical calculations, to obtain an accurate estimate of the spectral weight
distribution in the $(k,\omega)$ plane. Several experimental puzzles on the
observed intensities and line-shapes in quasi 1D compounds, like ${\rm
SrCuO_2}$, find a natural explanation in this theoretical framework.
