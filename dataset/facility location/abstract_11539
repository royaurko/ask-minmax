Wireless mobile grids are one of the emerging grid types, which help to pool
the resources of several willing and cooperative mobile devices to resolve a
computationally intensive task. The mobile grids exhibit stronger challenges
like mobility management of devices, providing transparent access to grid
resources, task management and handling of limited resources so that resources
are shared efficiently. Task execution on these devices should not be affected
by their mobility. The proposed work presents performance evaluation of
wireless mobile grid using normal walk mobility model. The normal walk model
represents daily motion of users and the direction of motion is mostly
symmetric in a real life environment, thus it is effective in location updating
of a mobile station and in turn helps task distribution among these available
mobile stations. Some of the performance parameters such as Task Execution
Time, task failure rate, communication overhead on Brokering Server and
Monitoring Cost are discussed.
