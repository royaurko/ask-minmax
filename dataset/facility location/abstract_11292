GRO J1655-40 showed significant X-ray activity in the last week of February,
2005 and remained active for the next 260 days. The rising and the decline
phases of this particular outburst show evidence for systematic movements of
the Comptonizing region, assumed to be a CENBOL, which causes the
Quasi-periodic Oscillations or QPOs. We present both the spectral and the
timing results of the RXTE/PCA data taken from these two hard spectral states.
Assuming that the QPOs originate from an oscillating shock CENBOL, we show how
the shock slowly moves in through the accretion flow during the rising phase at
a constant velocity and accelerate away outward during the later part of the
decline phase. By fitting the observed frequencies with our solution, we
extract time variation of various disk parameters such as the shock locations,
velocity etc.
