Reference resolution is one of the important tasks in natural language
processing. In this paper, the contributor first determines the referents and their
locations of "dousha", literally meaning "the same company", which appear in
Japanese newspaper articles. Secondly, three heuristic methods, two of which
use semantic information in text such as company names and their patterns, are
proposed and tested on how accurately they identify the correct referents. The
proposed methods based on semantic patterns show high accuracy for reference
resolution of "dousha" (more than 90\%). This suggests that semantic
pattern-matching methods are effective for reference resolution in newspaper
articles.
