We present the analysis of ASCA archival data from the Galactic source W51.
The ASCA spectra show that the soft (kT<= 2.5 keV) X-rays are of thermal origin
and are compatible with W51C being a single, isothermal (kT~0.3 keV) supernova
remnant at the far-side of the Sagittarius arm. The ASCA images reveal hard
(kT>=2.5 keV) X-ray sources which were not seen in previous X-ray observations.
Some of these sources are coincident with massive star-forming regions and the
spectra are used to derive X-ray parameters. By comparing the X-ray absorbing
column density with atomic hydrogen column density, we infer the location of
star-forming regions relative to molecular clouds. There are unidentified hard
X-ray sources superposed on the supernova remnant and we discuss the
possibility of their association.
