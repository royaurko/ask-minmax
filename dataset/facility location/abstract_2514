The p-type point-contact germanium detectors are novel techniques offering
kg-scale radiation sensors with sub-keV sensitivities. They have been used for
light Dark Matter WIMPs searches and may have potential applications in
neutrino physics. There are, however, anomalous surface behaviour which needs
to be characterized and understood. We describe the methods and results of a
research program whose goals are to identify the bulk and surface events via
software pulse shape analysis techniques, and to devise calibration schemes to
evaluate the selection efficiency factors. Efficiencies-corrected background
spectra from the low-background facility at Kuo-Sheng Neutrino Laboratory are
derived.
