We examine the behavior of fermions in the presence of a non-singular thick
brane having co-dimension 2. It is shown that one can obtain three trapped zero
modes which differ from each other by having different values of angular
momentum with respect to the 2 extra dimensions. These three zero modes are
located at different points in the extra dimensional space and are interpreted
as the three generations of fundamental fermions. The angular momentum in the
extra dimensions (which is not conserved) acts as the family or generation
label. This gives a higher dimensional picture for the family puzzle.
