This paper presents the requirements and design of a Timing Synchronization
System (TSS) for the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF)
control system at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. A clock
module has been designed which resides in a VME crate. The clock module can be
a communications master or a slave depending on its configuration, which is
software and jumper selectable. As a master, the clock module sends out
messages in response to an external synchronization signal over a serial fiber
optic line. As a slave, it receives the messages and interrupts an associated
computer in its VME crate. The application that motivated the development of
the TSS, the Accelerator 30 Hz Measurement System, will be described.
Operational experience with the TSS will also be discussed.
