We propose a novel and easy-to-implement joint location-scale association
testing procedure that can account for complex genetic architecture without
explicitly modeling interaction effects, and is suitable for large-scale
whole-genome scans and meta-analyses. We focus on Fisher's method and use it to
combine evidence from the standard location test and the more recent scale
test, and we describe its use for single-variant, gene-set and pathway
association analyses.
