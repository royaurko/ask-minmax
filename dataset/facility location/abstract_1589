Non-resonant ferromagnetic x-ray diffraction has been used to separate the
spin and orbital contribution to the magnetization density of the proposed
zero-moment ferromagnet $Sm_{0.982}Gd_{0.018} Al_{2}$. The alignment of the
spin and orbital moments relative to the net magnetization shows a sign
reversal at 84K, the compensation temperature. Below this temperature the
orbital moment is larger than the spin moment, and vice versa above it. This
result implies that the compensation mechanism is driven by the different
temperature dependencies of the $4f$ spin and orbital moments. Specific heat
data indicate that the system remains ferromagnetically ordered throughout.
