We introduce a new attractor mechanism to find the entropy for spherically
symmetric extremal black holes. The key ingredient is to find a two-dimensional
(2D) dilaton gravity with the dilaton potential $V(\phi)$. The condition of an
attractor is given by $\nabla^2\phi=V(\phi_0)$ and
$\bar{R}_2=-V^{\prime}(\phi_0)$ and for a constant dilaton $ \phi=\phi_0$,
these are also used to find the location of the degenerate horizon $r=r_{e}$ of
an extremal black hole. As a nontrivial example, we consider an extremal
regular black hole obtained from the coupled system of Einstein gravity and
nonlinear electrodynamics. The desired Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is
successfully recovered from the generalized entropy formula combined with the
2D dilaton gravity, while the entropy function approach does not work for
obtaining this entropy.
