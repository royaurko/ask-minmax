In 2008, the blazar Mrk421 entered in a very active phase and was one of the
brightest sources in the sky at TeV energies, showing strong and frequent
flaring. We searched for gamma-ray emission at energies E > 0.8 TeV during the
whole 2008 with the ARGO-YBJ experiment, a full coverage air shower detector
located at Yangbajing (4300 m a.s.l., Tibet, P.R. China). The observed signal
is not constant and in correlation with X-ray measurements. The average
emission, during the active period of the source, was about twice the Crab
Nebula level, with an integral flux of (4.9$\pm 2.0$)x 10$^{-11}$ photons
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for E$_{\gamma}$ >1 TeV.
  This paper concentrates on 2008 June when the Mrk421 flaring activity has
been studied from optical to 100 MeV gamma rays, and only partially up to TeV
energies, since the moonlight hampered the Cherenkov telescope observations
after 8 June. Our data complete these observations, with the detection of a
second flare of intensity of about 7 Crab units on June 11-13, with a
statistical significance of 4.2 standard deviations. The observed flux is
consistent with a prediction made in the framework of the Synchrotron
Self-Compton model, in which the flare is caused by a rapid acceleration of
leptons in the jet.
