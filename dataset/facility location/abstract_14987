We present a Chandra observation of the globular cluster Terzan 5 during
times when the neutron-star X-ray transient EXO 1745-248 located in this
cluster was in its quiescent state. We detected the quiescent system with a
(0.5-10 keV) luminosity of ~2 x 10^{33} ergs/s. This is similar to several
other neutron-star transients observed in their quiescent states. However, the
quiescent X-ray spectrum of EXO 1745--48 was dominated by a hard power-law
component instead of the soft component that usually dominates the quiescent
emission of other neutron-star X-ray transients. This soft component could not
conclusively be detected in EXO 1745-248 and we conclude that it contributed at
most 10% of the quiescent flux in the energy range 0.5-10 keV. EXO 1745-248 is
only the second neutron-star transient whose quiescent spectrum is dominated by
the hard component (SAX J1808.4-3658 is the other one). We discuss possible
explanations for this unusual behavior of EXO 1745-248, its relationship to
other quiescent neutron-star systems, and the impact of our results on
understanding quiescent X-ray binaries. We also discuss the implications of our
results on the way the low-luminosity X-ray sources in globular clusters are
classified.
