We present version 4.0 of the symbolic manipulation system FORM. The most
important new features are manipulation of rational polynomials and the
factorization of expressions. Many other new functions and commands are also
added; some of them are very general, while others are designed for building
specific high level packages, such as one for Groebner bases. New is also the
checkpoint facility, that allows for periodic backups during long calculations.
Lastly, FORM 4.0 has become available as open source under the GNU General
Public License version 3.
