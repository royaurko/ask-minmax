For over a century physicists have sought a mathematical theory that unites
the dual, wave and corpuscle, behaviors that light exhibits. In the early
twentieth century H. Bateman was studying a solution that uses wave functions
with singularities to mark light quanta location in space and time as potential
singularities do for material particles. He published an incomplete,
mathematically obtuse paper applying his scheme to presciently predict
synchrotron rays well before they were experimentally observed. Here, I clarify
the presentation in Bateman's paper and supply a missing demonstration that it
does predict results observed nearly four decades later.
