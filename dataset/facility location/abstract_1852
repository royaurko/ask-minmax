In view of a possible evolution of the CERN accelerator complex towards
higher proton intensities, a 2.2 GeV H- linac with 4 MW beam power has been
designed, for use in connection with an accumulator and compressor ring as
proton driver of a muon-based Neutrino Factory. The high-energy part of this
linac can use most of the RF equipment (superconducting cavities and klystrons)
from the LEP collider after its decommissioning at the end of 2000. Recent
results concerning low-beta superconducting cavities are presented, and the
main characteristics of the linac design are described. The complete
linac-based proton driver facility is outlined, and the impact on the linac
design of the requirements specific to a Neutrino Factory is underlined.
