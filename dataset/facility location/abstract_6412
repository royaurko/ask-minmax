A graph-theoretic method, simpler than existing ones, is used to characterize
the minimal set of monomial generators for the integral closure of any algebra
of polynomials generated by quadratic monomials. The toric ideal of relations
between these generators is generated by a set of binomials, defined
graphically. The spectra of the original algebra and of its integral closure
turn out to be canonically homeomorphic.
