We present a dynamical analysis of the central ~1.3 square degrees of the
cluster of galaxies Abell 1367, based on 273 redshift measurements (of which
119 are news). From the analysis of the 146 confirmed cluster members we derive
a significantly non-Gaussian velocity distribution, with a mean location C_{BI}
= 6484+/-81 km/s and a scale S_{BI} = 891+/-58 km/s. The cluster appears
elongated from the North-West to the South-East with two main density peaks
associated with two substructures. The North-West subcluster is probably in the
early phase of merging into the South-East substructure (~ 0.2 Gyr before core
crossing). A dynamical study of the two subclouds points out the existence of a
group of star-forming galaxies infalling into the core of the South-East
subcloud and suggests that two other groups are infalling into the NW and SE
subclusters respectively. These three subgroups contain a higher fraction of
star-forming galaxies than the cluster core, as expected during merging events.
Abell 1367 appears as a young cluster currently forming at the intersection of
two filaments.
