We construct an example of proof within the main formal system from
arXiv:1010.4760v3, which is intended to capture the bisimulation equivalence
for non-deterministic first-order grammars, and show that its conclusion is
semantically false. We then locate and analyze the flawed argument in the
soundness (meta)-proof of the above reference.
