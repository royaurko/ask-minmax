Presented in this paper is a detailed and direct comparison of the LIGO and
Virgo binary neutron star detection pipelines. In order to test the search
programs, numerous inspiral signals were added to 24 hours of simulated
detector data. The efficiencies of the different pipelines were tested, and
found to be comparable. Parameter estimation routines were also tested. We
demonstrate that there are definite benefits to be had if LIGO and Virgo
conduct a joint coincident analysis; these advantages include increased
detection efficiency and the providing of source sky location information.
