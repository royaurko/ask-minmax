I discuss heavy flavor production at hadronic facilities. I present total
cross sections and differential distributions for top quark, bottom quark, and
charm quark production at the Tevatron and LHC colliders, and at fixed-target
experiments such as HERA-B. The calculations include complete next-to-leading
order corrections as well as higher-order soft-gluon corrections which are
important near kinematical threshold.
