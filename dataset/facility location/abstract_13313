We propose a mechanism to produce fluctuations in the viscosity parameter
($\alpha$) in differetially rotating discs. We carried out a nonlinear analysis
of a general accretion flow, where any perturbation on the background $\alpha$
was treated as a passive/slave variable in the sense of dynamical system
theory. We demonstrate a complete physical picture of growth, saturation and
final degradation of the perturbation as a result of the nonlinear nature of
coupled system of equations. The strong dependence of this fluctuation on the
radial location in the accretion disc and the base angular momentum
distribution is demonstrated. The growth of fluctuations is shown to have a
time scale comparable to the radial drift time and hence the physical
significance is discussed. The fluctuation is found to be a power law in time
in the growing phase and we briefly discuss its statistical significance.
