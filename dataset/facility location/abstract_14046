The growth and development of the mobile phone network has led to an
increased demand for energy by the telecommunications sector, with a noticeable
impact on the environment. Monitoring of energy consumption is a great tool for
understanding how to better manage this consumption and find the best strategy
to adopt in order to maximize reduction of unnecessary usage of electricity.
This paper reports on a monitoring campaign performed on six Base Transceiver
Stations (BSs) located central Italy, with different technology, typology and
technical characteristics. The study focuses on monitoring energy consumption
and environmental parameters (temperature, noise, and global radiation),
linking energy consumption with the load of telephone traffic and with the air
conditioning functions used to cool the transmission equipment. Moreover, using
experimental data collected, it is shown, with a Monte Carlo simulation based
on power saving features, how the BS monitored could save energy.
