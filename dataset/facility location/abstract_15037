We report the discovery of a young massive stellar cluster and infrared
nebula in the direction of the CS molecular cloud associated to the IRAS point
source 16132-5039. The analysis of the mid-infrared images from the more
accurate MSX catalog, reveled that there are two independent components
associated with the IRAS source. The integral of the spectral energy
distribution for these components, between 8.28 $\mu$m and 100 $\mu$m, gave
lower limits for the bolometric luminosity of the embedded objects of $8.7
\times 10^4 L_\odot$ and $9 \times 10^3 L_\odot$, which corresponds to ZAMS O8
and B0.5 stars, respectively. The number of Lyman continuum photons expected
from the stars that lie along the reddening line for early-type stars is about
1.7 $ \times$ 10$^{49}$ s$^{-1}$, enough to produce the detected flux densities
at 5 GHz. The NIR spectrum of the nebula increases with frequency, implying
that free-free emission cannot be the main source of the extended luminosity,
from which we conclude that the observed emission must be mainly dust scattered
light. A comparison of the cluster described in this paper with the young
stellar cluster associated with the IRAS source 16177-5018, which is located at
the same distance and direction, shows that the mean visual absorption of the
newly discovered cluster is about 10 magnitudes smaller and it contains less
massive stars, suggesting that it was formed from a less massive molecular
cloud.
