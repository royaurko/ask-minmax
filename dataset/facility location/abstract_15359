The reionization history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshift
(z > 6) was likely strongly shaped by several global feedback processes.
Because the earliest ionizing sources formed at the locations of the rare
density peaks, their spatial distribution was strongly clustered. Here we
demonstrate that this clustering significantly boosts the impact of feedback
processes operating at high redshift. We build a semi-analytical model to
include feedback and clustering simultaneously, and apply this model to the
suppression of star-formation in minihalos due to photoionization. The model is
built on the excursion-set-based formalism of Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga and
Hernquist (2004), which incorporates the clustering of ionizing sources, and
which we here extend to include suppression of star formation in minihalos. We
find that clustering increases the mean HII bubble size by a factor of several,
and it dramatically increases the fraction of minihalos that are suppressed, by
a factor of up to 60 relative to a randomly distributed population. This
enhanced suppression can significantly reduce the electron scattering optical
depth, as required by the three-year data from the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We argue that source clustering is likely to similarly
boost the importance of a variety of other feedback mechanisms.
