We describe the construction and performance of a scanning tunneling
microscope (STM) capable of taking maps of the tunneling density of states with
sub-atomic spatial resolution at dilution refrigerator temperatures and high
(14 T) magnetic fields. The fully ultra-high vacuum system features visual
access to a two-sample microscope stage at the end of a bottom-loading dilution
refrigerator, which facilitates the transfer of in situ prepared tips and
samples. The two-sample stage enables location of the best area of the sample
under study and extends the experiment lifetime. The successful thermal
anchoring of the microscope, described in detail, is confirmed through a base
temperature reading of 20 mK, along with a measured electron temperature of 250
mK. Atomically-resolved images, along with complementary vibration
measurements, are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the vibration
isolation scheme in this instrument. Finally, we demonstrate that the
microscope is capable of the same level of performance as typical machines with
more modest refrigeration by measuring spectroscopic maps at base temperature
both at zero field and in an applied magnetic field.
