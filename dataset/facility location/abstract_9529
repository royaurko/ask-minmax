An exact model is proposed for a gray, isotropically scattering planetary
atmosphere in radiative equilibrium. The slab is illuminated on one side by a
collimated beam and is bounded on the other side by an emitting and partially
reflecting ground. We provide expressions for the incident and reflected fluxes
on both boundary surfaces, as well as the temperature of the ground and the
temperature distribution in the atmosphere, assuming the latter to be in local
thermodynamic equilibrium. Tables and curves of the temperature distribution
are included for various values of the optical thickness. Finally,
semi-infinite atmospheres illuminated from the outside or by sources at
infinity will be dealt with.
