A novel x-axis tuning fork MEMS gyroscope with "8 vertical springs-proofmass"
structure for Coriolis effect detection is presented. Compared with the common
single-plane springs, the 8 vertical springs, symmetrically located at the top
and bottom sides, more stably suspend the large thick proofmass featuring large
capacitance variation and low mechanical noise. A bulk-micromachining
technology is applied to obtain the large proofmass and twins-like dual beams.
During the fabrication process, the dimensions of the 8 vertical springs are
precisely confined by thermal oxide protected limit trenches (LTs) sidewalls
and the extreme slowly etched (111)-planes; therefore a small mismatch of less
than 30 Hz is achieved before tuning. Initial test shows a sensitivity of
0.15mV/(deg/s) and rate resolution around 0.1deg/s under atmosphere pressure.
