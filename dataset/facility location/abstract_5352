We present observations of a circumstellar disk that is inclined close to
edge-on around a young brown dwarf in the Taurus star-forming region. Using
data obtained with SpeX at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, we find that
the slope of the 0.8-2.5 um spectrum of the brown dwarf 2MASS J04381486+2611399
cannot be reproduced with a photosphere reddened by normal extinction. Instead,
the slope is consistent with scattered light, indicating that circumstellar
material is occulting the brown dwarf. By combining the SpeX data with mid-IR
photometry and spectroscopy from the Spitzer Space Telescope and previously
published millimeter data from Scholz and coworkers, we construct the spectral
energy distribution for 2MASS J04381486+2611399 and model it in terms of a
young brown dwarf surrounded by an irradiated accretion disk. The presence of
both silicate absorption at 10 um and silicate emission at 11 um constrains the
inclination of the disk to be ~70 deg, i.e. ~20 deg from edge-on. Additional
evidence of the high inclination of this disk is provided by our detection of
asymmetric bipolar extended emission surrounding 2MASS J04381486+2611399 in
high-resolution optical images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope.
According to our modeling for the SED and images of this system, the disk
contains a large inner hole that is indicative of a transition disk (R_in~58
R_star~0.275 AU) and is somewhat larger than expected from embryo ejection
models (R_out=20-40 AU vs. R_out<10-20 AU).
