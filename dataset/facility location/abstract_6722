For the one-dimensional telegraph process, we obtain explicit distribution of
the occupation time of the positive half-line. The long-term limiting
distribution is then derived when the initial location of the process is in the
range of sub-normal or normal deviations from the origin; in the former case,
the limit is given by the arcsine law. These limit theorems are also extended
to the case of more general occupation-type functionals.
