We study and analyse low-resolution spectra of the unordinary late WN star
FSZ35 in M33. We classify the object as a hydrogen-rich WN8 star. Using the
radiative transfer code CMFGEN, we determine the physical parameters of this
object and compare them to the parameters of other WN8 stars including the LBV
star Romano's star during the minimum of brightness. Unlike Romano's star, the
object is fairly stable both spectrally and photometrically, that may be
attributed to its more advanced evolutionary stage or lower luminosity. FSZ35
is shown to possess a compact nebula producing faint but detectable
[OIII]emission. Location of this object at a large distance (about 100 pc) from
the nearest association suggests the object may be one more example of a
massive runaway star.
