The responses of the upper ocean to typhoon Namtheun in July 2004 are
investigated by sea surface measurements and vertical profiles. Pre-typhoon
ocean environment played an important role in this case. There were two extreme
cooling regions located at cyclonic eddy A and typhoon wake B. Although the
magnitudes of SST cooling at A and B were similar, other physical and
biophysical responses were quite different. Combining multi-satellite data with
vertical profile data, it is found that the upwelling dominated the responses
at A and the vertical mixing dominated the responses at B. This study implies
that to insight into the ocean surface responses to typhoon, the subsurface
dynamics need to be analyzed via both the in situ and satellite-based
observations, and the physical and biological models.
