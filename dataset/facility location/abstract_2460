With the rapid development of information technology and multimedia, the use
of digital data is increasing day by day. So it becomes very essential to
protect multimedia information from piracy and also it is challenging. A great
deal of Copyright owners is worried about protecting any kind of illegal
repetition of their information. Hence, facing all these kinds of problems
development of the techniques is very important. Digital watermarking
considered as a solution to prevent the multimedia data. In this paper, an idea
of watermarking is proposed and implemented. In proposed watermarking method,
the original image is rearranged using zigzag sequence and DWT is applied on
rearranged image. Then DCT and SVD are applied on all high bands LH, HL and HH.
Watermark is then embedded by modifying the singular values of these bands.
Extraction of watermark is performed by the inversion of watermark embedding
process. For choosing of these three bands it gives facility of mid-band and
pure high band that ensures good imperceptibility and more robustness against
different kinds of attacks.
