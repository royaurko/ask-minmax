We discuss a possibility that a tidal disruption event near a dormant
supermassive black hole (SMBH) can give rise to spectral features of iron in
6-7 keV X-ray signal: a relativistic line profile emerges from debris
illuminated and ionised by an intense flash produced from the destroyed star.
This could provide a unique way to determine parameters of the system. We
consider a model where the nuclear stellar population acquires an oblate shape
(i.e., a flattened distribution) in the inner region near a supermassive black
hole, and also the primary irradiation flare is expected to occur more likely
near the equatorial plane, co-planar with the infalling material. This suggests
that the reprocessing of primary X-rays results in a transient profile that
should be relevant for tidal-disruption events (TDE) in otherwise
under-luminous (inactive) galactic nuclei, i.e. with no prior accretion disc.
Resonance mechanisms of the stellar motion can increase the orbital
eccentricity for some stars in the nuclear cluster and help to bring them close
to the tidal radius, where they can give rise to TDEs. The proposed scenario
appears to be distinguishably different from the standard scheme of lamp-post
model for the origin of the relativistic line in active galaxies, where the
source is thought to be located predominantly near the symmetry axis.
