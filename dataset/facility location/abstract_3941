The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be the next generation ground based
observatory in very high energy gamma ray astronomy. The facility will achieve
a wide energy coverage, starting from a threshold of a few tens of GeV up to
hundreds of TeV by utilising several classes of telescopes, each optimised for
different regions of the gamma-ray spectrum. The required energy resolution of
better than 10-15% over most of the energy range and a goal of 5% systematic
uncertainty on the measurement of the Cherenkov light intensity at the position
of each telescope means that a very precise evaluation of the entire system
will need to be made. The composite nature of the array means multiple camera
technologies will be employed so multiple calibration systems and procedures
will be necessary to meet the performance requirements. Additional constraints
will come from the need to minimise observing time losses and that the
observatory is foreseen to operate for tens of years, so both short and long
term systematic changes in performance will need to be investigated and
monitored. This contribution summarises the recommended camera calibration
strategy of CTA based on the experience with current IACTs.
