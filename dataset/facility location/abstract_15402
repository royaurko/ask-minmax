We report a discovery of proto-cluster candidates around high redshift radio
galaxies at z~2.5 on the basis of clear statistical excess of colour-selected
galaxies around them seen in the deep near-infrared imaging data obtained with
CISCO on Subaru Telescope. We have observed six targets, all at similar
redshifts at z~2.5, and our data reach to J=23.5, H=22.6 and K=21.8 (5 sigma)
and cover a 1.6' x 1.6' field centered on each radio galaxy. We apply colour
cuts in JHKs in order to exclusively search for galaxies located at high
redshifts, z>2. Over the magnitude range of 19.5<K<21.5 we see a significant
excess of red galaxies with J-K>2.3 by a factor of two around the combined
radio galaxies fields compared to those found in the general field of GOODS
South. The excess of galaxies around the radio galaxies fields becomes more
than factor of three around 19.5<K<20.5 when the two-colours cuts are applied
with JHKs. Such overdensity of the colour-selected galaxies suggest that those
fields tend to host high density regions at high redshifts, although there
seems to be the variety of the density of the colour-selected galaxies in each
field. In particular, two radio galaxies fields out of the six observed fields
show very strong density excess and these are likely to be proto-clusters
associated to the radio galaxies which would evolve into rich clusters of
galaxies dominated by old passively evolving galaxies.
