We study the electromagnetic properties of the nucleon and its excitations in
a collective model. In the ensuing algebraic treatment all results for helicity
amplitudes and form factors can be derived in closed form in the limit of a
large model space. We discuss nucleon form factors and transverse
electromagnetic couplings in photo- and electroproduction, including transition
form factors that can be measured at new electron facilities.
