ANAIS (Annual modulation with NaI Scintillators) is a project aiming to set
up at the new facilities of the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC), a large
scale NaI(Tl) experiment in order to explore the DAMA/LIBRA annual modulation
positive result using the same target and technique. Two 12.5 kg each NaI(Tl)
crystals provided by Alpha Spectra took data at the LSC in the ANAIS-25 set-up.
The comparison of the background model for the ANAIS-25 prototypes with the
experimental results is presented. ANAIS crystal radiopurity goals have been
achieved for Th-232 and U-238 chains, but a Pb-210 contamination
out-of-equilibrium was identified, whose origin has been studied. The high
light collection efficiency obtained with these prototypes allows to anticipate
an energy threshold of the order of 1 keVee. A new detector, with improved
performances, was received in March 2015 and very preliminary results are
shown.
