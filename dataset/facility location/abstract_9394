The principles of Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics are disclosed leading to
a new way to interpret whole-Earth dynamics. Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics
incorporates elements of and unifies the two seemingly divergent dominant
theories of continential displacement, plate tectonics theory and Earth
expansion theory. Whole-Earth decompression is the consequence of Earth
formation from within a Jupiter-like protoplanet with subsequent loss of gases
and ices and concomitant rebounding. The initial whole-Earth decompression is
expected to result in a global system of major primary decompression cracks
appearing in the rigid crust which persist as the basalt feeders for the
global, mid-oceanic ridge system. As the Earth subsequently decompresses, the
area of the Earth's surface increases by the formation of secondary
decompression cracks, often located near the continental margins, presently
identified as oceanic trenches. These secondary decompression cracks are
subsequently in-filled with basalt, extruded from the mid-oceanic ridges, which
traverses the ocean floor by gravitational creep, ultimately plunging into
secondary decompression cracks, emulating subduction. Much of the evidence
presented in support of plate tectonics supports Whole-Earth Decompression
Dynamics, but without necessitating mantle convection/circulation or basalt
re-cycling. Moreover, the timescale for Earth decompression is not constrained
to the last 200 million years, the maximum age of the current ocean floor.
