We present an optical and X-ray study of four Be/X-ray binaries located in
the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). OGLE I-band data of up to 11 years of
semi-continuous monitoring has been analysed for SMC X-2, SXP172 and SXP202B,
providing both a measurement of the orbital period (Porb = 18.62, 68.90, and
229.9 days for the pulsars respectively) and a detailed optical orbital profile
for each pulsar. For SXP172 this has allowed a direct comparison of the optical
and X-ray emission seen through regular RXTE monitoring, revealing that the
X-ray outbursts precede the optical by around 7 days. Recent X-ray studies by
XMM-Newton have identified a new source in the vicinity of SXP15.3 raising
doubt on the identification of the optical counterpart to this X-ray pulsar.
Here we present a discussion of the observations that led to the proposal of
the original counterpart and a detailed optical analysis of the counterpart to
the new X-ray source, identifying a 21.7 d periodicity in the OGLE I-band data.
The optical characteristics of this star are consistent with that of a SMC
Be/X-ray binary. However, this star was rejected as the counterpart to SXP15.3
in previous studies due to the lack of H{\alpha} emission.
