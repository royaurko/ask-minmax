We study the the survival probability P(t) upto time t, of a test particle
moving in a fluctuating external field. The particle moves according to some
prescribed deterministic or stochastic rules and survives as long as the
external field that it sees at its own location does not change sign. This is a
natural generalization of the "static persistence" (when the particle is at
rest) that has generated considerable recent interests. Two types of motions of
the particle are considered. In one case, the particle adopts a strategy to
live longer and in the other it just diffuses randomly. Three different
external fields were considered: (i) the solution of diffusion equation, (ii)
the "colour" profile of the q-state Potts model undergoing zero temperature
coarsening dynamics and (iii) spatially uncorrelated Brownian signals. In most
cases studied, $P(t)\sim t^{-\theta_m}$ for large t. The exponent $\theta_m$ is
calculated via numerically, analytically by approximate methods and in some
cases exactly. It is shown in some special cases that the survival probability
of the mobile particle is related to the persistence of special "patterns"
present in the initial configuration of a phase ordering system.
