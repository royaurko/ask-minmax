An important field of research in functional neuroimaging is the discovery of
integrated, distributed brain systems and networks, whose different regions
need to work in unison for normal functioning.
  The EEG is a non-invasive technique that can provide information for massive
connectivity analyses. Cortical signals of time varying electric neuronal
activity can be estimated from the EEG. Although such techniques have very high
time resolution, two cortical signals even at distant locations will appear to
be highly similar due to the low spatial resolution nature of the EEG.
  In this study a method for eliminating the effect of common sources due to
low spatial resolution is presented. It is based on an efficient estimation of
the whole-cortex partial coherence matrix. Using as a starting point any linear
EEG tomography that satisfies the EEG forward equation, it is shown that the
generalized partial coherences for the cortical grey matter current density
time series are invariant to the selected tomography. It is empirically shown
with simulation experiments that the generalized partial coherences have higher
spatial resolution than the classical coherences. The results demonstrate that
with as little as 19 electrodes, lag-connected brain regions can often be
missed and misplaced even with lagged coherence measures, while the new method
detects and localizes correctly the connected regions using the lagged partial
coherences.
