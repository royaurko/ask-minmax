We present the results of astrometric observations with VERA toward the H2O
maser sources in IRAS 05137+3919, which is thought to be located in the far
outer Galaxy. We have derived the parallax of \pi = 0.086 +/- 0.027 mas, which
corresponds to the source distance of D=11.6+5.3-2.8 kpc. Although the parallax
measurement is only 3-sigma level and thus the distance uncertainty is
considerably large, we can strongly constrain the minimum distance to this
source, locating the source at the distance from the Sun greater than 8.3 kpc
(or 16.7 kpc from the Galaxy's center) at 90% confidence level. Our results
provide an astrometric confirmation that this source is located in the far
outer Galaxy beyond 15 kpc from the Galaxy center, indicating that IRAS
05137+3919 is one of the most distant star-forming regions from the Galaxy
center.
