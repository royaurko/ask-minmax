Chandra images of galaxy clusters have revealed a wealth of structure unseen
by previous generations of low resolution X-ray observatories. In the cores of
clusters, bright, irregular X-ray emission is now routinely seen within central
dominant galaxies (CDGs) harboring powerful radio sources. The radio sources
are interacting with and are often displacing the hot gas leaving cavities in
their wakes. The cavities rise buoyantly, transporting up to 10E61 ergs of
energy to the intracluster medium over the life of a cluster. The dynamically
important magnetic fields observed in cooling flows may have originated from
these cavities. The cooling rates found by Chandra and XMM-Newton are much
smaller than previously reported, and they are more in line with the levels of
cold gas and star formation seen in other bandpasses. I discuss the emerging
correlation between extended H-alpha emission, star formation, and bright X-ray
emission at locations where the cooling time of the keV gas approaches a few
hundred million years. Data from a variety of disciplines suggest repeated,
short duration bursts of cooling and star formation are occurring, possibly
induced and regulated in some instances by the central radio source. Finally, I
discuss the interesting possibility that radio sources quench cooling flows,
while emphasizing the difficulties with some proposed scenarios.
