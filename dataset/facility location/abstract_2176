We propose an effective scheme for the generation of intense coherent extreme
ultraviolet light beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM). The light is
produced by a high-gain harmonic-generation free-electron laser (FEL), seeded
using a laser pulse with a transverse staircase-like phase pattern. During
amplification, diffraction and mode selection drive the radiation profile
towards a dominant OAM mode at saturation. With a seed laser at 260 nm,
gigawatt power levels are obtained at wavelengths approaching those of soft
x-rays. Compared to other proposed schemes to generate OAM with FELs, our
approach is robust, easier to implement, and can be integrated into already
existing FEL facilities without extensive modifications of the machine layout.
