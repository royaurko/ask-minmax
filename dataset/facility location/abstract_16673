High resolution blue continuum filtergrams from Hinode are employed to study
the umbral fine structure of a regular unipolar sunspot. The removal of
scattered light from the images increases the rms contrast by a factor of 1.45
on average. Improvement in image contrast renders identification of short
filamentary structures resembling penumbrae that are well separated from the
umbra-penumbra boundary and comprise bright filaments/grains flanking dark
filaments. Such fine structures were recently detected from ground based
telescopes and have now been observed with Hinode. A multi-level tracking
algorithm was used to identify umbral dots in both the uncorrected and
corrected images and to track them in time. The distribution of the values
describing the photometric and geometric properties of umbral dots are more
easily affected by the presence of stray light while it is less severe in the
case of kinematic properties. Statistically, umbral dots exhibit a peak
intensity, effective diameter, lifetime, horizontal speed and a trajectory
length of 0.29 I_QS, 272 km, 8.4 min, 0.45 km/s and 221 km respectively. The 2
hr 20 min time sequence depicts several locations where umbral dots tend to
appear and disappear repeatedly with various time intervals. The correction for
scattered light in the Hinode filtergrams facilitates photometry of umbral fine
structure which can be related to results obtained from larger telescopes and
numerical simulations.
