We present results of a study of charged particle track and vertex
reconstruction with a beam telescope made of four layers of 50 micron-thin CMOS
monolithic pixel sensors using the 120 GeV protons at the FNAL Meson Test Beam
Facility. We compare our results to the performance requirements of a future
e+e- linear collider in terms of particle track extrapolation and vertex
reconstruction accuracies.
