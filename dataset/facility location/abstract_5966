The single-site dynamical mean field theory approximation to the double
exchange model is found to exhibit a previously unnoticed instability, in which
a well-defined ground state which is stable against small perturbations is
found to be unstable to large-amplitude but purely local fluctuations. The
instability is shown to arise either from phase separation or, in a narrow
parameter regime, from the presence of a competing phase. The instability is
therefore suggested as a computationally inexpensive means of locating regimes
of parameter space in which phase separation occurs.
