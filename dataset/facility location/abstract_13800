In the past years technological advances such as the increasing bandwidth in
network infrastructures and new software developments such as message and
agent-based systems gave rise to the field of cloud technologies, which have
evolved from abstract concepts to concrete solutions, ranging from flexible,
platform-independent systems to highly specialized software solutions. In this
paper we introduce and evaluate two anomaly detection methods to achieve a
higher level of security in a specific cloud solution for interactive media,
the Media Cloud from Alcatel-Lucent. The Media Cloud focuses on real-time
processing of interactive media applications, allowing for optimal resource
planning using highly specific functional components. The proposed anomaly
detection methods are designed to work complimentary to each other and are
capable of detecting known and unknown vulnerabilities and security issues,
offering very low false positive rates and very high detection rates, as is
shown by the evaluation on real Media Cloud data and synthetic data. The
proposed methods use behavioral and structural features, and are capable of
locating the detected anomalies as well, giving the executing analyst easy
insight into the running processes.
