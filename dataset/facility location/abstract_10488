In this paper we analyze urban spatial segregation phenomenon in terms of the
income distribution over a population, and inflationary parameter weighting the
evolution of housing prices. For this, we develop a discrete, spatially
extended model based in a multi--agent approach. In our model, the mobility of
socioeconomic agents is driven only by the housing prices. Agents exchange
location in order to fit their status to the cost of their housing. On the
other hand, the price of a particular house changes depends on the status of
its tenant, and on the neighborhood mean lodging cost, weighted by a control
parameter. The agent's dynamics converges to a spatially organized
configuration, whose regularity we measured by using an entropy--like
indicator. With this simple model we found a nontrivial dependence of
segregation on both, the initial inequality of the socioeconomic agents and the
inflationary parameter. In this way we supply an explanatory model for the
segregation--inequality thesis putted forward by Douglas Massey.
