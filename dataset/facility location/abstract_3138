The main background above 3\,MeV for in-beam nuclear astrophysics studies
with $\gamma$-ray detectors is caused by cosmic-ray induced secondaries. The
two commonly used suppression methods, active and passive shielding, against
this kind of background were formerly considered only as alternatives in
nuclear astrophysics experiments. In this work the study of the effects of
active shielding against cosmic-ray induced events at a medium deep location is
performed. Background spectra were recorded with two actively shielded HPGe
detectors. The experiment was located at 148\,m below the surface of the Earth
in the Reiche Zeche mine in Freiberg, Germany. The results are compared to data
with the same detectors at the Earth's surface, and at depths of 45\,m and
1400\,m, respectively.
