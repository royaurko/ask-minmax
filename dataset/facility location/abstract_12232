In 1929, Leo Szilard invented a feedback protocol in which a hypothetical
intelligence called Maxwell's demon pumps heat from an isothermal environment
and transduces it to work. After an intense controversy that lasted over eighty
years; it was finally clarified that the demon's role does not contradict the
second law of thermodynamics, implying that we can convert information to free
energy in principle. Nevertheless, experimental demonstration of this
information-to-energy conversion has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate that a
nonequilibrium feedback manipulation of a Brownian particle based on
information about its location achieves a Szilard-type information-energy
conversion. Under real-time feedback control, the particle climbs up a
spiral-stairs-like potential exerted by an electric field and obtains free
energy larger than the amount of work performed on it. This enables us to
verify the generalized Jarzynski equality, or a new fundamental principle of
"information-heat engine" which converts information to energy by feedback
control.
