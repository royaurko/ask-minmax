We have used the data from the COBE satellite to search for delayed microwave
emission (31 - 90 GHz) from Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). The large $7^\circ$ beam
of COBE is well matched to the large positional uncertainties in the GRB
locations, although it also means that fluxes from (point source) GRB objects
will be diluted. In view of this we are doing a statistical search of the GRBs
which occurred during the currently released COBE DMR data (years 1990 and
1991), which overlap $\sim 200$ GRBs recorded by GRO. Here we concentrate on
just the top 10 GRBs (in peak counts/second). We obtain the limits on the
emission by comparing the COBE fluxes before and after the GRB at the GRB
location. Since it is thought that the microwave emission should lag the GRB
event, we have searched the GRB position for emission in the few months
following the GRB occurrence.
