The Hawking radiation of Dirac particles in an arbitrarily rectilinearly
accelerating Kinnersley black hole with electro-magnetic charge and
cosmological constant is investigated by using method of the generalized
tortoise coordinate transformation. Both the location and the temperature of
the event horizon depend on the time and the polar angle. The Hawking thermal
radiation spectrum of Dirac particles is also derived.
