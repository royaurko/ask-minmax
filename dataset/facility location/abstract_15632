It was known that by a duality transformation, interaction bosons at filling
factor $ f=p/q $ hopping on a lattice can be mapped to interacting vortices
hopping on the dual lattice subject to a fluctuating{\em dual} " magnetic
field" whose average strength through a dual plaquette is equal to the boson
density $ f=p/q $.So the kinetic term of the vortices is the same as the
Hofstadter problem of electrons moving in a lattice in the presence of $ f=p/q
$ flux per plaquette. Motivated by this mapping, we study the Hofstadter bands
of vortices hopping in the presence of magnetic flux $ f=p/q $ per plaquette on
5 most common bi-partisian and frustrated lattices such as square, honeycomb,
triangular, dice and Kagome lattices. We also determine the number of minima
and their locations in the lowest band. We numerically calculate the bandwidths
of the lowest Hofstadter bands in these lattices and find that except the
Kagome lattice at odd $ q $, they all satisfy the exponential decay law $ W = A
e^{-cq} $ even at the smallest $ q $. We determine $ (A, c) $ for the 5
different lattices. When $ q=2 $, we find that the lowest Hofstadter band is
completely flat for both Kagome and dice lattices. This indicates that the
boson ground state at half filling with nearest neighbor hopping on Kagome and
dice lattice is always a superfluid state,in contrast to the triangular lattice
where the boson ground state was shown previously to undergo a transition from
superfluid to supersolid state.
