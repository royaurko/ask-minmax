Considering both "large-U" and "small-U" orbitals, it is found that the
carriers of the high-Tc cuprates are polaron-like "stripons" carrying charge
and located on stripe-like inhomogeneities, "quasi-electrons" carrying charge
and spin, and "svivons" carrying spin and lattice distortion. This is shown to
result in the observed anomalous spectroscopic and transport properties of the
cuprates. Pairing results from transitions between pair states of stripons and
quasi-electrons through the exchange of svivons, and a crossover occurs between
BCS and Bose-Einstein condensation behaviors.
