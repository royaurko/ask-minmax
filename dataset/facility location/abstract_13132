We rigorously prove a form of disorder-resistance for a class of
one-dimensional cellular automaton rules, including some that arise as boundary
dynamics of two-dimensional solidification rules. Specifically, when started
from a random initial seed on an interval of length L, with probability tending
to one as L goes to infinity, the evolution is a replicator. That is, a region
of space-time of density one is filled with a spatially and temporally periodic
pattern, punctuated by a finite set of other finite patterns repeated at a
fractal set of locations. On the other hand, the same rules exhibit provably
more complex evolution from some seeds, while from other seeds their behavior
is apparently chaotic. A principal tool is a new variant of percolation theory,
in the context of additive cellular automata from random initial states.
