Introduction of polarizability in classical molecular simulations holds the
promise to increase accuracy as well as prediction power to computer modeling.
To introduce polarizability in a straight-forward way one strategy is based on
Drude particles: dummy atoms whose displacements mimic polarizability. In this
work, molecular dynamics simulations of SWM4-NDP, a Drude-based water model,
were performed for a wide range of temperatures going from 170 K to 340 K. We
found that the density maximum is located far down in the supercooled region at
around 200 K, roughly 80 K below the experimental value. Very long relaxation
times together with a new increase in the density were found at even lower
temperatures. On the other hand, both hydrogen-bond coordination up to the
second solvation shell and tetrahedral order resembled very much what was found
for TIP4P/2005, a very good performer at the reproduction of the density curve
and other properties of bulk water in temperature space. Such a discrepancy
between the density curve and the hydrogen bond propensity was not observed in
other conventional water models. Our results suggest that while the simplicity
of the SWM4 model is appealing, its current parametrization needs improvements
in order to correctly reproduce water behavior beyond ambient conditions.
