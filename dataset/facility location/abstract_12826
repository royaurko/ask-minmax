By using a covariant isobar model and the latest experimental data we have
analyzed the role of the $P_{13}(1900)$ and $D_{13}(2080)$ resonances in the
kaon photoproduction process $\gamma p\to K^+\Lambda$. Special attention has
been paid to the region where the second peak in the cross section is located,
i.e. at total c.m. energies around 1.9 GeV. It is found that this peak
originates mostly from the $P_{13}(1900)$ resonance contribution. Although the
contribution of the $D_{13}(2080)$ resonance is not negligible, it is much
smaller than that of the $P_{13}(1900)$ state. Our finding confirms that the
$P_{13}(1900)$ resonance is also important in explaining the beam-recoil double
polarization data $C_x$ and $C_z$, provided that the mass and the width of this
resonance are 1871 and 131 MeV, respectively.
