For a competitive system of k coupled nonlinear Schroedinger equations we
prove the existence, when the competition parameter is large, of positive
radial solutions on R^N. We show that, when the competition parameter goes to
infinity, the profile of each component separates, in many pulses, from the
others. Moreover, we can prescribe the location of such pulses in terms of the
oscillations of the changing-sign solutions of the scalar nonlinear
Schroedinger equation. Within an Hartree-Fock approximation, this provides a
theoretical indication of phase separation into many nodal domains for the
k-mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates.
