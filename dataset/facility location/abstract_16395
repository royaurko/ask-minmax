The light echo systems of historical supernovae in the Milky Way and local
group galaxies provide an unprecedented opportunity to reveal the effects of
asymmetry on observables, particularly optical spectra. Scattering dust at
different locations on the light echo ellipsoid witnesses the supernova from
different perspectives and the light consequently scattered towards Earth
preserves the shape of line profile variations introduced by asymmetries in the
supernova photosphere. However, the interpretation of supernova light echo
spectra to date has not involved a detailed consideration of the effects of
outburst duration and geometrical scattering modifications due to finite
scattering dust filament dimension, inclination, and image point-spread
function and spectrograph slit width. In this paper, we explore the
implications of these factors and present a framework for future resolved
supernova light echo spectra interpretation, and test it against Cas A and SN
1987A light echo spectra. We conclude that the full modeling of the dimensions
and orientation of the scattering dust using the observed light echoes at two
or more epochs is critical for the correct interpretation of light echo
spectra. Indeed, without doing so one might falsely conclude that differences
exist when none are actually present.
