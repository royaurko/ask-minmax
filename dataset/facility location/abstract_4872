We investigate the feasibility of implementing a system that will coordinate
ground-based optical telescopes to cover the Fermi GBM Error Circle (EC). The
aim of the system is to localize GBM detected GRBs and facilitate
multi-wavelength follow-up from space and ground. This system will optimize the
observing locations in the GBM EC based on individual telescope location, Field
of View (FoV) and sensitivity. The proposed system will coordinate GBM EC
scanning by professional as well as amateur astronomers around the world. The
results of a Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the feasibility of the
project are presented.
