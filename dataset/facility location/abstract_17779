We present a novel experimental design for high sensitivity measurements of
the electrical resistance of samples at high pressures (0-6GPa) and high
temperatures (300-1000K) in a 'Paris-Edinburgh' type large volume press.
Uniquely, the electrical measurements are carried out directly on a small
sample, thus greatly increasing the sensitivity of the measurement. The
sensitivity to even minor changes in electrical resistance can be used to
clearly identify phase transitions in material samples. Electrical resistance
measurements are relatively simple and rapid to execute and the efficacy of the
present experimental design is demonstrated by measuring the electrical
resistance of Pb, Sn and Bi across a wide domain of temperature-pressure phase
space and employing it to identify the loci of phase transitions. Based on
these results, the phase diagrams of these elements are reconstructed to high
accuracy and found to be in excellent agreement with previous studies. In
particular, by mapping the locations of several well-studied reference points
in the phase diagram of Sn and Bi, it is demonstrated that a standard
calibration exists for the temperature and pressure, thus eliminating the need
for direct or indirect temperature and pressure measurements. The present
technique will allow simple and accurate mapping of phase diagrams under
extreme conditions and may be of particular importance in advancing studies of
liquid state anomalies.
