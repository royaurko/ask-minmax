We study the spectra of $p \times p$ random matrices $K$ with off-diagonal
$(i,j)$ entry equal to $n^{-1/2}k(X_i^TX_j/n^{1/2})$, where $X_i$'s are the
rows of a $p \times n$ matrix with i.i.d. entries and $k$ is a scalar function.
It is known that under mild conditions, as $n$ and $p$ increase proportionally,
the empirical spectral measure of $K$ converges to a deterministic limit $\mu$.
We prove that if $k$ is a polynomial and the distribution of entries of $X_i$
is symmetric and satisfies a general moment bound, then $K$ is the sum of two
components, the first with spectral norm converging to $\|\mu\|$ (the maximum
absolute value of the support of $\mu$) and the second a perturbation of rank
at most two. In certain cases, including when $k$ is an odd polynomial
function, the perturbation is 0 and the spectral norm $\|K\|$ converges to
$\|\mu\|$. If the entries of $X_i$ are Gaussian, we also prove that $\|K\|$
converges to $\|\mu\|$ for a large class of odd non-polynomial functions $k$.
In general, the perturbation may contribute spike eigenvalues to $K$ outside of
its limiting support, and we conjecture that they have deterministic limiting
locations as predicted by a deformed GUE model. Our study of such matrices is
motivated by the analysis of statistical thresholding procedures to estimate
sparse covariance matrices from multivariate data, and our results imply an
asymptotic approximation to the spectral norm error of such procedures when the
population covariance is the identity.
