We have studied the problem of all sky search in reference to continuous
gravitational wave particularly for such sources whose wave-form are known in
advance. We have made an analysis of the number of templates required for
matched filter analysis as applicable to these sources. We have employed the
concept of {\it fitting factor} {\it (FF)}; treating the source location as the
parameters of the signal manifold and have studied the matching of the signal
with templates corresponding to different source locations. We have
investigated the variation of FF with source location and have noticed a
symmetry in template parameters, $\theta_T$ and $\phi_T$. It has been found
that the two different template values in source location, each in $\theta_T$
and $\phi_T$, have same {\it FF}. We have also computed the number of templates
required assuming the noise power spectral density $S_n(f)$ to be flat. It is
observed that higher {\it FF} requires exponentially increasing large number of
templates.
