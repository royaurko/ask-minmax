Modern society habitually uses online social media services to publicly share
observations, thoughts, opinions, and beliefs at any time and from any
location. These geotagged social media posts may provide aggregate insights
into people's perceptions on a bad range of topics across a given geographical
area beyond what is currently possible through services such as Yelp and
Foursquare. This paper develops probabilistic language models to investigate
whether collective, topic-based perceptions within a geographical area can be
extracted from the content of geotagged Twitter posts. The capability of the
methodology is illustrated using tweets from three areas of different sizes. An
application of the approach to support power grid restoration following a storm
is presented.
