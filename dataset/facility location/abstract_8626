The results of a deep submillimetre observation using SCUBA of the powerful
radio galaxy 3C324, at redshift z=1.206, are presented. At 850 microns,
emission from the location of the host radio galaxy is marginally detected at
the 4.2 sigma level, 3.01 +/- 0.72 mJy, but there is no detection of emission
at 450 microns to a 3 sigma limit of 21 mJy. A new 32 GHz radio observation
using the Effelsberg 100m telescope confirms that the sub-millimetre signal is
not associated with synchrotron emission. These observations indicate that both
the mass of warm dust within 3C324, and the star formation rate, lie up to an
order of magnitude below the values recently determined for radio galaxies at z
= 3 to 4. The results are compared with dust masses and star formation rates
derived in other ways for 3C324.
