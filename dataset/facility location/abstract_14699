We derive the expected Type II SN differential number counts, N(m), and
Hubble diagram for SCDM and LCDM cosmological models, taking into account the
effects of gravitational lensing (GL) produced by the intervening cosmological
mass. The mass distribution of dark matter halos (ie the lenses) is obtained by
means of a Monte Carlo method applied to the Press-Schechter mass function. The
halos are assumed to have a NFW density profile, in agreement with recent
simulations of hierarchical cosmological models. Up to z=15, the (SCDM, LCDM)
models predict a total number of (857, 3656) SNII/yr in 100 surveyed 4' times
4' fields of the Next Generation Space Telescope. NGST will be able to reach
the peak of the N(m) curve, located at AB approx 30(31) for SCDM(LCDM) in J and
K wavelength bands and detect (75%, 51%) of the above SN events. This will
allow a detailed study of the early cosmic star formation history, as traced by
SNIIe. N(m) is only very mildly affected by the inclusion of lensing effects.
In addition, GL introduces a moderate uncertainty in the determination of
cosmological parameters from Hubble diagrams, when these are pushed to higher
$z$. For example, for a ``true'' LCDM with (Omega_M= 0.4, Omega_Lambda=0.6),
without proper account of GL, one would instead derive
(Omega_{M}=0.36^{+0.15}_{-0.12}, Omega_{Lambda}=0.60^{+0.12}_{-0.24}). We
briefly compare our results with previous similar work and discuss the
limitations of the model.
