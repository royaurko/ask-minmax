Although WASP-14 b is one of the most massive and densest exoplanets on a
tight and eccentric orbit, it has never been a target of photometric follow-up
monitoring or dedicated observing campaigns. We report on new photometric
transit observations of WASP-14 b obtained within the framework of "Transit
Timing Variations @ Young Exoplanet Transit Initiative" (TTV@YETI). We
collected 19 light-curves of 13 individual transit events using six telescopes
located in five observatories distributed in Europe and Asia. From light curve
modelling, we determined the planetary, stellar, and geometrical properties of
the system and found them in agreement with the values from the discovery
paper. A test of the robustness of the transit times revealed that in case of a
non-reproducible transit shape the uncertainties may be underestimated even
with a wavelet-based error estimation methods. For the timing analysis we
included two publicly available transit times from 2007 and 2009. The long
observation period of seven years (2007-2013) allowed us to refine the transit
ephemeris. We derived an orbital period 1.2 s longer and 10 times more precise
than the one given in the discovery paper. We found no significant periodic
signal in the timing-residuals and, hence, no evidence for TTV in the system.
