The characteristics of the type II bursts with herringbone structure observed
both by ground based radio telescopes (UTR-2, URAN-2) and spaceborn
spectrometers (STEREO A-B) are discussed. The burst was recorded on 7 June,
2011 in the frequency band 3--33~MHz. It was characterized by extremely rich
fine structure. The statistical analysis of more than 300 herringbone
sub-bursts constituting the burst was performed separately for the positively
(reverse) and negatively (forward) drifting sub-bursts. The sense and the
degree of circular polarization of the herringbone sub-bursts were measured in
the respectively wide frequency band (16--32~MHz). A second order fine
frequency structure of the herringbone sub-bursts was firstly observed and
processed. Using STEREO COR1 (A,B) and SOHO LASCO C2 images the direction and
radial speed of the CME responsible for the studied type II burst were
determined. The possible location of the type II burst source on the flank of
the shock was found.
