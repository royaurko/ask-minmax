We investigate mobility regimes for localized modes in the discrete nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger (DNLS) equation with the cubic-quintic onsite terms. Using the
variational approximation (VA), the largest soliton's total power admitting
progressive motion of kicked discrete solitons is predicted, by comparing the
effective kinetic energy with the respective Peierls-Nabarro (PN) potential
barrier. The prediction is novel for the DNLS model with the cubic-only
nonlinearity too, demonstrating a reasonable agreement with numerical findings.
Small self-focusing quintic term quickly suppresses the mobility. In the case
of the competition between the cubic self-focusing and quintic self-defocusing
terms, we identify parameter regions where odd and even fundamental modes
exchange their stability, involving intermediate asymmetric modes. In this
case, stable solitons can be set in motion by kicking, so as to let them pass
the PN barrier. Unstable solitons spontaneously start oscillatory or
progressive motion, if they are located, respectively, below or above a
mobility threshold. Collisions between moving discrete solitons, at the
competing nonlinearities frame, are studied too.
