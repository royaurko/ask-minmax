We show several calculations to identify the critical point in the ground
state in random spin systems including spin glasses on the basis of the duality
analysis. The duality analysis is a profound method to obtain the precise
location of the critical point in finite temperature even for spin glasses. We
propose a single equality for identifying the critical point in the ground
state from several speculations. The equality can indeed give the exact
location of the critical points for the bond-dilution Ising model on several
lattices and provides insight on further analysis on the ground state in spin
glasses.
