The small group of Galactic Globular Clusters (GGC) (Pal 12, Terzan 7,
Ruprecht 106, Arp 2) recently discovered to be significantly younger (by ~3-4
Gyr) than the average cluster population of the Galaxy are shown to lie near
planes passing in the vicinity of some satellite galaxies of the Milky Way and
through the Galactic Centre itself. Assuming that these configurations
represent a fossil record of interactions between the Galaxy and its companions
from which these clusters originated, we identified, along one of them, another
candidate ``young'' GGC, i.e. IC4499, whose Color-Magnitude Diagram is
presented. Various hypotheses on the possible origin of ``young'' GGC are also
briefly discussed within a framework where the location on preferential planes
may be seen as a general characteristic for the Local Group members.
