The SLAC Linac can deliver damped bunches with ILC parameters for bunch
charge and bunch length to End Station A. A 10Hz beam at 28.5 GeV energy can be
delivered there, parasitic with PEP-II operation. We plan to use this facility
to test prototype components of the Beam Delivery System and Interaction
Region. We discuss our plans for this ILC Test Facility and preparations for
carrying out experiments related to collimator wakefields and energy
spectrometers. We also plan an interaction region mockup to investigate effects
from backgrounds and beam-induced electromagnetic interference.
