Using a gap equation for the pion mass a nonperturbative method is given for
solving the chiral quark-meson model in the chiral limit at the lowest order in
the fermion contributions encountered in a large N_f approximation. The
location of the tricritical point is analytically determined. A mean field
potential is constructed from which critical exponents can be obtained.
