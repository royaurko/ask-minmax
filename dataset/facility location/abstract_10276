Based on the proper-time renormalization group approach, the scalar and the
quark number susceptibilities in the vicinity of possible critical end points
of the hadronic phase diagram are investigated in the two-flavor quark-meson
model. After discussing the quark-mass dependence of the location of such
points, the critical behavior of the in-medium meson masses and quark number
density are calculated. The universality classes of the end points are
determined by calculating the critical exponents of the susceptibilities. In
order to numerically estimate the influence of fluctuations we compare all
quantities with results from a mean-field approximation. It is concluded that
the region in the phase diagram where the susceptibilities are enhanced is more
compressed around the critical end point if fluctuations are included.
