Phosphorene, the single- or few-layer form of black phosphorus, was recently
rediscovered as a twodimensional layered material holding great promise for
applications in electronics and optoelectronics. Research into its fundamental
properties and device applications has since seen exponential growth. In this
Perspective, we review recent progress in phosphorene research, touching upon
topics on fabrication, properties, and applications; we also discuss challenges
and future research directions. We highlight the intrinsically anisotropic
electronic, transport, optoelectronic, thermoelectric, and mechanical
properties of phosphorene resulting from its puckered structure in contrast to
those of graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides. The facile fabrication
and novel properties of phosphorene have inspired design and demonstration of
new nanodevices; however, further progress hinges on resolutions to technical
obstructions like surface degradation effects and non-scalable fabrication
techniques. We also briefly describe the latest developments of more
sophisticated design concepts and implementation schemes that address some of
the challenges in phosphorene research. It is expected that this fascinating
material will continue to offer tremendous opportunities for research and
development for the foreseeable future.
