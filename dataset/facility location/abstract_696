A location and tracking system becomes very important to our future world of
pervasive computing. An algorithm for accurate location information is being
incorporated in the human walking model and in the blind human walking model.
We want to implement an accurate location tracking mechanism using Zigbee along
with GPS, we have incorporated Markov chain algorithm for establishing
accuracy. Normal Human and blind human walking steps were actually taken in the
known environment within our campus and the Markov chain algorithm was used for
smoothening the stepwise variation in location updates. A comparison module is
also implemented to show the difference between normal human and blind human
walking step variations. This accuracy is used for designing a blind tracking
device so that the device can be used by the blind for finding the path without
obstacles. We present a system level approach to localizing and tracking Human
and blind users on a basis of different sources of location information [GPS
plus Zigbee]. The system can be applied outdoors especially for avoiding
accidents, GPS as the source of location data. Performance evaluation shows
that the system is accurate and it is a future path finding device with service
for the blind.
