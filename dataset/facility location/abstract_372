The HICAT project is a Heavy Ion accelerator for light ion Cancer Treatment
to be built for the clinics in Heidelberg, Germany. It consists of a 7 MeV/u
linac, a compact synchrotron and three treatment places, one of them equipped
with a 360 degree gantry beam-line. The facility will implement the intensity
controlled raster-scanning technique that was developed and successfully
demonstrated at GSI with over 100 patients at present. In order to produce the
beams with the characteristics requested by the treatment sequencer, the
accelerator must operate on a pulse-to-pulse basis with different settings.
This concept imposes strict and challenging demands on the operation of the
accelerators and hence the control system of the facility. The control system
should be developed, installed and maintained by and under the complete
responsibility of an industrial system provider, using a state-of-the-art
system and wide-spread industrial components wherever possible. The
presentation covers the status of the project and the requirements on the
control system.
