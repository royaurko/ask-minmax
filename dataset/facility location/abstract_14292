We investigate the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration at
finite density and temperature within the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model,
and mainly focus on the critical behaviors near the critical end point (CEP)
and tricritical point (TCP) of QCD. The co-existence region of the Wigner and
Nambu phase is determined in the phase diagram for the massive and massless
current quark, respectively. We use the various susceptibilities to locate the
CEP/TCP and then extract the critical exponents near them. Our calculations
reveal that the various susceptibilities share the same critical behaviors for
the physical current quark mass, while they show different features in the
chiral limit. Furthermore the critical exponent of order parameter at the TCP,
$\beta$=1/4, differs from that on the $O(4)$ line, $\beta$=1/2, which indicates
a change in the universality class.
