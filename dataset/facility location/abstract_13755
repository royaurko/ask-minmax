The effects of a large coronal mass ejection (CME) on a solar coronal
streamer located roughly 90 degrees from the main direction of the CME
propagation observed on January 2, 2012 by the SOHO/LASCO coronagraph are
analyzed. Radial coronal streamers undergo some bending when CMEs pass through
the corona, even at large angular distances from the streamers. The phenomenon
resembles a bending wave traveling along the streamer. Some researchers
interpret these phenomena as the effects of traveling shocks generated by rapid
CMEs, while others suggest they are waves excited inside the streamers by
external impacts. The analysis presented here did not find convincing arguments
in favor of either of these interpretations. It is concluded that the streamer
behavior results from the effect of the magnetic field of a moving magnetic
rope associated with the coronal ejection. The motion of the large-scale
magnetic rope away from the Sun changes the surrounding magnetic field lines in
the corona, and these changes resemble the half-period of a wave running along
the streamer.
