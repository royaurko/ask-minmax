  The Planck LFI Radiometer Chain Assemblies (RCAs) have been calibrated in two
dedicated cryogenic facilities. In this paper the facilities and the related
instrumentation are described. The main satellite thermal interfaces for the
single chains have to be reproduced and stability requirements have to be
satisfied. Setup design, problems occurred and improving solutions implemented
are discussed. Performance of the cryogenic setup are reported.
