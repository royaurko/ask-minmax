We study numerically the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model as function of the
magnetic field h, with fixed temperature T=0.6 Tc. We investigate the finite
size scaling behavior of several quantities, such as the spin glass
susceptibility, looking for numerical evidences of the transition on the De
Almeida Thouless line. We find strong corrections to scaling which make
difficult to locate the transition point. This shows, in a simple case, the
extreme difficulties of spin glass simulations in non-zero magnetic field.
Next, we study various sum rules (consequences of stochastic stability)
involving overlaps between three and four replicas, which appear to be
numerically well satisfied, and in a non-trivial way. Finally, we present data
on P(q) for a large lattice size (N=3200) at low temperature T=0.4 Tc, where,
for the first time, the shape predicted by the RSB solution of the model for
non-zero magnetic field is visible.
