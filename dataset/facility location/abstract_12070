The difference in density profiles of the contributions from different
density peaks to dark matter halos results in certain expectations about the
Milky Way's stellar halo. We cut our simulated halo stars into two populations:
those forming before/during the last major merger, and those accreted after the
last major merger. The former population are more centrally located at z=0,
while stars forming in low mass late forming proto-galaxies are spread through
the halo. A difference in observed binding energy distinguishes these two
populations. We look at possible chemical abundance signatures of the two
populations. We also show that galaxies forming in isolated low sigma peaks
will form from primordial material. Thus, even though the oldest stars are
centrally concentrated as they originated in the early collapsing, densest
regions, primordial stars would be found distributed throughout the halo. Thus,
the lack of observed metal free stars can be taken as directly constraining the
Population III IMF, and the lowest metallicity observed stars can be
interpreted as holding clues to the chemical yields of Pop III stars.
