Muon colliders and neutrino factories are attractive options for future
facilities aimed at achieving the highest lepton-antilepton collision energies
and precision measurements of parameters of the neutrino mixing matrix. The
performance and cost of these depend sensitively on how well a beam of muons
can be cooled. Recent progress in muon cooling design studies and prototype
tests nourishes the hope that such facilities can be built in the decade to
come.
