Behavior of planar multilayer periodic structures due to plane wave
excitation has been studied using the transfer matrix method. Multilayer
structure is taken with periodicity two. That is, layers at even and odd
locations repeat themselves. Layers at odd locations are of chiral nihility
metamaterial whereas three different cases for layers at even locations are
considered, i.e., dielectric, chiral and chiral nihility. Effects of
polarization rotation due to the optical activity is studied with respect to
the angle of incidence and frequency in terahertz domain. Chiral nihility
introduces property of transparency to the structure for normal incidence while
complete rejection is observed for chiral nihility-chiral nihility structure at
oblique incidence.
