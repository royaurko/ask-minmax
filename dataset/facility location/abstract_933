We present the design and preliminary results of a prototype beam-based
digital feedback system for the Interaction Point of the International Linear
Collider. A custom analogue front-end processor, FPGA-based digital signal
processing board, and kicker drive amplifier have been designed, built, and
tested on the extraction line of the KEK Accelerator Test Facility (ATF). The
system was measured to have a latency of approximately 140 ns.
