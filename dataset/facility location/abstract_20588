We report initial results from a quasi-simultaneous X-ray/optical observing
campaign targeting V4046 Sgr, a close, synchronous-rotating classical T Tauri
star (CTTS) binary in which both components are actively accreting. V4046 Sgr
is a strong X-ray source, with the X-rays mainly arising from high-density (n_e
~ 10^(11-12) cm^(-3)) plasma at temperatures of 3-4 MK. Our multiwavelength
campaign aims to simultaneously constrain the properties of this X-ray emitting
plasma, the large scale magnetic field, and the accretion geometry. In this
paper, we present key results obtained via time-resolved X-ray grating spectra,
gathered in a 360 ks XMM-Newton observation that covered 2.2 system rotations.
We find that the emission lines produced by this high-density plasma display
periodic flux variations with a measured period, 1.22+/-0.01 d, that is
precisely half that of the binary star system (2.42 d). The observed rotational
modulation can be explained assuming that the high-density plasma occupies
small portions of the stellar surfaces, corotating with the stars, and that the
high-density plasma is not azimuthally symmetrically distributed with respect
to the rotational axis of each star. These results strongly support models in
which high-density, X-ray-emitting CTTS plasma is material heated in accretion
shocks, located at the base of accretion flows tied to the system by magnetic
field lines.
