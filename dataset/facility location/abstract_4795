Deposition of smaller granular particles on a larger nucleus particle has
been simulated in two-dimension using molecular dynamics method. Variation of
sequences of velocity of deposited particles is conducted and reported in this
work. The sequences obey a normal distribution function of velocity with the
same parameters. It has been observed that for velocity in range of 0 to 0.02
the densest deposited site (15-17 % number of grains) is located at about angle
{\pi}/4 where location of injection point is {\pi}/4. And the less dense is
about {\pi}/4 + {\pi}/2. Different sequences give similar result.
