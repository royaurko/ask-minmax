In this work we consider the problem of recovering an ensemble of Diracs on
the sphere from its projection onto spaces of spherical harmonics. We show that
under an appropriate separation condition on the unknown locations of the
Diracs, the ensemble can be recovered through Total Variation norm
minimization. The proof of the uniqueness of the solution uses the method of
`dual' interpolating polynomials and is based on [8], where the theory was
developed for trigonometric polynomials. We also show that in the special case
of non-negative ensembles, a sparsity condition is sufficient for exact
recovery.
