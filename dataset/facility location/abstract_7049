We study a static scalar massless field created by a source located near an
electrically charged higher dimensional spherically symmetric black hole. We
demonstrated that there exist bi-conformal transformations relating static
field solutions in the metric with different parameters of the mass M and
charge Q. Using this symmetry we obtain the static scalar Green function in the
higher dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom spacetimes.
