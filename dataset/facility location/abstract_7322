This paper deals with the reconstruction of the direction of a gravitational
wave source using the detection made by a network of interferometric detectors,
mainly the LIGO and Virgo detectors. We suppose that an event has been seen in
coincidence using a filter applied on the three detector data streams. Using
the arrival time (and its associated error) of the gravitational signal in each
detector, the direction of the source in the sky is computed using a chi^2
minimization technique. For reasonably large signals (SNR>4.5 in all
detectors), the mean angular error between the real location and the
reconstructed one is about 1 degree. We also investigate the effect of the
network geometry assuming the same angular response for all interferometric
detectors. It appears that the reconstruction quality is not uniform over the
sky and is degraded when the source approaches the plane defined by the three
detectors. Adding at least one other detector to the LIGO-Virgo network reduces
the blind regions and in the case of 6 detectors, a precision less than 1
degree on the source direction can be reached for 99% of the sky.
