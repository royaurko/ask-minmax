We report on ASCA observations of the low mass X-ray binaries GX 354-0 and KS
1731-260. The spectrum of GX 354-0 is best described as a power-law or a
Comptonized spectrum with tau ~ 5 and kT ~ 8 keV and a residual at ~6.5 keV.
The residual may be a disk reflection or a Compton broadened Gaussian line from
the hot inner ADAF-like coronal region. The absorption column density to the
source is 2.9e22 cm^-2. No soft thermal component was detected. The spectrum
from KS 1731-260 is softer and it is best fit with a two component model with a
column density of 1.1e22 cm^-2. The likely interpretation is emission from a
Comptonizing cloud with an optical depth tau>12 and either a neutron star or a
disk blackbody emission. We discuss the likely location of the Comptonizing
cloud for both sources within the context of several proposed emission models.
