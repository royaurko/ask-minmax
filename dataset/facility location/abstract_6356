We present a theoretical description for the equilibrium states of a large
class of models of two-dimensional and geophysical flows, in arbitrary domains.
We account for the existence of ensemble inequivalence and negative specific
heat in those models, for the first time using explicit computations. We give
exact theoretical computation of a criteria to determine phase transition
location and type. Strikingly, this criteria does not depend on the model, but
only on the domain geometry. We report the first example of bicritical points
and second order azeotropy in the context of systems with long range
interactions.
