In coming years, Australia may find the need to build new optical telescopes
to continue local programmes, contribute to global survey projects, and form a
local multi-wavelength connection for the new radio telescopes being built. In
this study, we refine possible locations for a new optical telescope by
studying remotely sensed meteorological infrared data to ascertain expected
cloud coverage rates across Australia, and combine these data with a Digital
Elevation Model using a Geographic Information System. We find that the best
sites within Australia for building optical telescopes are likely to be on the
highest mountains in the Hamersley Range in Northwest Western Australia, while
the MacDonnell Ranges in the Northern Territory may also be appropriate. We
believe that similar seeing values to Siding Spring should be obtainable and
with significantly more observing time at the identified sites. We expect to
find twice as many clear nights as at current telescope sites. These sites are
thus prime locations for future on-site testing.
