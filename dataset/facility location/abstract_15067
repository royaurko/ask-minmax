Al(26) radioactivity traces recent nucleosynthesis throughout the Galaxy, and
is known to be produced in massive stars and novae. The map from its decay
gamma-ray line suggests massive stars to dominate, but high-resolution line
spectroscopy is expected to supplement imaging of Al(26) source regions and
thus to help decide about the Al(26) injection process and interstellar
environment, hence about the specific massive-star subgroup and phase which
produces interstellar Al(26). The INTEGRAL Spectrometer SPI has observed
Galactic Al(26) radioactivity in its 1809 keV gamma-ray line during its first
inner-Galaxy survey. Instrumental background lines make analysis difficult;
yet, a clear signal from the inner Galaxy agrees with expectations. In
particular, SPI has constrained the line width to exclude previously-reported
line broadenings corresponding to velocities >500 km/s. The
signal-to-background ratio of percent implies that detector response and
background modeling need to be fine-tuned to eventually enable line shape
deconvolution in order to extract source location information along the line of
sight.
