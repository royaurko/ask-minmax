We will present the multi-wavelength modeling of the supernova remnant
Cassiopeia A's shell based on radio, X-rays, and GeV-TeV gamma rays. Our aim is
to estimate the location of TeV gamma rays with the help of spectral analysis
of X-rays from different regions of the shell, because Chandra X-ray
observations have a far better angular resolution than the gamma-ray
measurements. Our analysis shows X-ray flux levels from various regions of the
remnant to be different. We find that leptonic model is unable to explain the
GeV and TeV data, simultaneously. So, we invoke a hadronic model as an
additional component to explain the GeV and TeV data.
