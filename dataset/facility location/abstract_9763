We present a combined study by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and atomistic
simulations of the emission of dissociated dislocation loops by nanoindentation
on a (001) fcc surface. The latter consist of two stacking-fault ribbons
bounded by Shockley partials and a stair-rod dislocation. These dissociated
loops, which intersect the surface, are shown to originate from loops of
interstitial character emitted along the <110> directions and are usually
located at hundreds of angstroms away from the indentation point. Simulations
reproduce the nucleation and glide of these dislocation loops.
