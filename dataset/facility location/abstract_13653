Energy band structure of the bilayer graphene superlattices with
zero-averaged periodic $\delta$-function potentials are studied within the
four-band continuum model. Using the transfer matrix method, studies are mainly
focused on examining the touching points between adjacent minibands. For the
zero-energy touching points the dispersion relation derived shows the
Dirac-like double-cone shape with the group velocity which is periodic in the
potential strength $P$ with the period of $\pi$ and becomes anisotropic at
relatively large $P$. From the finite-energy touching points we have identified
those located at zero wave-number. It was shown that for these finite-energy
touching points the dispersion is direction-dependent in the sense that it is
linear or parabolic in the direction parallel or perpendicular to the
superlattice direction, respectively. We have also calculated the density of
states and the conductivity that demonstrate a manifestation of the touching
points of interest.
