Recently, Gandhi, H\"onig, and Kishimoto submitted a manuscript to the arXiv
e-print service on the location of the emitting region of the narrow FeK$\alpha
$ line that appears in the X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
compared with the inner radius of the dust torus (arXiv:1502.02661). Prior to
their manuscript, a similar discussion had already been presented in a section
of Minezaki & Matsushita (2015), which had been accepted for publication in the
Astrophysical Journal. Because Gandhi et al. made no reference to Minezaki &
Matsushita (2015) apart from improperly citing it merely as an application of
the dust reverberation of AGNs, we present a brief comparison of both papers.
Gandhi et al. compared the location of the FeK$\alpha$ emitting region with the
individually measured radius of the dust torus for type 1 AGNs, whereas
Minezaki & Matsushita (2015) examined it based on the scaling relation of the
dust reverberation radius for both type 1 and type 2 AGNs. Nevertheless, Gandhi
et al's main result is basically consistent with and supports the results of
Minezaki & Matsushita (2015).
