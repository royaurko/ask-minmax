We derive the elastic properties of a cylindrical cloak for in-plane coupled
shear and pressure waves. The cloak is characterized by a rank 4 elasticity
tensor with 16 spatially varying entries which are deduced from a geometric
transform. Remarkably, the Navier equations retain their form under this
transform, which is generally untrue [Milton et al., New J. Phys. 8, 248
(2006)]. We numerically check that clamped and freely vibrating obstacles
located inside the neutral region are cloaked disrespectful of the frequency
and the polarization of an incoming elastic wave.
