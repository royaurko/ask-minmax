We demonstrate, that Bose-Einstein condensate can escape from the trap,
formed of combined linear periodic (optical lattice) and parabolic potentials,
and the escaping mechanism is similar to Hawking radiation from black hole. The
low-amplitude bright-bright soliton in two-component Bose-Einstein condensate
(where chemical potentials of the BEC first and second components are located
nearby the opposite edges of the first band of the optical lattice spectrum)
serves as an analogue of particle-antiparticle pair in Hawking radiation. It is
shown that parabolic potential, being applied to such two-component BEC, leads
to spatial separation of its components: BEC component with chemical potential
located in semi-infinite gap exerts the periodical oscillations, while the BEC
component, whose chemical potential is in the first finite gap, escapes from
the trap (due to negative effective mass of gap soliton). We also propose a
method for the creation of such bright-bright soliton -- transferring of atoms
from one BEC component to another by spatially periodic linear coupling term.
