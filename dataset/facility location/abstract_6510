Determinantal and permanental processes are point processes with a
correlation function given by a determinant or a permanent. Their atoms exhibit
mutual attraction of repulsion, thus these processes are very far from the
uncorrelated situation encountered in Poisson models. We establish a
quasi-invariance result : we show that if atoms locations are perturbed along a
vector field, the resulting process is still a determinantal (respectively
permanental) process, the law of which is absolutely continuous with respect to
the original distribution. Based on this formula, following Bismut approach of
Malliavin calculus, we then give an integration by parts formula.
