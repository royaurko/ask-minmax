Hawking's radiation effect of Klein-Gordon scalar field, Dirac particles and
Maxwell's electromagnetic field in the non-stationary rotating de Sitter
cosmological space-time is investigated by using a method of generalized
tortoise co-ordinates transformation. The locations and the temperatures of the
cosmological horizons of the non-stationary rotating de Sitter model are
derived. It is found that the locations and the temperatures of the rotating
cosmological model depend not only on the time but also on the angle. The
stress-energy regularization techniques are applied to the two dimensional
analog of the de Sitter metrics and the calculated stress-energy tensor
contains the thermal radiation effect.
