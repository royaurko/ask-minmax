We summarize recent results for the phase structure of QCD at finite
temperature and light-quark chemical potential for N_f=2+1 and N_f=2+1+1
dynamical quark flavors. We discuss order parameters for the chiral and
deconfinement transitions obtained from solutions of a coupled set of
(truncated) Dyson-Schwinger equations for the quark and gluon propagators of
Landau gauge QCD. Based on excellent agreement with results from lattice-QCD at
zero chemical potential we study the possible appearance of a critical
end-point at large chemical potential.
