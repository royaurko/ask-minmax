In this report proofs are presented for a method for abstracting continuous
dynamical systems by timed automata. The method is based on partitioning the
state space of dynamical systems with invariant sets, which form cells
representing locations of the timed automata.
  To enable verification of the dynamical system based on the abstraction,
conditions for obtaining sound, complete, and refinable abstractions are set
up.
  It is proposed to partition the state space utilizing sub-level sets of
Lyapunov functions, since they are positive invariant sets. The existence of
sound abstractions for Morse-Smale systems and complete and refinable
abstractions for linear systems are proved.
