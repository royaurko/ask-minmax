We report results from an XMM-Newton observation of the broad-line radio
galaxy 3C109 (z=0.3056). Confirming previous results, an Fe emission line is
detected, possibly comprising a broad component. However, the data cannot
distinguish between an untruncated accretion disc and a case in which the
innermost 20-30 gravitational radii are missing. In fact, a partial-covering
plus narrow Fe line scenario is not ruled out statistically. However, the
absorber would have to comprise hundreds/thousands very compact clouds close to
the X-ray source, which seems rather extreme a requirement. The 2-10 keV
intrinsic luminosity of 3C109 is of the order of 2-3x10^45 erg/s which,
combined with a recent black hole mass estimate of ~2x10^8 M_sun, implies an
Eddington ratio greater than unity. If partial covering is excluded, the
observed reflection fraction (of the order of unity), steep photon index
(1.86), and Fe line equivalent width (about 100 eV) all suggest to exclude that
the X-ray continuum is strongly beamed, indicating that the large Eddington
ratio is associated with a radiatively efficient accretion process. We also
confirm previous findings on the detection of low energy absorption in excess
of the Galactic value. The better quality of the XMM-Newton data enables us to
attribute the excess absorption to slightly ionized gas in the line of sight,
located at the redshift of 3C109. [abriged]
