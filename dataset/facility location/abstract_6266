A model for economic behavior, under heterogeneous spatial economic
conditions is developed. The role of selection pressure in a Bak-Sneppen-like
dynamics with entity diffusion on a lattice is studied by Monte-Carlo
simulation taking into account business rule(s), like enterprise - enterprise
short range location "interaction"(s), business plan(s) through spin-offs or
merging and enterprise survival evolution law(s). It is numerically found that
the model leads to a sort of phase transition for the fitness gap as a function
of the selection pressure.
