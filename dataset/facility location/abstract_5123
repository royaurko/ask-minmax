We investigate the intergenerational shape dynamics of single Caulobacter
crescentus cells using a novel combination of imaging techniques and
theoretical modeling. We determine the dynamics of cell pole-to-pole lengths,
cross-sectional widths, and medial curvatures from high accuracy measurements
of cell contours. Moreover, these shape parameters are determined for over 250
cells across approximately 10000 total generations, which affords high
statistical precision. Our data and model show that constriction is initiated
early in the cell cycle and that its dynamics are controlled by the time scale
of exponential longitudinal growth. Based on our extensive and detailed growth
and contour data, we develop a minimal mechanical model that quantitatively
accounts for the cell shape dynamics and suggests that the asymmetric location
of the division plane reflects the distinct mechanical properties of the
stalked and swarmer poles. Furthermore, we find that the asymmetry in the
division plane location is inherited from the previous generation. We interpret
these results in terms of the current molecular understanding of shape, growth,
and division of C. crescentus
