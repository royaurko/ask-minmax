3EG J1837-0423 and HESS J1841-055 are two unidentified and peculiar
high-energy sources located in the same region of the sky, separated by 1.4
deg. Specifically, 3EG J1837-0423 is a transient MeV object detected by EGRET
only once during flaring activity that lasted a few days while HESS J1841-055
is a highly extended TeV source. We attempted to match the high-energy emission
from the unidentified sources 3EG J1837-0423 and HESS J1841-055 with X-rays
(4-20 keV) and soft gamma-rays (20-100 keV) candidate counterparts detected
through deep INTEGRAL observations of the sky region. As a result we propose
the SFXT AX J1841.0-0536 as a possible candidate counterpart of 3EG J1837-0423,
based on spatial proximity and transient behavior. Alternatively, AX
J1841.0-0536 could be responsible for at least a fraction of the entire TeV
emission from the extended source HESS J1841-055, based on a striking spatial
correlation. In either case, the proposed association is also supported from an
energetic standpoint by a theoretical scenario where AX J1841.0-0536 is a low
magnetized pulsar which, due to accretion of massive clumps from the supergiant
companion donor star, undergoes sporadic changes to transient Atoll-states
where a magnetic tower can produce transient jets and as a consequence
high-energy emission. In either case (by association with 3EG J1837-0423 or
alternatively with HESS J1841-055), AX J1841.0-0536 might be the prototype of a
new class of Galactic transient MeV/TeV emitters.
