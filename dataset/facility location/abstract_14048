Gazeau-Klauder coherent states of the extended trigonometric Scarf potential,
underlying the quadratic energy spectrum and associated with Jacobi-type Xm
exceptional orthogonal polynomials P(a,b,m) n (x), are constructed. The
temporal evolution of wave-packet coherent states are performed by means of an
autocorrelation function and the full revival properties are investigated in
the usual time-domain analysis. This latter seems to be less useful for
describing the fractional revivals due to the complicated nature of coherent
wave-packet. Fortunately the autocorrelation function revels a little signature
of fractional revivals at the vicinity of quarters of the revival time Trev due
to the quadratic energy spectrum and the use of the wavelet-based
time-frequency analysis of the autocorrelation function provides an analytical
and numerical observation of the fractional revivals at different orders of the
system.
