Let $\xi$ be a random measure on a locally compact second countable
topological group and let $X$ be a random element in a measurable space on
which the group acts. In the compact case, we give a natural definition of the
concept that the origin is a typical location for $X$ in the mass of $\xi$, and
prove that when this holds the same is true on sets placed uniformly at random
around the origin. This new result motivates an extension of the concept of
typicality to the locally compact case where it coincides with the concept of
mass-stationarity. We describe recent developments in Palm theory where these
ideas play a central role.
