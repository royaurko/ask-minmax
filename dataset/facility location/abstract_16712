This work relates the occurrence and the characterization of fibrous
tremolite within the latest pyroclastic deposits of the Colli Albani (Alban
Hills) volcano, to the south-east of Rome (Italy). These mineralizations were
observed during a systematic rock-sampling undertaken to complete the
geological survey for the new 1:50 000 map of this volcanic area. The examined
specimens were collected inside distal deposits correlated to the last Albano
Maar activity, which are geographically located within the boundaries of the
Nemi community. Tremolite occurs within both carbonate ejecta and the host
pyroclastic rocks. It shows up as whitish to light gray coloured aggregates of
crystals with fibrous aspect and sericeous brightness. Due to the extremely
small crystal dimensions, never exceeding 0.5 micron in diameter, the
micro-chemical composition of the fibres could be obtained only by combining
P-XRD, SEM-EDX and FTIR methods. Infrared spectroscopy, in particular, proved
to be a valuable technique to characterize the studied amphibole. The
composition determined is that of a Fe-free F-rich (c. 53%) tremolite with
significant (c. 20%) richterite components in solid-solution. The occurrence of
fibrous tremolite in an inhabited place, occurring as natural geological
material rather than being due to anthropogenic pollution, should be examined
with concern, because it implies complex health and legal responsibilities in
the case of mobilization due to extreme climatic events.
