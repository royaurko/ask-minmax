We introduce Q-space, the tensor product of an index space with a primary
space, to achieve a more general mathematical description of correlations in
terms of q-tuples. Topics discussed include the decomposition of Q-space into a
sum-variable (location) subspace S plus an orthogonal difference-variable
subspace D, and a systematisation of q-tuple size estimation in terms of
p-norms. The "GHP sum" prescription for q-tuple size emerges naturally as the
2-norm of difference-space vectors. Maximum- and minimum-size prescriptions are
found to be special cases of a continuum of p-sizes.
