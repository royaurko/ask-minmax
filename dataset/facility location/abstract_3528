It is vital that new clean and abundant sources of energy be developed for
the sustainability of modern society. Nuclear fusion of the hydrogen isotopes
deuterium and tritium, if successful, might make a major contribution toward
satisfying this need. The U.S. has an important effort aimed at achieving
practical inertial confinement fusion, ICF, which has been under development
for decades at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The National
Ignition Facility (NIF) is a giant laser to multiply-shock and thus
quasi-isentropically compress a capsule of deuterium-tritium (DT) to high
density and temperature, where the fusion rate is proportional to density
squared times temperature to the fourth power. The principal problem that must
be solved for NIF to work successfully is elimination of the Rayleigh-Tailor
(R-T) instability that originates from the interface between the solid shell
and the DT fuel within it. The R-T instability poisons the fusion reaction by
reducing the temperature of the DT achieved by dynamic compression driven by
the NIF laser. The primary technological problem today is one of Condensed
Matter and Materials Physics (CMMP), rather than laser technology and plasma
physics. The CMMP of the fuel capsule that must be done to minimize growth of
the R-T instability is yet to be done. Based on what is known today, it is
unlikely that NIF will produce practical amounts of fusion energy.
