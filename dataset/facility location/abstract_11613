Recent results from Pierre Auger Observatory, showing energy dependent
chemical composition of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with a growing
fraction of heavy elements at high energies, suggest a possible non-negligible
contribution of the Galactic sources. We show that, in the case of UHECRs
produced by gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) or rare types of supernova explosions that
took place in Milky Way in the past, the change in UHECR composition can result
from the difference in diffusion times for different species. The anisotropy in
the direction of the Galactic Center is expected to be a few per cent on
average, but the locations of the most recent/closest bursts can be associated
with observed clusters of UHECRs.
