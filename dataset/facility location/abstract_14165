The increasing interest in spatially correlated functional data has led to
the development of appropriate geostatistical techniques. Prediction of a curve
at an unmonitored location can be obtained using a functional kriging with
external drift model that takes into account the effect of exogenous variables
(either scalar or functional). Nevertheless uncertainty evaluation for
functional spatial prediction remains an open issue. We propose a
semi-parametric bootstrap for spatially correlated functional data that allows
to evaluate the uncertainty of a predicted curve. Prediction bands are obtained
by ordering the bootstrapped predicted curves in two different ways according
to band depth and $L^2$ distance. The performance of the proposed methodology
is assessed via a simulation study. Moreover, the approach is illustrated on a
well known data set of Canadian temperature and on a real data set of PM$_{10}$
concentration in the Piemonte region, Italy. Based on the results it can be
concluded that the method is computationally feasible and suitable for
quantifying the uncertainty around a predicted curve.
