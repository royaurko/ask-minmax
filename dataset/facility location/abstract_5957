A nematic liquid crystal in contact with a grating surface possessing an
alternating stripe pattern of locally homeotropic and planar anchoring is
studied within the Frank--Oseen model. The combination of both chemical and
geometrical surface pattern leads to rich phase diagrams, involving a
homeotropic, a planar, and a tilted nematic texture. The effect of the groove
depth and the anchoring strengths on the location and the order of phase
transitions between different nematic textures is studied. A zenithally
bistable nematic device is investigated by confining a nematic liquid crystal
between the patterned grating surface and a flat substrate with strong
homeotropic anchoring.
