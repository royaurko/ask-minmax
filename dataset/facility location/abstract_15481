We have studied a sample of 28 periodically variable B-type supergiants
selected from the HIPPARCOS mission and 12 comparison stars covering the whole
B-type spectral range. Our goal is to test if their variability is compatible
with opacity-driven non-radial oscillations.
  We have used the NLTE atmosphere code FASTWIND to derive the atmospheric and
wind parameters of the complete sample through line profile fitting. We applied
the method to selected H, He and Si line profiles, measured with the high
resolution CES spectrograph attached to the ESO CAT telescope in La Silla,
Chile.
  From the location of the stars in the (log Teff, log g) diagram, we suggest
that variability of our sample supergiants is indeed due to the gravity modes
resulting from the opacity mechanism. We find nine of the comparison stars to
be periodically variable as well, and suggest them to be new alpha Cyg
variables. We find marginal evidence of a correlation between the amplitude of
the photometric variability and the wind density. We investigate the Wind
Momentum Luminosity Relation for the whole range of B spectral type
supergiants, and find that the later types (> B5) perfectly follow the relation
for A supergiants. Additionally, we provide a new spectral type - Teff
calibration for B supergiants.
  Our results imply the possibility to probe internal structure models of
massive stars of spectral type B through seismic tuning of gravity modes.
