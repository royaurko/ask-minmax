Rigid body dynamics algorithms play a crucial role in several components of a
robot controller and simulations. Real time constraints in high frequency
control loops and time requirements of specific applications demand these
functions to be very efficient. Despite the availability of established
algorithms, their efficient implementation for a specific robot still is a
tedious and error-prone task. However, these components are simply necessary to
get high performance controllers.
  To achieve efficient yet well maintainable implementations of dynamics
algorithms we propose to use a domain specific language to describe the
kinematics/dynamics model of a robot. Since the algorithms are parameterized on
this model, executable code tailored for a specific robot can be generated,
thanks to the facilities available for \dsls. This approach allows the users to
deal only with the high level description of their robot and relieves them from
problematic hand-crafted development; resources and efforts can then be focused
on open research questions.
  Preliminary results about the generation of efficient code for inverse
dynamics will be presented as a proof of concept of this approach.
