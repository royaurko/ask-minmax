We have imaged a sample of 20 spiral galaxies in H$\alpha$ and in the
near-infrared K band (2.2 um), in order to determine the location and strength
of star formation in these objects with respect to perturbations in the old
stellar population. We have found that star formation rates are significantly
enhanced in the vicinity of K band arms. We have also found that this
enhancement in star formation rate in arm regions correlates well with a
quantity that measures the relative strengths of shocks in arms. Assuming that
the K band light is dominated by emission from the old stellar population, this
shows that density waves trigger star formation in the vicinity of spiral arms.
