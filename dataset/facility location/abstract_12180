We present a modular rack-mounted laser system for the cooling and
manipulation of neutral rubidium atoms which has been developed for a portable
gravimeter based on atom interferometry that will be capable of performing high
precision gravity measurements directly at sites of geophysical interest. This
laser system is constructed in a compact and mobile design so that it can be
transported to different locations, yet it still offers improvements over many
conventional laboratory-based laser systems. Our system is contained in a
standard 19" rack and emits light at five different frequencies simultaneously
on up to 12 fibre ports at a total output power of 800 mW. These frequencies
can be changed and switched between ports in less than a microsecond. The setup
includes two phase-locked diode lasers with a phase noise spectral density of
less than 1 \mu rad/sqrt(Hz) in the frequency range in which our gravimeter is
most sensitive to noise. We characterize this laser system and evaluate the
performance limits it imposes on an interferometer.
