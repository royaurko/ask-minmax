The Living Earth Simulator (LES) is one of the core components of the
FuturICT architecture. It will work as a federation of methods, tools,
techniques and facilities supporting all of the FuturICT simulation-related
activities to allow and encourage interactive exploration and understanding of
societal issues. Society-relevant problems will be targeted by leaning on
approaches based on complex systems theories and data science in tight
interaction with the other components of FuturICT. The LES will evaluate and
provide answers to real-world questions by taking into account multiple
scenarios. It will build on present approaches such as agent-based simulation
and modeling, multiscale modelling, statistical inference, and data mining,
moving beyond disciplinary borders to achieve a new perspective on complex
social systems.
