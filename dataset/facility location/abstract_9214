The central region of the Galaxy has been observed at 580, 620 and 1010 MHz
with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). We detect emission from
Sgr-A*, the compact object at the dynamical centre of the Galaxy, and estimate
its flux density at 620 MHz to be 0.5 +/- 0.1 Jy. This is the first detection
of Sgr A* below 1 GHz (Roy & Rao 2002, 2003), which along with a possible
detection at 330 MHz (Nord et al. 2004) provides its spectrum below 1 GHz.
Comparison of the 620 MHz map with maps made at other frequencies indicates
that most parts of the Sgr A West HII region have optical depth 2. However, Sgr
A*, which is seen in the same region in projection, shows a slightly inverted
spectral index between 1010 MHz and 620 MHz. This is consistent with its high
frequency spectral index, and indicates that Sgr A* is located in front of the
Sgr A West complex, and rules out any low frequency turnover around 1 GHz, as
suggested by Davies et al. (1976).
