Recently, a trace formula for non-self-adjoint periodic Schr\"odinger
operators in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ associated with Dirichlet eigenvalues was proved
in [9]. Here we prove a corresponding trace formula associated with Neumann
eigenvalues.
  In addition we investigate Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of such
operators. In particular, using the Dirichlet and Neumann trace formulas we
provide detailed information on location of the Dirichlet and Neumann
eigenvalues for the model operator with the potential $Ke^{2ix}$, where
$K\in\mathbb{C}$.
