Unsteady aerodynamic models are necessary to accurately simulate forces and
develop feedback controllers for wings in agile motion; however, these models
are often high dimensional or incompatible with modern control techniques.
Recently, reduced-order unsteady aerodynamic models have been developed for a
pitching and plunging airfoil by linearizing the discretized Navier-Stokes
equation with lift-force output. In this work, we extend these reduced-order
models to include multiple inputs (pitch, plunge, and surge) and explicit
parameterization by the pitch-axis location, inspired by Theodorsen's model.
Next, we investigate the na\"{\i}ve application of system identification
techniques to input--output data and the resulting pitfalls, such as unstable
or inaccurate models. Finally, robust feedback controllers are constructed
based on these low-dimensional state-space models for simulations of a rigid
flat plate at Reynolds number 100. Various controllers are implemented for
models linearized at base angles of attack $\alpha_0=0^\circ,
\alpha_0=10^\circ$, and $\alpha_0=20^\circ$. The resulting control laws are
able to track an aggressive reference lift trajectory while attenuating sensor
noise and compensating for strong nonlinearities.
