We investigate what we can learn about galaxy formation and evolution from
the data which will be obtained by the forthcoming large
submillimeter/millimeter facilities, mainly by the Atacama Submillimeter
Telescope Experiment (ASTE) and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array/Large
Millimeter and Submillimeter Array (ALMA/LMSA). We first calculate the source
counts from 350 um to 3 mm using the empirical infrared galaxy number count
model of Takeuchi et al. (2001). Based on the number counts, we evaluate the
source confusion and determine the confusion limit at various wavebands as a
function of the characteristic beam size. At submillimeter wavelengths, source
confusion with the 10-15-m class facilities becomes severe at 0.1 to 1 mJy
level, and astrometry and flux measurements will be difficult. However, we show
that very a large-area survey of submillimeter sources brighter than 10-50 mJy
can provide a unique constraint on infrared galaxy evolution at z = 1-2. We
also find that the 5\sigma-confusion limit of the LMSA is fainter than 1 \mu
Jy. The source counts at such faint flux levels give important information of
the epoch of galaxy formation. We then show that multiband photometry from the
infrared (by ASTRO-F) to the millimeter can be utilized as a redshift
estimator. In addition, we compare the observed 1.4, 5, and 8-GHz source counts
with our model counts to examine the contribution of star forming galaxies to
the faint radio galaxies.
