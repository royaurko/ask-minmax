In mean field approximation, we study a nontopological soliton of Polyakov
Quark Meson Model in the presence of fermionic vacuum term with two flavors at
finite temperature and density. The behavior of the effective potential
evolving with temperature supports the existence of the stable soliton solution
as long as $T\leq T_{\chi}^c$ for both crossover and first-order phase
transition, and these solutions are calculated with some appropriate boundary
conditions. However, it is found that only if $T\leq T^c_d$, the energy of the
soliton $M_N$ is less than the energy of three free constituent quarks $3M_q$.
As $T> T^c_d$, there is a instant delocalization phase transition from hadron
matter to quark matter. The phase diagram together with the location of
critical end point (CEP) has been obtained in $T$ and $\mu$ plane. We notice
that two critical temperatures always satisfy $T^c_d\leq T_{\chi}^c$. In the
end, we present and compare the result for temperature variation of
thermodynamic pressure at zero chemical potential with lattice data.
