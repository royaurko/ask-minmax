The galaxy NGC1313 has attracted the attention of various studies due to the
peculiar morphology observed in optical bands, although it is classified as a
barred, late-type galaxy with no apparent close-by companions. However, the
velocity field suggests an interaction with a satellite companion. Using
resolved stellar populations, we study different parts of the galaxy to
understand further its morphology. Based on HST/ACS images, we estimated star
formation histories by means of the synthetic CMD method in different areas in
the galaxy. Incompleteness limits our analysis to ages younger than ~100Myr.
Stars in the red and blue He burning phases are used to trace the distribution
of recent star formation. Star formation histories suggest a burst in the
southern-west region. We support the idea that NGC1313 is experiencing an
interaction with a satellite companion, observed as a tidally disrupted
satellite galaxy in the south-west of NGC1313. However, we do not observe any
indication of a perturbation due to the interaction with the satellite galaxy
at other locations across the galaxy, suggesting that only a modest-sized
companion that did not trigger a global starburst was involved.
