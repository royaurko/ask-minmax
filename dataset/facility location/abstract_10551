We describe the implementation of algorithms to construct and maintain
three-dimensional dynamic Delaunay triangulations with kinetic vertices using a
three-simplex data structure. The code is capable of constructing the geometric
dual, the Voronoi or Dirichlet tessellation. Initially, a given list of points
is triangulated. Time evolution of the triangulation is not only governed by
kinetic vertices but also by a changing number of vertices. We use
three-dimensional simplex flip algorithms, a stochastic visibility walk
algorithm for point location and in addition, we propose a new simple method of
deleting vertices from an existing three-dimensional Delaunay triangulation
while maintaining the Delaunay property. The dual Dirichlet tessellation can be
used to solve differential equations on an irregular grid, to define partitions
in cell tissue simulations, for collision detection etc.
