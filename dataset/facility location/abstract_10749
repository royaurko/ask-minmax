In this paper we derive uniform asymptotic expansions for the partial sums of
the exponential series. We indicate how this information will be used in a
later publication to obtain full and explicitly computable asymptotic
expansions with error bounds for all zeros of the Taylor polynomials
$p_{n-1}(z) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} z^k/ k!$. Our proof is based on a representation
of $p_{n-1}(nz)$ in terms of an integral of the form $\int_{\gamma}
\frac{e^{n\phi(s)}}{s-z}ds$. We demonstrate how to derive uniform expansions
for such integrals using a Riemann-Hilbert approach. A comparison with
classical steepest descent analysis shows the advantages of the Riemann-Hilbert
analysis in particular for points $z$ that are close to the critical points of
$\phi$.
