This report summarises the conclusions from the detector group of the
International Scoping Study of a future Neutrino Factory and Super-Beam
neutrino facility. The baseline detector options for each possible neutrino
beam are defined as follows:
  1. A very massive (Megaton) water Cherenkov detector is the baseline option
for a sub-GeV Beta Beam and Super Beam facility.
  2. There are a number of possibilities for either a Beta Beam or Super Beam
(SB) medium energy facility between 1-5 GeV. These include a totally active
scintillating detector (TASD), a liquid argon TPC or a water Cherenkov
detector.
  3. A 100 kton magnetized iron neutrino detector (MIND) is the baseline to
detect the wrong sign muon final states (golden channel) at a high energy
(20-50 GeV) neutrino factory from muon decay. A 10 kton hybrid neutrino
magnetic emulsion cloud chamber detector for wrong sign tau detection (silver
channel) is a possible complement to MIND, if one needs to resolve degeneracies
that appear in the $\delta$-$\theta_{13}$ parameter space.
