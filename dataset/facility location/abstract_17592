The UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey (GPS) began in 2005 as a 7 year effort to
survey ~1800 square degrees of the northern Galactic plane in the J, H, and K
passbands. The survey included a second epoch of K band data, with a baseline
of 2 to 8 years, for the purpose of investigating variability and measuring
proper motions. We have calculated proper motions for 167 Million sources in a
900 square degree area located at l > 60 degrees in order to search for new
high proper motion objects. Visual inspection has verified 617 high proper
motion sources (> 200 mas/yr) down to K=17, of which 153 are new discoveries.
Among these we have a new spectroscopically confirmed T5 dwarf, an additional T
dwarf with estimated type T6, 13 new L dwarf candidates, and two new common
proper motion systems containing ultracool dwarf candidates. We provide
improved proper motions for an additional 12 high proper motion stars that were
independently discovered in the WISE dataset during the course of this
investigation.
