Neutron capture cross sections of unstable isotopes are important for neutron
induced nucleosynthesis as well as for technological applications. A
combination of a radioactive beam facility, an ion storage ring and a high flux
reactor would allow a direct measurement of neutron induced reactions over a
wide energy range on isotopes with half lives down to minutes.
