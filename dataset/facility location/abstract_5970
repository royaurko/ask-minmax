Showing that the location of the zeros of the partition function can be used
to study phase transitions, Yang and Lee initiated an ambitious and very
fruitful approach. We give an overview of the results obtained using this
approach. After an elementary introduction to the Yang-Lee formalism, we
summarize results concerning equilibrium phase transitions. We also describe
recent attempts and breakthroughs in extending this theory to nonequilibrium
phase transitions.
