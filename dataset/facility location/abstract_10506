The possibility of obsevation of supernarrow dibaryons with symmetric wave
function in reactions $\gamma +d to \pi^+ +\gamma +nn$ and $\gamma +d to \pi^-
+\gamma +pp$ is studied. These dibaryons satisfy the condition $(-1)^{T+S}P=+1$
(where T is the isospin, S is the internal spin and P is the dibaryon parity)
and their decay into two nucleons is suppressed by the Pauly principle. In the
present paper the method of a dibaryon masses reconstruction over the dibaryon
decay products (\gamma nn) and (\gamma pp) is analysed. The Monte-Carlo
simulation is used to choose the optimal location of the detectors, to estimate
the contribution of the main background processes and to calculate the expected
yields of the dibaryon production. It is shown that 100 hours of the exposition
time at the microtron MAMI (Mainz) is quite enough to determine whether or not
the supernarrow dibaryons with symmetric wave function exist.
