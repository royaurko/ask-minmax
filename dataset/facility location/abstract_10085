A perturbing shell is introduced as a device for studying the excitation of
fluid motions in relativistic stellar models. We show that this approach allows
a reasonably clean separation of radiation from the shell and from fluid
motions in the star, and provides broad flexibility in the location and
timescale of perturbations driving the fluid motions. With this model we
compare the relativistic and Newtonian results for the generation of even
parity gravitational waves from constant density models. Our results suggest
that relativistic effects will not be important in computations of the
gravitational emission except possibly in the case of excitation of the neutron
star on very short time scales.
