We report INTEGRAL/IBIS results on temporal and spectral behaviour of the Low
Mass X-ray Binary XB 1832-330 located in the globular cluster NGC 6652. During
the 2003-2005 monitoring of the Galactic Centre, the source shows a weak flux
variability and an everage flux in the 20-150 keV of about 2*10^{-10} erg
s^{-1} cm^{-2}. The overall energy spectrum extends up to 150 keV and is well
described by a Comptonization model with an electrons temperature of $\sim$ 22
keV and a plasma optical depth of 1.8. We thus confirm the persistent nature of
this burtser.
