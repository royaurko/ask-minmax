The possibility to determine the axial strange form factor of the nucleon
from neutrino scattering experiments is studied. The existing experimental
information is reviewed and several related observables which could be measured
in the near future at new neutrino facilities are studied in detail. Elastic
scattering from S=T=0 nuclei is also briefly considered.
