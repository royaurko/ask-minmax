Over the past couple of years, the extent of the services provided on the
mobile devices has increased rapidly. A special class of service among them is
the Location Based Service(LBS) which depends on the geographical position of
the user to provide services to the end users. However, a mobile device is
still resource constrained, and some applications usually demand more resources
than a mobile device can a ord. To alleviate this, a mobile device should get
resources from an external source. One of such sources is cloud computing
platforms. We can predict that the mobile area will take on a boom with the
advent of this new concept. The aim of this paper is to exchange messages
between user and location service provider in mobile device accessing the cloud
by minimizing cost, data storage and processing power. Our main goal is to
provide dynamic location-based service and increase the information retrieve
accuracy especially on the limited mobile screen by accessing cloud
application. In this paper we present location based restaurant information
retrieval system and we have developed our application in Android.
