We report new precision p(e,e' pi+})n measurements in the Delta(1232)
resonance at Q2 = 0.127(GeV/c)2 obtained at the MIT-Bates Out-Of-Plane
scattering facility. These are the lowest, but non-zero, Q2 measurements in the
pi+ channel. The data offer new tests of the theoretical calculations,
particularly of the background amplitude contributions. The chiral effective
field theory and Sato-Lee model calculations are not in agreement with this
experiment.
