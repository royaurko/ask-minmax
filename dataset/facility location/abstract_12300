We investigate the critical properties of the two-dimensional Z(5) vector
model. For this purpose, we propose a new cluster algorithm, valid for Z(N)
models with odd values of N. The two-dimensional Z(5) vector model is
conjectured to exhibit two phase transitions with a massless intermediate
phase. We locate the position of the critical points and study the critical
behavior across both phase transitions in details. In particular, we determine
various critical indices and compare the results with analytical predictions.
