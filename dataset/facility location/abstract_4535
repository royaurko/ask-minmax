We present simple calculations which show that incommensurability upon doping
and the width of the magnetically ordered phase in Mott-Hubbard insulators
depend strongly on the location of the hole/electron pockets in the Brillouin
zone. For $LaSrCuO$ systems, we found the pockets at $(\pm \pi/2,\pm \pi/2)$,
in which case the corrections to the antiferromagnetic spin stiffness grow with
doping and destroy the commensurate antiferromagnetic ordering already at a
very small doping. On the other hand, in $NdCeCuO$, the hole pockets are
located at $(\pi,0)$ and the symmetry related points, in which case the
corrections to the stiffness scale linearly with the density of carriers and do
not destroy commensurate spin ordering. For $YBCuO$, systems the situation is
less certain, but our results favor hole pockets at $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$. We also
discuss briefly the tendency towards phase separation.
