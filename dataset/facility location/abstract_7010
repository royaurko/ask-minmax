Radio interferometers observe the Fourier space of the sky, at locations
determined by the array geometry. Before a real space image is constructed by a
Fourier transform, the data is weighted to improve the quality of
reconstruction. Two criteria for calculation of weights are maximizing
sensitivity and minimizing point spread function (PSF) sidelobe levels. In this
paper, we propose a novel weighting scheme suitable for ultra deep imaging
experiments. The proposed weighting scheme is used to maximize sensitivity
while minimizing PSF sidelobe variation across frequency and multiple epochs.
We give simulation results that show the superiority of the proposed scheme
compared with commonly used weighting schemes in achieving these objectives.
