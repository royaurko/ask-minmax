We analyze numerically how the voltage-current (V-I) characteristics near the
so-called Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition of 2D
superconductors are affected by a random spatial Gaussian distribution of
critical temperature inhomogeneities with long characteristic lengths (much
larger than the in-plane superconducting coherence length amplitude). Our
simulations allow to quantify the broadening around the average BKT transition
temperature of both the exponent alpha in V I^alpha and of the resistance V/I.
These calculations reveal that strong spatial redistributions of the local
current will occur around the transition as either I or the temperature T are
varied. Our results also support that the condition alpha=3 provides a good
estimate for the location of the average BKT transition temperature, and that
extrapolating to alpha->1 the alpha(T) behaviour well below the transition
provides a good estimate for the average mean-field critical temperature.
