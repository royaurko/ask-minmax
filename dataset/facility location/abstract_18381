We report on two BeppoSAX observations of BL Lac (2200+420) performed
respectively in June and December 1999, as part of a ToO program to monitor
blazars in high states of activity. During both runs the source has been
detected up to 100 keV, but it showed quite different spectra: in June it was
concave with a very hard component above 5-6 keV (alpha_1 ~ 1.6; alpha_2 ~
0.15); in December it was well fitted by a single power law (alpha ~ 0.6).
During the first BeppoSAX observation BL Lac showed an astonishing variability
episode: the 0.3 - 2 keV flux doubled in ~ 20 minutes, while the flux above 4
keV was almost constant. This frequency-dependent event is one of the shortest
ever recordered for BL Lac objects and places lower limits on the dimension and
the magnetic field of the emitting region and on the energy of the synchrotron
radiating electrons. A similar but less extreme behaviour is detected also in
optical light curves, that display non-simultaneous, smaller fluctuations of ~
20% in 20 min. We fit the spectral energy distributions with a homogeneous,
one-zone model to constrain the emission region in a very simple but effective
SSC + external Compton scenario, highlightning the importance of the location
of the emitting region with respect to the Broad Line Region and the relative
spectral shape dependence. We compare our data with historical radio to
gamma-ray Spectral Energy Distributions.
