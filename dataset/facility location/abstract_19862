We present single-dish and VLBI observations of an outburst of water maser
emission from the young binary system Haro 6-10. Haro 6-10 lies in the Taurus
molecular cloud and contains a visible T Tauri star with an infrared companion
1.3" north. Using the Very Long Baseline Array, we obtained five observations
spanning 3 months and derived absolute positions for 20 distinct maser spots.
Three of the masers can be traced over 3 or more epochs, enabling us to extract
absolute proper motions and tangential velocities. We deduce that the masers
represent one side of a bipolar outflow that lies nearly in the plane of the
sky with an opening angle of ~45\deg. They are located within 50 mas of the
southern component of the binary, the visible T Tauri star Haro 6-10S. The mean
position angle on the sky of the maser proper motions (~220\deg) suggests they
are related to the previously observed giant Herbig-Haro (HH) flow which
includes HH410, HH411, HH412, and HH184A-E. A previously observed HH jet and
extended radio continuum emission (mean position angle of ~190\deg) must also
originate in the vicinity of Haro6-10S and represent a second, distinct outflow
in this region. We propose that a yet unobserved companion within 150 mas of
Haro6-10S is responsible for the giant HH/maser outflow while the visible star
is associated with the HH jet. Despite the presence of H_2 emission in the
spectrum of the northern component of the binary, Haro6-10N, none of
outflows/jets can be tied directly to this young stellar object.
