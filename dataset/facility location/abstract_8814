We report significant associated clustering in the field of a z=1.226 quasar
from the Clowes-Campusano LQG in the form of both a factor ~11 overdensity of
I-K>3.75 galaxies and red sequences of 15-18 galaxies at I-K~4.3, V-K~6.9
indicative of a population of massive ellipticals at the quasar redshift. The
quasar is located between two groups of these galaxies, with further clustering
extending over 2-3 Mpc. A band of V-I<1 galaxies bisects the two groups of red
sequence galaxies, and we suggest that the merging of these two groups has
triggered both this band of star-formation and the quasar.
