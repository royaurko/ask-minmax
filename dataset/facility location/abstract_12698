High rate sampling detectors measuring the potential difference between the
main body and boom antennas of interplanetary spacecraft have been shown to be
efficient means to measure the voltage pulses induced by nano dust impacts on
the spacecraft body itself (see Meyer-Vernet et al, Solar Phys. 256, 463
(2009)). However, rough estimates of the free charge liberated in post impact
expanding plasma cloud indicate that the cloud's own internal electrostatic
field is too weak to account for measured pulses as the ones from the TDS
instrument on the STEREO spacecraft frequently exceeding 0.1 V/m. In this paper
we argue that the detected pulses are not a direct measure of the potential
structure of the plasma cloud, but are rather the consequence of a transitional
interruption of the photoelectron return current towards the portion of the
antenna located within the expanding cloud.
