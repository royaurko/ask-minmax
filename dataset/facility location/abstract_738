The universe provides numerous extremely interesting astrophysical sources of
synchrotron X radiation. The Chandra X-ray Observatory and other X-ray missions
provide powerful probes of these and other cosmic X-ray sources. Chandra is the
X-ray component of NASA's Great Observatory Program which also includes the
Hubble Space telescope, the Spitzer Infrared Telescope Facility, and the now
defunct Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory. The Chandra X-Ray Observatory provides
the best angular resolution (sub-arcsecond) of any previous, current, or
planned (for the foreseeable near future) space-based X-ray instrumentation. We
present here a brief overview of the technical capability of this X-Ray
observatory and some of the remarkable discoveries involving cosmic synchrotron
sources.
