Understanding the universe is hampered by the elusiveness of its most common
constituent, cold dark matter. Almost impossible to observe, dark matter can be
studied effectively by means of simulation and there is probably no other
research field where simulation has led to so much progress in the last decade.
Cosmological N-body simulations are an essential tool for evolving density
perturbations in the nonlinear regime. Simulating the formation of large-scale
structures in the universe, however, is still a challenge due to the enormous
dynamic range in spatial and temporal coordinates, and due to the enormous
computer resources required. The dynamic range is generally dealt with by the
hybridization of numerical techniques. We deal with the computational
requirements by connecting two supercomputers via an optical network and make
them operate as a single machine. This is challenging, if only for the fact
that the supercomputers of our choice are separated by half the planet, as one
is located in Amsterdam and the other is in Tokyo. The co-scheduling of the two
computers and the 'gridification' of the code enables us to achieve a 90%
efficiency for this distributed intercontinental supercomputer.
