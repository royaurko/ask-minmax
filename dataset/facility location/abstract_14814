Here we present three-dimensional MHD models for the Parker instability in a
thick magnetized disk, including the presence of a spiral arm. The $B$-field is
assumed parallel to the arm, and the model results are applied to the optical
segment of the Carina-Sagittarius arm. The characteristic features of the
undular and interchange modes are clearly apparent in the simulations. The
undular mode creates large gas concentrations distributed along the arm. This
results in a clear arm/inter-arm difference: the instability triggers the
formation of large interstellar clouds inside the arms, but generates only
small structures with slight density enhancements in the inter-arm regions. The
resulting clouds are distributed in an antisymmetric way with respect to the
midplane, creating an azimuthal corrugation along the arm. For conditions
similar to those of the optical segment of the Carina-Sagittarius arm, it has a
wavelength of about 2.4 kpc. This structuring can explain the origin of both HI
superclouds and the azimuthal corrugations in spiral arms. The wavelength
matches the corrugation length derived with the young stellar groups located in
the optical segment of the Carina-Sagittarius arm. Keywords: Galaxy: kinematics
