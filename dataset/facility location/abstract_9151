We present a mid-infrared study of NGC 3576. The high-resolution images were
taken at the Gemini South Observatory through narrow and broad band filters
centered between 7.9 micron and 18 micron. The nearly diffraction limited
images show IRS 1 resolved into 4 sources for the first time in the 10 micron
band. The positions of the sources are coincident with massive young stellar
objects detected previously in the near infrared. The properties of each
object, such as spectral energy distribution, silicate absorption feature,
color temperature and luminosities were obtained and are discussed. We also
report observations of two other YSO candidates and the detection of a new
diffuse MIR source without a NIR counterpart. We conclude that none of these
sources contributes significantly to the ionization of the HII region. A
possible location for the ionization source of NGC 3576 is suggested based on
both radio and infrared data.
