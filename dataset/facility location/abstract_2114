Scaling relations are salient ingredients of galaxy evolution and formation
models. I summarize results from the IMAGES survey, which combines
spatially-resolved kinematics from FLAMES/GIRAFFE with imaging from HST/ACS and
other facilities. Specifically, I will focus on the evolution of the stellar
mass and baryonic Tully-Fisher Relations (TFR) from z=0.6 down to z=0. We found
a significant evolution in zero point and scatter of the stellar mass TFR
compared to the local Universe. Combined with gas fractions derived by
inverting the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we derived for the first time a
baryonic TFR at high redshift. Conversely to the stellar mass TFR, the baryonic
relation does not appear to evolve in zero point, which suggests that most of
the reservoir of gas converted into stars over the past 6 Gyr was already
gravitationally bound to galaxies at z=0.6.
