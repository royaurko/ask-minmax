The generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) model allows for an unified description
of the recent accelerated expansion of the Universe and the evolution of energy
density perturbations. This dark energy - dark matter unification is achieved
through an exotic background fluid whose equation of state is given by $p = -
A/\rho^{\alpha}$, where $A$ is a positive constant and $0 < \alpha \le 1$.
Stringent constraints on the model parameters can be obtained from recent WMAP
and BOOMERanG bounds on the locations of the first few peaks and troughs of the
Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) power spectrum as well as SNe Ia
data.
