The new project GENIUS will cover a wide range of the parameter space of
predictions of SUSY for neutralinos as cold dark matter. Further it has the
potential to be a real-time detector for low-energy (pp and 7Be) solar
neutrinos. A GENIUS Test Facility has just been funded and will come into
operation by end of 2002.
