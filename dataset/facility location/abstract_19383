Gliese 436 is an M dwarf with a mass of 0.45 Msun and hosts the extrasolar
planet GL 436b [3, 6, 7, 2], which is currently the least massive transiting
planet with a mass of ~23.17 Mearth [10], and the only planet known to transit
an M dwarf. GL 436b represents the first transiting detection of the class of
extrasolar planets known as "Hot Neptunes" that have masses within a few times
that of Neptune's mass (~17 Mearth) and orbital semimajor axis <0.1 AU about
the host star. Unlike most other known transiting extrasolar planets, GL 436b
has a high eccentricity (e~0.16). This brings to light a new parameter space
for habitability zones of extrasolar planets with host star masses much smaller
than typical stars of roughly a solar mass. This unique system is an ideal
candidate for orbital perturbation and transit-time variation (TTV) studies to
detect smaller, possibly Earth-mass planets in the system. In April 2008 we
began a long-term intensive campaign to obtain complete high-precision light
curves using the Apache Point Observatory's 3.5-meter telescope, NMSU's 1-meter
telescope (located at APO), and Sommers Bausch Observatory's 24" telescope.
These light curves are being analyzed together, along with amateur and other
professional astronomer observations. Results of our analysis are discussed.
Continued measurements over the next few years are needed to determine if
additional planets reside in the system, and to study the impact of other
manifestations on the light curves, such as star spots and active regions.
