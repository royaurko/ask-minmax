We report the results of a blind search for 22-GHz water masers in two
regions, covering approximately half a square degree, within the giant
molecular cloud associated with RCW 106. The complete search of the two regions
was carried out with the 26-m Mount Pleasant radio telescope and resulted in
the detection of nine water masers, five of which are new detections. Australia
Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) observations of these detections have allowed us
to obtain positions with arcsecond accuracy, allowing meaningful comparison
with infrared and molecular data for the region. We find that for the regions
surveyed there are more water masers than either 6.7-GHz methanol, or main-line
OH masers. The water masers are concentrated towards the central axis of the
star formation region, in contrast to the 6.7-GHz methanol masers which tend to
be located near the periphery. The colours of the GLIMPSE point sources
associated with the water masers are similar to those of 6.7-GHz methanol
masers, but slightly less red. We have made a statistical investigation of the
properties of the 13CO and 1.2-mm dust clumps with and without associated water
masers. We find that the water masers are associated with the more massive,
denser and brighter 13CO and 1.2-mm dust clumps. We present statistical models
that are able to predict those 13CO and 1.2-mm dust clumps that are likely to
have associated water masers, with a low misclassification rate.
