We present UBVRIz lightcurves of the Type Ia SN 1999ee and the Type Ib/c SN
1999ex, both located in the galaxy IC 5179. SN 1999ee has an extremely well
sampled lightcurve spanning from 10 days before Bmax through 53 days after
peak. Near maximum we find systematic differences ~0.05 mag in photometry
measured with two different telescopes, even though the photometry is reduced
to the same local standards around the supernova using the specific color terms
for each instrumental system. We use models for our bandpasses and
spectrophotometry of SN 1999ee to derive magnitude corrections (S-corrections)
and remedy this problem. This exercise demonstrates the need of accurately
characterizing the instrumental system before great photometric accuracies of
Type Ia supernovae can be claimed. It also shows that this effect can have
important astrophysical consequences since a small systematic shift of 0.02 mag
in the B-V color can introduce a 0.08 mag error in the extinction corrected
peak B magnitudes of a supernova and thus lead to biased cosmological
parameters. The data for the Type Ib/c SN 1999ex present us with the first ever
observed shock breakout of a supernova of this class. These observations show
that shock breakout occurred 18 days before Bmax and support the idea that Type
Ib/c supernovae are due to core collapse of massive stars rather than
thermonuclear disruption of white dwarfs.
