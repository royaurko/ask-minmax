We consider preprocessing a set $S$ of $n$ points in convex position in the
plane into a data structure supporting queries of the following form: given a
point $q$ and a directed line $\ell$ in the plane, report the point of $S$ that
is farthest from (or, alternatively, nearest to) the point $q$ among all points
to the left of line $\ell$. We present two data structures for this problem.
The first data structure uses $O(n^{1+\varepsilon})$ space and preprocessing
time, and answers queries in $O(2^{1/\varepsilon} \log n)$ time, for any $0 <
\varepsilon < 1$. The second data structure uses $O(n \log^3 n)$ space and
polynomial preprocessing time, and answers queries in $O(\log n)$ time. These
are the first solutions to the problem with $O(\log n)$ query time and $o(n^2)$
space.
  The second data structure uses a new representation of nearest- and
farthest-point Voronoi diagrams of points in convex position. This
representation supports the insertion of new points in clockwise order using
only $O(\log n)$ amortized pointer changes, in addition to $O(\log n)$-time
point-location queries, even though every such update may make $\Theta(n)$
combinatorial changes to the Voronoi diagram. This data structure is the first
demonstration that deterministically and incrementally constructed Voronoi
diagrams can be maintained in $o(n)$ amortized pointer changes per operation
while keeping $O(\log n)$-time point-location queries.
