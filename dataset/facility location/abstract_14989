We report on two XMM-Newton observations of the bright narrow-line Seyfert 1
galaxy Ark 564 taken one year apart (2000 June and 2001 June). The 0.6-10 keV
continuum is well described by a soft blackbody component (kT~140-150 eV) plus
a steep power law (Gamma~2.50-2.55). No significant spectral changes are
observed between the two observations, although the X-ray flux in the second
observation is ~40-50 per cent lower. In both observations we detect a
significant absorption edge at a rest-frame energy of ~0.73 keV, corresponding
to OVII. The presence of the absorption feature is confirmed by a simultaneous
Chandra grating observation in 2000 June, although the best-fitting edge
threshold is at a slightly lower energy in the Chandra data, possibly because
of a different parameterisation of the underlying X-ray continuum. We find
tentative evidence for a broad iron emission line in the 2000 June observation.
The results from an analysis of the power spectral density (PSD) function are
also presented. The present XMM-Newton data support the idea that the PSD shows
two breaks, although the location of the high-frequency break requires further
constraints.
