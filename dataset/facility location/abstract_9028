It was proposed by Blitz et al. (1999) that High Velocity Clouds (HVCs) are
remnants of Local Group formation and the average distance of HVCs is 1 Mpc,
which is the result of a simple dynamical calculation leading to match the
observed HVCs distributions. However, in this paper, we clearly show that
fitting the observed HVCs distributions by a dynamical calculation cannot
provide any constraints on the average distance of HVCs.
 With our choices of initial conditions, the observational results in Wakker &
van Woerden (1991) are produced in our simulations for the models of both
Galactic and extragalactic origins. Moreover, because Zwaan & Briggs (2000)
reported that they failed to locate any extragalactic counterparts of the Local
Group HVCs in a blind HI 21-cm survey of extragalactic groups, we propose to
use ``remnants of galactic disc formation'' as the modification for the picture
of ``remnants of galaxy group formation'' in Blitz et al. (1999) and thus
reduce the possible average distances of HVCs to be about or less than a few
hundred kpc.
