The series of Uranium isotopes with $N=154 \sim 172$ around the magic number
N=162/164 are identified to be thermally fissile. The thermal neutron fission
of a typical representative $^{249}$U of this region amenable to synthesis in
the radioactive ion beam facilities is considered here. Semiempirical study of
fission barrier height and width shows this nucleus to be infinitely stable
against spontaneous fission due to increase in barrier width arising out of
excess neutrons. Calculation of probability of fragment mass yields and
microscopic study in relativistic mean field theory, show this nucleus to
undergo a new mode of thermal fission decay termed {\it multifragmentation
fission} where a number of prompt scission neutrons are simultaneously released
along with the two heavy fission fragments.
