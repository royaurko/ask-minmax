We analyze results of data processing of observations of well-known object
titled SS433 with the VLBA during more than 10 years. Data have been processed
with the software project titled 'Astro Space Locator' (ASL for Windows). The
Multi Frequency Synthesis (MFS) method has been used for reconstruction of
radio maps at 18 and 6 centimeter wavelength ranges (L and C ranges). High
quality images of SS433 for several epochs are presented. Evolution of its
radio structure is demonstrated. Astrophysical parameters of object and their
changes in time are discussed. Any polarization phenomena are not taken into
account. We present results of processing of data of RR polarization for all
the observational sessions
