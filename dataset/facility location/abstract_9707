We study the dynamic scaling properties of an aggregation model in which
particles obey both diffusive and driven ballistic dynamics. The diffusion
constant and the velocity of a cluster of size $s$ follow $D(s) \sim s^\gamma$
and $v(s) \sim s^\delta$, respectively. We determine the dynamic exponent and
the phase diagram for the asymptotic aggregation behavior in one dimension in
the presence of mixed dynamics. The asymptotic dynamics is dominated by the
process that has the largest dynamic exponent with a crossover that is located
at $\delta = \gamma - 1$. The cluster size distributions scale similarly in all
cases but the scaling function depends continuously on $\gamma$ and $\delta$.
For the purely diffusive case the scaling function has a transition from
exponential to algebraic behavior at small argument values as $\gamma$ changes
sign whereas in the drift dominated case the scaling function decays always
exponentially.
