We discuss the chiral phase transition of hot and dense quark matter. We
illustrate that the first-order phase transition is generally favored at high
baryon density and the repulsive vector-vector interaction weakens the
first-order phase transition. We use the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with the
Polyakov loop coupling for concreteness. We locate the QCD critical surface on
the quark mass plane for various values of the vector coupling constant. We
find that, with increasing quark chemical potential, the first-order region in
the quark mass plane could shrink for sufficiently large vector coupling. This
may be a possible explanation for the recent lattice QCD results by de Forcrand
and Philipsen.
