The T2K (Tokai to Kamioka) experiment is a second generation long baseline
neutrino oscillation experiment located in Japan. The main goal is to probe the
$\theta_{13}$ neutrino mixing parameter by looking for $\nu_{\mu}\to\nu_e$
transitions in an almost pure beam of muon neutrinos. The T2K utilizes the
neutirno beam produced at J-PARC (Tokai, Ibaraki) and Super-Kamiokande
(Kamioka, Gifu) is used as a far detector. The experiment has been in operation
since January 2010. After analyzing 1.43$\times10^{20}$ p.o.t. data collected
six events are observed in far detector while the expected number with sin$^2
2\theta_{13}$=0 is 1.5$\pm$0.3. Null oscillation hypotheis leads to
7$\times10^{-3}$ probability to observe six or more candidate events, which so
gives 2.5 $\sigma$ significance to the result. Thus the current T2K result is
an indication of $\nu_e$ appearance due to $\nu_{\mu}\to\nu_e$ transitions. As
for the first T2K $\nu_{\mu}$ disappearance data, the null oscillation
hypothesis is exluded at 4.5 $\sigma$ level and the estimated atmospheric
mixing parameters are consistent with the results from Super-Kamiokande and
MINOS experiments.
