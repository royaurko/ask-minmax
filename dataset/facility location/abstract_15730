One of the most challenging technical aspects of the dualities between string
theory on anti-de Sitter spaces and conformal field theories is understanding
how location in the interior of spacetime is represented in the field theory.
It has recently been argued that the interior of the spacetime can be directly
probed by using intrinsically non-local quantities in the field theory. In
addition, Balasubramanian and Ross [hep-th/9906226] argued that when the
spacetime described the formation of an AdS_3 black hole, the propagator in the
field theory probed the whole spacetime, including the region behind the
horizon. We use the same approach to study the propagator for the BTZ black
hole and a black hole solution with a single exterior region, and show that it
reproduces the propagator associated with the natural vacuum states on these
spacetimes. We compare our result with a toy model of the CFT for the
single-exterior black hole, finding remarkable agreement. The spacetimes
studied in this work are analytic, which makes them quite special. We also
discuss the interpretation of this propagator in more general spacetimes,
shedding light on certain issues involving causality, black hole horizons, and
products of local operators on the boundary.
