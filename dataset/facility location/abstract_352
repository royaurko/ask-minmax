A new experimental area designed to develop, test and verify muon ionization
cooling apparatus using the 400-MeV Fermilab Linac proton beam has been fully
installed and is presently being commissioned. Initially, this area was used
for cryogenic tests of liquid-hydrogen absorbers for the MUCOOL R&D program
and, now, for high-power beam tests of absorbers, high-gradient rf cavities in
the presence of magnetic fields (including gas-filled cavities), and other
prototype muon-cooling apparatus. The experimental scenarios being developed
for muon facilities involve collection, capture, and cooling of
large-emittance, high-intensity muon beams--~10**13 muons, so that conclusive
tests of the apparatus require full Linac beam, which is 1.6 x 10**13 p/pulse.
To support the muon cooling facility, this new primary beamline extracts and
transports beam directly from the Linac to the test facility. The design
concept for the MuCool facility is taken from an earlier proposal, but
modifications were necessary to accommodate high-intensity beam, cryogenics,
and the increased scale of the cooling experiments. Further, the different mode
of operation to provide precision line incorporates a specialized section and
utilizes a measurements of Linac beam parameters. This paper reports on the
technical details of the MuCool beamline for both modes.
