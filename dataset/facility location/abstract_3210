LMC2 has the highest X-ray surface brightness of all know supergiant shells
in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The X-ray emission peaks within the
ionized filaments that define the shell boundary, but also extends beyond the
southern border of LMC2 as an X-ray bright spur. ROSAT HRI images reveal the
X-ray emission from LMC2 and the spur to be truly diffuse, indicating a hot
plasma origin. We have obtained ROSAT PSPC and ASCA SIS spectra to study the
physical conditions of the hot gas interior to LMC2 and the spur. Raymond-Smith
thermal plasma model fits to the X-ray spectra, constrained by HI 21-cm
emission-line measurements of the column density, show the plasma temperature
of the hot gas interior of LMC2 to be kT = 0.1 - 0.7 keV and of the spur to be
kT = 0.1 - 0.5 keV. We have compared the physical conditions of the hot gas
interior to LMC2 with those of other supergiant shells, superbubbles, and
supernova remnants (SNRs) in the LMC. We find that our derived electron
densities for the hot gas inside LMC2 is higher than the value determined for
the supergiant shell LMC4, comparable to the value determined for the
superbubble N11, and lower than the values determined for the superbubble N44
and a number of SNRs.
