The isospin violating decay $f_1(1285)\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ has been studied at
VES facility. This study is based at the statistics acquired in $\pi^- Be$
interactions at 27, 36.6 and 41 GeV/c in diffractive reaction $\pi^- N \to (f_1
\pi^-) N$. The $f_1(1285) \to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ decay is observed. The ratio of
decay probabilities $BR(f_1(1285) \to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0)$ to $BR(f_1(1285) \to
\eta \pi^+\pi^-) \cdot BR(\eta \to \gamma\gamma)$ is $\sim\:1.4%$.
