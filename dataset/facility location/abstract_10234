We apply a recently proposed mechanism for predicting the weak mixing angle
to theories with TeV-size dimensions. "Reconstruction" of the associated moose
(or quiver) leads to theories which unify the electroweak forces into a five
dimensional SU(3) symmetry. Quarks live at an orbifold fixed point where SU(3)
breaks to the electroweak group. A variety of theories -- all sharing the same
successful prediction of the weak mixing angle -- emerges; they differ
primarily by the spatial location of the leptons and the absence or presence of
supersymmetry. A particularly interesting theory puts leptons in a
Konopinski-Mahmoud triplet and suppresses proton decay by placing quarks and
leptons on opposite fixed points.
