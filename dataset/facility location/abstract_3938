The FLASHForward project at DESY is a pioneering plasma-wakefield
acceleration experiment that aims to produce, in a few centimetres of ionised
hydrogen, beams with energy of order GeV that are of quality sufficient to be
used in a free-electron laser. The plasma wave will be driven by high-current
density electron beams from the FLASH linear accelerator and will explore both
external and internal witness-beam injection techniques. The plasma is created
by ionising a gas in a gas cell with a multi-TW laser system, which can also be
used to provide optical diagnostics of the plasma and electron beams due to the
<30 fs synchronisation between the laser and the driving electron beam. The
operation parameters of the experiment are discussed, as well as the scientific
program.
