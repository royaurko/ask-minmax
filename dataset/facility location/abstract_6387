We review the results of the microscopic approach to the calculation of the
anisotropy in the specific heat in unconventional superconductors under rotated
field. Treating vortex scattering on equal footing with the energy shift we
find that the electronic specific heat may have minima or maxima when the field
is aligned with the nodes, depending on the temperature and field range. We
discuss the influence of the paramagnetic limiting and Fermi surface shape on
the location of the inversion line.
