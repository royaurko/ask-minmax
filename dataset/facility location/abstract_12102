We present the observation of the decay B0 -> chi_c0K*0 as well as evidence
of B+ -> chi_c0K*+, with an 8.9 and a 3.6 standard deviation significance,
respectively, using a data sample of 454 million Y(4S) -> BB decays collected
with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II B meson factory located at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). The measured branching fractions are: B(B0 ->
chi_c0K*0) = (1.7 +/- 0.3 +/- 0.2) * 10^{-4} and B(B+ -> chi_c0K^*+) = (1.4 +/-
0.5 +/- 0.2) * 10^{-4}, where the first quoted errors are statistical and the
second are systematic. We obtain a branching fraction upper limit of B(B+ ->
chi_c0K*+) < 2.1 * 10^{-4} at the 90% confidence level.
