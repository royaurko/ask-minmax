We study the motion of charged test particles around a Kerr black hole
immersed in the asymptotically uniform magnetic field, concluding that
off-equatorial stable orbits are allowed in this system. Being interested in
dynamical properties of these astrophysically relevant orbits we employ rather
novel approach based on the analysis of recurrences of the system to the
vicinity of its previous states. We use recurrence plots (RPs) as a tool to
visualize recurrences of the trajectory in the phase space. Construction of RPs
is simple and straightforward regardless of the dimension of the phase space,
which is a major advantage of this approach when compared to the "traditional"
methods of the numerical analysis of dynamical systems (for instance the visual
survey of Poincar\'{e} surfaces of section, evaluation of the Lyapunov spectra
etc.). We show that RPs and their quantitative measures (obtained from
recurrence quantification analysis -- RQA) are powerful tools to detect
dynamical regime of motion (regular vs. chaotic) and precisely locate the
transitions between these regimes.
