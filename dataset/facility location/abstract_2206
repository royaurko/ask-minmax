Highly crystalline TiO2 nanostructures were prepared through a facile
inorganic acid-assisted hydrothermal treatment of hexagonal-structured
assemblies of nanocrystalline titiania templated by cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (Hex-ncTiO2/CTAB Nanoskeleton) as starting materials. All samples were
characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). The influence of hydrochloric acid concentration on the morphology,
crystalline and the formation of the nanostructures were investigated. We found
that the morphology and crystalline phase strongly depended on the hydrochloric
acid concentrations. More importantly, crystalline phase was closely related to
the morphology of TiO2 nanostructure. Nanoparticles were polycrystalline
anatase phase, and aligned nanorods were single crystalline rutile phase.
Possible formation mechanisms of TiO2 nanostructures with various crystalline
phases and morphologies were proposed.
