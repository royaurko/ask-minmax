In this contribution TMD evolution of azimuthal asymmetries, in particular of
the Sivers and double Collins asymmetries, is addressed. A comparison of the
scale dependence is made between asymmetries described with TMD factorization
at low transverse momentum and those described with collinear factorization at
high transverse momentum. Finally, the advantages of Bessel weighting are
discussed: convergence of transverse momentum integrals, suppression of large
transverse momentum contributions, and well-defined lattice QCD evaluations of
Bessel-weighted TMDs including proper gauge links.
