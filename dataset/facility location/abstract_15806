We consider a rotator whose equation of motion for the angle $\theta$
consists of the zeroth and first Fourier modes. Numerical analysis based on the
trailing of saddle-node bifurcations is used to locate the n:1 Arnold tongues
where synchronization occurs. Several of them are wide enough for high-order
synchronization to be seen in passive observations. By sweeping the system
parameters within a certain range, we find that the stronger the dependence of
$\dot\theta$ on $\theta$, the wider the regions of synchronization. Use of a
synchronization index reveals a vast number of very narrow n:m Arnold tongues.
A competition phenomenon among the tongues is observed, in that they "push" and
"squeeze" one another: as some tongues widen, others narrow. Two mechanisms for
transitions between different n:m synchronization states are considered: slow
variation of the driving frequency, and the influence of low-frequency noise on
the rotator.
