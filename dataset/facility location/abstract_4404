In this paper we present LocLinkVis (Locate-Link-Visualize); a system which
supports exploratory information access to a document collection based on
geo-referencing and visualization. It uses a gazetteer which contains
representations of places ranging from countries to buildings, and that is used
to recognize toponyms, disambiguate them into places, and to visualize the
resulting spatial footprints.
