The Simultaneous Medicina-{\it Planck} Experiment (SiMPlE) is aimed at
observing a selected sample of 263 extragalactic and Galactic sources with the
Medicina 32-m single dish radio telescope in the same epoch as the Planck
satellite observations. The data acquired with a frequency coverage down to 5
GHz, also combined with Planck at frequencies above 30 GHz, will constitute a
useful reference catalogue of bright sources over the whole Northern
hemisphere. Furthermore, source observations performed in different epochs and
comparison with other catalogues allow the investigation of source
variabilities on different timescales. In this work, we describe the sample
selection, the on-going data acquisition campaign, the data reduction
procedures, the developed tools, and the comparison with other data-sets. We
present the data at 5 and 8.3 GHz for the SiMPlE Northern Sample consisting of
79 sources with $\delta \geq 45^\circ$ selected in our catalogue and observed
during the first 6 months of the project. A first analysis of their spectral
behaviour and long-term variability is also presented.
