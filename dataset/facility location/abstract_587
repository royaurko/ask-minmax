The recent advent in the field of multimedia proposed a many facilities in
transport, transmission and manipulation of data. Along with this advancement
of facilities there are larger threats in authentication of data, its licensed
use and protection against illegal use of data. A lot of digital image
watermarking techniques have been designed and implemented to stop the illegal
use of the digital multimedia images. This paper compares the robustness of
three different watermarking schemes against brightness and rotation attacks.
The robustness of the watermarked images has been verified on the parameters of
PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio), RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAE (Mean
Absolute Error).
