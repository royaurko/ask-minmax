Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) chambers will constitute the large majority of
precision detectors in the Muon Spectrometer of the ATLAS experiment at the
Large Hadron Collider at CERN. For commissioning and calibration of MDT
chambers, a Cosmic Ray Measurement Facility is in operation at Munich
University. The objectives of this facility are to test the chambers and
on-chamber electronics, to map the positions of the anode wires within the
chambers with the precision needed for standalone muon momentum measurement in
ATLAS, and to gain experience in the operation of the chambers and on-line
calibration procedures.
  Until the start of muon chamber installation in ATLAS, 88 chambers built at
the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich have to be commissioned and
calibrated. With a data taking period of one day individual wire positions can
be measured with an accuracy of 8.3 micrometers in the chamber plane and 27
micrometers in the direction perpendicular to that plane.
