We review our current understanding of how the first galaxies formed at the
end of the cosmic dark ages, a few 100 million years after the Big Bang. Modern
large telescopes discovered galaxies at redshifts greater than seven, whereas
theoretical studies have just reached the degree of sophistication necessary to
make meaningful predictions. A crucial ingredient is the feedback exerted by
the first generation of stars, through UV radiation, supernova blast waves, and
chemical enrichment. The key goal is to derive the signature of the first
galaxies to be observed with upcoming or planned next-generation facilities,
such as the James Webb Space Telescope or Atacama Large Millimeter Array. From
the observational side, ongoing deep-field searches for very high-redshift
galaxies begin to provide us with empirical constraints on the nature of the
first galaxies.
