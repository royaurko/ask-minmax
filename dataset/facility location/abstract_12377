The ANTARES Collaboration has completed in 2008 the deployment of what is
currently the largest high energy neutrino detector in the Northern hemisphere.
The search for cosmic neutrinos in the energy range between tens of GeV and
tens of PeV is performed by means of a three dimensional array of
photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), arranged on 12 vertical structures (strings)
located in the Mediterranean Sea at a depth of about 2500 meters. The detection
principle relies on the identification of the Cherenkov light produced as
ultra-relativistic muons propagate in water. The main goal of the detector is
the search for point-like sources of cosmic neutrinos from both Galactic and
extra-Galactic sources. Besides the search for point sources, other analysis
topics are strongly pursued and will be described in the following.
