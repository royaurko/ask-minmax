The ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) were isolated in external galaxies for
the last 5 years. Their X-ray luminosities exceed 100-10000 times those of
brightest Milky Way black hole binaries and they are extremely variable. There
are two models for the ULXs, the best black hole candidates. 1. They are
supercritical accretion disks around a stellar mass black hole like that in
SS433, observed close to the disk axes. 2. They are Intermediate Mass Black
Holes (of 100-10000 solar masses). Critical observations which may throw light
upon the ULXs nature come from observations of nebulae around the ULXs. We
present results of 3D-spectroscopy of nebulae around several ULXs located in
galaxies at 3-6 Mpc distances. We found that the nebulae to be powered by their
central black holes. The nebulae are shocked and dynamically perturbed probably
by jets. The nebulae are compared with SS433 nebula (W50).
