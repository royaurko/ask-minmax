A distributed, hierarchical information service for computer networks might
rely in several instances, located in different layers. A distributed directory
service, for example, might be comprised of upper level listings, and local
directories. The upper level listings contain a compact version of the local
directories. Clients desiring to access the information contained in local
directories might first access the high-level listings, in order to locate the
appropriate local instance. One of the keys for the competent operation of such
service is the ability of properly summarizing the information, which will be
maintained in the upper level directories. We analyze the case of the Lookup
Service in the Information Services plane of perfSONAR performance monitoring
distributed architecture, which implements IPv4 summarization in its functions.
We propose an empirical method, or heuristic, to achieve the summarizations,
based on the PATRICIA tree. We further apply the heuristic on a simulated
distributed test bed and contemplate the results.
