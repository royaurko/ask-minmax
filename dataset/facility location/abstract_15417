We have developed an interactive program which shows the solar energetic
particle (SEP) intensity-time profile as observed by SOHO/ERNE, simultaneously
with the associated coronal mass ejection in optical imaging movies taken by
LASCO coronagraph, soft X-ray by YOHKOH, ultraviolet by EIT, DH radio emission
by WAVE/Wind, and the H$\alpha$ location for the solar flare and spectral radio
emission from the journal of geophysical data. The whole set of data will
provide increased scientific knowledge on the solar energetic particle events
and the solar phenomena associated with them, because in this program one can
see easily the temporal associations of each phenomenon during the evolution of
the particle intensity. The (SEP) intensity-time profile will give a clear view
to detect the velocity dispersion in the events, if it exists. The ERNE data
are commented in order to follow of phenomena associated with changes of the
intensity-time profiles. We introduce this set of data as an index for the
ERNE/SOHO solar energetic particle events. The interactive program is applied
for statistical, correlative study of SEP events observed on board SOHO.
