ESO and ESA agreed to establish a number of Working Groups to explore
possible synergies between these two major European astronomical institutions.
This Working Group's mandate was to concentrate on fundamental questions in
cosmology, and the scope for tackling these in Europe over the next ~15 years.
One major resulting recommendation concerns the provision of new generations of
imaging survey, where the image quality and near-IR sensitivity that can be
attained only in space are naturally matched by ground-based imaging and
spectroscopy to yield massive datasets with well-understood photometric
redshifts (photo-z's). Such information is essential for a range of new
cosmological tests using gravitational lensing, large-scale structure, clusters
of galaxies, and supernovae. Great scope in future cosmology also exists for
ELT studies of the intergalactic medium and space-based studies of the CMB and
gravitational waves; here the synergy is less direct, but these areas will
remain of the highest mutual interest to the agencies. All these recommended
facilities will produce vast datasets of general applicability, which will have
a tremendous impact on broad areas of astronomy.
