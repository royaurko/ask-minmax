If Omega_tot = 1 and structure formed from adiabatic initial conditions then
the age of the Universe, as constrained by measurements of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB), is t_0=14.0 +/- 0.5 Gyr. The uncertainty is surprisingly
small given that CMB data alone constrain neither h nor Omega_Lambda
significantly. It is due to the tight (and accidental) correlation, in these
models, of the age with the angle subtended by the sound horizon on the
last--scattering surface and thus with the well-determined acoustic peak
locations. If we assume either the HST Key Project result h = 0.72 \pm .08 or
simply that h > 0.55, we find Omega_Lambda > 0.4 at 95% confidence--another
argument for dark energy, independent of supernovae observations. Our analysis
is greatly simplified by the Monte Carlo Markov chain approach to Bayesian
inference combined with a fast method for calculating angular power spectra.
