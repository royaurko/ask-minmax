Thanks to numerical data gathered by Lyon's shared bicycling system V\'elo'v,
we are able to analyze 11.6 millions bicycle trips, leading to the first robust
characterization of urban bikers' behaviors. We show that bicycles outstrip
cars in downtown Lyon, by combining high speed and short paths.These data also
allows us to calculate V\'elo'v fluxes on all streets, pointing to interesting
locations for bike paths.
