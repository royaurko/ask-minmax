We report the discovery of a new filamentary structure, G358.85+0.47,
consisting of at least three mutually parallel but bent `strands', located
about 1.5 degrees SW of the Sgr A complex. Unlike all the other known Galactic
center filaments, G358.85+0.47 is oriented parallel to the galactic plane. This
orientation of the filament may have implications for the large scale structure
of the magnetic field near the Galactic Center. This feature was identified in
a new wide-field image of the Galactic Center region at 90 cm. Further higher
resolution observations at 20 cm revealed a filamentary structure which is
similar to several other known linear features in the vicinity of the Galactic
center. Based on its appearance in a 20 cm image, we give it the name 'the
Pelican' for further reference.
