"LUE200" - 200 MeV electron linac is being created at JINR as a driver of the
pulsed neutron source "IREN" [1]. The special full-scale facilities for testing
the main systems of LUE-200 (FSTF) are used at JINR, BINP, MEPhI and YerPhI
[2]. The verification of the linac accelerating system is providing at the
VEPP-5 preinjector constructed at BINP [3]. The accelerating system of LUE200
includes two S-band (2856 MHz) accelerating sections of 3 m long. The sections
are connected with modulator based one 5045 klystron (SLAC production). There
are SLED-systems for the multiplying the pulse RF power. The first results of
the accelerating system test on the VEPP-5 preinjector are presented. The
electron beam energy up to 92 MeV and consequently average rate of acceleration
of the electron beam more than 30 MeV/m were achieved after acceleration in one
section.
