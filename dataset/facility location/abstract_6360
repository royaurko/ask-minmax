Robust and efficient optimization methods for variance component estimation
using Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) models for genetic mapping of
quantitative traits are considered. We show that the standard Newton-AI scheme
may fail when the optimum is located at one of the constraint boundaries, and
we introduce different approaches to remedy this by taking the constraints into
account. We approximate the Hessian of the objective function using the average
information matrix and also by using an inverse BFGS formula. The robustness
and efficiency is evaluated for problems derived from two experimental data
from the same animal populations.
