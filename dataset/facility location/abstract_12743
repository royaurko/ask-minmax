We study the influence of the isospin asymmetry on the phase structure of
strongly interacting quark matter near the tricritical point (TCP) using a
generalized Ginzburg-Landau approach. The effect has proven to be so drastic,
not only bringing about the shift of the location of TCP, but resulting in a
rich fine structure at the vicinity of TCP. In particular, we find that an
arbitrary small perturbation due to isospin density lifts the degeneracy of TCP
making it split into four independent multicritical points. Accordingly, the
homogeneous pion condensate and its solitonic counterpart come to occupy large
domains in the Ginzburg-Landau coupling space.
