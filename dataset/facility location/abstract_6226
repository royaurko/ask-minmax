We show that if a holomorphic Hamiltonian system is holomorphically
integrable in the non-commutative sense in a neighbourhood of a non-equilibrium
phase curve which is located at a regular level of the first integrals, then
the identity component of the differential Galois group of the variational
equations along the phase curve is Abelian. Thus necessary conditions for the
commutative and non-commutative integrability given by the differential Galois
approach are the same.
