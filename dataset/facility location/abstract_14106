We analyse the critical exponents relating to the quark mass anomalous
dimension and beta-function at the Banks-Zaks fixed point in Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD) in a variety of representations for the quark in the
momentum subtraction (MOM) schemes of Celmaster and Gonsalves. For a specific
range of values of the number of quark flavours, estimates of the exponents
appear to be scheme independent. Using the recent five loop modified minimal
subtraction (MSbar) scheme quark mass anomalous dimension and estimates of the
fixed point location we estimate the associated exponent as 0.263-0.268 for the
SU(3) colour group and 12 flavours when the quarks are in the fundamental
representation.
