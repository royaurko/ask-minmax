The Faint Sky Variability Survey (FSVS) is aimed at finding photometric
and/or astrometric variable objects between 16th and 24th mag on time-scales
between tens of minutes and years with photometric precisions ranging from 3
millimag to 0.2 mag. An area of 23 deg$^2$, located at mid and high Galactic
latitudes, was covered using the Wide Field Camera (WFC) on the 2.5-m Isaac
Newton Telescope (INT) on La Palma. Here we present some preliminary results on
the variability of sources in the FSVS.
