We obtained GALEX FUV, NUV, and Spitzer/IRAC 3.6$\mu$m photometry for > 2000
galaxies, available for 90% of the S4G sample. We find a very tight "GALEX Blue
Sequence (GBS)" in the (FUV-NUV) versus (NUV-[3.6]) color-color diagram which
is populated by irregular and spiral galaxies, and is mainly driven by changes
in the formation timescale ($\tau$) and a degeneracy between $\tau$ and dust
reddening. The tightness of the GBS provides an unprecedented way of
identifying star-forming galaxies and objects that are just evolving to (or
from) what we call the "GALEX Green Valley (GGV)". At the red end of the GBS,
at (NUV-[3.6]) > 5, we find a wider "GALEX Red Sequence (GRS)" mostly populated
by E/S0 galaxies that has a perpendicular slope to that of the GBS and of the
optical red sequence. We find no such dichotomy in terms of stellar mass
(measured by $\rm{M}_{[3.6]}$), since both massive ($M_{\star} > 10^{11}
M_{\odot}$) blue and red sequence galaxies are identified. The type that is
proportionally more often found in the GGV are the S0-Sa's and most of these
are located in high-density environments. We discuss evolutionary models of
galaxies that show a rapid transition from the blue to the red sequence on
timescale of $10^{8}$years.
