We focus in this paper on the effect of the resolution of Direct Numerical
Simulations (DNS) on the spatio-temporal development of the turbulence
downstream of a single square grid. The aims of this study are to validate our
numerical approach by comparing experimental and numerical one-point statistics
downstream of a single square grid and then investigate how the resolution is
impacting the dynamics of the flow. In particular, using the Q-R diagram, we
focus on the interaction between the strain-rate and rotation tensors, the
symmetric and skew-symmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor
respectively. We first show good agreement between our simulations and hot-wire
experiment for one-point statistics on the centreline of the single square
grid. Then, by analysing the shape of the Q-R diagram for various streamwise
locations, we evaluate the ability of under-resolved DNS to capture the main
features of the turbulence downstream of the single square grid.
