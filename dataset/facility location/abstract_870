We present energy spread and bunch length measurements at the Accelerator
Test Facility (ATF) at KEK, as functions of current, for different ring rf
voltages, and with the beam both on and off the coupling resonance. We fit the
on-coupling bunch shapes to those of an impedance model consisting of a
resistor and an inductor connected in series. We find that the fits are
reasonably good, but that the resulting impedance is unexpectedly large.
