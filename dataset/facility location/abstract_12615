We present CARMA observations of the three northern unconfirmed galaxy
clusters discovered by the PLANCK satellite. We confirm the existence of two
massive clusters (PLCKESZ G115.71+17.52 and PLCKESZ G121.11+57.01) at high
significance. For these clusters, we present refined centroid locations from
the 31 GHz CARMA data, as well as mass estimates obtained from a joint analysis
of CARMA and PLANCK data. We do not detect the third candidate, PLCKESZ
G189.84-37.24, and place an upper limit on its mass of M500 < 3.2 X 10^(14)
M_SUN at 68% confidence. Considering our data and the characteristics of the
PLANCK Early Release SZ Catalog, we conclude that this object is likely to be a
cold-core object in the plane of our Galaxy. As a result, we estimate the
purity of the ESZ Catalog to be greater than 99.5%.
