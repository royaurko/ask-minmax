Out of about 500 Lithium-rich ROSAT counterparts, which are presumed to be
low-mass pre-main sequence stars, 21 stars have been observed by HIPPARCOS. We
study their parallaxes, proper motions, and photometric data. For 7 out of 10
Taurus and Lupus stars in our sample, proper motions and parallaxes are not
inconsistent with membership to these associations, while most of the stars in
Chamaeleon and Scorpius appear to be young foreground stars. Combined with
ground based photometry and spectroscopy, HIPPARCOS parallaxes allow us to
place 15 stars on an H-R diagram. All these 15 stars are indeed pre-main
sequence stars with ages from 1 to 15 Myr. Only two of the stars are located on
the Hayashi-tracks, whereas the other 13 are post-T Tauri stars located on
radiative tracks. Although this sample is admittedly small, containing only 3%
of the total sample of Lithium-rich ROSAT counterparts, it does not confirm
recent predictions by other contributors: We find no stars in the age range from 20
to 100 Myr. The foreground pre-main sequence stars may have been ejected
towards us, or they belong to the Gould Belt system, a plane filled with young
stars.
