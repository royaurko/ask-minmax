Wireless networking has become an important area of research in academic and
industry. The main objectives of this paper is to gain in-depth knowledge about
the Wi-Fi- WiMAX technology and how it works and understand the problems about
the WiFi- WiMAX technology in maintaining and deployment. The challenges in
wireless networks include issues like security, seamless handover, location and
emergency services, cooperation, and QoS.The performance of the WiMAX is better
than the Wi-Fi and also it provide the good response in the access. It's
evaluated the Quality of Service (Qos) in Wi-Fi compare with WiMAX and provides
the various kinds of security Mechanisms. Authentication to verify the identity
of the contributorized communicating client stations. Confidentiality (Privacy) to
secure that the wirelessly conveyed information will remain private and
protected. Take necessary actions and configurations that are needed in order
to deploy Wi-Fi -WiMAX with increased levels of security and privacy
