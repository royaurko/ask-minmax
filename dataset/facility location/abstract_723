I present some recent results from experiments at the Oak Ridge Electron
Linear Accelerator (ORELA) and discuss their impact in nuclear astrophysics. I
then describe some possible future nuclear astrophysics experiments at ORELA
and at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) being built in Oak Ridge. The SNS
and ORELA are complementary, world-class facilities and both will be needed for
important future experiments in nuclear astrophysics.
