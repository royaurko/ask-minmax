We present new narrow-band near-infrared images together with K band spectra
of highly collimated bipolar jets close to the IRAS 05487+0255 source. The jets
are located at 50" West of the Herbig-Haro 110 outflow. The jets are not
visible at optical wavelengths, and therefore, do not fall into the `standard'
Herbig-Haro object classification scheme. Nevertheless, they belong to an ever
growing group of molecular hydrogen jets associated with YSOs which are
optically undetected. The jets are very well collimated, with a length-to-width
ratio of 10-20. The spectra of the jet and counter-jet in the K-band show a
limited number of molecular hydrogen emission lines which makes it difficult to
obtain an accurate excitation temperature. We estimate Tex = 1104+/-67 K and
Tex = 920+/- 156 K for the red and blue jet components respectively. The radial
velocities of the jet and counter-jet, based on the shift of the (1,0) S(1)
2.121 micron line, are -275+/- 50 km/s and 180+/- 50 km/s respectively,
suggesting an angle of 30 to 45 degrees between the jet and the line of sight.
The molecular hydrogen emission of the entire jet extends for at least 40" or
0.1 pc at the distance of Orion. If the flow velocity is comparable to that of
the radial velocities, then the dynamical age of the system is quite short
(about 500 yrs), consistent with a young jet arising from an embedded source.
Entrainment in a turbulent mixing layer may explain this morphology and
spectral character.
