The Joint European X-ray Telescope (JET-X) was the core instrument of the
Russian Spectrum-X-gamma space observatory. It consisted of two identical soft
X-ray (0.3 - 10 keV) telescopes with focusing optical modules having a measured
angular resolution of nearly 15 arcsec. Soon after the payload completion, the
mission was cancelled and the two optical flight modules (FM) were brought to
the Brera Astronomical Observatory where they had been manufactured. After 16
years of storage, we have utilized the JET-X FM2 to test at the PANTER X-ray
facility a prototype of a novel X-ray polarimetric telescope, using a Gas Pixel
Detector (GPD) with polarimetric capabilities in the focal plane of the FM2.
The GPD was developed by a collaboration between INFN-Pisa and INAF-IAPS. In
the first phase of the test campaign, we have re-tested the FM2 at PANTER to
have an up-to-date characterization in terms of angular resolution and
effective area, while in the second part of the test the GPD has been placed in
the focal plane of the FM2. In this paper we report the results of the tests of
the sole FM2, using an unpolarized X-ray source, comparing the results with the
calibration done in 1996.
