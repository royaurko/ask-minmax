Mass-stationarity means that the origin is at a typical location in the mass
of a random measure. It is an intrinsic characterisation of Palm versions with
respect to stationary random measures. Stationarity is the special case when
the random measure is Lebesgue measure. The paper presents constructions of
stationary and mass-stationary versions through change of measure and change of
origin. Further, the paper considers characterisations of mass-stationarity by
distributional invariance under preserving shifts agains stationary independent
backgrounds.
