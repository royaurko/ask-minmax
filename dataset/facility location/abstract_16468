We study the phase-diagram of a parity and time-reversal (PT) symmetric
tight-binding chain with $N$ sites and hopping energy $J$, in the presence of
two impurities with imaginary potentials $\pm i\gamma$ located at arbitrary
(P-symmetric) positions $(m, \bar{m}=N+1-m)$ on the chain where $m\leq N/2$. We
find that except in the two special cases where impurities are either the
farthest or the closest, the PT-symmetric region - defined as the region in
which all energy eigenvalues are real - is algebraically fragile. We
analytically and numerically obtain the critical impurity potential
$\gamma_{PT}$ and show that $\gamma_{PT}\propto 1/N\rightarrow 0$ as
$N\rightarrow\infty$ except in the two special cases. When the PT symmetry is
spontaneously broken, we find that the maximum number of complex eigenvalues is
given by $2m$. When the two impurities are the closest, we show that the
critical impurity strength $\gamma_{PT}$ in the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$
approaches $J$ ($J/2$) provided that $N$ is even (odd). For an even $N$ the PT
symmetry is maximally broken whereas for an odd $N$, it is sequentially broken.
Our results show that the phase-diagram of a PT-symmetric tight-binding chain
is extremely rich and that, in the continuum limit, this model may give rise to
new PT-symmetric Hamiltonians.
