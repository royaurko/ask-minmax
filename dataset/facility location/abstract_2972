In this work, we have studied the observational constraints on the Cardassian
Model for the dark energy. We have compared the model with existing Supernova
data. The dependence of the location of the Cosmic Microwave Background
Radiation (CMBR) peaks on the parameters of the model have also been studied.
We find, in particular, that observational data arising from Archeops for the
location of the first peak, BOOMERANG for the location of the third peak,
together with the Supernova data, constrain significantly the parameter space.
