We present near-infrared (NIR) surface photometry of a sample of 14
early-type spirals with observed rotation curves. In this first paper, we
report the results of two-dimensional parametric and non-parametric
decompositions to separate the bulge and disk components; the parametric bulge
is modeled with a generalized exponential law of integer index n, and the disk
with a simple exponential. We find that the derived bulge parameters, for a
given galaxy, vary systematically with the bulge shape index n. The mean
early-type bulge has a best-fit n = 2.6, and 80% of the sample has best n of 2
or 3. Bulges are rarely spherical; the median bulge intrinsic ellipticity is
0.33. The median early-type disk has (J-K)_d more than 0.1 mag bluer than the
bulge, and a NIR disk surface brightness more than 1 mag arcsec^{-2} brighter
than later-type disks. Our data are consistent with the well-established
correlation of both bulge and disk surface brightness with physical scale
length, and we note that the location of bulges within this projection of the
fundamental plane depends on their shape index n. In agreement with previous
work, the ratios of bulge and disk scale lengths are consistent with a constant
value r_e/r_d = 0.3; however, such value again depends on the bulge index n,
implying that claims for a scale-free Hubble sequence may be premature.
