Long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRB) are at cosmological distance, they
appear to be located near star forming regions, and are likely associated with
some type of supernovae. They are also likely to be strongly beamed, which
lowers their energetics by several orders of magnitude, and increases their
rate by the same factor. Therefore, it is likely that one out of 100 - 1000
core collapse supernovae generates ultra-relativistic jets, which beam
gamma-rays and all other early emission into two narrow cones. After a year, or
so, the jets are decelerated and become non-relativistic, and their emission
becomes more or less isotropic. At least two GRB: 970508 (z = 0.835) and 980703
(z = 0.966) show strong radio emission from late, and therefore
non-relativistic afterglows. Such events should be readily detectable at low
redshift, say z = 0.03. A search for strong radio emitters among recent nearby
supernovae should be done $ \sim 1 $ year after the explosion. If some of these
explosions generated GRB and their gamma-ray beam missed us, the bipolar
structure of the radio remnant should be resolvable with VLBA.
