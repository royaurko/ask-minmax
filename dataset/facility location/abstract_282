A four mass torsion pendulum facility for testing of the LISA GRS is under
development in Trento. With a LISA-like test mass suspended off-axis with
respect to the pendulum fiber, the facility allows for a direct measurement of
surface force disturbances arising in the GRS. We present here results with a
prototype pendulum integrated with very large-gap sensors, which allows an
estimate of the intrinsic pendulum noise floor in the absence of sensor related
force noise. The apparatus has shown a torque noise near to its mechanical
thermal noise limit, and would allow to place upper limits on GRS related
disturbances with a best sensitivity of 300 fN/Hz^(1/2) at 1mHz, a factor 50
from the LISA goal. Also, we discuss the characterization of the gravity
gradient noise, one environmental noise source that could limit the apparatus
performances, and report on the status of development of the facility.
