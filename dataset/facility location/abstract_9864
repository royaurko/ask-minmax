Though the existence of two-level systems (TLS) is widely accepted to explain
low temperature anomalies in the sound absorption, heat capacity, thermal
conductivity and other quantities, an exact description of their microscopic
nature is still lacking. We performed computer simulations for a binary
Lennard-Jones system, using a newly developed algorithm to locate double-well
potentials (DWP) and thus two-level systems on a systematic basis. We show that
the intrinsic limitations of computer simulations like finite time and finite
size problems do not hamper this analysis. We discuss how the DWP are embedded
in the total potential energy landscape. It turns out that most DWP are
connected to the dynamics of the smaller particles and that these DWP are
rather localized. However, DWP related to the larger particles are more
collective.
