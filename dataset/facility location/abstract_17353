Context: Coronal magnetic null points have been implicated as possible
locations for localised heating events in 2D models. We investigate this
possibility about fully 3D null points.
  Aims: We investigate the nature of the fast magnetoacoustic wave about a
fully 3D magnetic null point, with a specific interest in its propagation, and
we look for evidence of MHD mode coupling and/or conversion to the Alfv\'en
mode.
  Methods: A special fieldline and flux-based coordinate system was constructed
to permit the introduction of a pure fast magnetoacoustic wave in the vicinity
of proper and improper 3D null points. We considered the ideal, {\beta} = 0,
MHD equations, which are solved using the LARE3D numerical code. The
constituent modes of the resulting wave were isolated and identified using the
special coordinate system. Numerical results were supported by analytical work
derived from perturbation theory and a linear implementation of the WKB method.
  Results: An initially pure fast wave is found to be permanently decoupled
from the Alfv\'en mode both linearly and nonlinearly for both proper and
improper 3D null points. The pure fast mode also generates and sustains a
nonlinear disturbance aligned along the equilibrium magnetic field. The
resulting pure fast magnetoacoustic pulse has transient behaviour, which is
found to be governed by the (equilibrium) Alfv\'en-speed profile, and a
refraction effect focuses all the wave energy towards the null point.
  Conclusions: Thus, the main results from previous 2D work do indeed carry
over to the fully 3D magnetic null points and
