Using the SIT (Suprathermal Ion Telescope) instrument on STEREO-A we have
examined the abundance of the rare isotope 3He during the rising activity phase
of solar cycle 24 between January 2010 and December 2011. We have identified
six solar energetic particle (SEP) events with enormous abundance enhancements
of 3He (3He/4He >1). The events were short lasting, typically ~0.5-1 day and
most of them occurred in association with high-speed solar wind streams and
corotating interaction regions. With one exception the events were not
associated with ~100 keV solar electron intensity increases. The events showed
also enhanced NeS/O and Fe/O ratios. The solar images indicate that the events
were generally associated with the active regions located near a coronal hole.
