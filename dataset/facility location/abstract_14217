We have performed an unbiased deep near-infrared survey toward the Aquila
molecular cloud with a sky coverage of ~1 deg2. We identified 45 molecular
hydrogen emission-line objects(MHOs), of which only 11 were previously known.
Using the Spitzer archival data we also identified 802 young stellar objects
(YSOs) in this region. Based on the morphology and the location of MHOs and YSO
candidates, we associate 43 MHOs with 40 YSO candidates. The distribution of
jet length shows an exponential decrease in the number of outflows with
increasing length and the molecular hydrogen outflows seem to be oriented
randomly. Moreover, there is no obvious correlation between jet lengths, jet
opening angles, or jet H2 1-0 S(1) luminosities and spectral indices of the
possible driving sources in this region. We also suggest that molecular
hydrogen outflows in the Aquila molecular cloud are rather weak sources of
turbulence, unlikely to generate the observed velocity dispersion in the region
of survey.
