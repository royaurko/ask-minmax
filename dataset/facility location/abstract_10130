We consider a planar gravitating thick domain wall of the $\lambda \phi^4$
theory as a spacetime with finite thickness glued to two vacuum spacetimes on
each side of it. Darmois junction conditions written on the boundaries of the
thick wall with the embedding spacetimes reproduce the Israel junction
condition across the wall in the limit of infinitesimal thickness. The thick
planar domain wall located at a fixed position is then transformed to a new
coordinate system in which its dynamics can be formulated. It is shown that the
wall's core expands as if it were a thin wall. The thickness in the new
coordinates is not constant anymore and its time dependence is given.
