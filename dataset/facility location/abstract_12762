We present a short review of GRB studies performed for many years by Ioffe
Institute experiments onboard a number of space missions. The first
breakthrough in the studies of GRB was made possible by four Konus experiments
carried out by the Ioffe Institute onboard the Venera 11-14 deep space missions
from 1978 to 1983. A new important stage of our research is associated with the
joint Russian-American experiment with the Russian Konus scientific instrument
onboard the U.S. Wind spacecraft which has been successfully operating since
its launch in November 1994. The Konus-Wind experiment has made an impressive
number of important GRB observations and other astrophysical discoveries, due
to the advantages of its design and its interplanetary location. We also
briefly discuss future GRB experiments of the Ioffe Institute.
