We construct a Kerr-Newman-like spacetimes starting from higher dimensional
(HD) Einstein-Yang-Mills black holes via complex transformations suggested by
Newman-Janis. The new metrics are HD generalization of Kerr-Newman spacetimes
which has a geometry precisely that of Kerr-Newman in 4D corresponding to
Yang-Mills (YM) gauge charge, but the sign of charge term gets flipped in the
HD spacetimes. It is interesting to note that gravitational contribution of YM
gauge charge, in HD, is indeed opposite (attractive rather than repulsive) that
of Maxwell charge. The effect of YM gauge charge on the structure and location
of static limit surface and apparent horizon is discussed. We find that static
limit surfaces become less prolate with increase in dimensions and are also
sensitive to YM gauge charge thereby affecting the shape of ergosphere. We also
analyze some thermodynamical properties of these BHs.
