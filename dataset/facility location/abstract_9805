In this work we present a general derivation of the non-Fickian behavior for
the self-diffusion of identically interacting particle systems with excluded
mutual passage. We show that the conditional probability distribution of
finding a particle at position $x_{t}$ after time $t$, when the particle was
located at $x_{0}$ at $t=0$, follows a Gaussian distribution in the long-time
limit, with variance $2W(t)\sim t^{1/2}$ for overdamped systems and with
variance $2W(t)\sim t$ for classical systems. The asymptotic behavior of the
mean-squared displacement, $W(t)$, is shown to be independent of the nature of
interactions for homogeneous systems in the fluid state. Moreover, the
long-time behavior of self-diffusion is determined by short-time and large
scale collective density fluctuations.
