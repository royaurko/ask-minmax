We have analyzed spatially resolved spectra of A754 obtained with ASCA. The
combination of spectral and imaging capabilities of ASCA has set unprecedented
constraints on the hydrodynamical effects of a cluster merger. We find
significant gas temperature variations over the cluster face, indicating shock
heating of the atmosphere during the merger. The hottest region, >12 keV, is
located in the region of the Northwest galaxy clump though the entire region
along the cluster axis appears to be hotter than the mean cluster temperature
(~9 keV). The cool, ~5 keV gas originally found with the HEAO1-A2 experiment,
resides in the exterior of the cluster atmosphere and in plume of gas we
identify with a stripped cool atmosphere of the infalling subcluster. We have
also attempted to reconstruct an iron abundance map of this merging system.
Though poorly constrained, no significant deviations of abundance from the mean
value are apparent in the individual regions.
  A754 is the only cluster so far which shows the significant temperature
pattern expected in a subcluster merger, in both the ROSAT (Henry & Briel 1995)
and ASCA data, providing the first possibility to compare it with theoretical
predictions. The observed temperature and surface brightness maps suggest that
the two colliding subunits have missed each other by about 1 Mpc, and are now
moving perpendicular to the cluster axis in the image plane (as, e.g., in the
simulations by Evrard etal 1996).
