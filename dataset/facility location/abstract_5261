We measured the lifetime and the mesonic and non-mesonic decay rates of the
4He-Lambda hypernucleus. The hypernuclei were created using a 750 MeV/c
momentum K- beam on a liquid 4He target by the reaction 4He(K-,pi-)4He-Lambda.
The 4He-Lambda lifetime was directly measured using protons from Lambda p -> n
p non-mesonic decay (also referred to as proton-stimulated decay) and was found
to have a value of tau = 245 +/- 24 ps. The mesonic decay rates were determined
from the observed numbers of pi-'s and pi0's as Gamma_pi-/Gamma_tot = 0.270 +/-
0.024 and Gamma_pi0/Gamma_tot = 0.564 +/- 0.036, respectively, and the values
of the proton- and neutron-stimulated decay rates were extracted as
Gamma_p/Gamma_tot = 0.169 +/- 0.019 and Gamma_n/Gamma_tot <= 0.032 (95% CL),
respectively. The effects of final-state interactions and possible 3-body
Lambda N N decay contributions were studied in the context of a simple model of
nucleon-stimulated decay. Nucleon-nucleon coincidence events were observed and
were used in the determination of the non-mesonic branching fractions. The
implications of the results of this analysis were considered for the empirical
Delta I = 1/2 rule and the decay rates of the 4H-Lambda hypernucleus.
