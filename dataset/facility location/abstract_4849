In the solar photosphere, many properties of coronal holes (CHs) are not
known, especially vector magnetic fields. Using observations from
\emph{Hinode}, we investigate vector magnetic fields, current densities and
current helicities in two CHs and compare them with two normal quiet regions
(QRs) for the first time. We find that, in the CHs and QRs, the areas where
large current helicities are located are mainly co-spatial with strong vertical
and horizontal field elements both in shape and location. In the CHs,
horizontal magnetic fields, inclination angles, current densities and current
helicities are larger than those in the QRs. The mean vertical current density
and current helicity, averaged over all the observed areas including the CHs
and QRs, are approximately 0.008 A m$^{-2}$ and 0.005 G$^{2}$ m$^{-1}$,
respectively. The mean current density in magnetic flux concentrations where
the vertical fields are stronger than 100 G is as large as 0.012 $\pm$ 0.001 A
m$^{-2}$, consistent with that in the flare productive active regions. Our
results imply that the magnetic fields, especially the strong fields, both in
the CHs and QRs are nonpotential.
