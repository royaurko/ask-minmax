I review what eLISA will see from Galactic binaries -- double stars with
orbital periods less than a few hours and white dwarf (or neutron star/black
hole) components. I discuss the currently known binaries that are guaranteed
(or verification) sources and explain why the expected total number of eLISA
Galactic binaries is several thousand, even though there are large
uncertainties in our knowledge of this population, in particular that of the
interacting AM CVn systems. I very briefly sketch the astrophysical questions
that can be addressed once these thousands of systems are detected. I close
with a short outline of the electro-magnetic facilities that will come on line
before eLISA will fly and the importance of developing analysis plans using
both electro-magnetic and gravitational wave data.
