We report the detection of broad Halpha emission in three X-ray selected
obscured AGNs at z=1-2. By exploiting the Halpha width and the intrinsic X-ray
luminosity, we estimate their black hole masses, which are in the range
0.1-3x10^9 Msun. By means of multi-band photometric data, we measure the
stellar mass of their host galaxy and, therefore, infer their M_BH/M_star
ratio. These are the first obscured AGNs at high-z, selected based on their
black hole accretion (i.e. on the basis of their X-ray luminosity), that can be
located on the M_BH-M_star relation at high-z. All of these obscured high-z
AGNs are fully consistent with the local M_BH-M_star relation. This result
conflicts with those for other samples of AGNs in the same redshift range,
whose M_BH/M_star ratio departs significantly from the value observed in local
galaxies. We suggest that the obscured AGNs in our sample are in an advanced
evolutionary stage, have already settled onto the local M_BH-M_star relation,
and whose nuclear activity has been temporarily revived by recent galaxy
interactions.
