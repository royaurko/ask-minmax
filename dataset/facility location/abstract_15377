In preparation of a study of the HeII/HI ratio towards the bright QSO
HS1700+6416, we predict the metal line content of the far-UV spectral range by
modelling 18 metal absorption line systems with redshifts 0.2<z<2.6 identified
in the spectrum of this quasar. For that purpose, we investigate the spectral
energy distribution of the metagalactic ionizing radiation field. Simple
photoionization models based on 8 different shapes of the ionizing background
are tested for each system. The adopted energy distributions comprise the
Haardt & Madau (2001, HM) model of metagalactic UV background as well as
typical spectra of AGN and starburst galaxies. The models are evaluated and the
favoured one is estimated. We find that the majority of the considered systems
is best reproduced with a HM-like ionizing radiation, where the HeII break,
formally located at 4 Ryd, is shifted to lower energies (~3 Ryd), probably due
to the opacity of the higher HeII Lyman series lines. The remaining systems can
be reasonably described with models based on the unmodified HM background or
the spectra of AGN or starburst galaxies. This finding supports the idea that
the UV background is spatially variable due to both IGM opacity variations and
to local sources. In comparison to an unmodified HM background, the resulting
ionizing spectrum leads to carbon abundances lower by ~0.5 dex. Furthermore, if
the ionizing radiation field as determined from metal line systems was typical
for the IGM, the expected HeII/HI ratio would be 150 to 190.
