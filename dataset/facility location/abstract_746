At FRM-II the installation of a user office software is under consideration,
supporting tasks like proposal handling, beam time allocation, data handling
and report creation. Although there are several software systems in use at
major facilities, most of them are not portable to other institutes. In this
paper the requirements for a modular and extendable user office software are
discussed with focus on security related aspects like how to prevent a denial
of service attack on fully automated systems. A suitable way seems to be the
creation of a web based application using Apache as webserver, MySQL as
database system and PHP as scripting language.
