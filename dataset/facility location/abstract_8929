The kinematic and morphological properties of a string of [Ar III] bright
knots in the Crab Nebula are examined using 1994 - 1999 HST WFPC-2 images of
the remnant. We find that five southern [Ar III] bright knots exhibit ordinary
radial motions away from the nebula's center of expansion with magnitudes
consistent with their projected radial displacements. These results do not
support the suggestion by MacAlpine et al.(1994) that these knots might be
moving rapidly away from the Crab pulsar due to a collimated wind. The HST
images also do not show that the [Ar III] knots have unusual morphologies
relative to other features in the remnant. Our proper motion results, when
combined with radial velocity estimates, suggest these knots have relatively
low space velocities implying relatively interior remnant locations thus
placing them closer to the ionizing radiation from the Crab's synchrotron
nebula. This might lead to higher knot gas temperatures thereby explaining the
knots' unusual line emission strengths as MacAlpine et al.(1994) suspected.
