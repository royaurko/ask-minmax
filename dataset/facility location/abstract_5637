We discuss how the curvature of the universe can be robustly measured
employing only the gross features of the CMB anisotropy spectrum. Though the
position of the first peak is not robust, uncertainties in the model for
structure formation can be removed by using the spacing of the acoustic peaks
and the location of the damping tail. Combined these provide important
consistency tests that can be used to discriminate against a truly exotic
model.
