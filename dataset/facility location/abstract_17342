Many common diseases are highly polygenic, modulated by a large number
genetic factors with small effects on susceptibility to disease. These small
effects are difficult to map reliably in genetic association studies. To
address this problem, researchers have developed methods that aggregate
information over sets of related genes, such as biological pathways, to
identify gene sets that are enriched for genetic variants associated with
disease. However, these methods fail to answer a key question: which genes and
genetic variants are associated with disease risk? We develop a method based on
sparse multiple regression that simultaneously identifies enriched pathways,
and prioritizes the variants within these pathways, to locate additional
variants associated with disease susceptibility. A central feature of our
approach is an estimate of the strength of enrichment, which yields a coherent
way to prioritize variants in enriched pathways. We illustrate the benefits of
our approach in a genome-wide association study of Crohn's disease with
~440,000 genetic variants genotyped for ~4700 study subjects. We obtain strong
support for enrichment of IL-12, IL-23 and other cytokine signaling pathways.
Furthermore, prioritizing variants in these enriched pathways yields support
for additional disease-association variants, all of which have been
independently reported in other case-control studies for Crohn's disease.
