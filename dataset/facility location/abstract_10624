We report theoretical investigations of the tomographic procedure suggested
by Itatani {\it et al.} [Nature, {\bf 432} 867 (2004)] for reconstructing
highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) using high-order harmonic generation
(HHG). Using the limited range of harmonics from the plateau region, we found
that under the most favorable assumptions, it is still very difficult to obtain
accurate HOMO wavefunction, but the symmetry of the HOMO and the internuclear
separation between the atoms can be accurately extracted, especially when
lasers of longer wavelengths are used to generate the HHG. We also considered
the possible removal or relaxation of the approximations used in the
tomographic method in actual applications. We suggest that for chemical
imaging, in the future it is better to use an iterative method to locate the
positions of atoms in the molecule such that the resulting HHG best fits the
macroscopic HHG data, rather than by the tomographic method.
