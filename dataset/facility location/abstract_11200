An anomalous Hall effect and rectification of a Hall voltage are observed by
applying a radio-frequency (rf) current through a single-layered ferromagnetic
wire located on a coplanar waveguide. The components of the magnetization
precession, both in and perpendicular to the plane, can be detected via the
Hall voltage rectification of the rf current by incorporating an additional
direct (dc) current. In this paper, we propose a phenomenological model, which
describes the time-dependent anisotropic magnetoresistance and time-dependent
planer Hall effect. The nonlinearity of the spin dynamics accompanied by
spin-waves as functions of rf and dc currents is also studied, as well as those
of the magnitude and orientation of the external magnetic field.
