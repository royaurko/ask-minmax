We present proper motions of 72 T Tauri stars located in the central region
of Taurus-Auriga. These proper motions are taken from a new proper motion
catalogue called STARNET. Our sample comprises 17 classical T Tauri stars and
55 weak-line T Tauri stars, most of the latter discovered by ROSAT. 53 stars
had no proper motion measurement before. Kinematically, 62 of these stars are
members of the association. A velocity dispersion of less than 2-3 km/s is
found which is dominated by the errors of the proper motions. This velocity
dispersion correlates with a spread in distances. Furthermore we present proper
motions of 58 stars located in a region just south of the Taurus molecular
clouds and compare the kinematics of the youngest stars in this sample (younger
than 3.5 10^7 yrs) with the kinematics of the pre-main sequence stars in the
Taurus-Auriga association. From a comparison of the space velocities we find
that the stars in the central region of Tau-Aur are kinematically different
from the stars in the southern part. Among the stars with large proper motions
far off the Taurus mean motion we find 2 Pleiades candidates and 7 possible
Pleiades runaway stars.
