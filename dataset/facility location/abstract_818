Primakoff effect offers us with a way to determine the radiative decay width
of pseudo-scalar mesons when they are photo-produced in the electromagnetic
field of hadronic systems. Taking advantage of recent developments in the Regge
description of the production of mesons in the strong hadronic field, this
paper evaluates the relative importance of the electromagnetic and the strong
amplitudes, and assesses the possibilities which become opened by modern
experimental facilities.
