We study a Markov process constructed from the P\'olya sum process, which
yields a kind of spatial version of the Chinese restaurant process, where each
'table' is assigned a 'location'. This construction firstly allows a definition
of summation of independent processes, and secondly a monotone coupling for
different parameters. Moreover, the process is related to a multi-particle
random walk on the positive integers and its hydrodynamic limit and
fluctuations are discussed.
