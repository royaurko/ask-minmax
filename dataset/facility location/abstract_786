We demonstrate how the virtual photoproduction of vector mesons on nuclei
scans the wave function of vector mesons from the large non-perturbative
transverse size $\rho \sim R_{V}$ down to the small perturbative size $\rho
\sim 1/\sqrt{Q^{2}}$. Thee mechanism of scanning is based on color transparency
and QCD predicted spatial wave function of quark-antiquark fluctuations of
virtual photons. A rich, energy- and $Q^{2}$-dependent, pattern of the nuclear
shadowing and antishadowing is predicted, which can be tested at the European
Electron Facility and SLAC.
