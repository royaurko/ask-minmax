In this article we identify social communities among gang members in the
Hollenbeck policing district in Los Angeles, based on sparse observations of a
combination of social interactions and geographic locations of the individuals.
This information, coming from LAPD Field Interview cards, is used to construct
a similarity graph for the individuals. We use spectral clustering to identify
clusters in the graph, corresponding to communities in Hollenbeck, and compare
these with the LAPD's knowledge of the individuals' gang membership. We discuss
different ways of encoding the geosocial information using a graph structure
and the influence on the resulting clusterings. Finally we analyze the
robustness of this technique with respect to noisy and incomplete data, thereby
providing suggestions about the relative importance of quantity versus quality
of collected data.
