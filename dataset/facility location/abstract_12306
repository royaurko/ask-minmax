In the course of the XMM-Newton survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a
region to the east of the emission nebula N19 was observed in November 2009. To
search for new candidates for high mass X-ray binaries the EPIC PN and MOS data
of the detected point sources were investigated and their spectral and temporal
characteristics identified. A new transient (XMMUJ005011.2-730026= SXP214) with
a pulse period of 214.05 s was discovered; the source had a hard X-ray spectrum
with power-law index of ~0.65. The accurate X-ray source location permits the
identification of the X-ray source with a ~15th magnitude Be star, thereby
confirming this system as a new Be/X-ray binary.
