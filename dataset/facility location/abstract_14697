We present a study of the X-ray variability properties and spectral shapes of
five active galaxies all of which show extreme or enigmatic X-ray properties.
We focus on QSO 0117-2837, RXJ0134.3-4258, and NGC 4051, and briefly comment on
Mrk 1298 and 4C +74.26. The individual objects were originally partly selected
as candidates to host warm absorbers on the basis of (i) characteristic X-ray
absorption features (NGC 4051, Mrk 1298, 4C +74.26), (ii) extreme X-ray
spectral steepness (QSO 0117-2837; this object is found to be located in the
`zone of avoidance' when plotted in the Gamma_x - FWHM_Hbeta diagram), and
(iii) drastic spectral variability (RXJ0134.3-4258). The temporal analysis
reveals large-amplitude variability by a factor ~30 in the long-term X-ray
lightcurve of NGC 4051, very rapid variability of Mrk 1298, constant X-ray flux
of the NLSy1 galaxy QSO 0117-2837, and constant mean countrate of
RXJ0134.3-4258 despite huge spectral changes.
  Besides the warm absorber, several further mechanisms and their
merits/shortcomings are investigated to explain the spectral characteristics of
the individual objects. Different models are favored for different sources.
Consequences for Narrow-line Seyfert 1s in general are discussed and we present
results from photoionization models to distinguish between different suggested
NLSy1 scenarios.
