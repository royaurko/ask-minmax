QCD predicts a phase transition between hadronic matter and a Quark Gluon
Plasma at high energy density. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at
Brookhaven National Laboratory is a new facility dedicated to the experimental
study of matter under extreme conditions. I will discuss the first round of
experimental results from colliding heavy nuclei at RHIC and our current
understanding of the state of matter generated in such collisions,
concentrating on partonic energy loss and jet quenching as a probe of the
medium.
