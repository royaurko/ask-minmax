A Cosmic Ray Test Facility (CRTF) is the first large-scale implementation of
a scintillation triggering system based on a new scintillation technique known
as START. In START, the scintillation light is collected and transported by WLS
optical fibers, while light detection is performed by pairs of avalanche
photodiodes with the Metal-Resistor-Semiconductor structure operated in the
Geiger mode (MRS APD). START delivers 100% efficiency of cosmic muon detection,
while its intrinsic noise level is less than 10^{-2} Hz. CRTF, consisting of
160 START channels, has been continuously operated by the ALICE TOF
collaboration for more than 25 000 hours, and has demonstrated a high level of
stability. Fewer than 10% of MRS APDs had to be replaced during this period.
