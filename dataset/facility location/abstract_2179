The "top-down" approach to minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM)
phenomenology provides model-dependent indications for a natural stop mass. The
approach is based on specific assumptions about the supersymmetry-breaking
energy scale and parameters degeneracies. In order to determine robust
predictions we update the stop-mass prediction within the MSSM with 25
parameters (MSSM-25) by including electroweak fine-tuning as "naturalness data"
during the Bayesian fits of the parameters to experimental data. The
approximately prior-independent results show that imposing naturalness, taken
here to mean a 25% to 100% fine-tuning, predicts a 1-2 TeV stop mass. The
posterior distributions for the neutralino-proton cross sections indicate
better prospects for probing the associated neutralino cold dark matter (CDM)
with future upgrades of the detection facilities.
