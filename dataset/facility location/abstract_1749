The ratio of the electric and magnetic form factors of the proton, GEp/GMp,
was measured at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) using
the recoil polarization technique. The ratio of the form factors is directly
proportional to the ratio of the transverse to longitudinal components of the
polarization of the recoil proton in the elastic $\vec ep \to e\vec p$
reaction. The new data presented in this article span the range 3.5 < Q2 < 5.6
GeV2 and are well described by a linear Q2 fit. Also, the ratio QF2p/F1p
reaches a constant value above Q2=2 GeV2.
