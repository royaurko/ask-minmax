We have computed line profiles from self-gravitating toroids around black
holes. The specific angular momentum of the toroids is assumed to be constant
in space. The images of the toroids show peculiar feature in the rear side of
the black holes. Concerning the line profiles, the red wing extends to the very
small frequency region because the location of the inner edge is rather near
the event horizon of the black hole and consequently the velocity of the inner
edge of toroids can be faster than that of the Kepler disks.
