Spherically symmetric, vacuum solutions in 5D and 7D Kaluza-Klein theory are
obtained. These solutions are flux tubes with constant cross-sectional size,
located between (+) and (-) Kaluza-Klein's ``electrical'' and ``magnetic''
charges disposed respectively at $\pm\infty$ and filled by constant
Kaluza-Klein ``electrical'' and ``magnetic'' fields. These objects are
surprisingly similar to the flux tubes which forms between two monopoles in
Type-II superconductors and also the hypothesized color field flux tube that is
thought to form between two quarks in the QCD vacuum.
