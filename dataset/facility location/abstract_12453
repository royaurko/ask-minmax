The NA61/SHINE collaboration performed measurements of pC interactions at 31
GeV/c beam momentum with a full size replica of the T2K target (1.9 interaction
length) during a pilot run in 2007. Larger statistics runs were also conducted
in 2009 and 2010. The NA61/SHINE setup consists in a large acceptance
spectrometer located on the H2 beamline of the SPS at CERN. For the first time,
the kinematical phase space of interest for an accelerator based neutrino
experiment (i.e. kinematical phase space of pions/kaons exiting the target and
producing neutrinos in the direction of the near and far detectors) is fully
covered by a single hadron production experiment. In a first stage, yields of
positively charged pions were measured at the surface of the target. The
analysis of the 2007 data set presented here demonstrates that a) high quality
long target data were successfully taken with the NA61/SHINE apparatus, and b)
for the first time, the T2K neutrino flux predictions can effectively be
re-weighted with the NA61/SHINE long target data.
