We investigate a type of emerging user-assisted mobile applications or
services, referred to as Dynamic Mobile Ad-hoc Crowd Service (DMACS), such as
collaborative streaming via smartphones or location privacy protection through
a crowd of smartphone users. Such services are provided and consumed by users
carrying smart mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) who are in close proximity of
each other (e.g., within Bluetooth range). Users in a DMACS system dynamically
arrive and depart over time, and are divided into multiple possibly overlapping
groups according to radio range constraints. Crucial to the success of such
systems is a mechanism that incentivizes users' participation and ensures fair
trading. In this paper, we design a multi-market, dynamic double auction
mechanism, referred to as M-CHAIN, and show that it is truthful, feasible,
individual-rational, no-deficit, and computationally efficient. The novelty and
significance of M-CHAIN is that it addresses and solves the fair trading
problem in a multi-group or multi-market dynamic double auction problem which
naturally occurs in a mobile wireless environment. We demonstrate its
efficiency via simulations based on generated user patterns (stochastic
arrivals, random market clustering of users) and real-world traces.
