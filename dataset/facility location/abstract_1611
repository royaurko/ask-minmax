We describe the core components of the architecture for the (NSDL) National
Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Education Digital Library.
Over time the NSDL will include heterogeneous users, content, and services. To
accommodate this, a design for a technical and organization infrastructure has
been formulated based on the notion of a spectrum of interoperability. This
paper describes the first phase of the interoperability infrastructure
including the metadata repository, search and discovery services, rights
management services, and user interface portal facilities.
