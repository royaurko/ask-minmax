In order to explore how the FR I / FR II dichotomy is related to the nuclear
properties of radio galaxies, we studied a complete sample of 26 nearby FR II
radio galaxies using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and compared them with
a sample of FR I previously analyzed. FR I nuclei lie in the radio-optical
luminosity plane along a tight linear correlation, which argues for a common
synchrotron origin. FR II show a more complex behavior, which is however
clearly related to their optical spectral classification.
  Broad line FR II radio galaxies (BLRG) are located overall well above the FR
I correlation, suggesting that a contribution from thermal (disc) emission is
present. Three narrow line (NLRG) and one weak line radio galaxy (WLRG), in
which no nuclear source is seen, can be interpreted as the obscured
counter-parts of BLRG, in agreement with the current unification schemes.
  Conversely, in 5 sources of the sample, all of them NLRG or WLRG, optical
cores are located on the same correlation defined by FR I and with similar
radio and optical luminosities. This suggests that, in analogy to FR I, the
emission is dominated by synchrotron radiation and represents the optical
counter-part of the non-thermal radio cores. Interestingly, all these galaxies
are located in clusters, an environment typical of FR I.
  These results imply that, at least at low redshifts, the FR II population is
not homogeneous. Furthermore, the traditional dichotomy between edge darkened
and brightened radio morphology is not univocally connected with the innermost
nuclear structure, as we find FR~II with FR I-like nuclei and this has
interesting bearings from the point of view of the AGN unified models.
