Over the past two decades synchrotron facilities dedicated to the generation
of x-rays for study of atoms, molecules and condensed matter have proliferated
all over the world. As a result of the special properties of x-rays produced by
these machines, there has been an enormous growth in the experimental
possibilities. In this work we will demonstrate how these special properties
can be used to carry out hitherto impossible measurements of the Angstrom level
structure of the free surfaces of liquids. We demonstrate that surface
structure of liquids is often different from that of the bulk.
  A large part of this thesis is devoted to surface-induced atomic or molecular
layering phenomenon in metallic and dielectric liquids. In Chapters 1 through
10 we describe surface features of high-surface tension metals (Ga, In, Hg,
Sn), as well as alkali metals (K, KNa) and water. The second part of the thesis
(Chapters 11 through 16) is devoted to surface of binary metallic alloys (GaIn,
HgAu, KNa, BiIn and GaBi), investigating a wide range of surface phenomena such
as Gibbs adsorption and the tetra-point nanoscale wetting.
