Recent analysis of the distribution of clusters of galaxies is reviewed.
Clusters of galaxies located in rich superclusters form a quasiregular lattice
similar in structure to honeycombs. The power spectrum of clusters of galaxies
has a sharp peak at wavelength 120 Mpc corresponding to the lattice step. The
peak in the spectrum may be due to processes during the inflationary stage of
the structure evolution.
