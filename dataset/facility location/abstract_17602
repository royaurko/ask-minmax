Using the High Resolution Camera onboard the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we
have measured an accurate position for the bright persistent neutron-star X-ray
binary and atoll source GX 3+1. At a location that is consistent with this new
position we have discovered the near-infrared (NIR) counterpart to GX 3+1 in
images taken with the PANIC and FourStar cameras on the Magellan Baade
Telescope. The identification of this K_s=15.8+-0.1 mag star as the counterpart
is based on the presence of a Br-gamma emission line in a NIR spectrum taken
with the FIRE spectrograph on the Baade Telescope. The absolute magnitude
derived from the best available distance estimate to GX 3+1 indicates that the
mass donor in the system is not a late-type giant. We find that the NIR light
in GX 3+1 is likely dominated by the contribution from a heated outer accretion
disk. This is similar to what has been found for the NIR flux from the brighter
class of Z sources, but unlike the behavior of atolls fainter (Lx ~ 1e36 to
1e37 erg/s) than GX 3+1, where optically-thin synchrotron emission from a jet
probably dominates the NIR flux.
