We present synthetic line profiles as predicted by the models of 2-D line-
driven disk winds due to Proga, Stone & Drew. We compare the model line
profiles with HST observations of the cataclysmic variable IX Vel. The model
wind consists of a slow outflow that is bounded on the polar side by a fast
stream. We find that these two components of the wind produce distinct spectral
features. The fast stream produces profiles which show features consistent with
observations. These include the appearance of the P-Cygni shape for a range of
inclinations, the location of the maximum depth of the absorption component at
velocities less than the terminal velocity, and the transition from absorption
to emission with increasing inclination. However the model profiles have too
little absorption or emission equivalent width. This quantitative difference
between our models and observations is not a surprise because the line-driven
wind models predict a mass loss rate that is lower than the rate required by
the observations. We note that the model profiles exhibit a double-humped
structure near the line center which is not echoed in observations. We identify
this structure with a non-negligible redshifted absorption which is formed in
the slow component of the wind where the rotational velocity dominates over
expansion velocity. We conclude that the next generation of disk wind models,
developed for application to CVs, needs to yield stronger wind driving out to
larger disk radii than do the present models.
