The paper presents the newly developed dynamic spatial general equilibrium
model of European Commission, RHOMOLO. The model incorporates several elements
from economic geography in a novel and theoretically consistent way. It
describes the location choice of different types of agents and captures the
interplay between agglomeration and dispersion forces in determining the
spatial equilibrium. The model is also dynamic as it allows for the
accumulation of factors of production, human capital and technology. This makes
RHOMOLO well suited for simulating policy scenario related to the EU cohesion
policy and for the analysis of its impact on the regions and the Member States
of the union.
