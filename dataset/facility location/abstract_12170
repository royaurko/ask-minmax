We address some open questions regarding the phase diagram of the
one-dimensional Hubbard model with asymmetric hopping coefficients and balanced
species. In the attractive regime we present a numerical study of the passage
from on-site pairing dominant correlations at small asymmetries to
charge-density waves in the region with markedly different hopping
coefficients. In the repulsive regime we exploit two analytical treatments in
the strong- and weak-coupling regimes in order to locate the onset of phase
separation at small and large asymmetries respectively.
