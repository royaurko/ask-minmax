The Kamilaroi people and their neighbours, the Euahlayi, Ngemba, and
Murrawarri, are an Aboriginal cultural grouping located in the northwest and
north central of New South Wales. They have a rich history, but have been
missed in much of the literature concerned with sky knowledge in culture. This
study collected stories, some of which have not previously been reported in an
academic format, from Aboriginal people practicing their culture, augmented
with stories from the literature, and analysed the data to create a database of
sky knowledge that will be added to the larger body of Aboriginal cultural
knowledge in Australia. We found that there is a strong sky culture reflected
in the stories, and we also explored the stories for evidence of an
ethnoscientific approach to knowledge of the sky.
