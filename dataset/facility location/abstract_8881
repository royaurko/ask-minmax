New observations of the Magellanic Cloud Luminous Blue Variable candidate
S119 (HD269687) show the relationship of the star to its environs. Echelle
spectroscopy and high-resolution HST imagery reveal an expanding bubble
centered on the star. This bubble appears in both Halpha and [NII] and is
noticeably brighter on the near (blue-shifted) side. The systemic velocity of
both the expanding bubble and the star itself (as seen by the very broad Halpha
emission feature in the stellar spectrum) is V_hel=160 km/s whereas the
velocity of the superposed LMC ISM is 250-300 km/s. ISM absorption features
seen in FUSE spectra reveal components at both stellar and LMC velocities. Thus
we conclude that S119 is located within the LMC ISM and that the bubble is
interacting strongly with the ISM in a bow shock.
