The selection of the GLAST burst monitor (GBM) by NASA will allow the
investigation of the relation between the keV and the MeV-GeV emission from
gamma-ray bursts. The GBM consists of 12 NaI and 2 BGO crystals allowing a
continuous measurement of the energy spectra of gamma-ray bursts from ~5 keV to
\~30 MeV. One feature of the GBM is its high time resolution for time-resolved
gamma-ray spectroscopy. Moreover the arrangement of the NaI crystals allows a
rapid on-board location (<15 degrees) of a gamma-ray burst within a FoV of ~8.6
sr. This position will be communicated to the main instrument of GLAST making
follow-up observations at high energies possible.
