We report on the experimental observation of two-dimensional solitons located
in a defect channel at the surface of a hexagonal waveguide array. The
threshold power for the excitation of defect surface solitons existing due to
total internal reflection grows with decrease of the refractive index in
negative defects and vanishes for sufficiently strong positive defects.
Negative defects can also support linear surface modes existing due to
Bragg-type reflections.
