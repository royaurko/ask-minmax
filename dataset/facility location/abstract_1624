We represent and discuss a theory of gravitational holography in which all
the involved waves; subject, reference and illuminator are gravitational waves
(GW). Although these waves are so weak that no terrestrial experimental
set-ups, even the large LIGO, VIRGO, GEO and TAMA facilities, were able up to
now to directly detect them they are, nevertheless, known under certain
conditions (such as very small wavelengths) to be almost indistinguishable (see
P. 962 in Ref. \cite{mtw}) from their analogue electromagnetic waves (EMW). We,
therefore theoretically, show, using the known methods of optical holography
and taking into account the very peculiar nature of GW, that it is also
possible to reconstruct subject gravitational waves.
