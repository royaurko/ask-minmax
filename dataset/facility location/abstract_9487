We present medium-resolution optical spectra of the secondary star in the
high Galactic latitude black hole X-ray binary XTE J1118+480 and determine the
abundance of Mg, Al, Ca, Fe, and Ni in its atmosphere. For all the elements
investigated we find supersolar abundances; thus, we reject the hypothesis that
the black hole came from the direct collapse of an ancient massive halo star.
The compact primary most likely formed in a supernova event of a massive star
whose nucleosynthetic products polluted the secondary star. The observed
element abundances and their ratios can be explained using a variety of
supernova models with a wide range of metallicities. While an explosive origin
in the Galactic halo or thick disk cannot be discarded, a metal-rich progenitor
is clearly favored by the observed abundance pattern. This suggests that the
black hole was produced in the Galactic thin disk with a violent natal kick,
propelling the X-ray binary to its current location and orbit.
