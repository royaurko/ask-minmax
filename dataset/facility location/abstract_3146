Decisions on settlement location in the face of climate change and coastal
inundation may have resulted in success, survival or even catastrophic failure
for early settlers in many parts of the world. In this study we investigate
various questions related to how individuals respond to a palaeoenvironmental
simulation, on an interactive tabletop device where participants have the
opportunity to build a settlement on a coastal landscape, balancing safety and
access to resources, including sea and terrestrial foodstuffs, whilst taking
into consideration the threat of rising sea levels. The results of the study
were analysed to consider whether decisions on settlement were predicated to be
near to locations where previous structures were located, stigmergically, and
whether later settler choice would fare better, and score higher, as time
progressed. The proximity of settlements was investigated and the reasons for
clustering were considered. The interactive simulation was exhibited to
thousands of visitors at the 2012 Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition at
the Europes Lost World exhibit. 347 participants contributed to the simulation,
providing a sufficiently large sample of data for analysis.
