Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a CAD-based human-robot
interface that allows non-expert users to teach a robot in a manner similar to
that used by human beings to teach each other.
  Design/methodology/approach - Intuitive robot programming is achieved by
using CAD drawings to generate robot programs off-line. Sensory feedback allows
minimization of the effects of uncertainty, providing information to adjust the
robot paths during robot operation.
  Findings - It was found that it is possible to generate a robot program from
a common CAD drawing and run it without any major concerns about calibration or
CAD model accuracy.
  Research limitations/implications - A limitation of the proposed system has
to do with the fact that it was designed to be used for particular
technological applications.
  Practical implications - Since most manufacturing companies have CAD packages
in their facilities today, CAD-based robot programming may be a good option to
program robots without the need for skilled robot programmers.
  Originality/value - The paper proposes a new CAD-based robot programming
system. Robot programs are directly generated from a CAD drawing running on a
commonly available 3D CAD package (Autodesk Inventor) and not from a
commercial, computer aided robotics (CAR) software, making it a simple CAD
integrated solution. This is a low-cost and low-setup time system where no
advanced robot programming skills are required to operate it. In summary, robot
programs are generated with a high-level of abstraction from the robot
language.
