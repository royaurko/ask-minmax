Thin gap chambers (TGCs) are built for the muon trigger chambers in the
endcap region of the LHC experiment ATLAS. More than 2500 ATLAS TGCs are being
produced at the Weizmann institute in Israel, and in Shandong University in
China. Detailed testing of these chambers is performed at the Technion and at
the Tel-Aviv University. Two cosmic ray hodoscopes for testing the operation of
these detectors were built in Israel. In these hodoscopes the response of the
chambers to energetic cosmic ray muons is recorded and analyzed. The hodoscopes
measure the exact time and space location of the cosmic ray hit and read out
the chambers which are being tested to verify that they produce a corresponding
signal within the required time interval. The cosmic ray hodoscopes built at
the Technion and at the Tel Aviv University for the test of ATLAS TGCs are
described. The mechanical structure, readout electronics, data acquisition and
operating scheme are presented. Typical TGC test results are presented and
discussed.
