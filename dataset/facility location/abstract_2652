The MCNP code was used to study the characteristics of gamma radiation field
with collimated beam geometry. A close-to-reality simulation model of the
facility was used for calculation air-kerma along the whole range of
source-detector-distance (SDD) along the central beam and air-kerma off-axis
beam profiles at two different source-detector-distance (SDD). The simulation
results were tested by the measured results which were acquired in the
Radiation Metrology Center of CIAE. Other characteristics such as the
individual contributions of photons scattered in collimator, floor, walls,
mobile platform and other parts of the irradiation halls to the total air kerma
rate on the beam axis were calculated for the purpose of future improvement of
metrological parameters in CIAE. Finally, factors which influence the
simulation results were investigated, including e.g., detector volume effects
or source density effects.
