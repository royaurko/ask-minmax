In the course of our ongoing multiplicity study of exoplanet host stars we
detected a faint companion located at ~43arcsec (480AU physical projected
separation) north-west of its primary -- the exoplanet host star HD3651 at
11pc. The companion, HD3651B, clearly shares the proper motion of the exoplanet
host star in our four images, obtained with ESO/NTT and UKIRT, spanning three
years in epoch difference. The magnitude of the companion is H=16.75+-0.16mag,
the faintest co-moving companion of an exoplanet host star imaged directly.
HD3651B is not detected in the POSS-II B-, R- and I-band images, indicating
that this object is fainter than ~20mag in the B- and R-band and fainter than
\~19mag in the I-band. With the Hipparcos distance of HD3651 of 11pc, the
absolute magnitude of HD3651B is about 16.5mag in the H band. Our H-band
photometry and the Baraffe et al. (2003) evolutionary models yield a mass of
HD3651B to be 20 to 60MJup for assumed ages between 1 and 10Gyr. The effective
temperature ranges between 800 and 900K, consistent with a spectral type of T7
to T8. We conclude that HD3651B is a brown-dwarf companion, the first of its
kind directly imaged as a companion of an exoplanet host star, and one of the
faintest T dwarfs found in the solar vicinity (within 11pc).
