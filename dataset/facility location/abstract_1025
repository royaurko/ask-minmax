Recently the generation of electron bunch trains with sub-picosecond time
structure has been experimentally demonstrated at the A0 photoinjector of
Fermilab using a transverse-longitudinal phase-space exchange beamline. The
temporal profile of the bunch train can be easily tuned to meet the
requirements of the applications of modern accelerator beams. In this paper we
report the A0 bunch-train experiment and explore numerically the possible
extension of this technique to shorter time scales at the Fermilab SRF
Accelerator Test Facility, a superconducting linear electron accelerator
currently under construction in the NML building.
