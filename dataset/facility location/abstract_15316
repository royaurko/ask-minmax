The ``central engine'' of AGN is thought to be powered by accretion on a
central nucleus believed to be a super-massive black hole. The localization and
exact mechanism of the energy release in AGN are still not well understood. We
present observational evidence for the link between variability of the radio
emission of the compact jet, optical and X-ray continua emission and ejections
of new jet components in the radio galaxy 3C 390.3. The time delays between the
light curves of the individual jet components and the light curve of the
optical continuum are estimated by using minimization methods and the discret
correlation function. We find that the variations of the optical continuum are
correlated with radio emission from a stationary feature in the jet. This
correlation indicates that the source of variable non-thermal continuum
radiation is located in the innermost part of the relativistic jet. We suggest
that the continuum emission from the jet and counterjet ionizes material in a
subrelativistic outflow surrounding the jet, which results in a formation of
two conical regions with broad emission lines (in addition to the conventional
broad line region around the central nucleus) at a distance more or equal to
0.4 parsecs from the central engine. Implications for modeling of the
broad-line regions are discussed.
