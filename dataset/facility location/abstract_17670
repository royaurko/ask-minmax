Let $\pi(n)$ denote the prime-counting function and let
$$f(n)=\left|\left\lfloor\log n-\lfloor\log
n\rfloor-0.1\right\rfloor\right|\left\lfloor\frac{\left\lfloor n/\lfloor\log
n-1\rfloor\right\rfloor\lfloor\log n-1\rfloor}{n}\right\rfloor\text{.}$$ In
this paper we prove that if $n$ is an integer $\ge 60184$ and $f(n)=0$, then
$\pi(n)$ does not divide $n$. We also show that if $n\ge 60184$ and $\pi(n)$
divides $n$, then $f(n)=1$. In addition, we prove that if $n\ge 60184$ and
$n/\pi(n)$ is an integer, then $n$ is a multiple of $\lfloor\log n-1\rfloor$
located in the interval $[e^{\lfloor\log n-1\rfloor+1},e^{\lfloor\log
n-1\rfloor+1.1}]$. This allows us to show that if $c$ is any fixed integer $\ge
12$, then in the interval $[e^c,e^{c+0.1}]$ there is always an integer $n$ such
that $\pi(n)$ divides $n$.
  Let $S$ denote the sequence of integers generated by the function
$d(n)=n/\pi(n)$ (where $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $n>1$) and let $S_k$ denote the
$k$th term of sequence $S$. Here we ask the question whether there are
infinitely many positive integers $k$ such that $S_k=S_{k+1}$.
