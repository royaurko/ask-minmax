We test the utility of the nPI formalism for solving nonperturbative dynamics
of gauge theories by applying it to study the phase diagram of SU(N) Higgs
theory in 3 Euclidean spacetime dimensions. Solutions reveal standard
signatures of a first order phase transition with a critical endpoint leading
to a crossover regime, in qualitative agreement with lattice studies. The
location of the critical endpoint, x sim 0.14 for SU(2) with a fundamental
Higgs, is in rough but not tight quantitative agreement with the lattice. We
end by commenting on the overall effectiveness and limitations of an nPI
effective action based study. In particular, we have been unable to find an nPI
gauge-fixing procedure which can simultaneously display the right phase
structure and correctly handle the large-VEV Higgs region. We explain why doing
so appears to be a serious challenge.
