We discuss a method for determining the optimally-localized set of
generalized Wannier functions associated with a set of Bloch bands in a
crystalline solid. By ``generalized Wannier functions'' we mean a set of
localized orthonormal orbitals spanning the same space as the specified set of
Bloch bands. Although we minimize a functional that represents the total spread
sum_n [ <r^2>_n - <r>_n^2 ] of the Wannier functions in real space, our method
proceeds directly from the Bloch functions as represented on a mesh of
k-points, and carries out the minimization in a space of unitary matrices
U_mn^k describing the rotation among the Bloch bands at each k-point. The
method is thus suitable for use in connection with conventional
electronic-structure codes. The procedure also returns the total electric
polarization as well as the location of each Wannier center. Sample results for
Si, GaAs, molecular C2H4, and LiCl will be presented.
