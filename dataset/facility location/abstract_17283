A posteriori anisotropy study of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with
the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) has shown evidence of excess of cosmic ray
particles above 55 EeV within $18^{\circ}$ of the direction of the radio galaxy
Centaurus A. However, the origin of the excess remains elusive. We simulate the
propagation of different species of particles coming from the direction of
Centaurus A in the Galactic magnetic fields, and find that only particles of
nuclear charge $Z\la 10$ can avoid being deflected outside of the $18^{\circ}$
window of Centaurus A. On the other hand, considering the increasingly heavy
composition of UHECRs at the highest energies measured by PAO, a plausible
scenario for cosmic rays from the direction of Centaurus A can be found if they
consist of intermediate-mass nuclei. The chemical composition of cosmic rays
can be further constrained by lower-energy cosmic rays of the same rigidity. We
find that cosmic ray acceleration in the lobes of Centaurus A is not favored,
while acceleration in the stellar winds that are rich in intermediate-mass
nuclei, could meet the requirement. This suggests that the observed excess may
originate from cosmic ray accelerators induced by stellar explosions in the
star-forming regions of Centaurus A and/or the Centaurus cluster located behind
Centaurus A.
