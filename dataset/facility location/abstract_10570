We propose a theoretical Hugoniot obtained by combining results for the
equation of state (EOS) from the Direct Path Integral Monte Carlo technique
(DPIMC) and those from Reaction Ensemble Monte Carlo (REMC) simulations. The
main idea of such proposal is based on the fact that DPMIC provides
first-principle results for a wide range of densities and temperatures
including the region of partially ionized plasmas. On the other hand, for lower
temperatures where the formation of molecules becomes dominant, DPIMC
simulations become cumbersome and inefficient. For this region it is possible
to use accurate REMC simulations where bound states (molecules) are treated on
the Born-Oppenheimer level using a binding potential calculated by Kolos and
Wolniewicz. The remaining interaction is then reduced to the scattering between
neutral particles which is reliably treated classically applying effective
potentials. The resulting Hugoniot is located between the experimental values
of Knudson {\textit{et al.}} \cite{1} and Collins {\textit{et al.}} \cite{2}.
