We present deep near-infrared (J, H, Ks) images toward an embedded cluster
which lies in a C18O clump in the cloud C of the Vela Molecular Ridge. This
cluster has at least ~ 350 members and a radius of ~ 0.5 pc. The stellar
surface number density is approximately 3000 stars pc^-2 in the central 0.1 pc
x 0.1 pc region of the cluster. This is much higher than most of the young
clusters within 1 kpc of the Sun. From the comparison of the luminosity
function and near-infrared excess fraction with those of other embedded
clusters, we estimate that the age of this cluster is approximately 2-3 Myr.
This cluster exhibits an excess of brighter stars in its central region, from
which we conclude that the more massive stars are located near the cluster
center.
