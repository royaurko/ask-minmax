The latitudinal location of the sunspot zones in each hemisphere is
determined by calculating the centroid position of sunspot areas for each solar
rotation from May 1874 to June 2011. When these centroid positions are plotted
and analyzed as functions of time from each sunspot cycle maximum there appears
to be systematic differences in the positions and equatorward drift rates as a
function of sunspot cycle amplitude. If, instead, these centroid positions are
plotted and analyzed as functions of time from each sunspot cycle minimum then
most of the differences in the positions and equatorward drift rates disappear.
The differences that remain disappear entirely if curve fitting is used to
determine the starting times (which vary by as much as 8 months from the times
of minima). The sunspot zone latitudes and equatorward drift measured relative
to this starting time follow a standard path for all cycles with no dependence
upon cycle strength or hemispheric dominance. Although Cycle 23 was peculiar in
its length and the strength of the polar fields it produced, it too shows no
significant variation from this standard. This standard law, and the lack of
variation with sunspot cycle characteristics, is consistent with Dynamo Wave
mechanisms but not consistent with current Flux Transport Dynamo models for the
equatorward drift of the sunspot zones.
