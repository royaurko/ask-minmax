This paper is devoted to the study of directional minimal time functions that
specify the minimal time for a vector to reach an object following its given
direction. We provide a careful analysis of general and generalized
differentiation properties of this class of functions. The analysis allows us
to study a new model of facility location that involves sets. This is a
continuation of our effort in applying variational analysis to facility
location problems.
