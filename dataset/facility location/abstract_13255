In this paper we generalize an argument of Neukirch from birational anabelian
geometry to the case of arithmetic curves. In contrast to the function field
case, it seems to be more complicate to describe the position of decomposition
groups of points at the boundary of the scheme $\Spec \caO_{K,S}$, where $K$ is
a number field and $S$ a set of primes of $K$, intrinsically in terms of the
fundamental group. We prove that it is equivalent to give the following pieces
of information additionally with the fundamental group $\pi_1(\Spec
\caO_{K,S})$: the location of decomposition groups of boundary points inside
it, the $p$-part of the cyclotomic character, the number of points on the
boundary of all finite etale covers, etc. Under certain finiteness hypothesis
on Tate-Shafarevich groups with divisible coefficients, one can reconstruct all
this quantities from the fundamental group alone.
