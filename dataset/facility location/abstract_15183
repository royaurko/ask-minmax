Polarized diffuse emission observations at 2.3 GHz in a high Galactic
latitude area are presented. The 2\degr X 2\degr field, centred in
(\alpha=5^h,\delta=-49\degr), is located in the region observed by the
BOOMERanG experiment. Our observations has been carried out with the Parkes
Radio telescope and represent the highest frequency detection done to date in
low emission areas. Because of a weaker Faraday rotation action, the high
frequency allows an estimate of the Galactic synchrotron contamination of the
Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization (CMBP) that is more reliable than that
done at 1.4 GHz. We find that the angular power spectra of the E- and B-modes
have slopes of \beta_E = -1.46 +/- 0.14 and \beta_B = -1.87 +/- 0.22,
indicating a flattening with respect to 1.4 GHz. Extrapolated up to 32 GHz, the
E-mode spectrum is about 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of the CMBP,
allowing a clean detection even at this frequency. The best improvement
concerns the B-mode, for which our single-dish observations provide the first
estimate of the contamination on angular scales close to the CMBP peak (about 2
degrees). We find that the CMBP B-mode should be stronger than synchrotron
contamination at 90 GHz for models with T/S > 0.01. This low level could move
down to 60-70 GHz the optimal window for CMBP measures.
