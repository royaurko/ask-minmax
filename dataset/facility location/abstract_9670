In this paper we show how transmission metallic gratings with very narrow and
deep enough slits can exhibit transmission resonances for wavelengths larger
than the period of the grating. By using a transfer matrix formalism and a
quasi-analytical model based on a modal expansion, we show that there are two
possible ways of transferring light from the upper surface to the lower one: by
the excitation of coupled surface plasmon polaritons on both surfaces of the
metallic grating or by the coupling of incident plane waves with waveguide
resonances located in the slits. Both mechanisms can lead to almost perfect
transmittance for those particular resonances.
