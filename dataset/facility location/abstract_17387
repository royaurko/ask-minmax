The flux and nuclear composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays depend on
the cosmic distribution of their sources. Data from cosmic ray observatories
are yet inconclusive about their exact location or distribution, but provide a
measure for the average local density of these emitters. Due to the
discreteness of the emitters the flux and nuclear composition is expected to
show ensemble fluctuations on top of the statistical variations, i.e. "cosmic
variance". This effect is strongest for the most energetic cosmic rays due to
the limited propagation distance in the cosmic radiation background and is
hence a local phenomenon. For the statistical analysis of cosmic ray emission
models it is important to quantify the possible level of this variance. In this
paper we present a completely analytic method that describes the variation of
the flux and nuclear composition with respect to the local source density. We
highlight that proposed future space-based observatories with exposures of
O(10^6 km^2 sr yr) will attain sensitivity to observe these spectral
fluctuations in the cosmic ray energy spectrum at Earth relative to the overall
power-law fit.
