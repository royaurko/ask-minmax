We study stochastic billiards on general tables: a particle moves according
to its constant velocity inside some domain ${\mathcal D} \subset {\mathbb
R}^d$ until it hits the boundary and bounces randomly inside according to some
reflection law. We assume that the boundary of the domain is locally Lipschitz
and almost everywhere continuously differentiable. The angle of the outgoing
velocity with the inner normal vector has a specified, absolutely continuous
density. We construct the discrete time and the continuous time processes
recording the sequence of hitting points on the boundary and the pair
location/velocity. We mainly focus on the case of bounded domains. Then, we
prove exponential ergodicity of these two Markov processes, we study their
invariant distribution and their normal (Gaussian) fluctuations. Of particular
interest is the case of the cosine reflection law: the stationary distributions
for the two processes are uniform in this case, the discrete time chain is
reversible though the continuous time process is quasi-reversible. Also in this
case, we give a natural construction of a chord "picked at random" in
${\mathcal D}$, and we study the angle of intersection of the process with a
$(d-1)$-dimensional manifold contained in ${\mathcal D}$.
