The method of analytic continuation from imaginary to real chemical
potentials $\mu$ is one of the few available techniques to study QCD at finite
temperature and baryon density. One of its most appealing applications is the
determination of the critical line for small $\mu$: we perform a direct test of
the validity of the method in this case by studying two-color QCD, where the
sign problem is absent. The (pseudo)critical line is found to be analytic
around $\mu^2 = 0$, but a very large precision would be needed at imaginary
$\mu$ to correctly predict the location of the critical line at real $\mu$.
