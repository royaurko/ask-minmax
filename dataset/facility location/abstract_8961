The "core" of a radio source is believed to mark the frequency-dependent
location where the optical depth to synchrotron self--absorption tau_s~1. The
frequency dependence can be used for derive physical conditions of the radio
emitting region and the ambient environment near the central engine of the
radio source. In order to test and improve the models to derive this
information, we made multi-frequency dual-polarization observations of 3C309.1
in 1998.6, phase-referenced to the QSOs S5 1448+76 and 4C72.20 (S5 1520+72)
(4d26' and 1d49' away, respectively). We present here preliminary results from
these observations: total and polarized intensity maps, spectral information
deduced from these images, and the relative position of 3C309.1 with respect to
S5 1448+76 at different frequencies. Finally, we discuss briefly the observed
shift of the core position.
