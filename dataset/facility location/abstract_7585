Intersections of thick, plane SU(2) center vortices are characterized by the
topological charge |Q|=1/2. We compare such intersections with the distribution
of zeromodes of the Dirac operator in the fundamental and adjoint
representation using both the overlap and asqtad staggered fermion formulations
in SU(2) lattice gauge theory. We analyze configurations with four
intersections and find that the probability density distribution of fundamental
zeromodes in the intersection plane differs significantly from the one obtained
analytically in [Phys.\ Rev.\ D 66, 85004 (2002)]. The Dirac eigenmodes are
clearly sensitive to the traces of the Polyakov (Wilson) lines and do not
exactly locate topological charge contributions. Although, the adjoint Dirac
operator is able to produce zeromodes for configurations with topological
charge |Q|=1/2, they do not locate single vortex intersections, as we prove by
forming arbitrary linear combinations of these zeromodes - their scalar density
peaks at least at two intersection points. With pairs of thin and thick
vortices we realize a situation similar to configurations with topological
charge |Q|=1/2. For such configurations the zeromodes do not localize in the
regions of fractional topological charge contribution but spread over the whole
lattice, avoiding regions of negative traces of Polyakov lines.
