Matrices are the most common representations of graphs. They are also used
for the representation of algebras and cluster algebras. This paper shows some
properties of matrices in order to facilitate the understanding and locating
symmetrizable matrices with specific characteristics, called positive
quasi-Cartan companion matrices. Here, symmetrizable matrix are those which are
symmetric when multiplied by a diagonal matrix with positive entries called
symmetrizer matrix. Four algorithms are developed: one to decide whether there
is a symmetrizer matrix; second to find such symmetrizer matrix; another to
decide whether the matrix is positive or not; and the last to find a positive
quasi-Cartan companion matrix, if there exists. The third algorithm is used to
prove that the problem to decide if a matrix has a positive quasi-Cartan
companion is NP.
