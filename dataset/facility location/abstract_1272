A general result on the explicit form of the general error locator polynomial
for all cyclic codes is given, along with several specific results for classes
of cyclic codes. From these, a theoretically justification of the sparsity of
the general error locator polynomial is obtained for all cyclic codes with
$t\leq 3$ and $n<63$, except for three cases.
