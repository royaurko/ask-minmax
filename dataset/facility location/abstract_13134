We propose a new scheme for increasing the throughput of video files in
cellular communications systems. This scheme exploits (i) the redundancy of
user requests as well as (ii) the considerable storage capacity of smartphones
and tablets. Users cache popular video files and - after receiving requests
from other users - serve these requests via device-to-device localized
transmissions. The file placement is optimal when a central control knows a
priori the locations of wireless devices when file requests occur. However,
even a purely random caching scheme shows only a minor performance loss
compared to such a genie-aided scheme. We then analyze the optimal
collaboration distance, trading off frequency reuse with the probability of
finding a requested file within the collaboration distance. We show that an
improvement of spectral efficiency of one to two orders of magnitude is
possible, even if there is not very high redundancy in video requests.
