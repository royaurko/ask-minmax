We propose a novel RG method to specify the location of the IR fixed point in
lattice gauge theories and apply it to the $SU(3)$ gauge theories with $N_f$
fundamental fermions. It is based on the scaling behavior of the propagator
through the RG analysis with a finite IR cut-off, which we cannot remove in the
conformal field theories in sharp contrast with the confining theories. The
method also enables us to estimate the anomalous mass dimension in the
continuum limit at the IR fixed point. We perform the program for $N_f=16, 12,
8 $ and $N_f=7$ and indeed identify the location of the IR fixed points in all
cases.
