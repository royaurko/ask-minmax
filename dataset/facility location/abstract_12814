Data warehouse store and provide access to large volume of historical data
supporting the strategic decisions of organisations. Data warehouse is based on
a multidimensional model which allow to express user's needs for supporting the
decision making process. Since it is estimated that 80% of data used for
decision making has a spatial or location component [1, 2], spatial data have
been widely integrated in Data Warehouses and in OLAP systems. Extending a
multidimensional data model by the inclusion of spatial data provides a concise
and organised spatial datawarehouse representation. This paper aims to provide
a comprehensive review of litterature on developed and suggested spatial and
spatio-temporel multidimensional models. A benchmarking study of the proposed
models is presented. Several evaluation criterias are used to identify the
existence of trends as well as potential needs for further investigations.
