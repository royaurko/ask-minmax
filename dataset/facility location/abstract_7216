We present the Chandra results of AX J1843.8-0352, a supernova remnant (SNR)
recently identified with ASCA. Chandra spatially resolved two components from
this SNR: non-thermal and thermal ones. The morphology of the non-thermal
component is clumpy and elliptical, elongated from the north to the south with
a mean diameter of about 9 arcmin. The spectrum is fitted with a power-law
model of photon index 2.1 and the east rim is associated with the non-thermal
radio sources C and F (Helfand et al. 1989). Therefore the non-thermal
component is probably synchrotron X-rays by energetic electrons accelerated at
the shell of the SNR. The thermal component is the brightest clump located
within the non-thermal component and shows a spectrum of a thin plasma of about
0.7 keV temperature. Notable discovery is its peculiar morphology; a head of 50
arcsec x 30 arcsec size near the south-east rim of the SNR and a 30 arcsec-long
``jet'' pointing to the southwest. Although this emission is associated with
the west part of the radio source F, the absorption is twice larger than that
of the non-thermal X-rays, or the bulk of the SNR emission. Therefore, it is
unclear whether this peculiar plasma is a thermal component associated with AX
J1843.8-0352, a Galactic source located in the far side of our Galaxy, or an
extragalactic source.
