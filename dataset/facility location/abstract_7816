We present results based on YJKs photometry of star clusters located in the
outermost, eastern region of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We analysed a
total of 51 catalogued clusters whose colour--magnitude diagrams (CMDs), having
been cleaned from field-star contamination, were used to assess the clusters'
reality and estimate ages of the genuine systems. Based on CMD analysis, 15
catalogued clusters were found to be possible non-genuine aggregates. We
investigated the properties of 80% of the catalogued clusters in this part of
the SMC by enlarging our sample with previously obtained cluster ages, adopting
a homogeneous scale for all. Their spatial distribution suggests that the
oldest clusters, log(t yr-1) >= 9.6, are in general located at greater
distances to the galaxy's centre than their younger counterparts -- 9.0 <=
log(t yr-1) <= 9.4 -- while two excesses of clusters are seen at log(t yr-1) ~
9.2 and log(t yr-1) ~ 9.7. We found a trail of younger clusters which follow
the Wing/Bridge components. This long spatial sequence does not only harbour
very young clusters, log(t yr-1) ~ 7.3, but it also hosts some of intermediate
ages, log(t yr-1) ~ 9.1. The derived cluster and field-star formation
frequencies as a function of age are different. The most surprising feature is
an observed excess of clusters with ages of log(t yr-1) < 9.0, which could have
been induced by interactions with the LMC.
