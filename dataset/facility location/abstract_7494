The lower limit to the distribution of orbital periods P for the current
population of close-in exoplanets shows a distinctive discontinuity located at
approximately one Jovian mass. Most smaller planets have orbital periods longer
than P~2.5 days, while higher masses are found down to P~1 day.
  We analyze whether this observed mass-period distribution could be explained
in terms of the combined effects of stellar tides and the interactions of
planets with an inner cavity in the gaseous disk.
  We performed a series of hydrodynamical simulations of the evolution of
single-planet systems in a gaseous disk with an inner cavity mimicking the
inner boundary of the disk. The subsequent tidal evolution is analyzed assuming
that orbital eccentricities are small and stellar tides are dominant.
  We find that most of the close-in exoplanet population is consistent with an
inner edge of the protoplanetary disk being located at approximately P>2 days
for solar-type stars, in addition to orbital decay having been caused by
stellar tides with a specific tidal parameter on the order of Q'*=10^7. The
data is broadly consistent with planets more massive than one Jupiter mass
undergoing type II migration, crossing the gap, and finally halting at the
interior 2/1 mean-motion resonance with the disk edge. Smaller planets do not
open a gap in the disk and remain trapped in the cavity edge. CoRoT-7b appears
detached from the remaining exoplanet population, apparently requiring
additional evolutionary effects to explain its current mass and semimajor axis.
