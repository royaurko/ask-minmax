We investigate the evolution of intracluster medium during a cluster merger,
explicitly considering the relaxation process between the ions and electrons by
N-body and hydrodynamical simulations. When two subclusters collide each other,
a bow shock is formed between the centers of two substructures and propagate in
both directions along the collision axis. The shock primarily heats the ions
because the kinetic energy of an ion entering the shock is larger than that of
an electron by the ratio of masses. In the post-shock region the energy is
transported from the ions to electrons via Coulomb coupling. However, since the
energy exchange timescale depends both on the gas density and temperature,
distribution of electron temperature becomes more complex than that of the
plasma mean temperature, especially in the expanding phase. After the collision
of two subclusters, gas outflow occurs not only along the collision axis but
also in its perpendicular direction. The gas which is originally located in the
central part of the subclusters moves both in the parallel and perpendicular
directions. Since the equilibrium timescale of the gas along these directions
is relatively short, temperature difference between ions and electrons is
larger in the directions tilted by the angles of $\pm 45^\circ$ with respect to
the collision axis. The electron temperature could be significantly lower that
the plasma mean temperature by $\sim 50 %$ at most. The significance of our
results in the interpretation of X-ray observations is briefly discussed.
