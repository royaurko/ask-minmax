A study of the strangeness production reaction pp->pK^+Lambda for excess
energies of epsilon \le 150 MeV, accessible at high-luminosity accelerator
facilities like COSY, is presented. Methods to analyze the Dalitz plot
distribution and angular spectra in the Jackson and helicity frames are worked
out and suitable observables for extracting information on low lying resonances
that couple to the K-Lambda system and for determining the Lambda-p
effective-range parameters from the final state interaction are identified and
discussed. Furthermore, the chances for identifying the reaction mechanism of
strangeness production are investigated.
