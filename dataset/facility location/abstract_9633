In their comment Fabrizio and Gogolin dispute our result of the enhancement
of the tunneling density of states in a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid at the
location of a backward scattering defect [Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 4230(1996);
cond-mat/9601020]. They state that the anticommutativity of the fermion
operators of the left and right moving electrons was not considered properly in
the Letter. We show in the Reply that the result of the Letter can be
reproduced following the Comment when its calculations are performed correctly.
This clearly indicates that the question about the anticommutation relations
was raised by Fabrizio and Gogolin without serious grounds.
