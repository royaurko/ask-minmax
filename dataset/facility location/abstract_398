4MOST (4m Multi Object Spectroscopic Telescope) is a spectroscopic facility
that will be installed on ESO's VISTA around 2020. The science rationale of
this facility are to be found in the ASTRONET Science Vision for European
Astronomy (de Zeeuw & Molster, 2007). Specifically fundamental contribution can
be made to the Extreme Universe (Dark Energy & Dark Matter, Black holes),
Galaxy Formation & Evolution, and the Origin of Stars science cases in the
ASTRONET Science Vision. The unique capabilities of the 4MOST facility are due
to by its large field-of-view, high multiplex, its broad optical spectral
wavelength coverage
