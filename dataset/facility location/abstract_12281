Context. One of the most striking discoveries of the INTEGRAL observatory is
the existence of a previously unknown population of X-ray sources in the inner
arms of the Galaxy. The investigations of the optical/NIR counterparts of some
of them have provided evidence that they are highly absorbed high mass X-ray
binaries hosting supergiants. Aims. We aim to identify the optical/NIR
counterpart of one of the newly discovered INTEGRAL sources, IGR J16283-4838,
and determine the nature of this system. Methods. We present optical and NIR
observations of the field of IGR J16283-4838, and use the astrometry and
photometry of the sources within it to identify its counterpart. We obtain its
NIR spectrum, and its optical/NIR spectral energy distribution by means of
broadband photometry. We search for the intrinsic polarization of its light,
and its short and long-term photometric variability. Results. We demonstrate
that this source is a highly absorbed HMXB located beyond the Galactic center,
and that it may be surrounded by a variable circumstellar medium.
