Around the globe the number of older people in relation to the rest is
constantly growing. As a result, medical and care facilities cannot handle the
growing number of patients. Therefore, elderly in-home assistance gets more
attention an importance. Due to issues regarding memory, physical strength and
reduced self-assessment, old people face a lot of challenges in accomplishing
their activities of daily living. This thesis is meant to address these
problems by analysing the required infrastructure of a home-care facility as
well as the arising issues regarding used components, especially wireless
sensors. After the analysis, a prototype of a home-care system is designed and
implemented. Furthermore, the issue of energy consumption of the used wireless
sensor node is addressed by modifying the intelligence of the used sensor.
After that, the design and components of the prototype used for the energy
consumption analysis is explained, together with the programming structure of
the sensor nodes used in this thesis. Thereupon, the results are of the
simulations are discussed and compared with the contributors' expectations. Finally
the overall outcomes of the thesis are analysed and summed up, followed by a
short outlook of further possible improvements and developments.
