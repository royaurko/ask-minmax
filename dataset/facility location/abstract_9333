Methanol masers are often detected in regions of intense star formation.
Several studies in the last decade indicate that they may even be the earliest
signpost of a high-mass star-forming region. Their powerful emission make them
very good candidates for observations using both single--dish telescopes and
interferometers, the latter allows detailed structural and dynamical studies of
these objects. We have prepared a catalogue of all known 6.7-GHz methanol
masers, discovered both by surveys that targeted possible associated objects
and unbiased surveys covering a large fraction of galactic longitudes across
the Galactic plane (-0.5deg <= b <= 0.5deg for most of the regions). The
catalogue contains 519 sources which are listed with their kinematic
(galactocentric and heliocentric) distances as well as possibly associated IR
objects. We find that 6.7-GHz methanol masers clearly trace the molecular ring
of our Galaxy, where most of the OB associations are located. The present list
of masers also reports detections of other masing transitions of methanol as
further information for the study of the maser phenomenon. In a further
publication we will address some statistical considerations.
