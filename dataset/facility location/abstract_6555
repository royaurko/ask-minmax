Three-dimensional numerical simulations of magnetoacoustic wave propagation
are performed in a sunspot atmosphere with a computational domain covering from
the photosphere to the chromosphere. The wave source, with properties
resembling the solar spectrum, is located at different distances from the axis
of the sunspot for each simulation. These results are compared with the theory
of mode transformation and also with observational features. Simulations show
that the dominant oscillation frequency in the chromosphere decreases with the
radial distance from the sunspot axis. The energy flux of the different wave
modes involved, including de Alfv\'en mode, is evaluated and discussed.
