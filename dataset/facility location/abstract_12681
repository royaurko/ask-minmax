We present a microscopic computation of the radio emission from air showers
initiated by ultra-high energy cosmic rays in the atmosphere. The strategy
adopted is to compute each secondary particle contribution of the
electromagnetic component and to construct the total signal at any location.
SELFAS2 is a code which doesn't rely on air shower generators like AIRES or
CORSIKA and it is based on the concept of air shower universality which makes
it completely autonomous. Each positron and electron of the air shower is
generated randomly following relevant distributions and tracking them along
their travel in the atmosphere. We confirm in this paper earlier results that
the radio emission is mainly due to the time derivative of the transverse
current and the time derivative of the charge excess. The time derivative of
the transverse current created by systematic deviations of charges in the
geomagnetic field is usually dominant compared to the charge excess
contribution except for the case of an air shower parallel to the geomagnetic
field.
