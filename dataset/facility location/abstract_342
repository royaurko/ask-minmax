The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is a next-generation optical synoptic
survey that builds on the experience and infrastructure of the Palomar
Transient Factory (PTF). Using a new 47 deg$^2$ survey camera, ZTF will survey
more than an order of magnitude faster than PTF to discover rare transients and
variables. I describe the survey and the camera design. Searches for young
supernovae, fast transients, counterparts to gravitational-wave detections, and
rare variables will benefit from ZTF's high cadence, wide area survey.
