The 18F(p,alpha) reaction was recognized as one of the most important for
gamma ray astronomy in novae as it governs the early 511 keV emission. However,
its rate remains largely uncertain at nova temperatures. A direct measurement
of the cross section over the full range of nova energies is impossible because
of its vanishing value at low energy and of the short 18F lifetime. Therefore,
in order to better constrain this reaction rate, we have performed an indirect
experiment taking advantage of the availability of a high purity and intense
radioactive 18F beam at the Louvain La Neuve RIB facility. We present here the
first results of the data analysis and discuss the consequences.
