Using the catalytic CO oxidation at RuO2(110) as a showcase, we employ
first-principles kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate the intricate
effects on temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy data brought about by
the mere correlations between the locations of the active sites at a
nanostructured surface. Even in the absence of lateral interactions, this
nanostructure alone can cause inhomogeneities that cannot be grasped by
prevalent mean-field data analysis procedures, which thus lead to wrong
conclusions on the reactivity of the different surface species.
