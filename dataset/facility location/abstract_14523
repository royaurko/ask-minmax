There is evidence for temperature fluctuations in Planetary Nebulae and in
Galactic HII regions. If such fluctuations occur in the low-metallicity,
extragalactic HII regions used to probe the primordial helium abundance, the
derived 4He mass fraction, Y_P, could be systematically different from the true
primordial value. For cooler, mainly high-metallicity HII regions the derived
helium abundance may be nearly unchanged but the oxygen abundance could have
been seriously underestimated. For hotter, mainly low-metallicity HII regions
the oxygen abundance is likely accurate but the helium abundance could be
underestimated. The net effect is to tilt the Y vs. Z relation, making it
flatter and resulting in a higher inferred Y_P. Although this effect could be
large, there are no data which allow us to estimate the size of the temperature
fluctuations for the extragalactic HII regions. Therefore, we have explored
this effect via Monte Carlos in which the abundances derived from a fiducial
data set are modified by \Delta-T chosen from a distribution with 0 < \Delta-T
< \Delta-T_max where \Delta-T_max is varied from 500K to 4000K. It is
interesting that although this effect shifts the locations of the HII regions
in Y vs. O/H plane, it does not introduce any significant additional
dispersion.
