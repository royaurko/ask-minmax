We assess the performances of the transition voltage spectroscopy (TVS)
method to determine the energies of the molecular orbitals involved in the
electronic transport though molecular junctions. A large number of various
molecular junctions made with alkyl chains but with different chemical
structure of the electrode-molecule interfaces are studied. In the case of
molecular junctions with clean, unoxidized electrode-molecule interfaces, i.e.
alkylthiols and alkenes directly grafted on Au and hydrogenated Si,
respectively, we measure transition voltages in the range 0.9 - 1.4 V. We
conclude that the TVS method allows estimating the onset of the tail of the
LUMO density of states, at energy located 1.0 - 1.2 eV above the electrode
Fermi energy. For oxidized interfaces (e.g. the same monolayer measured with Hg
or eGaIn drops, or monolayers formed on a slightly oxidized silicon substrate),
lower transition voltages (0.1 - 0.6 V) are systematically measured. These
values are explained by the presence of oxide-related density of states at
energies lower than the HOMO-LUMO of the molecules. As such, the TVS method is
a useful technique to assess the quality of the molecule-electrode interfaces
in molecular junctions.
