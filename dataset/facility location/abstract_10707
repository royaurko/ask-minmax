We present the results of our recent studies on a Thick Gas Electron
Multiplier (THGEM)-based imaging detector prototype. It consists of two 100x100
mm^2 THGEM electrodes in cascade, coupled to a resistive anode. The event
location is recorded with a 2D double-sided readout electrode equipped with
discrete delay-lines and dedicated electronics. The THGEM electrodes, produced
by standard printed-circuit board and mechanical drilling techniques, a 0.4 mm
thick with 0.5 mm diameter holes spaced by 1 mm. Localization resolutions of
about 0.7 mm (FWHM) were measured with soft x-rays, in a detector operated with
atmospheric-pressure Ar/CH4; good linearity and homogeneity were achieved. We
describe the imaging-detector layout, the resistive-anode 2D readout system and
the imaging properties. The THGEM has numerous potential applications that
require large-area imaging detectors, with high-rate capability,
single-electron sensitivity and moderate (sub-mm) localization resolution.
