The Public Key Infrastructure(PKI) provides facilities for data encryption,
digital signature and time stamping. It is a system where different contributorities
verify and authenticate the validity of each participant with the use of
digital certificates. A Certificate Policy (CP) is a named set of rules and it
indicates the applicability of a certificate in a Public Key Infrastructure.
Sometimes two companies or organizations with different PKIs merge. Therefore
it would be necessary that their PKIs are also able to merge. Sometimes, the
unification of different PKIs is not possible because of the different
certificate policies. This paper presents a method to compare and assess
certificate policies during merger and acquisition of companies.
