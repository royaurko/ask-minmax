Background: The strength of electron capture for medium mass nuclei has a
significant effect on the evolution of supernovae. There is insufficient
knowledge of these strengths and very little data for important radioactive
nuclei. Purpose: Determine whether it is feasible to obtain EC strength from
studies of T_o+1 excitations in (p,n) reactions, and whether this might yield
information for radioactive nuclei. Methods: Cross sections for the
{58,60,62,64}Ni(p,n){58,60,62,64}Cu reactions were measured over the angular
range of 0.3 deg to 11.6 deg at 134.3 MeV using the IUCF neutron time-of-flight
facility. esults: The T_o+1 excitations in {60,62}Ni were identified by
comparison with inelastic proton scattering spectra, their B(GT) were
extracted, and the corresponding electron capture rates in supernovae were
calculated. Data from the TRIUMF (n,p) experiments at 198 MeV were reanalyzed;
the electron capture rates for the reanalyzed data are in moderately good
agreement with the higher resolution (p,n) results, but differ in detail. The
possibility of future measurements with radioactive nuclei was considered.
Conclusions: It is possible to determine electron capturestrength from (p,n)
experiments. This approach may make it possible to obtain electron capture
strength for radioactive nuclei by studying (p,n) reactions in inverse
kinematics.
