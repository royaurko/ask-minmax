A particle scheme for scalar conservation laws in one space dimension is
presented. Particles representing the solution are moved according to their
characteristic velocities. Particle interaction is resolved locally, satisfying
exact conservation of area. Shocks stay sharp and propagate at correct speeds,
while rarefaction waves are created where appropriate. The method is variation
diminishing, entropy decreasing, exactly conservative, and has no numerical
dissipation away from shocks. Solutions, including the location of shocks, are
approximated with second order accuracy. Source terms can be included. The
method is compared to CLAWPACK in various examples, and found to yield a
comparable or better accuracy for similar resolutions.
