After a short overview of the MACRO detector, located at the Gran Sasso
Laboratory, I shall present and discuss the results on atmospheric muon
neutrino oscillations, concerning low (<E_nu> ~ 4 GeV) and high (<E_nu> ~ 50
GeV) energy data. Using the Multiple Coulomb Scattering of muons inside the
lower part of the detector, estimates of the neutrino energy were made event by
event for the high energy sample. The data on angular distributions, absolute
flux and L/E_nu distribution favor nu_mu <--> nu_tau oscillations with maximal
mixing and Delta m^2=2.5 x 10^-3 eV^2.
