The Basic Ecological Observatory (BEO) Moussala is located at 2925m above sea
level and one of the main activities is connected with gamma background and
neutron dose rate monitoring. The neutron and gamma measurements are carried
out with help of site radiation monitor Harwell Type 3208-1. The dose rate of
ambient gamma background is measured with SBN-90, improved with the embedded
microprocessor system using automatic PC based system. A cross check and inter
calibration with existing TLD (thermo luminescent dosimeters) at BEO Moussala
which is a part of the monitoring network of INRNE is presented. A polyethylene
sphere with a layer of lead serving as a neutron breeder, extending the energy
range from about 40 MeV to several hundred MeV is presented as a project in
development. Another project in development is the construction of active
detector based on SNM-15 detectors for a dose rate measurement of cosmic
neutrons is described. Preliminary study of the performances of the detectors
are carried out. A further project for muonic telescope similar to the yet
developed is discussed.
