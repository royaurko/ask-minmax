The Sc galaxy NGC 6181 was observed at the 6m telescope of SAO RAS with the
scanning Perot-Fabry interferometer in the H-alpha emission line and at the 1m
telescope of SAO RAS in BVRI broadband filters with CCD. Subtraction of the
mean circular rotation curve from the two-dimensional velocity field has
revealed a ring-like zone with a diameter about of 2 kpc where strong radial
gas motions are present. The form of the ring is almost perfectly circular in
the plane of the galaxy. It is located closer to the center than the beginning
of the well-defined spiral structure, but outside of the central
bulge-dominated region. The detected radial velocity reduced to the plane of
the galaxy is about 100 km/sec and probably is azimuthally dependent. The very
inner region of the galaxy, r < 3 arcsec or 0.5 kpc, shows a turn of the
dynamical major axis by about 30 deg. Central continuum isophotes are also
twisted which suggests the presence of small nuclear bar.
