The revolution of hydraulic fracturing has dramatically increased the supply
and lowered the cost of natural gas in the United States driving an expansion
of natural gas-fired generation capacity in many electrical grids. Unrelated to
the natural gas expansion, lower capital costs and renewable portfolio
standards are driving an expansion of intermittent renewable generation
capacity such as wind and photovoltaic generation. These two changes may
potentially combine to create new threats to the reliability of these
interdependent energy infrastructures. Natural gas-fired generators are often
used to balance the fluctuating output of wind generation. However, the
time-varying output of these generators results in time-varying natural gas
burn rates that impact the pressure in interstate transmission pipelines.
Fluctuating pressure impacts the reliability of natural gas deliveries to those
same generators and the safety of pipeline operations. We adopt a partial
differential equation model of natural gas pipelines and use this model to
explore the effect of intermittent wind generation on the fluctuations of
pressure in natural gas pipelines. The mean square pressure fluctuations are
found to grow linearly in time with points of maximum deviation occurring at
the locations of flow reversals.
