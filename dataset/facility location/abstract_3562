Maps are used to describe far-off places . It is an aid for navigation and
military strategies. Mapping of the lands are important and the mapping work is
based on (i). Natural resource management & development (ii). Information
technology ,(iii). Environmental development ,(iv). Facility management and
(v). e-governance. The Landuse / Landcover system espoused by almost all
Organisations and scientists, engineers and remote sensing community who are
involved in mapping of earth surface features, is a system which is derived
from the united States Geological Survey (USGS) LULC classification system. The
application of RS and GIS involves influential of homogeneous zones, drift
analysis of land use integration of new area changes or change detection
etc.,National Remote Sensing Agency(NRSA) Govt. of India has devised a
generalized LULC classification system respect to the Indian conditions based
on the various categories of Earth surface features , resolution of available
satellite data, capabilities of sensors and present and future applications.
The profusion information of the earth surface offered by the high resolution
satellite images for remote sensing applications. Using change detection
methodologies to extract the target changes in the areas from high resolution
images and rapidly updates geodatabase information processing.Traditionally,
classification approaches have focused on per-pixel technologies. Pixels within
areas assumed to be automatically homogeneous are analyzed independently.
