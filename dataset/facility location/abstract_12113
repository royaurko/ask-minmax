We study the relation between short-time vibrational modes and long-time
relaxational dynamics in a kinetically constrained lattice gas with harmonic
interactions between neighbouring particles. We find a correlation between the
location of the low (high) frequency vibrational modes and regions of high
(low) propensity for motion. This is similar to what was observed in continuous
force systems, but our interpretation is different: in our case relaxation is
due to localised excitations which propagate through the system; these
localised excitations act as background disorder for the elastic network,
giving rise to anomalous vibrational modes. Our results show that a correlation
between spatially extended low frequency modes and high propensity regions does
not imply that relaxational dynamics originates in extended soft modes. We
consider other measures of elastic heterogeneity, such as non-affine
displacement fields and mode localisation lengths, and discuss implications of
our results to interpretations of dynamic heterogeneity more generally.
