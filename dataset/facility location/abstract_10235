The nature of the dark matter of the Universe is yet unknown and most likely
is connected with new physics. The search for its composition is under way
through direct and indirect detection. Fundamental physical aspects such as
energy threshold, geometry and location are taken into account to investigate
proposed neutrino telescopes of km^3 volume sensitivities to dark matter. These
sensitivities are just sufficient to test a few WIMP scenarios. Telescopes of
km^3 volume, such as IceCube, can definitely discover or exclude superheavy (M
> 10^10 GeV) Strong Interacting Massive Particles (Simpzillas). Smaller
neutrino telescopes such as ANTARES, AMANDA-II and NESTOR can probe a large
region of the Simpzilla parameter space.
