The equilibrium and non--equilibrium disorder induced phase transitions are
compared in the random-field Ising model (RFIM). We identify in the
demagnetized state (DS) the correct non-equilibrium hysteretic counterpart of
the T=0 ground state (GS), and present evidence of universality. Numerical
simulations in d=3 indicate that exponents and scaling functions coincide,
while the location of the critical point differs, as corroborated by exact
results for the Bethe lattice. These results are of relevance for optimization,
and for the generic question of universality in the presence of disorder.
