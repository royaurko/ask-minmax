We present multiwavelength observations of the newly discovered X-ray
transient XTE J1118+480 obtained in the rising phase of the 2000 April
outburst. This source is located at unusually high Galactic latitude and in a
very low absorption line of sight. This made the first EUVE spectroscopy of an
X-ray transient outburst possible. Together with our HST, RXTE, and UKIRT data
this gives unprecedented spectral coverage. We find the source in the low hard
state. The flat IR-UV spectrum appears to be a combination of optically thick
disk emission and flat spectrum emission, possibly synchrotron, while at higher
energies, including EUV, a typical low hard state power-law is seen. EUVE
observations reveal no periodic modulation, suggesting an inclination low
enough that no obscuration by the disk rim occurs. We discuss the nature of the
source and this outburst and conclude that it may be more akin to
mini-outbursts seen in GRO J0422+32 than to a normal X-ray transient outburst.
