Location data becomes more and more important. In this paper, we focus on the
trajectory data, and propose a new framework, namely PRESS (Paralleled
Road-Network-Based Trajectory Compression), to effectively compress trajectory
data under road network constraints. Different from existing work, PRESS
proposes a novel representation for trajectories to separate the spatial
representation of a trajectory from the temporal representation, and proposes a
Hybrid Spatial Compression (HSC) algorithm and error Bounded Temporal
Compression (BTC) algorithm to compress the spatial and temporal information of
trajectories respectively. PRESS also supports common spatial-temporal queries
without fully decompressing the data. Through an extensive experimental study
on real trajectory dataset, PRESS significantly outperforms existing approaches
in terms of saving storage cost of trajectory data with bounded errors.
