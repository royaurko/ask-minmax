The light absorption and transmission of monolayer MoS$_{2}$ in a
one-dimensional defective photonic crystal (d-1DPC) is theoretically
investigated. The study shows that the strong interference effect decreases
photon density in particular areas of the microcavity. The d-1DPC can reduce
light absorption of monolayer MoS$_{2}$ and enhance light transmission. The
impact of monolayer MoS$_{2}$ light absorption on the localization effect of
photon is investigated when monolayer MoS$_{2}$ and the organic light-emitting
diode are located in the same microcavity. However, monolayer MoS$_{2}$ does
not reduce the localization effect of light by regulating the position of
monolayer MoS$_{2}$ in the microcavity.
