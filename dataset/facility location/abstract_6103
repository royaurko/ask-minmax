The ANTARES collaboration is building a deep underwater neutrino Cerenkov
telescope at 2400 m which will be located off the Mediterranean sea coast near
Toulon, France. The main scientific aims of the experiment are the detection of
high energy upgoing muons coming from astrophysical neutrinos, indirect dark
matter searches, the study of atmospheric neutrino oscillations. The detector
will be completed in the end of 2004.
