The term beta-beam has been coined for the production of a pure beam of
electron neutrinos or their antiparticles through the decay of radioactive ions
circulating in a storage ring. This concept requires radioactive ions to be
accelerated to as high Lorentz gamma as 150. The neutrino source itself
consists of a storage ring for this energy range, with long straight sections
in line with the experiment(s). Such a decay ring does not exist at CERN today,
nor does a high-intensity proton source for the production of the radioactive
ions. Nevertheless, the existing CERN accelerator infrastructure could be used
as this would still represent an important saving for a beta-beam facility.
