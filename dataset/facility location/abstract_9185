We measured the bar pattern speed in a sample of 7 SB0 galaxies using the
Tremaine-Weinberg method. This represents the largest sample of galaxies for
which bar pattern speed has been measured this way. All the observed bars are
as rapidly rotating as they can be. We compared this result with recent
high-resolution N-body simulations of bars in cosmologically-motivated dark
matter halos, and conclude that these bars are not located inside centrally
concentrated halos.
