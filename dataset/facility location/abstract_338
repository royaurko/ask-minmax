A dedicated facility has been commissioned for Cryogenic Dark Matter Search
(CDMS) detector fabrication at Texas A&M University (TAMU). The fabrication
process has been carefully tuned using this facility and its equipment.
Production of successfully tested detectors has been demonstrated. Significant
improvements in detector performance have been made using new fabrication
methods/equipment and tuning of process parameters.
