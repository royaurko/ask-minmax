We numerically work out the impact of the general relativistic Lense-Thirring
effect on the Earth-Mercury range caused by the gravitomagnetic field of the
rotating Sun. The peak-to peak nominal amplitude of the resulting time-varying
signal amounts to 1.75 10^1 m over a temporal interval 2 yr. Future
interplanetary laser ranging facilities should reach a cm-level in ranging to
Mercury over comparable timescales; for example, the BepiColombo mission, to be
launched in 2014, should reach a 4.5 - 10 cm level over 1 - 8 yr. We looked
also at other Newtonian (solar quadrupole mass moment, ring of the minor
asteroids, Ceres, Pallas, Vesta, Trans-Neptunian Objects) and post-Newtonian
(gravitoelectric Schwarzschild solar field) dynamical effects on the
Earth-Mercury range. They act as sources of systematic errors for the
Lense-Thirring signal which, in turn, if not properly modeled, may bias the
recovery of some key parameters of such other dynamical features of motion.
Their nominal peak-to-peak amplitudes are as large as 4 10^5 m (Schwarzschild),
3 10^2 m (Sun's quadrupole), 8 10^1 m (Ceres, Pallas, Vesta), 4 m (ring of
minor asteroids), 8 10^-1 m (Trans-Neptunian Objects). Their temporal patterns
are different with respect to that of the gravitomagnetic signal.
