The Hawking radiation of Weyl neutrinos in an arbitrarily accelerating
Kinnersley black hole is investigated by using a method of the generalized
tortoise coordinate transformation. Both the location and temperature of the
event horizon depend on the time and on the angles. They coincide with previous
results, but the thermal radiation spectrum of massless spinor particles
displays a kind of spin-acceleration coupling effect.
