Results of a 2001 March 17-20 BeppoSAX observation of the X-ray binary XB
1832-330 located in the globular cluster NGC 6652 are presented. In contrast to
the majority of luminous globular cluster X-ray sources, the (0.1-200 keV)
BeppoSAX spectrum cannot be fit with a disk-blackbody and comptt Comptonization
model, unless partial covering is included. This confirms the ASCA detection of
partial covering by Mukai & Smale (2000). The best-fit spectral parameters are
similar to those of the globular cluster sources with orbital periods of <1 hr,
implying that XB 1832-330 is also an ultra-compact system. A plausible optical
candidate to XB 1832-330 has recently been discovered by Heinke et al. (2001)
which shows evidence for possible 0.92, 2.22, or 4.44 hr periodicities. We find
no evidence for any 2-10 keV periodic modulation at any of these periods with a
2 sigma upper limit to the semi-amplitude of any sinusoid of < 1.5%.
