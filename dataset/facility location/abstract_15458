We report the discovery of water maser emission in five active galactic
nuclei (AGN) with the 100-m Green Bank Telescope (GBT). The positions of the
newly discovered masers, measured with the VLA, are consistent with the optical
positions of the host nuclei to within 1 sigma (0.3 arcsec radio and 1.3 arcsec
optical) and most likely mark the locations of the embedded central engines.
The spectra of three sources, 2MASX J08362280+3327383, NGC 6264, and UGC 09618
NED02, display the characteristic spectral signature of emission from an
edge-on accretion disk with maximum orbital velocity of ~700, ~800, and ~1300
km s^-1, respectively. We also present a GBT spectrum of a previously known
source MRK 0034 and interpret the narrow Doppler components reported here as
indirect evidence that the emission originates in an edge-on accretion disk
with orbital velocity of ~500 km s^-1. We obtained a detection rate of 12
percent (5 out of 41) among Seyfert 2 and LINER systems with 10000 km s^-1 <
v_sys < 15000 km s^-1. For the 30 nuclear water masers with available hard
X-ray data, we report a possible relationship between unabsorbed X-ray
luminosity (2-10 keV) and total isotropic water maser luminosity, L_{2-10}
proportional to L_{H2O}^{0.5+-0.1}, consistent with the model proposed by
Neufeld and Maloney in which X-ray irradiation and heating of molecular
accretion disk gas by the central engine excites the maser emission.
