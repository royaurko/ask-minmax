We have observed the old open clusters M 67 and NGC 188 with the ROSAT PSPC.
In M 67 we detect a variety of X-ray sources. The X-ray emission by a
cataclysmic variable, a single hot white dwarf, two contact binaries, and some
RS CVn systems is as expected. The X-ray emission by two binaries located below
the subgiant branch in the Hertzsprung Russell diagram of the cluster, by a
circular binary with a cool white dwarf, and by two eccentric binaries with
orbital period > 700 d is puzzling. Two members of NGC 188 are detected,
including the FK Com type star D719. Another possible FK Com type star,
probably not a member of NGC 188, is also detected.
