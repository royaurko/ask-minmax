The one of the most time consuming steps for association rule mining is the
computation of the frequency of the occurrences of itemsets in the database.
The hash table index approach converts a transaction database to an hash index
tree by scanning the transaction database only once. Whenever user requests for
any Uniform Resource Locator (URL), the request entry is stored in the Log File
of the server. This paper presents the hash index table structure, a general
and dense structure which provides web page set extraction from Log File of
server. This hash table provides information about the original database. Web
Page set mining (WPs-Mine) provides a complete representation of the original
database. This approach works well for both sparse and dense data
distributions. Web page set mining supported by hash table index shows the
performance always comparable with and often better than algorithms accessing
data on flat files. Incremental update is feasible without reaccessing the
original transactional database.
