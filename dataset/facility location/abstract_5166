The MobilitApp application is able to obtain mobility data and type of
activity performed by a person. It runs in the background and stores the
information in synchronous periodic locations. The main work of this project
was to develop tools that facilitate the exploitation of the information
obtained, add elements that make it attractive to use the application and
spread it to a wider audience. With these new procedures, we manage to increase
the number of connected users, improve security with which sensitive user
information is managed and establish channels that will be used to add
additional functionality to the application in future works.
