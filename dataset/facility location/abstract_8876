An extended analysis of some instrumental polarisation sources has been done,
as a consequence of the renewed interest in extremely sensitive polarisation
measurements stimulated by Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. The case of
correlation polarimeters, being them more suitable than other configurations,
has been studied in detail and the algorithm has been derived to calculate
their intrinsic sensitivity limit due to device characteristics as well as to
the operating environment. The atmosphere emission, even though totally
unpolarised, has been recognized to be the most important source of sensitivity
degradation for ground based experiments. This happens through receiver
component losses (mainly in the OMT), which generate instrumental polarisation
in genuinely uncorrelated signals. The relevant result is that, also in best
conditions (cfr. Antarctica), integration times longer than ~40s are not
allowed on ground without modulation techniques. Finally, basic rules to
estimate the maximum modulation period for each instrumental configuration have
been provided.
