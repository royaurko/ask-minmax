Identifying the optical/near-infrared (NIR) counterparts to the distant
submillimeter (submm) source population has proved difficult due to poor submm
spatial resolution. However, the proportionality of both centimeter and submm
data to the star formation rate suggests that high resolution radio continuum
maps with subarcsecond positional accuracy could be exploited to locate submm
sources. We targeted with SCUBA a sample of micro-Jy radio sources in the
flanking fields of the Hubble Deep Field selected from the uniform (8 micro-Jy
at 1-sigma) 1.4 GHz VLA image of Richards (1999). We find that the majority of
bright (>6 mJy) submm sources have detectable radio counterparts. With the
precise positions from the radio, we also find that these submm sources are
extremely faint in the optical and NIR (I>>24 and K=21-22) and are therefore
inaccessible to optical spectroscopy. Redshift estimates can, however, be made
from the shape of the spectral energy distribution in the radio and submm. This
procedure, which we refer to as millimetric redshift estimation, places the
bright submm population at z=1-3, where it forms the high redshift tail of the
faint radio population.
