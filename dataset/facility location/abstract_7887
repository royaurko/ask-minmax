The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (SZE) has been observed toward six massive
galaxy clusters, at redshifts 0.091 \leq z \leq 0.322 in the 86-102 GHz band
with the Y. T. Lee Array for Microwave Background Anisotropy (AMiBA). We modify
an iterative method, based on the isothermal \beta-models, to derive the
electron temperature T_e, total mass M_t, gas mass M_g, and integrated Compton
Y within r_2500, from the AMiBA SZE data. Non-isothermal universal temperature
profile (UTP) \beta models are also considered in this paper. These results are
in good agreement with those deduced from other observations. We also
investigate the embedded scaling relations, due to the assumptions that have
been made in the method we adopted, between these purely SZE-deduced T_e, M_t,
M_g and Y. Our results suggest that cluster properties may be measurable with
SZE observations alone. However, the assumptions built into the pure-SZE method
bias the results of scaling relation estimations and need further study.
