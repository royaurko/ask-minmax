This paper presents a novel framework for modeling the uplink intercell
interference (ICI) in a multiuser cellular network. The proposed framework
assists in quantifying the impact of various fading channel models and
state-of-the-art scheduling schemes on the uplink ICI. Firstly, we derive a
semianalytical expression for the distribution of the location of the scheduled
user in a given cell considering a wide range of scheduling schemes. Based on
this, we derive the distribution and moment generating function (MGF) of the
uplink ICI considering a single interfering cell. Consequently, we determine
the MGF of the cumulative ICI observed from all interfering cells and derive
explicit MGF expressions for three typical fading models. Finally, we utilize
the obtained expressions to evaluate important network performance metrics such
as the outage probability, ergodic capacity, and average fairness numerically.
Monte-Carlo simulation results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the
derived analytical expressions.
