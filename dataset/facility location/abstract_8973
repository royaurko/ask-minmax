We have analysed images of the field of A2390 obtained with the CFHT and HST.
The analysis fits models to bulge and disk components to several hundred
galaxies, with about equal samples from the cluster and field. We also have
assessed and graded asymmetries in the images. The cluster galaxies are
compared in different cluster locations and also compared with field galaxies.
We find that the central old population galaxies are bulge-dominated, while
disk systems have young populations and are found predominantly in the outer
cluster. S0 and bulgy disk galaxies are found throughout, but concentrate in
regions of substructure. Disks of cluster blue galaxies are generally brighter
and smaller than those in the field. We find that the cluster members have a
higher proportion of interacting galaxies than the field sample. Interactions
in the cluster and in the field, as well as cluster infall, appear to inhibit
star-formation in galaxies.
