We present a 9 deg^2 map of the North American and Pelican Nebulae regions
obtained in all four IRAC channels with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The
resulting photometry is merged with that at JHKs from 2MASS and a more
spatially limited $BVI$ survey from previous ground-based work. We use a
mixture of color- color diagrams to select a minimally contaminated set of more
than 1600 objects that we claim are young stellar objects (YSOs) associated
with the star forming region. Because our selection technique uses IR excess as
a requirement, our sample is strongly biased against inclusion of Class III
YSOs. The distribution of IRAC spectral slopes for our YSOs indicates that most
of these objects are Class II, with a peak towards steeper spectral slopes but
a substantial contribution from a tail of flat spectrum and Class I type
objects. By studying the small fraction of the sample that is optically
visible, we infer a typical age of a few Myr for the low mass population. The
young stars are clustered, with about a third of them located in eight clusters
that are located within or near the LDN 935 dark cloud. Half of the YSOs are
located in regions with surface densities higher than 1000 YSOs / deg^2. The
Class I objects are more clustered than the Class II stars.
