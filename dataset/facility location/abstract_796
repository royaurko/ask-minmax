The lightest neutralino in supersymmetric models with conserved R-parity is
an attractive candidate for non-luminous matter in the universe. If relic
neutralinos are indeed present as dark matter in our galaxy, they can be
directly detected in scattering experiments. This could serve as an independent
search channel for supersymmetry complementary to collider experiments. I
compare the sensitivity of direct detection experiments with the reach for
supersymmetry at collider facilities in the framework of the minimal
supergravity model.
