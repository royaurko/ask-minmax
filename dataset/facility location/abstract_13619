Anisotropic superconducting properties including the upper critical field
Hc2, thermal activation energy U0, and critical current density Jc are
systematically studied in a large Ca1-xLaxFeAs2 single crystal (x ~ 0.18). The
obtained Hc2 bears a moderate anisotropy gamma of approximately 2-4.2, located
between those of '122' Ba1-xKxFe2As2 (1 < gamma < 2) and '1111' NdFeAsO1-xFx (5
< gamma < 9.2). Both the magnitude of U0 and its field dependence are very
similar to those of NdFeAsO1-xFx, also indicating anisotropic
superconductivity. Moreover, high and anisotropic Jc's exceeding 10^5 A/cm2
have been calculated from the magnetization hysteresis loops, indicating the
existence of strong bulk-dominated pinning in the present superconducting
material.
