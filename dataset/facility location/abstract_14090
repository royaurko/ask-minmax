We present an atomically resolved study of metal-organic vapor epitaxy grown
Mn doped InSb that is ferromagnetic at room-temperature. Both topographic and
spectroscopic measurements have been performed by cross-sectional scanning
tunneling microscopy. The measurements show a perfect crystal structure without
any precipitates and reveal that Mn acts as a shallow acceptor. The Mn
concentration obtained from the cross-sectional STM data compares well with the
intended doping concentration. No second phase material or (nano)clustering of
the Mn was observed. While the pair correlation function of the Mn atoms showed
that their local distribution is uncorrelated beyond the STM resolution for
observing individual dopants, disorder in the Mn ion location is clearly noted.
We discuss the implications of the observed disorder for a number of suggested
explanations of the room-temperature ferromagnetism in Mn doped InSb grown by
metal-organic vapor epitaxy.
