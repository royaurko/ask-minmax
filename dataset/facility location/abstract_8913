We report on single-dish monitoring as well as extremely high angular
resolution observations of the flaring H2O maser in the Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk
348. The H2O line is redshifted by ~130 km/s with respect to the systemic
velocity, is very broad, with a FWHM of 130 km/s, and has no detectable high
velocity components within 1500 km/s on either side of the strong line.
Monitoring observations made with the Effelsberg 100m telescope show that the
maser varies significantly on timescales as short as one day. VLBA observations
indicate that the maser emission arises entirely from a region less than 0.25
pc in extent, located toward a continuum component thought to be associated
with the receding jet.
