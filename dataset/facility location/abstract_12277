We present here Imitator II, a new version of Imitator, a tool implementing
the "inverse method" for parametric timed automata: given a reference valuation
of the parameters, it synthesizes a constraint such that, for any valuation
satisfying this constraint, the system behaves the same as under the reference
valuation in terms of traces, i.e., alternating sequences of locations and
actions. Imitator II also implements the "behavioral cartography algorithm",
allowing us to solve the following good parameters problem: find a set of
valuations within a given bounded parametric domain for which the system
behaves well. We present new features and optimizations of the tool, and give
results of applications to various examples of asynchronous circuits and
communication protocols.
