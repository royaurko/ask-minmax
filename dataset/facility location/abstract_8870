We present results about the distribution and kinematics of the molecular
environment of the AGN in NGC1068, over a 1.5'' x 3.5'' region around the
central engine in NGC1068, derived from H2 line emission detected with ISAAC at
VLT/ANTU on ESO/Paranal. The H2 emitting molecular gas is found to be
distributed along the East-West direction and with two main peak emission
(knots) located at a distance of about 70 pc from the central engine. The
eastern H2 knot is more intense than the western one. The line profiles mapped
across the entire 1.5'' x 3.5'' region, at a spatial resolution of 0.3'' x
0.45'', appear to be quite complex with either a blue or red wing. At first
order, we find a velocity difference of 140 km/s between the two knots; if
interpreted as quasi-keplerian velocity, this implies a central enclosed mass
of 10^8 solar masses.
