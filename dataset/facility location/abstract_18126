This paper presents transition of the failure mode of a cohesive, spherical
body due to YORP spin-up. On the assumption that the distribution of materials
in the body is homogeneous, failed regions first appearing in the body at
different spin rates are predicted by comparing the yield condition of an
elastic stress in the body. It is found that as the spin rate increases, the
locations of the failed regions move from the equatorial surface to the central
region. To avoid such failure modes, the body should have higher cohesive
strength. The results by this model are consistent with those by a plastic
finite element model. Then, this model and a two-layered-cohesive model first
proposed by Hirabayashi et al. are used to classify possible evolution and
disruption of a spherical body. There are three possible pathways to
disruption. First, because of a strong structure, failure of the central region
is dominant and eventually leads to a breakup into multiple components. Second,
a weak surface and a weak interior make the body oblate. Third, a strong
internal core prevents the body from failing and only allows surface shedding.
This implies that observed failure modes may highly depend on the internal
structure of an asteroid, which could provide crucial information for giving
constraints on the physical properties.
