Quantum theory of hydrogen atoms distribution between two complementary
nucleotide bases in DNA double helix at moment of replication has been proposed
in this work. It bases on two mechanisms of proton tunneling: the
Andreev-Meyerovich mechanism with spontaneous phonon radiation and the
Kagan-Maximov (Flynn-Stoneham) mechanism at phonon scattering. According to the
presented model, the probability of proton location in shallow potential well
(point mutation form) is directly proportional to temperature. It was shown
that the point mutation probability decreases with increasing replication
velocity.
