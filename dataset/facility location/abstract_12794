We study $q$-analogues of $k$-Fibonacci numbers that arise from weighted
tilings of an $n\times1$ board with tiles of length at most $k$. The weights on
our tilings arise naturally out of distributions of permutations statistics and
set partitions statistics. We use these $q$-analogues to produce $q$-analogues
of identities involving $k$-Fibonacci numbers. This is a natural extension of
results of the first contributor and Sagan on set partitions and the first contributor
and Mathisen on permutations. In this paper we give general $q$-analogues of
$k$-Fibonacci identities for arbitrary weights that depend only on lengths and
locations of tiles. We then determine weights for specific permutation or set
partition statistics and use these specific weights and the general identities
to produce specific identities.
