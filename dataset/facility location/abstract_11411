The determination of the stiffness center of a machine tool is a major
element for knowing the dynamic behavior of this one. This stiffness center can
be obtained from a static characterization of the machine tool. For an
operation of turning, we present an experimental protocol to determine the
stiffness matrix, then by inversion, the associated flexibility matrix. This
step makes it possible to establish the privileged directions of the movement
associated with the maximum and minimal stiffness as well as the stiffness
center. Through this step, it is observed that, at the time of an operation of
turning, the movement of the point of the tool is carried out according to an
ellipse located in a tilted average plan compared to the machine spindle. This
movement is linked with the self-excited vibrations. This analysis could be
exploited and transposed in the case of the High Speed Machining. It will make
it possible to predict various aspects of machining related to the behavior of
the tool in the process of cut.
