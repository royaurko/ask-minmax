We report the discovery of two previously unknown WN3 stars in the Large
Magellanic Cloud. Both are bright (15th magnitude), isolated, and located in
regions covered in earlier surveys, although both are relatively weak-lined. We
suggest that there may be $\mathcal{O}(10)$ remaining undiscovered WNE stars in
the LMC.
