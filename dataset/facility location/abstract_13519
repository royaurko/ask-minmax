This paper employs a recently developed asymptotic Bayesian multi-hypothesis
testing (MHT) error analysis to treat the problem of superresolution imaging of
a pair of closely spaced, equally bright point sources. The analysis exploits
the notion of the minimum probability of error (MPE) in discriminating between
two competing equi-probable hypotheses, a single point source of a certain
brightness at the origin vs. a pair of point sources, each of half the
brightness of the single source and located symmetrically about the origin, as
the distance between the source pair is changed. For a Gaussian point-spread
function (PSF), the analysis makes predictions on the scaling of the minimum
source strength, expressed in units of photon number, required to disambiguate
the pair as a function of their separation, in both the signal-dominated and
background-dominated regimes. Certain logarithmic corrections to the quartic
scaling of the minimum source strength with respect to the degree of
superresolution characterize the signal-dominated regime, while the scaling is
purely quadratic in the background-dominated regime. For the Gaussian PSF,
general results for arbitrary strengths of the signal, background, and sensor
noise levels are also presented.
