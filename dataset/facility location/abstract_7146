The kinematical and spatial properties of the metal-rich globular clusters in
the Galaxy ([Fe/H] > -0.8) indicates that these objects do not comprise a
homogeneous population. Three subsystems are identified. The highest-mass
clusters exhibit a very slow net rotation with a speed of v_rot = 24 km/s and
v_rot/sigma = 0.3, indicative of a centrally condensed, spheroidal subsystem.
Roughly half of the lower-mass clusters appear to be located in an elongated
bar-like structure which passes through the Galactic Center, and has similar
properties to the central stellar bar of the Milky Way. The remaining
lower-mass clusters exhibit very rapid net rotation, with a rotation speed of
v_rot = 164 km/s and v_rot/sigma = 6. These clusters are located in the
Galactic plane, within a ring of 4 to 6 kpc radial distance from the Galactic
Center. The highest-mass clusters may have formed during relatively advanced
stages of the dissipative evolution of the inner Galactic halo. The lower-mass
bar clusters may be associated with the formation of the Galactic stellar bar
or bulge. The lower-mass ring clusters appear to be real disk objects. They may
represent a stage in cluster formation that was intermediate between that of
the halo globular clusters and the oldest extant open clusters.
