We demonstrate that ultrafast carrier excitation can drastically affect
electronic structures and induce brief surface plasmonic response in
non-plasmonic metals, potentially creating a plasmonic switch. Using
first-principles molecular dynamics and Kubo-Greenwood formalism for
laser-excited tungsten we show that carrier heating mobilizes d electrons into
collective inter and intraband transitions leading to a sign flip in the
imaginary optical conductivity, activating plasmonic properties for the initial
non-plasmonic phase. The drive for the optical evolution can be visualized as
an increasingly damped quasi-resonance at visible frequencies for pumping
carriers across a chemical potential located in a d-band pseudo-gap with
energy-dependent degree of occupation. The subsequent evolution of optical
indices for the excited material is confirmed by time-resolved ultrafast
ellipsometry. The large optical tunability extends the existence spectral
domain of surface plasmons in ranges typically claimed in laser self-organized
nanostructuring. Non-equilibrium heating is thus a strong factor for
engineering optical control of evanescent excitation waves, particularly
important in laser nanostructuring strategies.
