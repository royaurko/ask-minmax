Using data derived from the H.E.S.S. Phase 1 telescope system and a
Ceilometer facility on site, a method of correcting for changing atmospheric
quality based on reconstructed shower parameters is presented. The method was
applied to data from the active galactic nucleus PKS 2155-304, taken during
August and September 2004 when the quality of the atmosphere at the site was
highly variable. Corrected and uncorrected fluxes are shown, and the method is
discussed as a first step towards a more complete atmospheric calibration.
