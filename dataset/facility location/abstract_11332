Gibbs random fields corresponding to systems of real-valued spins (e.g.
systems of interacting anharmonic oscillators) indexed by the vertices of
unbounded degree graphs with a certain summability property are constructed. It
is proven that the set of tempered Gibbs random fields is non-void and weakly
compact, and that they obey uniform exponential integrability estimates. In the
second part of the paper, a class of graphs is described in which the mentioned
summability is obtained as a consequence of a property, by virtue of which
vertices of large degree are located at large distances from each other. The
latter is a stronger version of a metric property, introduced in [Bassalygo, L.
A. and Dobrushin, R. L. (1986). \textrm{Uniqueness of a Gibbs field with a
