We study numerically three-dimensional Z(N) lattice gauge theories at finite
temperature, for N = 5, 6, 8, 12, 13 and 20 on lattices with temporal extension
$N_t$ = 2, 4, 8. For each model, we locate phase transition points and
determine critical indices. We propose also the scaling of critical points with
N. The data obtained enable us to verify the scaling near the continuum limit
for the Z(N) models at finite temperatures.
