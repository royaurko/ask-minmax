In 1995 a 9SDH-2 Pelletron from NEC was installed at IFUNAM (Instituto de
Fisica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico). Two beam lines have been
operational since then and two new lines have been built. In order to perform
the planned projects in this grown facility, an upgrading of the original
manual control system is required. The proposed new control system takes
advantage of the existing devices and incorporates the electronics needed for
the newer beam lines. The control software from NEC, has been modified to
accommodate the larger requirements. It runs on the same dedicated computer but
receives commands from a new installed host. Both computers communicate through
a local network sharing the accelerator database. The new host computer also
handles all parameters related to the new lines. In the future, the old
computer will be replaced in order to expand the possibilities of the system
and use a friendlier graphical interface. In this work we present the changes
made to the control software, the new acquisition and control devices installed
and the integration of the old and new systems. Finally, the beam control
procedure based on the analysis of the beam profile that is under development
is also shown.
