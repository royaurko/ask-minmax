We studied class I methanol masers in the transition 7_0-6_1 A+ at the
frequency 44 GHz with the VLA. The observations on the VLA were made with the
angular resolution 0''.1, which was the highest at the moment. It was shown
that the masers consist of chains of unresolved spots located on curved lines
or arcs. The length of such arcs is from 20 to 1000 AU and the brightness
temperature of the strongest masers exceeds 3.6x10^8 K. The observed location
of maser spots is in agreement with their position at the border line between
molecular outflows and surrounding molecular clouds. The high brightness
temperature implies that the maser condensations have enhanced abundance of
methanol due to evaporation of methanol from the surface of dust grains. The
mass of maser condensations is less than 4x10^-5 solar mass and corresponds to
planetary masses.
