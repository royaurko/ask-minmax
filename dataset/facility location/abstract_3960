(Abridged) We present near-IR photometry of a selected sample of southern
hemisphere E+A galaxies. The sample includes 50 galaxies from nearby and
distant clusters as well as E+A galaxies from the field. The photometry
includes J, H and Ks apparent magnitudes and colors. Observed colors are
obtained from the apparent total magnitudes and compared to spectrophotometric
models of galaxy evolution GISSEL96. There is an overall agreement between
integrated colors of models and observed ones, for both the E+A located in
clusters and in the field, at z~0.1. However, large differences are found
between colors predicted from models and those observed in E+A galaxies located
in more distant clusters. We investigate systematic properties of the E+A
sample as a function of their environment. Results seem to indicate that
cluster E+As (at low redshift) are bluer than field E+As at z~0.1. Even this
conclusion does not depend whether we use comoving or rest-frame colors, nor on
the models used to obtain rest-frame colors; the difference is not significant
enough, considering color dispersions between the samples. If differences are
real, they could imply different stellar content for the E+A galaxies located
in the field, compared to the cluster E+A.
