We investigate the phase structure of 3-flavor QCD in the presence of finite
quark chemical potential $a\mu=0.1$ by using the Wilson-Clover fermion action.
Especially, we focus on locating the critical end point that characterizes the
phase structure. We do this by the kurtosis intersection method for the quark
condensate. For Wilson-type fermions, the correspondence between bare
parameters and physical parameters is indirect. Hence we present a strategy to
transfer the bare parameter phase structure to the physical one.
