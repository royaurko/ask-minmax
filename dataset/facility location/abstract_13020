Google Earth (GE) has become a powerful tool for geological modeling and
visualization. An interesting and useful feature of GE, Google Street View, can
allow the GE users to view geological structure such as layers of rock masses
at a field site. In this paper, we introduce a practical solution for building
3D geological models for rock masses based on the data acquired by use with GE.
A real study case at Haut-Barr, France is presented to demonstrate our
solution. We first locate the position of Haut-Barr in GE, and then determine
the shape and scale of the rock masses in the study area, and thirdly acquire
the layout of layers of rock masses in the Google Street View, and finally
create the approximate 3D geological models by extruding and intersecting. The
generated 3D geological models can simply reflect the basic structure of the
rock masses at Haut-Barr, and can be used for visualizing the rock bodies
interactively.
