The role of the axial anomaly in the chiral phase transition at finite
temperature and quark chemical potential is investigated within a
non-perturbative functional renormalization group approach. The flow equation
for the grand potential is solved to leading-order in a derivative expansion of
a three flavor quark-meson model truncation. The results are compared with a
standard and an extended mean-field analysis, which facilitates the exploration
of the influence of bosonic and fermionic fluctuations, respectively, on the
phase transition. The influence of U(1)_A-symmetry breaking on the chiral
transition, the location of a possible critical endpoint in the phase diagram
and the quark mass sensitivity is studied in detail.
