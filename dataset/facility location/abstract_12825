This paper focuses on detecting social, physical-world events from photos
posted on social media sites. The problem is important: cheap media capture
devices have significantly increased the number of photos shared on these
sites. The main contribution of this paper is to incorporate online social
interaction features in the detection of physical events. We believe that
online social interaction reflect important signals among the participants on
the "social affinity" of two photos, thereby helping event detection. We
compute social affinity via a random-walk on a social interaction graph to
determine similarity between two photos on the graph. We train a support vector
machine classifier to combine the social affinity between photos and
photo-centric metadata including time, location, tags and description.
Incremental clustering is then used to group photos to event clusters. We have
very good results on two large scale real-world datasets: Upcoming and
MediaEval. We show an improvement between 0.06-0.10 in F1 on these datasets.
