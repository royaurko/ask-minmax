Public bus services are widely deployed in cities around the world because
they provide cost-effective and economic public transportation. However, from a
passenger point of view urban bus systems can be complex and difficult to
navigate, especially for disadvantaged users, i.e. tourists, novice users,
older people, and people with impaired cognitive or physical abilities. We
present Urban Bus Navigator (UBN), a reality-aware urban navigation system for
bus passengers with the ability to recognize and track the physical public
transport infrastructure such as buses. Unlike traditional location-aware
mobile transport applications, UBN acts as a true navigation assistant for
public transport users. Insights from a six-month long trial in Madrid indicate
that UBN removes barriers for public transport usage and has a positive impact
on how people feel about public transport journeys.
