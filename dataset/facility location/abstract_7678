Aims: We study the supernova remnant G20.0-0.2 and its surroundings in order
to look for the high energy counterpart of the radio nebula and to find
evidence of interaction between the shock front and the interstellar medium.
Methods: We used Chandra archival observations to analyze the X-ray emission
from the supernova remnant. The surrounding gas was investigated using data
extracted from the Galactic Ring Survey, the VLA Galactic Plane Survey, the
Galactic Legacy Infrared Midplane Survey Extraordinaire, and the Bolocam
Galactic Plane Survey. Results: G20.0-0.2 shows diffuse X-ray emission from the
central region of the radio remnant. Although the current data do not allow us
to distinguish between a thermal or non-thermal origin for the X-ray diffuse
emission, based on the radio properties we suggest a synchrotron origin as the
most favorable. The hard X-ray point source CXO J182807.4-113516 appears
located at the geometrical center of the remnant and is a potential candidate
to be the pulsar powering the nebula. We found a molecular cloud adjacent to
the flattest border of G20.0-0.2, indicating a probable interaction between the
shock front of the remnant and the molecular gas. Several young stellar object
candidates are found located in the brightest region of the molecular emission,
and over a millimeter continuum source and a dark cloud. This distribution is
an indication of an active star forming region around the supernova remnant.
