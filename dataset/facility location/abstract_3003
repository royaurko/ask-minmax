The solid angle subtended by a right circular cylinder at a point source
located at an arbitrary position generally consists of a sum of two terms: that
defined by the cylindrical surface ($\Omega_{cyl}$) and the other by either of
the end circles ($\Omega_{circ}$). We derive an expression for $\Omega_{cyl}$
in terms of elliptic integrals of the first and third kinds and give similar
expressions for $\Omega_{circ}$ using integrals of the first and second kinds.
These latter can be used alternatively to an expression also in terms of
elliptic integrals, due to Philip A. Macklin and included as a footnote in
Masket (Rev. Sci. Instr., 28 (3), 191-197, 1957). The solid angle subtended by
the whole cylinder when the source is located at an arbitrary location can then
be calculated using elliptic integrals.
