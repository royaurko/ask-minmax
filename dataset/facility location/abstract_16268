A difficult task with many particle detectors focusing on interactions below
~100 keV is to perform a calibration in the appropriate energy range that
adequately probes all regions of the detector. Because detector response can
vary greatly in various locations within the device, a spatially uniform
calibration is important. We present a new method for calibration of liquid
xenon (LXe) detectors, using the short-lived 83m-Kr. This source has
transitions at 9.4 and 32.1 keV, and as a noble gas like Xe, it disperses
uniformly in all regions of the detector. Even for low source activities, the
existence of the two transitions provides a method of identifying the decays
that is free of background. We find that at decreasing energies, the LXe light
yield increases, while the amount of electric field quenching is diminished.
Additionally, we show that if any long-lived radioactive backgrounds are
introduced by this method, they will present less than 67E-6 events/kg/day in
the next generation of LXe dark matter direct detection searches
