Cliffs is an open-source relative of MOST (Method Of Splitting Tsunamis)
numerical model, implemented as described in (Tolkova, 2014, Pure and Appl.
Geophys., 171(9), 2289-2314), with some modifications thereafter. Cliffs
features: Shallow-Water approximation with an option to manipulate numerical
dispersion; Use of Cartesian or spherical (lon/lat) coordinates; 1D and 2D
configurations; Structured co-located grid with (optionally) varying spacing;
Runup on land; Initial conditions or boundary forcing; Grid nesting with
one-way coupling; Parallelized with OpenMP; NetCDF format of input/output data.
This user manual accompanies Cliffs code distribution on GitHub, and is updated
