We present the first report of the detection of sudden ionospheric
disturbances (SIDs) due to a Soft Gamma Ray Repeater (SGR) SGR J1550-5418 and a
Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) GRB 090424. These detections were made with receiving
stations of Indian Centre for Space Physics which were monitoring Very Low
Frequency signals (VLFs) from the VTX transmitter located at the southern tip
of Indian sub-continent. These positive detections add to the list of a handful
of similar detections of other GRBs and SGRs throughout the world.
