Cross sections for the reaction ${^1}$H($e,e'\pi^+$)$n$ were measured in Hall
C at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) using the CEBAF
high-intensity, continous electron beam in order to determine the charged pion
form factor. Data were taken for central four-momentum transfers ranging from
$Q^2$=0.60 to 2.45 GeV$^2$ at an invariant mass of the virtual photon-nucleon
system of $W$=1.95 and 2.22 GeV. The measured cross sections were separated
into the four structure functions $\sigma_L$, $\sigma_T$, $\sigma_{LT}$, and
$\sigma_{TT}$. The various parts of the experimental setup and the analysis
steps are described in detail, including the calibrations and systematic
studies, which were needed to obtain high precision results. The different
types of systematic uncertainties are also discussed. The results for the
separated cross sections as a function of the Mandelstam variable $t$ at the
different values of $Q^2$ are presented. Some global features of the data are
discussed, and the data are compared with the results of some model
calculations for the reaction ${^1}$H($e,e'\pi^+$)$n$.
