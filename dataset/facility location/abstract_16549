Here we present the results of a Suzaku observation of the Broad Line Radio
Galaxy 3C 445. We confirm the results obtained with the previous X-ray
observations which unveiled the presence of several soft X-ray emission lines
and an overall X-ray emission which strongly resembles a typical Seyfert 2
despite of the optical classification as an unobscured AGN. The broad band
spectrum allowed us to measure for the first time the amount of reflection
(R~0.9) which together with the relatively strong neutral Fe Kalpha emission
line (EW ~ 100 eV) strongly supports a scenario where a Compton-thick mirror is
present. The primary X-ray continuum is strongly obscured by an absorber with a
column density of NH =2-3 x10^{23} cm^{-2}. Two possible scenarios are proposed
for the absorber: a neutral partial covering or a mildly ionised absorber with
an ionisation parameter log\xi ~ 1.0 erg cm s^{-1}. A comparison with the past
and more recent X-ray observations of 3C 445 performed with XMM-Newton and
Chandra is presented, which provided tentative evidence that the ionised and
outflowing absorber varied. We argue that the absorber is probably associated
with an equatorial disk-wind located within the parsec scale molecular torus.
