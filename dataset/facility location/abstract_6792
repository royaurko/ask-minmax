Recently heterogeneous base station structure has been adopted in cellular
systems to enhance system throughput and coverage. In this paper, the uplink
coverage probability for the heterogeneous cellular systems is analyzed and
derived in closed-form. The randomness on the locations and number of mobile
users is taken into account in the analysis. Based on the analytical results,
the impacts of various system parameters on the uplink performance are
investigated in detail. The correctness of the analytical results is also
verified by simulation results. These analytical results can thus serve as a
guidance for system design without the need of time consuming simulations.
