It is widely assumed that the most probable sites of flare occurrences are
the locations of high horizontal magnetic field gradients in the active
regions. Instead of magnetograms the present work checks this assumption by
using sunspot data, the targeted phenomenon is the pre-flare behaviour of the
strong horizontal gradients of the magnetic field at the location of the flare.
The empirical basis of the work is the SDD (SOHO/MDI-Debrecen sunspot Data)
sunspot catalogue. Case studies of two active regions and five X-flares have
been carried out to find possible candidates for pre-flare signatures. It has
been found that the following properties of the temporal variations of
horizontal magnetic field gradient are promising for flare forecast: the speed
of its growth, its maximal value, its decrease after the maximum until the
flare and the rate of its fluctuation.
