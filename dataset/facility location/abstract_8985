Five planetary nebulae (PNe) have been discovered in the nearby dwarf
irregular galaxy. Emission line images were obtained using the Wide Field
Camera of the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) at La Palma (Spain). The
candidate PNe were identified by their point-like appearance and relatively
strong [OIII] emission-line fluxes. They are located within a galactocentric
distance of 2.8 arcmin, corresponding to 1.1 kpc at the distance of Sextans B.
Luminosities are in the range 1800--5600Lsolar. Sextans B is one of the
smallest dwarf irregular galaxies with a PN population. The number of PNe
detected suggest an enhanced star formation rate between 1 and 5 Gyr ago.
