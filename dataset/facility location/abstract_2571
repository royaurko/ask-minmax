Telescope bibliographies are integral parts of observing facilities. They are
used to associate the published literature with archived observational data, to
measure an observatory's scientific output through publication and citation
statistics, and to define guidelines for future observing strategies.
  The ESO and NRAO librarians as well as NAOJ jointly maintain the ALMA
(Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) bibliography, a database of
refereed papers that use ALMA data.
  In this paper, we illustrate how relevant articles are identified, which
procedures are used to tag entries in the database and link them to the correct
observations, and how results are communicated to ALMA stakeholders and the
wider community. Efforts made to streamline the process will be explained and
evaluated, and a first analysis of ALMA papers published after two years of
observations will be given.
