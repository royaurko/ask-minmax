We address the question of whether the angular power spectrum of the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) sky is further distorted by weak gravitational lensing
of foreground large-scale structures. Using an analytic approach to both
gaseous and dark halo models, we show that the contamination of weak lensing in
the measurement of SZ power power is negligibly small, and relatively
corrections |\Delta C_l|/C_l are less than 3% up to l=10^5. This arises from
both the weaker gravitational potentials of low-redshift matter inhomogeneities
that can act as lenses for SZ sources (clusters) and the shallower shape of
intrinsic SZ power spectrum at large l, in contrast to the cosmic microwave
background which can be significantly affected by weak lensing because of the
distant location and significant damping of its intrinsic power spectrum at
small angular scales.
