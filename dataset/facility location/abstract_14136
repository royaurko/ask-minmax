To optimize rotated, multidimensional constellations over a single-input,
single-output Rayleigh fading channel, a family of rotation matrices is
constructed for all dimensions which are a power of 2. This family is a
one-parameter subgroup of the group of rotation matrices, and is located using
a gradient descent scheme on this Lie group. The parameter defining the family
is chosen to optimize the cutoff rate of the constellation. The optimal
rotation parameter is computed explicitly for low signal-to-noise ratios. The
cutoff rate serves as the main judge of performance, and is an approximation of
the coded modulation capacity of the constellation.
  These rotations modestly outperform full-diversity algebraic rotation
matrices in terms of cutoff rate and error performance. However, a QAM
constellation rotated by such a matrix lacks full diversity, but will satisfy a
less restrictive property referred to as "local full diversity". Roughly, a
locally fully diverse constellation is fully diverse only in small
neighborhoods. This is in contrast with the conventional wisdom that good
signal sets exhibit full diversity. A "local" variant of the minimum product
distance is also introduced and is shown experimentally to be a superior
predictor of constellation performance than the minimum product distance.
