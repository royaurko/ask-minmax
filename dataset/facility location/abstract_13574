In this paper we consider a system with two carousels operated by one picker.
The items to be picked are randomly located on the carousels and the pick times
follow a phase-type distribution. The picker alternates between the two
carousels, picking one item at a time. Important performance characteristics
are the waiting time of the picker and the throughput of the two carousels. The
waiting time of the picker satisfies an equation very similar to Lindley's
equation for the waiting time in the PH/U/1 queue. Although the latter equation
has no simple solution, we show that the one for the waiting time of the picker
can be solved explicitly. Furthermore, it is well known that the mean waiting
time in the PH/U/1 queue depends on to the complete interarrival time
distribution, but numerical results show that, for the carousel system, the
mean waiting time and throughput are rather insensitive to the pick-time
distribution.
