Our goal is to perform global simulations of thin accretion discs around
compact bodies like neutron stars with dipolar magnetic profile and black holes
by exploiting the facilities provided by state-of-the-art grid-based, high
resolution shock capturing (HRSC) and finite volume codes. We have used the
Godunov-type code PLUTO to simulate a thin disc around a compact object
prescribed with a pseudo-Newtonian potential in a purely hydrodynamical (HD)
regime, with numerical viscosity as a first step towards achieving our goal as
mentioned above.
