We study the correlators of two circular Wilson loops of different radii at
strong coupling. In our setup one Wilson loop is located inside the other. We
use holography to calculate the connected two-point function. Both an AdS
background and a confining background are considered. As the computation for
the confining case cannot be carried out analytically we solve the problem
numerically. In the AdS case our results agree with similar holographic
calculations. In the case of a confining background we find an asymptotic area
law, in agreement with the result of the lattice strong coupling expansion. We
also elaborate on the subtle issue of the interplay between connected and
disconnected string worldsheets.
