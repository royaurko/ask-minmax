An analysis of arrival directions of extensive air showers (EAS) registered
with the EAS MSU and EAS-1000 prototype arrays has revealed a region of
excessive flux of PeV cosmic rays in the direction toward pulsars PSR
J1840+5640 and LAT PSR J1836+5925 at significance level up to 4.5sigma. The
first of the pulsars was discovered almost 30 years ago and is a well-studied
old radio pulsar located at the distance of 1.7pc from the Solar system. The
second pulsar belongs to a new type of pulsars, discovered by the space
gamma-ray observatory Fermi, pulsations of which are not observed in optical
and radio wavelengths but only in the gamma-ray range of energies
(gamma-ray-only pulsars). In our opinion, the existence of the region of
excessive flux of cosmic rays registered with two different arrays provides a
strong evidence that isolated pulsars can give a noticeable contribution to the
flux of Galactic cosmic rays in the PeV energy range.
