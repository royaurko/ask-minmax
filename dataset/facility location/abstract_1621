A brief sketch of the present status of gravitational wave experiments is
given. Attention is concentrated to recent observations with the gravitational
detector network. The project OGRAN for a combined optic-interferometrical and
acoustical gravitation wave antenna planned for installation into underground
facilities of the Baksan Neutrino Observatory is presented. We describe general
principles of the apparatus, expected sensitivity and current characteristics
of the antenna prototype; some ways for sensitivity improvement are also
discussed.
