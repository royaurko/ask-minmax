We present absolute astrometry of 35 radio sources in the Orion Trapezium and
Becklin-Neugebauer/Kleinman-Low regions, obtained from Very Large Array
archival observations collected over a period of 15 years. By averaging the
results for all the sources, we estimate the mean absolute proper motion of
Orion to be --in Galactic coordinates-- $\mu_\ell \cos b$ = +2.1 $\pm$ 0.2 mas
yr$^{-1}$; $\mu_b$ = $-$0.1 $\pm$ 0.2 mas yr$^{-1}$. These values agree
remarkably well with those expected from the differential rotation of the Milky
Way. Subtraction of this mean motion from the individual measurements allows us
to register all proper motions to the rest frame of the Orion nebula, and
identify radio sources with large residual velocities. In the KL region, we
find three sources in this situation: the BN object, the radio source I, and
the radio counterpart of the infrared source n. All three objects appear to be
moving away from a common point where they must all have been located about 500
years ago. This suggests that all three sources were originally part of a
multiple massive stellar system that recently disintegrated as a result of a
close dynamical
