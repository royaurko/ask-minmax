In this paper we derive the galaxy luminosity function from the Nearby
Optical Galaxy (NOG) sample, which is a nearly complete, magnitude-limited
(B<14 mag), all-sky sample of nearby optical galaxies (~6400 galaxies with
cz<5500 km/s). For this local sample, we use galaxy distance estimates based on
different peculiar velocity models. Therefore, the derivation of the luminosity
function is carried out using the locations of field and grouped galaxies in
real distance space.
  The local field galaxy luminosity function in the B system is well described
by a Schechter function. The exact values of the Schechter parameters slightly
depend on the adopted peculiar velocity field models.
  The shape of the luminosity function of spiral galaxies does not differ
significantly from that of E-S0 galaxies. On the other hand, the late-type
spirals and irregulars have a very steeply rising luminosity function towards
the faint end, whereas the ellipticals appreciably decrease in number towards
low luminosities.
  The presence of galaxy systems in the NOG sample does not affect
significantly the field galaxy luminosity function, since environmental effects
on the total luminosity function appear to be marginal.
