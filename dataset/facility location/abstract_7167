We studied in detail the binary cluster candidates SL 538 and NGC 2006 in the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This cluster pair is located in the northwestern
part of the large OB association LH 77 in supergiant shell LMC 4. A third star
cluster, KMHK 1019, is located within 5' from the cluster pair. Our study is
the first age determination of SL 538 and NGC 2006 that is based on CMDs. We
derived an age of 18+/-2 Myr for SL 538, 22.5+/-2.5 Myr for NGC 2006, and 16
Myr for KMHK 1019. Thus the three clusters are (nearly) coeval. We identified
Be star candidates and find the same ratio N(Be)/N(B) for the components of the
binary cluster (12%) while the amount of Be stars detected in KMHK 1019 (5%)
and in the surrounding field (2%) is considerably lower. Since Be stars are
usually rapid rotators this may indicate intrinsically higher rotational
velocities in the components of the cluster pair. Also the IMF derived from the
CMDs shows the same slope for both SL 538 and NGC 2006 and is consistent with a
Salpeter IMF. An estimation of the cluster masses based on the IMF slopes
showed that both clusters have similar total masses. These findings support
joint, near-simultaneous formation of the cluster pair in the same giant
molecular cloud.
