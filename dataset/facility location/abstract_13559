Simultaneous radio and extreme ultraviolet (EUV)/white-light imaging data are
examined for a solar type II radio burst occurring on 2010 March 18 to deduce
its source location. Using a bow-shock model, we reconstruct the 3-dimensional
EUV wave front (presumably the type-II emitting shock) based on the imaging
data of the two STEREO spacecraft. It is then combined with the Nan\c{c}ay
radio imaging data to infer the 3-dimensional position of the type II source.
It is found that the type II source coincides with the interface between the
CME EUV wave front and a nearby coronal ray structure, providing evidence that
the type II emission is physically related to the CME-ray interaction. This
result, consistent with those of previous studies, is based on simultaneous
radio and EUV imaging data for the first time.
