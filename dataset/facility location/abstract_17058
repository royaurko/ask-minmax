Fluctuations in systems away from thermal equilibrium have features that have
no analog in equilibrium systems. One of such features concerns large rare
excursions far from the stable state in the space of dynamical variables. For
equilibrium systems, the most probable fluctuational trajectory to a given
state is related to the fluctuation-free trajectory back to the stable state by
time reversal. This is no longer true for nonequilibrium systems, where the
pattern of the most probable trajectories generally displays singularities.
Here we study how the singularities emerge as the system is driven away from
equilibrium, and whether a driving strength threshold is required for their
onset. Using a resonantly modulated oscillator as a model, we identify two
distinct scenarios, depending on the speed of the optimal path in thermal
equilibrium. If the position away from the stable state along the optimal path
grows exponentially in time, the singularities emerge without a threshold. We
find the scaling of the location of the singularities as a function of the
control parameter. If the growth away from the stable state is faster than
exponential, characterized by the ability to reach infinity in finite time,
there is a threshold for the onset of singularities, which we study for the
model.
