By means of Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations of a coarse-grained model for
flexible polymers, we investigate how the integrated autocorrelation times of
different energetic and structural quantities depend on the temperature. We
show that, due to critical slowing down, an extremal autocorrelation time can
also be considered as an indicator for the collapse transition that helps to
locate the transition point. This is particularly useful for finite systems,
where response quantities such as the specific heat do not necessarily exhibit
clear indications for pronounced thermal activity.
