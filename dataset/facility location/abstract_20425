We report an accurate measurement of the geomagnetically trapped proton
fluxes for kinetic energy above > 70 MeV performed by the PAMELA mission at low
Earth orbits (350-610 km). Data were analyzed in the frame of the adiabatic
theory of charged particle motion in the geomagnetic field. Flux properties
were investigated in detail, providing a full characterization of the particle
radiation in the South Atlantic Anomaly region, including locations, energy
spectra and pitch angle distributions. PAMELA results significantly improve the
description of the Earth's radiation environment at low altitudes placing
important constraints on the trapping and interaction processes, and can be
used to validate current trapped particle radiation models.
