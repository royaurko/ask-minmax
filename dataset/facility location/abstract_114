A polarization control experiment by utilizing a pair of crossed undulators
has been proposed for the Shanghai deep ultraviolet free electron laser test
facility. Numerical simulations indicate that, with the electromagnetic
phase-shifter located between the two crossed planar undulators, fully coherent
radiation with 100 nJ order pulse energy, 5 picoseconds pulse length and
circular polarization degree above 90% could be generated. The physical design
study and the preparation status of the experiment are presented in the paper.
