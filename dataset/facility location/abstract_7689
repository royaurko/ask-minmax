We have used the Australia Telescope Compact Array to undertake the first
high-resolution observations of the 19.9-GHz methanol maser transition. The
emission is coincident with the location of the targeted 6.7-GHz methanol
masers to within 0.2 arcseconds in absolute position. We find that the relative
distribution of the 19.9-GHz maser emission in our sample differs from that
observed in the 6.7-GHz transition, in contrast to the similar distribution
often seen in the 6.7- and 12.2-GHz methanol masers in many sources. We also
find that the peak velocity for the 19.9-GHz methanol masers is frequently
different from that observed in other class II transitions in the same regions.
These two results suggest that while 19.9-GHz methanol masers arise from the
same general location as other class II transitions, they are likely not
coincident on milliarcsecond scales; which has implications for
multi-transitional modelling of class II methanol maser sources. We have
investigated the properties of the OH and other classII methanol transitions
for those 107-GHz methanol masers with and without an associated 19.9-GHz
methanol maser. On the basis of these comparisons we suggest that the 19.9-GHz
transition traces an evolutionary phase around the peak of the class II maser
luminosity into its decline.
