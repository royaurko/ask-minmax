We present a search for laser emission coming from point sources in the
vicinity of 2796 stars, including 1368 Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) that
host one or more exoplanets. We search for extremely narrow emission lines in
the wavelength region between 3640 and 7890 Angstroms using the Keck 10-meter
telescope and spectroscopy with high resolution ($\lambda/\Delta \lambda$ =
60,000). Laser emission lines coming from non-natural sources are distinguished
from natural astrophysical sources by being monochromatic and coming from an
unresolved point in space. We search for laser emission located 2-7 arcsec from
the 2796 target stars. The detectability of laser emission is limited by
Poisson statistics of the photons and scattered light, yielding a detection
threshold flux of approximately $10^{-2}$ photons $m^{-2} s^{-1}$ for typical
Kepler stars and 1 photon $m^{-2} s^{-1}$ for solar-type stars within 100
light-years. Diffraction-limited lasers having a 10-meter aperture can be
detected from 100 light-years away if their power exceeds 90 W, and from 1000
light-years away (Kepler planets), if their power exceeds 1 kW (from lasers
located 60-200 AU, and 2000-7000 AU from the nearby and Kepler stars,
respectively). We did not find any such laser emission coming from any of the
2796 target stars. We discuss the implications for the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).
