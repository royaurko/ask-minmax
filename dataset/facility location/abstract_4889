In this paper, we provide a mathematical model for the electrolocation in
weakly electric fishes. We first investigate the forward complex conductivity
problem and derive the approximate boundary conditions on the skin of the fish.
Then we provide a dipole approximation for small targets away from the fish.
Based on this approximation, we obtain a non-iterative location search
algorithm using multi-frequency measurements. We present numerical experiments
to illustrate the performance and the stability of the proposed multi-frequency
location search algorithm. Finally, in the case of disk- and ellipse-shaped
targets, we provide a method to reconstruct separately the conductivity, the
permittivity, and the size of the targets from multi-frequency measurements.
