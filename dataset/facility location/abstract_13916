Persistent homology captures the evolution of topological features of a model
as a parameter changes. The most commonly used summary statistics of persistent
homology are the barcode and the persistence diagram. Another summary
statistic, the persistence landscape, was recently introduced by Bubenik. It is
a functional summary, so it is easy to calculate sample means and variances,
and it is straightforward to construct various test statistics. Implementing a
permutation test we detect conformational changes between closed and open forms
of the maltose-binding protein, a large biomolecule consisting of 370 amino
acid residues. Furthermore, persistence landscapes can be applied to machine
learning methods. A hyperplane from a support vector machine shows the clear
separation between the closed and open proteins conformations. Moreover,
because our approach captures dynamical properties of the protein our results
may help in identifying residues susceptible to ligand binding; we show that
the majority of active site residues and allosteric pathway residues are
located in the vicinity of the most persistent loop in the corresponding
filtered Vietoris-Rips complex. This finding was not observed in the classical
anisotropic network model.
