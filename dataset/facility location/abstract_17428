Previous SiO maps of the innermost regions of HH212 set strong constraints on
the structure and origin of this jet. They rule out a fast wide-angle wind, and
tentatively favor a magneto-centrifugal disk wind launched out to 0.6 AU. We
aim to assess the SiO content at the base of the HH212 jet to set an
independent constraint on the location of the jet launch zone with respect to
the dust sublimation radius. We present the first sub-arcsecond (0"44x0"96) CO
map of the HH212 jet base, obtained with the IRAM Plateau de Bure
Interferometer. Combining this with previous SiO(5-4) data, we infer the
CO(2-1) opacity and mass-flux in the high-velocity jet and arrive at a much
tighter lower limit to the SiO abundance than possible from the (optically
thick) SiO emission alone. Gas-phase SiO at high velocity contains at least 10%
of the elemental silicon if the jet is dusty, and at least 40% if the jet is
dust-free, if CO and SiO have similar excitation temperatures. Such a high SiO
content is challenging for current chemical models of both dust-free winds and
dusty interstellar shocks. Updated chemical models (equatorial dust-free winds,
highly magnetized dusty shocks) and observations of higher J CO lines are
required to elucidate the dust content and launch radius of the HH212
high-velocity jet.
