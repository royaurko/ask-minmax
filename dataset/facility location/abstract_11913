Comet NEAT C/2001 Q4 was observed for linear polarization using the optical
polarimeter mounted at the 1.2m telescope at Mt. Abu Observatory, during the
months of May and June 2004. Observations were conducted through the
International Halley Watch narrow band (continuum) and B,V,R broad band
filters. During the observing run the phase angle ranged from 85.6 deg in May
to 55 deg in June. As expected, polarization increases with wavelength in this
phase angle range. Polarization colour in the narrow bands changes at different
epochs, perhaps related to cometary activity or molecular emission
contamination. The polarization was also measured in the cometary coma at
different locations along a line, in the direction of the tail. As expected, we
notice minor decrease in the polarization as photocenter (nucleus) is traversed
while brightness decreases sharply away from it. Based on these polarization
observations we infer that the comet NEAT C/2001 Q4 has high polarization and a
typical grain composition- mixture of silicates and organics.
