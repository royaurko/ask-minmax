Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheet, one of two dimensional (2D)
semiconductors, has recently been regarded as a promising material to break
through the limit of present semiconductors including graphene. However, its
potential in carrier mobility has still been depreciated since the field-effect
mobilities have only been measured from metal-insulator-semiconductor field
effect transistors (MISFETs), where the transport behavior of conducting
carriers located at the insulator/MoS2 interface is unavoidably interfered by
the interface traps and gate voltage. Here, we for the first time report
MoS2-based metal semiconductor field-effect transistors (MESFETs) with NiOx
Schottky electrode, where the maximum mobilities or carrier transport behavior
of the Schottky devices may hardly be interfered by on-state gate field. Our
MESFETs with single-, double-, and triple-layered MoS2 respectively demonstrate
high mobilities of 6000, 3500, and 2800 cm2/Vs at a certain low threshold
voltage of -1 ~ -2 V. The thickness-dependent mobility difference in MESFETs
was theoretically explained with electron scattering reduction mechanisms.
