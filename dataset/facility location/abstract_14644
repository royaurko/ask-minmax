We present 3 methods for the subtraction of non-cosmic and unresolved cosmic
backgrounds observed by the Low-Energy Concentrator Spectrometer (LECS)
on-board BeppoSAX. Removal of these backgrounds allows a more accurate modeling
of the spectral data from point and small-scale extended sources. At high
(>|25| degree) galactic latitudes, subtraction using a standard background
spectrum works well. At low galactic latitudes, or in complex regions of the
X-ray sky, two alternative methods are presented. The first uses counts
obtained from two semi-annuli near the outside of the LECS field of view to
estimate the background at the source location. The second method uses ROSAT
Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) all-sky survey data to estimate
the LECS background spectrum for a given pointing position. A comparison of the
results from these methods provides an estimate of the systematic
uncertainties. For high galactic latitude fields, all 3 methods give 3 sigma
confidence uncertainties of <0.9 10^-3 count/s (0.1-10 keV), or <1.5 10^-3
count/s (0.1-2 keV). These correspond to 0.1-2.0 keV fluxes of 0.7-1.8 and
0.5-1.1 10^-13 erg/cm2/s for a power-law spectrum with a photon index of 2 and
photoelectric absorption of 3 10^20 and 3 10^21 atom/cm2, respectively. At low
galactic latitudes, or in complex regions of the X-ray sky, the uncertainties
are a factor ~2.5 higher.
