We conduct a search for the 4He-eta bound state with the WASA-at-COSY
facility via the measurement of the excitation function for the reaction
dd->3Heppi-. In first experiment performed in June 2008, we used COSY deuteron
beam with a slowly ramped beam momentum corresponding to a variation of the
excess energy for the 4He-eta system from -51.4 MeV to 22 MeV. Here we report
on the status of the measurement and the data evaluation.
