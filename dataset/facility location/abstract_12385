Close inspection of the pre-edge in oxygen near-edge x-ray absorption fine
structure spectra of single step, gas phase synthesized titanium oxynitride
photocatalysts with 20 nm particle size reveals an additional eg resonance in
the VB that went unnoticed in previous TiO2 anion doping studies. The relative
spectral weight of this Ti(3d)-O(2p) hybridized state with respect to and
located between the readily established t2g and eg resonances scales
qualitatively with the photocatalytic decomposition power, suggesting that this
extra resonance bears co-responsibility for the photocatalytic performance of
titanium oxynitrides at visible light wavelengths.
