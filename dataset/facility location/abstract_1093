This paper illustrates the design, fabrication and experiment results of
surface preparation system for 500MHz superconducting cavity at Shanghai
Institute of Applied Physic (SINAP). The SINAP established a set of clean room,
buffered chemical polishing equipment, and high pressure ultra-pure water
rinsing facility. The whole surface preparation procedure has been operated
successfully and verified by the successful vertical tests of 500MHz single
cell superconducting cavity.
