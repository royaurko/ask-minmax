A summary is given of some important developments in QCD studies of the
nucleon as presented at this workshop. Based on these developments some
expectations for the short- and long-term future of the field are sketched.
Taken together, the summary of the workshop and the future perspectives result
in a {\sl Road Map} for experimental studies of the QCD structure of the
nucleon. The Road Map includes as a long-term goal the construction of new
lepton-hadron scattering facilities both in Europe and the United States.
