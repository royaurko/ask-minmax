In this paper, we study the inverse electromagnetic medium scattering problem
of estimating the support and shape of medium scatterers from scattered
electric or magnetic near-field data. We shall develop a novel direct sampling
method based on an analysis of electromagnetic scattering and the behavior of
the fundamental solution. The method is applicable even with one incident field
and needs only to compute inner products of the measured scattered field with
the fundamental solutions located at sampling points. Hence it is strictly
direct, computationally very efficient, and highly tolerant to the presence of
noise in the data. Two- and three-dimensional numerical experiments indicate
that it can provide reliable support estimates of one single and multiple
scatterers in case of both exact and highly noisy data.
