The neutron and proton drip lines represent the limits of the nuclear
landscape. While the proton drip line is measured experimentally up to rather
high $Z$-values, the location of the neutron drip line for absolute majority of
elements is based on theoretical predictions which involve extreme
extrapolations. The first ever systematic investigation of the location of the
proton and neutron drip lines in the covariant density functional theory has
been performed by employing a set of the state-of-the-art parametrizations.
Calculated theoretical uncertainties in the position of two-neutron drip line
are compared with those obtained in non-relativistic DFT calculations. Shell
effects drastically affect the shape of two-neutron drip line. In particular,
model uncertainties in the definition of two-neutron drip line at $Z\sim 54,
N=126$ and $Z\sim 82, N=184$ are very small due to the impact of spherical
shell closures at N=126 and 184.
