The critical behavior of two-dimensional $n$-vector $\lambda\phi^4$ field
model is studied within the framework of pseudo-$\epsilon$ expansion approach.
Pseudo-$\epsilon$ expansions for Wilson fixed point location $g^*$ and critical
exponents originating from five-loop 2D renormalization group series are
derived. Numerical estimates obtained within Pad\'e and Pad\'e-Borel
resummation procedures as well as by direct summation are presented for $n =
1$, $n = 0$ and $n = -1$, i. e. for the models which are exactly solvable. The
pseudo-$\epsilon$ expansions for $g^*$, critical exponents $\gamma$ and $\nu$
have small lower-order coefficients and slow increasing higher-order ones. As a
result, direct summation of these series with optimal cut off provides
numerical estimates that are no worse than those given by the resummation
approaches mentioned. This enables one to consider the pseudo-$\epsilon$
expansion technique itself as some specific resummation method.
