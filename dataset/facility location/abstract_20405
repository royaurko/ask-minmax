We present ALMA Cycle-0 observations of the CO (6-5) line emission and of the
435um dust continuum emission in the central kpc of NGC 1614, a local luminous
infrared galaxy (LIRG) at a distance of 67.8 Mpc (1 arcsec = 329 pc). The CO
emission is well resolved by the ALMA beam (0".26 x 0".20) into a
circum-nuclear ring, with an integrated flux of f_{CO(6-5)} = 898 (+-153) Jy
km/s, which is 63(+-12)% of the total CO(6-5) flux measured by Herschel. The
molecular ring, located between 100pc < r < 350pc from the nucleus, looks
clumpy and includes seven unresolved (or marginally resolved) knots with median
velocity dispersion of 40 km/s. These knots are associated with strong star
formation regions with \Sigma_{SFR} 100 M_\sun/yr/kpc^{2} and \Sigma_{Gas}
1.0E4 M_\sun/pc^{2}. The non-detections of the nucleus in both the CO (6-5)
line emission and the 435um continuum rule out, with relatively high
confidence, a Compton-thick AGN in NGC 1614. Comparisons with radio continuum
emission show a strong deviation from an expected local correlation between
\Sigma_{Gas} and \Sigma_{SFR}, indicating a breakdown of the Kennicutt-Schmidt
law on the linear scale of 100 pc.
