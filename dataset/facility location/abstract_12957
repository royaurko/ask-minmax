MarcoPolo-R is a medium-class space mission proposed for the 2015-2025 ESA
Cosmic Vision Program with primary goal to return to Earth an unaltered sample
from a primitive near-Earth asteroid (NEA). Among the proposed instruments on
board, its narrow-angle camera (NAC) should be able to image the candidate
object with spatial resolution of 3 mm per pixel at 200 m from its surface. The
camera should also be able to support the lander descent operations by imaging
the target from several distances in order to locate a suitable place for the
landing. Hence a refocusing system is requested to accomplish this task,
extending its imaging capabilities. Here we present a three-mirror anastigmat
(TMA) common-axis optical design, providing high-quality imaging performances
by selecting as entrance pupil the system aperture stop and exploiting the
motion of a single mirror inside the instrument to allow the wide image
refocusing requested, from infinity up to 200 m above the NEA surface. Such
proposal matches with the NAC technical specifications and can be easily
implemented with present day technology.
