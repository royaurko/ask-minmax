Even from a light polluted city it is possible to observe Near Earth
Asteroids (NEAs) at opposition using a small telescope equipped with a CCD
camera. In this paper, we will overview first the major NEA programs,
continuing with planning the observations and the data reduction. Second, we
will present a NEA follow-up program carried out on the 60-cm telescope at York
University Observatory in Toronto, Canada. Part of this program, five NEAs have
been observed during ten nights. Their astrometric and photometric data were
reduced and sent to the Minor Planet Centre, following which an observatory
code was assigned and four batches have been included in the NEODyS database
and MPC Circulars. The results are applicable to any other small facility.
