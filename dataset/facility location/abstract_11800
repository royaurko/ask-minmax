Implicit particle filters for data assimilation generate high-probability
samples by representing each particle location as a separate function of a
common reference variable. This representation requires that a certain
underdetermined equation be solved for each particle and at each time an
observation becomes available. We present a new implementation of implicit
filters in which we find the solution of the equation via a random map. As
examples, we assimilate data for a stochastically driven Lorenz system with
sparse observations and for a stochastic Kuramoto-Sivashinski equation with
observations that are sparse in both space and time.
