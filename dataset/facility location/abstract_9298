Although analytical studies on the secular motion of the irregular satellites
have been published recently, these theories have not yet been satisfactorily
reconciled with the results of direct numerical integrations. These
discrepancies occur because in secular theories the disturbing function is
averaged over orbital motions, whereas instead one should take into account
some large periodic terms, most notably the so-called ``evection''. We
demonstrate that such terms can be incorporated into the Kozai formalism, and
that our synthetic approach produces much better agreement with results from
symplectic integrations. Using this method, we plot the locations of secular
resonances in the orbital-element space, and we note that the distribution of
irregular satellite clusters appears to be non-random. We find that the large
majority of irregular-satellite groups cluster close to the secular resonances,
with several objects having practically stationary pericenters. None of the
largest satellites belong to this class, so we argue that this dichotomy
implies that the smaller near-resonant satellites might have been captured
differently than the largest irregulars.
