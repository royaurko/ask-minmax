We present X-ray equivalent width imaging of the supernova remnant (SNR) 3C
397 for Mg He\alpha, Si He\alpha, S He\alpha, and Fe K\alpha complex lines with
the Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. The images reveal that the heavier the
element is, the smaller the extent of the element distribution is. The Mg
emission is evidently enhanced in the southeastern blow-out region, well along
the radio boundary there, and appears to partially envelope the eastern Fe
knot. Two bilateral hat-like Si line-emitting structures are along the northern
and southern borders, roughly symmetric with respect to the southeast-northwest
elongation axis. An S line-emitting shell is located just inner to the northern
radio and IR shell, indicating of a layer of reversely shocked sulphur in the
ejecta. A few enhanced Fe features are basically aligned along the diagonal of
the rectangular shape of the SNR, which implicates an early asymmetric SN
explosion.
