A typical computational geometry problem begins: Consider a set P of n points
in R^d. However, many applications today work with input that is not precisely
known, for example when the data is sensed and has some known error model. What
if we do not know the set P exactly, but rather we have a probability
distribution mu_p governing the location of each point p in P?
  Consider a set of (non-fixed) points P, and let mu_P be the probability
distribution of this set. We study several measures (e.g. the radius of the
smallest enclosing ball, or the area of the smallest enclosing box) with
respect to mu_P. The solutions to these problems do not, as in the traditional
case, consist of a single answer, but rather a distribution of answers. We
describe several data structures that approximate distributions of answers for
shape fitting problems.
  We provide simple and efficient randomized algorithms for computing all of
these data structures, which are easy to implement and practical. We provide
some experimental results to assert this. We also provide more involved
deterministic algorithms for some of these data structures that run in time
polynomial in n and 1/eps, where eps is the approximation factor.
