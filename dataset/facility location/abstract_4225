We consider linearized 5-d gravity in the Randall-Sundrum brane world. The
class of static solutions for linearized Einstein equations is found. Also we
obtaine wave solutions describing radiation from an imaginary point source
located at the Planck distance from the brane. We analyze the fields asymptotic
behavior and peculiarities of matter sources.
