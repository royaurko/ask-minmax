In the self--lensing framework, we estimate the modal values of the mass of
the gravitational lenses found by the MACHO collaboration towards the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our results suggest that only the events located near
the center can be identified as a low mass star population belonging to the LMC
disk or bar components.
