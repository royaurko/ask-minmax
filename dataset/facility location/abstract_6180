The problem of interpolation at $(n+1)^2$ points on the unit sphere
$\mathbb{S}^2$ by spherical polynomials of degree at most $n$ is proved to have
a unique solution for several sets of points. The points are located on a
number of circles on the sphere with even number of points on each circle. The
proof is based on a method of factorization of polynomials.
