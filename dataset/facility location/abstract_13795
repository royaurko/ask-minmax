We propose a new experiment Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider forward (RHICf)
for the precise measurements of very forward particle production at RHIC. The
proposal is to install the LHCf Arm2 detector in the North side of the ZDC
installation slot at the PHENIX interaction point. By installing
high-resolution electromagnetic calorimeters at this location we can measure
the spectra of photons, neutrons and pi0 at pseudorapidity eta>6.
