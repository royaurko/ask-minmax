The latest observations of line and continuum spectra emitted from the
extended narrow line region (ENLR) of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7212 are
analysed using models accounting for photoionization from the active nucleus
and shocks. The results show that relatively high (500--800 \kms) shock
velocities appear on the edge of the cone and outside of it. The model-inferred
AGN flux, which is lower than $10^{-11}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ eV$^{-1}$
at the Lyman limit, is more typical of low-luminosity AGN, and less so for
Seyfert 2 galaxies. The preshock densities are characteristic of the ENLR and
range between 80--150 cm$^{-3}$. Nitrogen and sulphur are found depleted by a
factor lower than 2, particularly at the eastern edge. Oxygen is depleted at
several locations. The Fe/H ratio is approximately solar, whereas the Ne/H
relative abundance is unusually high, 1.5--2 times the solar value. Modelling
the continuum spectral energy distribution (SED), we have found radio
synchrotron radiation generated by the Fermi mechanism at the shock front,
whereas the X-rays are produced by the bremsstrahlung from a relatively high
temperature plasma.
