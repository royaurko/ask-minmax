We present recent ROSAT, ASCA and SAX observations of intermediate BL Lac
objects (IBLs), i.e. BL Lacs which are located between high-energy and
low-energy peaked BL Lac objects with respect to alpha_rx. Both the statistical
properties of IBLs from the RGB sample and a detailed broad band X-ray spectral
analysis of two objects (1424+2401, 1055+5644) point towards a continuous
distribution of synchrotron emission peak frequencies among BL Lac objects.
