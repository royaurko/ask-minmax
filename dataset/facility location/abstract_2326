The simulation of Systems-on-Chip (SoC) is nowadays a hot topic because,
beyond providing many debugging facilities, it allows the development of
dedicated software before the hardware is available. Low-consumption CPUs such
as ARM play a central role in SoC. However, the effectiveness of simulation
depends on the faithfulness of the simulator. To this effect, we propose here
to prove significant parts of such a simulator, SimSoC. Basically, on one hand,
we develop a Coq formal model of the ARM architecture while on the other hand,
we consider a version of the simulator including components written in
Compcert-C. Then we prove that the simulation of ARM operations, according to
Compcert-C formal semantics, conforms to the expected formal model of ARM. Size
issues are partly dealt with using automatic generation of significant parts of
the Coq model and of SimSoC from the official textual definition of ARM.
However, this is still a long-term project. We report here the current stage of
our efforts and discuss in particular the use of Compcert-C in this framework.
