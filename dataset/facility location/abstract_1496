We present first results from a spectroscopic survey of 2000 F/G stars
0.5--5kpc from the Galactic plane, obtained with the 2dF facility on the AAT.
These data show the mean rotation velocity of the thick disk about the Galactic
center a few kpc from the plane is very different than expectation, being about
100km/s, rather than the predicted ~180km/s. We propose that our sample is
dominated by stars from a disrupted satellite which merged with the disk of the
Milky Way Galaxy some 10-12Gyr ago. We do not find evidence for the many
substantial mergers expected in hierarchical clustering theories. We find yet
more evidence that the stellar halo retains kinematic substructure, indicative
of minor mergers
