NGC 5850 is a prototype of double-barred galaxy (Friedli et al. 1996)
classified as SBb(sr) I-II (Higdon et al. 1998; Prieto et al. 1997). This kind
of system is primordial to understand the physical mechanism responsible for
feeding galaxy nuclei and boost the star formation rate. The CO(1-0) emission
has been mapped in NGC 5850, i) in the very center, using the IRAM Plateau de
Bure interferometer, to reach a 2.4\arcsec$\times$1.5\arcsec\
(PA$=$$-165^\circ$) spatial resolution, and ii) in the primary bar with the
IRAM-30m telescope, with a 22\arcsec beam. We have found CO emission in the
center of NGC 5850, located in a single peak on the northern part of the
nuclear ring. The high velocity dispersion of the molecular gas may prevent
star formation in that region. Gas simulations performed with a single bar
pattern and without the tidal influence of the companion NGC 5846 are unable to
reproduce the features observed in NGC 5850 (Combes, Leon, Friedli & Buta 1998,
in preparation). The decoupling of a second bar appears necessary. The presence
of the single molecular peak could be due to an $m=1$ mode excited by the
massive companion.
