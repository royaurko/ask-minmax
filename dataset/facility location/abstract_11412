Striking examples of episodic activity in active galactic nuclei are the
double-double radio galaxies (DDRGs) with two pairs of oppositely-directed
radio lobes from two different cycles of activity. Although there are over
about a dozen good examples of DDRGs, so far no case of one associated with a
quasar has been reported. We present Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope
observations of a candidate double-double radio quasar (DDRQ), J0935+0204
(4C02.27), and suggest that radio jets in this source may also have been
intrinsically asymmetric, contributing to the large observed asymmetries in the
flux density and location of both pairs of radio lobes.
