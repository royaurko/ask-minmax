The aim of this work is to present and discuss the observations of the iron
peak (Fe, Ni) and neutron-capture element (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu)
abundances for 276 FGK dwarfs, located in the galactic disk with metallicity -1
< [Fe/H] < +0.3. Atmospheric parameters and chemical composition of the studied
stars were determined from an high resolution, high signal-to-noise echelle
spectra obtained with the echelle spectrograph ELODIE at the Observatoire de
Haute-Provence (France). Effective temperatures were estimated by the line
depth ratio method and from the H_{\alpha} line-wing fitting. Surface gravities
(log g) were determined by parallaxes and the ionization balance of iron.
Abundance determinations were carried out using the LTE approach, taking the
hyperfine structure for Eu into account, and the abundance of Ba was computed
under the NLTE approximation. We are able to assign most of the stars in our
sample to the substructures of the Galaxy thick disk, thin disk, or Hercules
stream according to their kinematics. The classification of 27 stars is
uncertain. For most of the stars in the sample, the abundances of
neutron-capture elements have not been measured earlier. For all of them, we
provide the chemical composition and discuss the contribution from different
nucleosynthesis processes.
