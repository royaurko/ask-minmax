Project GRAND is an extensive air shower array utilizing position sensitive
detectors of proportional wire chambers. The 64 detectors deployed in a field
100 m x 100 m are located at 86.2 deg W and 41.7 deg N, at 220 m above sea
level. The project was completed about two years ago and has been taking data,
simultaneously on two triggers: 1) multiple-hit coincidence triggers which
collect data on extensive air showers, and 2) 200 Hz triggers which collect the
single tracks stored in each station during the last 5 msec.
