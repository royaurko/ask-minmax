We present the first spatially resolved spectroscopic imaging observations of
the 12CO(1-0) line emission in the central 2.5 kpc of the Seyfert 1 galaxy
NGC4151, obtained with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI). Most of
the cold molecular gas is distributed along two curved gas lanes about 1 kpc
north and south of the active nucleus, coincident with the circumnuclear dust
ring noted by previous contributors. These CO arcs lie within the Inner Lindblad
Resonance of the large scale oval bar and have kinematics consistent with those
derived from neutral hydrogen observations of the disk and bar. Two additional
gas clumps are detected that show non-circular motions - one associated with
the southern gas lane and one lying ~600 pc north of the nucleus. Closer to the
nucleus, no cold molecular gas is detected in the central 300 pc where abundant
near-IR H2 line emission arises. This suggests that the H2 line emission is not
a good indicator for a cold gas reservoir in NGC4151 and that the H2 is likely
photo-excited by the AGN. The upper limit of the CO mass in the central 300 pc
is sufficient to support the AGN activity at its current level for 10^7 yrs.
The total cold molecular mass detected by PdBI is 4.3 10^7 Msun. Finally, 3 mm
continuum emission arising from the location of the AGN is detected with a flux
of S~14 mJy and appears to be unresolved at an angular resolution of 2.8" (~180
pc).
