This contribution essentially will be divided into two parts: First, a brief
overview on topical accelerator applications in Europe, a selection of the
European 6th framework accelerator and ADS programs will be given, second the
emphasis will be put on selected nuclear data required for designing facilities
planned or even under construction. In this second part the progress on nuclear
data in the EU FP6 Integrated Project IP-EUROTRANS (specifically NUDATRA) is
summarized. For proton-induced reactions in the energy range of 200-2500 MeV
experimental data and model comparisons are shown on total and double
differential production cross sections of H- and He-isotopes and intermediate
mass fragments.
