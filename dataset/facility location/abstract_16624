We focus on the non-thermal components of the electron distribution in the
keV range and analyse high-energy resolution X-ray spectra detected by RESIK
and RHESSI for three solar flares.In the 2-4 keV range we assume that the
electron distribution can be modelled by an n-distribution. Using a method of
line-intensity ratios, we analyse allowed and satellite lines of Si observed by
RESIK and estimate the parameters of this n-distribution. At higher energies we
explore RHESSI bremsstrahlung spectra. Adopting a forward-fitting approach and
thick-target approximation, we determine the characteristics of injected
electron beams. RHESSI non-thermal component associated with the electron beam
is correlated well with presence of the non-thermal n-distribution obtained
from the RESIK spectra. In addition, such an n-distribution occurs during radio
bursts observed in the 0.61-15.4 GHz range. Furthermore, we show that the
n-distribution could also explain RHESSI emission below ~5 keV. Therefore, two
independent diagnostics methods indicate the flare plasma being affected by the
electron beam can have a non-thermal component in the ~2-5 keV range, which is
described by the n-distribution well. Finally, spectral line analysis reveals
that the n-distribution does not occupy the same location as the thermal
component detected by RHESSI at ~10 keV.
