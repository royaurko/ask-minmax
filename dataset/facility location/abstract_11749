The next generation low-background detectors operating underground aim for
unprecedented low levels of radioactive backgrounds. Although the radioactive
decays of airborne radon (particularly Rn-222) and its subsequent progeny
present in an experiment are potential backgrounds, also problematic is the
deposition of radon progeny on detector materials. Exposure to radon at any
stage of assembly of an experiment can result in surface contamination by
progeny supported by the long half life (22 y) of Pb-210 on sensitive locations
of a detector. An understanding of the potential surface contamination from
deposition will enable requirements of radon-reduced air and clean room
environments for the assembly of low background experiments. It is known that
there are a number of environmental factors that govern the deposition of
progeny onto surfaces. However, existing models have not explored the impact of
some environmental factors important for low background experiments. A test
stand has been constructed to deposit radon progeny on various surfaces under a
controlled environment in order to develop a deposition model. Results from
this test stand and the resulting deposition model are presented.
