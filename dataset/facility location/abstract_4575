We explore the possibility to locate a brane in black hole bulks. We study
explicitly the cases of BHTZ and Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter (AdS) black
holes. Our result is that in these cases branes cannot be supported by brane
tension alone and it is necessary to introduce other forms of matter on the
brane. We find classes of perfect fluid solutions obeying to peculiar state
equations. For the case of BHTZ bulk geometry the state equation takes exactly
the form of a ``Chaplygin gas'', which is relevant in the brane context. In the
Schwarzschild-AdS case we find new state equations which reduce to the
Chaplygin form when the brane is located near the horizon.
