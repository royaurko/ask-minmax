This paper presents an analytical investigation on the outage performance of
dual-hop multiple antenna amplify-and-forward relaying systems in the presence
of interference. For both the fixed-gain and variable-gain relaying schemes,
exact analytical expressions for the outage probability of the systems are
derived. Moreover, simple outage probability approximations at the high signal
to noise ratio regime are provided, and the diversity order achieved by the
systems are characterized. Our results suggest that variable-gain relaying
systems always outperform the corresponding fixed-gain relaying systems. In
addition, the fixed-gain relaying schemes only achieve diversity order of one,
while the achievable diversity order of the variable-gain relaying scheme
depends on the location of the multiple antennas.
