We evaluate susceptibility to lava flows on Mt. Etna based on specially
designed die-toss experiments using probabilities for type, time and place of
activation from the volcano's 400-year recorded history and current studies on
its known fractures and fissures. The types of activations were forcast using a
table of probabilities for events, typed by duration and volume of ejecta.
Lengths of time were represented by the number of activations to expect within
a given time-frame, calculated assuming Poisson-distributed inter-arrival times
for activations. Locations of future activations were forecast with a
probability distribution function for activation probabilities. Most likely
scenarios for risk and resulting topography were generated for Etna's next
activation (average 7.76 years), the next 25, 50 and 100 years. Forecasts for
areas most likely affected are in good agreement with previous risk studies
made. Forecasts for risks of lava invasions, as well as future topographies
might be a first. Threats to lifelines are also discussed.
