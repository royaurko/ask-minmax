We present a method for decoupling epitaxial graphene grown on SiC(0001) by
intercalation of a layer of fluorine at the interface. The fluorine atoms do
not enter into a covalent bond with graphene, but rather saturate the substrate
Si bonds. This configuration of the fluorine atoms induces a remarkably large
hole density of p \approx 4.5 \times 1013 cm-2, equivalent to the location of
the Fermi level at 0.79 eV above the Dirac point ED .
