We present an experimental evidence of a bunch compression scheme that uses a
traveling wave accelerating structure as a compressor. The bunch length issued
from a laser-driven radio-frequency electron source was compressed by a factor
>3 using an S-band traveling wave structure located immediately downstream from
the electron source. Experimental data are found to be in good agreement with
particle tracking simulations.
