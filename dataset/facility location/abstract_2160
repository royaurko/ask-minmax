We use the recently developed Center for Radiative Shock Hydrodynamics
(CRASH) code to numerically simulate laser-driven radiative shock experiments.
These shocks are launched by an ablated beryllium disk and are driven down
xenon-filled plastic tubes. The simulations are initialized by the
two-dimensional version of the Lagrangian Hyades code which is used to evaluate
the laser energy deposition during the first 1.1ns. The later times are
calculated with the CRASH code. This code solves for the multi-material
hydrodynamics with separate electron and ion temperatures on an Eulerian
block-adaptive-mesh and includes a multi-group flux-limited radiation diffusion
and electron thermal heat conduction. The goal of the present paper is to
demonstrate the capability to simulate radiative shocks of essentially
three-dimensional experimental configurations, such as circular and elliptical
nozzles. We show that the compound shock structure of the primary and wall
shock is captured and verify that the shock properties are consistent with
order-of-magnitude estimates. The produced synthetic radiographs can be used
for comparison with future nozzle experiments at high-energy-density laser
facilities.
