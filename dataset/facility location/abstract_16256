Electric field, uniform within the slab, emerging due to Fermi level pinning
at its both sides is analyzed using DFT simulations of the SiC surface slabs of
different thickness. It is shown that for thicker slab the field is nonuniform
and this fact is related to the surface state charge. Using the electron
density and potential profiles it is proved that for high precision simulations
it is necessary to take into account enough number of the Si-C layers. We show
that using 12 diatomic layers leads to satisfactory results. It is also
demonstrated that the change of the opposite side slab termination, both by
different type of atoms or by their location, can be used to adjust electric
field within the slab, creating a tool for simulation of surface properties,
depending on the doping in the bulk of semiconductor. Using these simulations
it was found that, depending on the electric field, the energy of the surface
states changes in a different way than energy of the bulk states. This
criterion can be used to distinguish Shockley and Tamm surface states. The
electronic properties, i.e. energy and type of surface states of the three
clean surfaces: 2H-, 4H-, 6H-SiC(0001), and SiC($000 \bar{1}$) are analyzed and
compared using field dependent DFT simulations.
