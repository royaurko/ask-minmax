All sufficiently massive clusters of galaxies are expected to be surrounded
by strong accretion shocks, where protons can be accelerated to $\sim
10^{18}$-$10^{19}$ eV under plausible conditions. Such protons interact with
the cosmic microwave background and efficiently produce very high energy
electron-positron pairs, which then radiate synchrotron and inverse Compton
emission, peaking respectively at hard X-ray and TeV gamma-ray energies.
Characterized by hard spectra (photon indices $\sim 1.5$) and spatial
distribution tracing the accretion shock, these can dominate over other
nonthermal components depending on the shock magnetic field. HESS and other
Cerenkov telescopes may detect the TeV emission from nearby clusters,
notwithstanding its extended nature. The hard X-rays may be observable by
future imaging facilities such as NeXT, and possibly also by ASTRO-E2/HXD. Such
detections will not only provide a clear signature of ultra-high energy proton
acceleration, but also an important probe of the accretion shock itself as well
as magnetic fields in the outermost regions of clusters.
