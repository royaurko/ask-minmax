We obtain a technique to reduce the computational complexity associated with
decoding of Hermitian codes. In particular, we propose a method to compute the
error locations and values using an uni-variate error locator and an
uni-variate error evaluator polynomial. To achieve this, we introduce the
notion of Semi-Erasure Decoding of Hermitian codes and prove that decoding of
Hermitian codes can always be performed using semi-erasure decoding. The
central results are:
  * Searching for error locations require evaluating an univariate error
locator polynomial over $q^2$ points as in Chien search for Reed-Solomon codes.
  * Forney's formula for error value computation in Reed-Solomon codes can
directly be applied to compute the error values in Hermitian codes.
  The approach develops from the idea that transmitting a modified form of the
information may be more efficient that the information itself.
