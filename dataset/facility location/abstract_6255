Complex photonic band structures (CPBS) of transmission metallic gratings
with rectangular slits are shown to exhibit strong discontinuities that are not
evidenced in the usual energetic band structures. These discontinuities are
located on Wood's anomalies and reveal unambiguously two different types of
resonances, which are identified as horizontal and vertical surface-plasmon
resonances. Spectral position and width of peaks in the transmission spectrum
can be directly extracted from CPBS for both kinds of resonances.
