The pair monitor is a beam profile monitor at interaction point (IP) for the
international linear collider (ILC). We have designed and developed the pair
monitor as a silicon pixel sensor which is located at about 400 cm from IP. As
the first step to develop the pair monitor, the readout ASIC was developed. In
this paper, test results of the readout ASIC and the future plan are reported.
