The BAT instrument tells the Swift satellite where to point to make immediate
follow-up observations of GRBs. The science software on board must efficiently
process gamma-ray events coming in at up to 34 kHz, identify rate increases
that could be due to GRBs while disregarding those from known sources, and
produce images to accurately and rapidly locate new Gamma-ray sources.
