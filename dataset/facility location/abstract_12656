The vertex detectors are crucial detectors for future linear e+e- colliders
since they must give the most accurate location of any outgoing charged
particles originating from the interaction point. The DEPFET collaboration is
developing a new type of pixel sensors which provide very low noise and high
spatial resolution. In order to precisely determine the track and vertex
positions, multiple scattering in the detector has to be reduced by minimizing
the material in the sensors, cooling, and support structures. A new method of
cooling by blowing air over the sensors has been developed and tested. It is
applied in the design and construction of the Belle-II detector and may be used
in the new generation of vertex detectors for linear colliders.
