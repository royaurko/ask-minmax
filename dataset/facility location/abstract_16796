Algol is a triple stellar system consisting of a close semidetached binary
orbited by a third object. Due to the disputed spatial orientation of the close
pair, the third body perturbation of this pair is a subject of much research.
In this study, we determine the spatial orientation of the close pair orbital
plane using the CHARA Array, a six-element optical/IR interferometer located on
Mount Wilson, and state-of-the-art e-EVN interferometric techniques. We find
that the longitude of the line of nodes for the close pair is
$\Omega_1=48\degr\pm2\degr$ and the mutual inclination of the orbital planes of
the close and the wide pairs is $95\degr\pm3\degr$. This latter value differs
by $5\degr$ from the formerly known $100\degr$ which would imply a very fast
inclination variation of the system, not borne out by the photometric
observations. We also investigated the dynamics of the system with numerical
integration of the equations of motions using our result as an initial
condition. We found large variations in the inclination of the close pair (its
amplitude $\sim 170\degr$) with a period of about 20 millennia. This result is
in good agreement with the photometrically observed change of amplitude in
Algol's primary minimum.
