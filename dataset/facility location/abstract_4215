We have studied the 3-flavor, finite temperature, QCD phase transition with
staggred fermions on an $ N_t=4$ lattice. By studying a variety of quark masses
we have located the critical point, $m_c$, where the first order 3-flavor
transition ends as lying in the region $0.32 \le m_c \le 0.35$ in lattice units
