We present a study based on more than 2500 uvby-measurements collected on HD
172189, a new eclipsing binary system with a Delta Sct-type pulsating component
that belongs to the open cluster IC 4756. The great interest of this object
lies in that three important characteristics coexist: cluster membership,
binarity and pulsation. Its binarity and the Delta Sct-type pulsations of one
component were detected in the course of several Stromgren photometric
campaigns. The frequency analysis of all the uvby out-of-eclipse data reveals a
clear frequency of 19.5974 c/d as well as the existence of other high values in
the range 18-20 c/d. We have also carried out a first evaluation of the binary
parameters and determined a value of 5.702 d for the orbital period. An
additional potential interest of HD 172189 resides in its location in the field
of view of the COROT mission and, therefore, this star is an excellent
candidate for becoming a target for asteroseismology.
