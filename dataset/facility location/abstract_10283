The flavor conversion of supernova neutrinos can lead to observable
signatures related to the unknown neutrino parameters. As one of the
determinants in dictating the efficiency of resonant flavor conversion, the
local density profile near the MSW resonance in a supernova environment is,
however, not so well understood. In this analysis, variable power-law functions
are adopted to represent the independent local density profiles near the
locations of resonance. It is shown that the uncertain matter density profile
in a supernova, the possible neutrino mass hierarchies, and the undetermined
1-3 mixing angle would result in six distinct scenarios in terms of the
survival probabilities of $\nu_{e}$ and $\bar{\nu_{e}}$. The feasibility of
probing the undetermined neutrino mass hierarchy and the 1-3 mixing angle with
the supernova neutrinos is then examined using several proposed experimental
observables. Given the incomplete knowledge of the supernova matter profile,
the analysis is further expanded to incorporate the Earth matter effect. The
possible impact due to the choice of models, which differ in the average energy
and in the luminosity of neutrinos, is also addressed in the analysis.
