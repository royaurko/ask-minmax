We have developed a multi-pixel beamformer technique, which can be used for
enhancing the capabilities for studying pulsars using an interferometric array.
Using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), we illustrate the application
of this efficient technique, which combines the enhanced sensitivity of a
coherent array beamformer with the wide field-of-view seen by an incoherent
array beamformer. Multi-pixel beamformer algorithm is implemented using the
recorded base-band data. With the optimisations in multi-pixelisation described
in this paper, it is now possible to form 16 directed beams in real-time. We
discuss a special application of this technique, where we use continuum imaging
followed by the multi-pixel beamformer to obtain the precise locations of newly
discovered millisecond pulsars with the GMRT. Accurate positions measured with
single observations enable highly sensitive follow-up studies using coherent
array beamformer and rapid follow up at higher radio frequencies and other
wavelengths. Normally, such accurate positions can only be obtained from a
long-term pulsar timing program. The multi-pixel beamformer technique can also
be used for highly sensitive targeted pulsar searches in extended supernova
remnants. In addition this method can provide optimal performance for the large
scale pulsar surveys using multi-element arrays.
