We examine how metallicity affects convection and overshoot in the
superadiabatic layer of main sequence stars. We present results from a grid of
3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations with four metallicities ($Z=0.040$,
0.020, 0.010, 0.001), and spanning a range in effective temperature ($4950 <
\rm T_{\rm eff} < 6230$). We show that changing the metallicity alters
properties of the convective gas dynamics, and the structure of the
superadiabatic layer and atmosphere. Our grid of simulations show that the
amount of superadiabaticity, which tracks the transition from efficient to
inefficient convection, \rev{is sensitive to changes in metallicity. We find
that increasing the metallicity forces the location of the transition region to
lower densities and pressures, and results in larger mean and turbulent
velocities throughout the superadiabatic region.} We also quantify the degree
of convective overshoot in the atmosphere, and show that it increases with
metallicity as well.
