The problem addressed in this paper is to control a plant so as to have its
output tracking (a family of) reference commands generated at a remote location
and transmitted through a communication channel of finite capacity. The
uncertainty due to the presence of the communication channel is counteracted by
a suitable choice of the parameters of the regulator.
