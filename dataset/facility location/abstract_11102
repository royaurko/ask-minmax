For estimating a lower bounded location or mean parameter for a symmetric and
logconcave density, we investigate the frequentist performance of the
$100(1-\alpha)%$ Bayesian HPD credible set associated with priors which are
truncations of flat priors onto the restricted parameter space. Various new
properties are obtained. Namely, we identify precisely where the minimum
coverage is obtained and we show that this minimum coverage is bounded between
$1-\frac{3\alpha}{2}$ and $1-\frac{3\alpha}{2}+\frac{\alpha^2}{1+\alpha}$; with
the lower bound $1-\frac{3\alpha}{2}$ improving (for $\alpha \leq 1/3$) on the
previously established ([9]; [8]) lower bound $\frac{1-\alpha}{1+\alpha}$.
Several illustrative examples are given.
