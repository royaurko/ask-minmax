To resolve the discrepancies of the superconducting order parameter in
quasi-two-dimensional NbSe_2, comprehensive specific-heat measurements have
been carried out. By analyzing both the zero-field and mixed-state data with
magnetic fields perpendicular to and parallel to the c axis of the crystal and
using the two-gap model, we conclude that (1) more than one energy scale of the
order parameter is required for superconducting NbSe_2 due to the thermodynamic
consistency; (2)delta_L=1.26 meV and delta_S=0.73 meV are obtained; (3)
N_S(0)/N(0)=11%~20%; (4) The observation of the kink in gamma(H) curve suggests
that the two-gap scenario is more favorable than the anisotropic s-wave model
to describe the gap structure of NbSe_2; and (5)delta_S is more isotropic and
has a three-dimensional-like feature and is located either on the Se or the
bonding Nb Fermi sheets.
