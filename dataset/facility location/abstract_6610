We calculate the current phase relation of a planar Josephson junction with a
ferromagnetic weak link located on top of a thin normal metal film. Following
experimental observations we assume transparent superconductor-ferromagnet
interfaces. This provides the best interlayer coupling and a low suppression of
the superconducting correlations penetrating from the superconducting
electrodes into the ferromagnetic layer. We show that this Josephson junction
is a promising candidate for an experimental {\phi} junction realization.
