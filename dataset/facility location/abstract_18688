We report the discovery of Cl 2334+48, a rich cluster of galaxies in the Zone
of Avoidance, identified in public images from the XMM-Newton archive. We
present the main properties of this cluster using the XMM-Newton X-ray data,
along with new optical spectroscopic and photometric observations. Cl 2334+48
is located at z = 0.271 +/- 0.001, as derived from the optical spectrum of the
brightest member galaxy. Such redshift agrees with a determination from the
X-ray spectrum (z = 0.263 (+0.012/-0.010)), in which an intense emission line
is matched to the rest wavelength of the Fe Kalpha complex. Its intracluster
medium has a plasma temperature of 4.92 (+0.50/-0.48) keV, sub-solar abundance
(0.38 +/- 0.12 Zsun), and a bolometric luminosity of 3.2 x 10^44 erg/s. A
density contrast delta = 2500 is obtained in a radius of 0.5 Mpc/h70, and the
corresponding enclosed mass is 1.5 x 10^14 Msun. Optical images show an
enhancement of g'-i' > 2.5 galaxies around the central galaxy, as expected if
these were cluster members. The central object is a luminous E-type galaxy,
which is displaced ~ 40 kpc/h70 from the cluster X-ray center. In addition, it
has a neighbouring arc-like feature (~ 22" or 90 kpc/h70 from it), probably due
to strong gravitational lensing. The discovery of Cl 2334+48 emphasises the
remarkable capability of the XMM-Newton to reveal new clusters of galaxies in
the Zone of Avoidance.
