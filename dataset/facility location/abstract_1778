The FRS-ESR facilities at GSI provide unique conditions for precision
measurements with stored exotic nuclei over a large range in the chart of
nuclides. In the present experiment the exotic nuclei were produced via
fragmentation of $^{152}$Sm projectiles in a thick beryllium target at 500-600
MeV/u, separated in-flight with the fragment separator FRS, and injected into
the storage-cooler ring ESR. Mass and lifetime measurements have been performed
with bare and few-electron ions. The experiment and first results will be
presented in this contribution.
