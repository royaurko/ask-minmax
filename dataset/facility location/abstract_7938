The MINERvA collaboration operated a scaled-down replica of the solid
scintillator tracking and sampling calorimeter regions of the MINERvA detector
in a hadron test beam at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. This article reports
measurements with samples of protons, pions, and electrons from 0.35 to 2.0
GeV/c momentum. The calorimetric response to protons, pions, and electrons are
obtained from these data. A measurement of the parameter in Birks' law and an
estimate of the tracking efficiency are extracted from the proton sample.
Overall the data are well described by a Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulation of
the detector and particle interactions with agreements better than 4%, though
some features of the data are not precisely modeled. These measurements are
used to tune the MINERvA detector simulation and evaluate systematic
uncertainties in support of the MINERvA neutrino cross section measurement
program.
