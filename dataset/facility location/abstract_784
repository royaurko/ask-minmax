We evaluate the matrix elements for the radiative kaon decays $K^+ \to
l^+\nu_l\gamma$, $l^+ \nu_l l'^+ l'^-$ and $K \to \pi l \nu_l\gamma$ \ ($l,\ l'
= e,\mu$) to next-to-leading order in chiral perturbation theory. We calculate
total rates and rates with several kinematical cuts and confront the results
with existing data. Measurements at future kaon facilities will allow for a
more detailed comparison between theory and experiment.
