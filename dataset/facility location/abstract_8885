We consider an explosion at the center of a halo which forms at the
intersection of filaments inside a cosmological pancake, a convenient test-bed
model for galaxy formation. ASPH/P3M simulations reveal that such explosions
are anisotropic. The energy and metals are channeled into the low density
regions, away from the pancake. The pancake remains essentially undisturbed,
even if the explosion is strong enough to blow away all the gas located inside
the halo and reheat the IGM surrounding the pancake. Infall quickly replenishes
this ejected gas and gradually restores the gas fraction as the halo continues
to grow. Estimates of the collapse epoch and SN energy-release for galaxies of
different mass in the CDM model can relate these results to scale-dependent
questions of blow-out and blow-away and their implication for early IGM heating
and metal enrichment and the creation of gas-poor dwarf galaxies.
