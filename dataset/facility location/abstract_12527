The ever increasing demands for using resource-constrained mobile devices for
running more resource intensive applications nowadays has initiated the
development of cyber foraging solutions that offload parts or whole
computational intensive tasks to more powerful surrogate stationary computers
and run them on behalf of mobile devices as required. The choice of proper mix
of mobile devices and surrogates has remained an unresolved challenge though.
In this paper, we propose a new decision-making mechanism for cyber foraging
systems to select the best locations to run an application, based on context
metrics such as the specifications of surrogates, the specifications of mobile
devices, application specification, and communication network specification.
Experimental results show faster response time and lower energy consumption of
benched applications compared to when applications run wholly on mobile devices
and when applications are offloaded to surrogates blindly for execution.
