The linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation does not predict that macroscopic bodies
should be located at one place only. Quantum mechanics textbooks generally
solve the problem by introducing the projection postulate, which forces
definite values to emerge during position measurements; many other
interpretations have also been proposed.\ Here, in the same spirit as the GRW
and CSL theories, we modify the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in a way that
efficiently cancels macroscopic density fluctuations in space.\ Instead of
introducing the stochastic dynamics of GRW or CSL, we assume a deterministic
dynamics that includes an attraction term towards the density in space of the
de Broglie-Bohm position of particles. This automatically ensures macroscopic
uniqueness, so that the state vector can be considered as a direct
representation of physical reality.
