We report on a search for faint (R total magnitude fainter than 21) and low
surface brightness galaxies (R central surface brightness fainter than ~24)
(fLSBs) in a 0.72x0.82 deg2 area centered on the Coma cluster. We analyzed deep
B and R band CCD imaging obtained using the CFH12K camera at CFHT and found 735
fLSBs. The total B magnitudes, at the Coma cluster redshift, range from -13 to
-9 with B central surface brightness as faint as 27 mag/arcsec2. Using empty
field comparisons, we show that most of these fLSBs are probably inside the
Coma cluster. We present the results of comparing the projected fLSB
distributions with the distributions of normal galaxies and with known X-ray
over densities. We also investigate their projected distribution relative to
their location in the color magnitude relation. Colors of fLSBs vary between
B-R~0.8 and ~1.4 for 2/3 of the sample and this part is consistent with the
known CMR red-sequence for bright (R<18) ellipticals in Coma. These fLSBs are
likely to have followed the same evolution as giant ellipticals, which is
consistent with a simple feedback/collapse formation and a passive evolution.
These fLSBs are mainly clustered around NGC4889. We found two other distinct
fLSB populations. These populations have respectively redder and bluer colors
compared to the giant elliptical red-sequence and possibly formed from stripped
faint ellipticals and material stripped from spiral in-falling galaxies.
