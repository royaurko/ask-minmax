We demonstrate that an exotically chiral f-wave topological superfluid can be
induced in coldfermionic-atom triangular optical lattices through the
laser-field-generated effective non-Abelian gauge field, controllable Zeeman
fields and s-wave Feshbach resonance. We find that the chiral f-wave
topological superfluid is characterized by three gapless Majorana edge states
located on the boundary of the system. More interestingly, these Majorana edge
states degenerate into one Majorana fermion bound to each vortex in the
superfluid. Our proposal enlarges topological superfluid family and specifies a
unique experimentally controllable system to study the Majorana fermion
physics.
