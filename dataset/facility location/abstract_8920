We present results from stacking analyses, using the 1 Ms Chandra Deep Field
North data, that constrain the X-ray emission of Lyman break galaxies at z =
2-4. Stacking the counts from 24 individually undetected Lyman break galaxies
located within the Hubble Deep Field North, we have obtained average detections
of these objects in the resulting 0.5-8.0 keV and 0.5-2.0 keV images; these
images have effective exposure times of 22.4 Ms (260 days). Monte Carlo testing
empirically shows the detections to be highly significant. The average
rest-frame 2-8 keV luminosity of a Lyman break galaxy is derived to be 3.2 x
10^{41} erg s^{-1}, comparable to that of the most X-ray luminous starbursts in
the local Universe. The observed ratio of X-ray to B-band luminosity is
somewhat, but not greatly, higher than that seen from local starbursts. The
X-ray emission probably arises from a combination of high-mass X-ray binaries,
"super-Eddington" X-ray sources, and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.
