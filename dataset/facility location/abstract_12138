We construct dynamics of two-dimensional Young diagrams, which are naturally
associated with their grandcanonical ensembles, by allowing the creation and
annihilation of unit squares located at the boundary of the diagrams. The
grandcanonical ensembles, which were introduced by Vershik, are uniform
measures under conditioning on their size (or equivalently, area). We then show
that, as the averaged size of the diagrams diverges, the corresponding height
variable converges to a solution of a certain non-linear partial differential
equation under a proper hydrodynamic scaling. Furthermore, the stationary
solution of the limit equation is identified with the so-called Vershik curve.
We discuss both uniform and restricted uniform statistics for the Young
diagrams.
