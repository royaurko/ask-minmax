The contributor suggests a cheap closed AB-Dome which protects the densely
populated cities from nuclear, chemical, biological weapon (bombs) delivered by
warheads, strategic missiles, rockets, and various incarnations of aviation
technology. The offered AB-Dome is also very useful in peacetime because it
shields a city from exterior weather and creates a fine climate within the
AB-Dome. The hemispherical AB-Dome is the inflatable, thin transparent film,
located at altitude up to as much as 15 km, which converts the city into a
closed-loop system. The film may be armored the stones which destroy the
rockets and nuclear warhead. AB-Dome protects the city in case the World
nuclear war and total poisoning the Earth atmosphere by radioactive fallout
(gases and dust). Construction of the AB-Dome is easy; the enclosure film is
spread upon the ground, the air pump is turned on, and the cover rises to its
planned altitude and supported by a small air over-pressure. The offered method
is cheaper by thousand times than protection of city by current anti-rocket
systems. The AB-Dome may be also used (height up to 15 and more kilometers) for
TV, communication, telescope, long distance location, tourism, high placed
windmills (energy), illumination and entertainments. The contributor developed
theory of AB-Dome, made estimation, computation and computed a typical project.
Discussion and results are in the end of article.
