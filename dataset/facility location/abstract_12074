A position coding pattern is an array of symbols in which subarrays of a
certain fixed size appear at most once. So, each subarray uniquely identifies a
location in the larger array, which means there is a bijection of some sort
from this set of subarrays to a set of coordinates. The key to Fly Pentop
Computer paper and other examples of position codes is a method to read the
subarray and then convert it to coordinates. Position coding makes use of ideas
from discrete mathematics and number theory. In this paper, we will describe
the underlying mathematics of two position codes, one being the Anoto code that
is the basis of "Fly paper". Then, we will present two new codes, one which
uses binary wavelets as part of the bijection.
