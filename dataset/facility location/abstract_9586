We examine how the location of star formation within disc galaxies depends on
environment at intermediate redshift. This is achieved by comparing
emission-line (r_em) and restframe B-band (r_B) scalelengths for matched
samples of 50 field and 19 cluster star-forming, disc galaxies, with 0.25 < z <
1.0 and M_B < -19.5 mag. We find that at a given r_B the majority of our
cluster galaxies have r_em smaller than those in the field, by 25 percent on
average. These results are compared with studies of local galaxies, which find
a very similar behaviour. From the relations of r_em and r_B versus B-band
absolute magnitude (M_B) we infer that the difference between the
intermediate-z cluster and field samples is mostly attributable to variation in
r_em at a given M_B, while the r_B versus M_B relation is similar for the two
samples.
