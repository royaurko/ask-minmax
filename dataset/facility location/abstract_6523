The objective of this article is to provide for the reader a basic
description of all the steps involved in the COM object life-cycle process. COM
is a software technology and process performer. The first section briefly
introduces the Component Object Model (COM), considering the process of the COM
object life cycle as the baseline of all COM issues. The second part describes
in detail the basic steps of the process - client request, server location,
object creation, interaction, and disconnection. A brief description is given
for the components involved in each step. Finally, the third section provides a
brief conclusion summarizing all the process steps.
