We have studied the dissociation of quarkonia states in a deconfined medium
of quarks and gluons at the large baryon chemical potential and small
temperature region. The aim of this study is to probe the dense baryonic medium
expected to be produced at the Facility for Anti-proton and Ion Research(FAIR),
GSI Darmstadt. This is done by correcting both the short- and long-distance
terms of the Cornell potential by a dielectric function, embodying the effects
of deconfined quarks and gluons, at finite baryon chemical potential and
temperature. It is found that $J/\psi$ is dissociated approximately at
1.4$\mu_c$ in the temperature range 20-50 $MeV$, which can indirectly help to
locate the point on the QCD phase diagram at the large chemical potential and
low-temperature zone.
