The T2K experiment is a second generation long baseline neutrino oscillation
experiment designed as a sensitive search for nu_e appearance. The T2K near
neutrino detector complex is located 280 meters from the pion production target
and will measure both neutrino beam properties close to the production point
and interaction cross sections. The main design features, test results and
status of these detectors are presented.
