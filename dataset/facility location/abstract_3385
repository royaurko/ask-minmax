Considering the prospects of using the W-Na target assemblies in ADS
facilities, the experiments were made to study the nuclear-physics
characteristics of W and Na, and the composite structures thereof in their
interactions with 0.8-GeV and 1.6-GeV protons. The neutron and proton-induced
reaction rates were measured inside, and on the surface of, a cylinder-shaped
heterogeneous W-Na assembly together with the double-differential spectra of
secondary neutrons emitted from different-depth W and Na discs. The measurement
results were simulated by the LAHET, CEM2k, and KASKAD-S codes in terms of the
latest versions of nuclear databases.
