The Aladin interactive sky atlas, developed at CDS, is a service providing
simultaneous access to digitized images of the sky, astronomical catalogues,
and databases.
  The driving motivation is to facilitate direct, visual comparison of
observational data at any wavelength with images of the optical sky, and with
reference catalogues.
  The set of available sky images consists of the STScI Digitized Sky Surveys,
completed with high resolution images of crowded regions scanned at the MAMA
facility in Paris.
  A Java WWW interface to the system is available at:
