Photometric data from the ASAS - South (declination less than 29 deg) survey
have been used for identification of bright stars located near the sources from
the ROSAT All Sky Survey Bright Source Catalog (RBSC). In total 6028 stars
brighter than 12.5 mag in I- or V -bands have been selected and analyzed for
periodicity. Altogether 2302 variable stars have been found with periods
ranging from 0.137 d to 193 d. Most of these stars have X-ray emission of
coronal origin with a few cataclysmic binaries and early type stars with
colliding winds. Whenever it was possible we collected data available in the
literature to verify periods and to classify variable objects.
  The catalog includes 1936 stars (1233 new) considered to be variable due to
presence of spots (rotationally variable), 127 detached eclipsing binary stars
(33 new), 124 contact binaries (11 new), 96 eclipsing stars with deformed
components (19 new), 13 ellipsoidal variables (4 new), 5 miscellaneous
variables and one pulsating RR Lyr type star (blended with an eclipsing
binary). More than 70% of new variable stars have amplitudes smaller than 0.1
mag, but for ASAS 063656-0521.0 we have found the largest known amplitude of
brightness variations due to the presence of spots (up to Delta V=0.8 mag). The
table with the compiled data and figures with light curves can be downloaded
from the Acta Astronomica Archive.
