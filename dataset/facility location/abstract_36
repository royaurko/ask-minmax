In this paper we consider a Beta Beam setup that tries to leverage at most
existing European facilities: i.e. a setup that takes advantage of facilities
at CERN to boost high-Q ions (8Li and 8B) aiming at a far detector located at L
= 732 Km in the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory. The average neutrino energy
for 8Li and 8B ions boosted at \gamma ~ 100 is in the range E_\nu = [1,2] GeV,
high enough to use a large iron detector of the MINOS type at the far site. We
perform, then, a study of the neutrino and antineutrino fluxes needed to
measure a CP-violating phase delta in a significant part of the parameter
space. In particular, for theta_13 > 3 deg, if an antineutrino flux of 3 10^19
useful 8Li decays per year is achievable, we find that delta can be measured in
60% of the parameter space with 6 10^18 useful 8B decays per year.
