We present the combined results of two investigations: a large-scale study of
the globular cluster system (GCS) around NGC 1399, the central galaxy of the
Fornax cluster, and a study of the GCSs around NGC 1374, NGC 1379 and NGC 1387,
three low-luminosity early-type galaxies located close to the centre of the
same cluster. In both cases, the data consist of images from the wide-field
MOSAIC Imager of the CTIO 4-m telescope, obtained with Washington C and
Kron-Cousins R filters, which provide good metallicity resolution. The colour
distributions and radial projected densities of the GCSs are analyzed. We focus
on the properties of the GCSs that trace possible interaction processes between
the galaxies, such as tidal stripping of globular clusters. For the blue
globular clusters, we find tails between NGC 1399 and neighbouring galaxies in
the azimuthal projected distribution, and the three low-luminosity galaxies
show low specific frequencies and a low proportion of blue GCs.
