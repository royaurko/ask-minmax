We present two catalogues of galaxies in the direction of the rich cluster
\a85. The first one includes 4,232 galaxies located in a region $\pm 1^\circ$
from the cluster centre. It has been obtained from a list of more than 25,000
galaxy candidates detected by scanning a Schmidt photographic plate taken in
the \bj band. Positions are very accurate in this catalogue but magnitudes are
not. This led us to perform CCD imaging observations in the V and R bands to
calibrate these photographic magnitudes. A second catalogue (805 galaxies)
gives a list of galaxies with CCD magnitudes in the V and R bands for a much
smaller region in the centre of the cluster. These two catalogues will be
combined with a redshift catalogue of 509 galaxies (Durret et al. 1997;
astro-ph/9709298) to investigate the cluster properties at optical wavelengths
(Durret et al. in preparation), as a complement to our previous X-ray studies
(Pislar et al. 1997, Lima-Neto et al. 1997).
