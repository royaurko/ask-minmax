Three fields located close to the center of the globular cluster Omega Cen
were surveyed in a search for variable stars. We present V-band light curves
for 32 periodic variables. This sample includes 10 SX Phe stars, 19 eclipsing
binaries, and three likely spotted variables (FK Com or RS CVn type stars).
Only 4 of these variables were previously known (including two objects reported
in Paper I). All SX Phe stars and 8 eclipsing binaries from our sample belong
to blue stragglers. Five binaries occupy positions on the upper main-sequence
of the cluster and another four are located at the base of the subgiant branch.
Of particular interest is detection of a detached binary system with a period
P=4.64 day. Further study of this star can provide direct information about
properties of turnoff stars in Omega Cen. A detached or semi-detached system
located slightly above the horizontal branch of Omega Cen was also discovered.
All SX Phe stars and most of eclipsing binaries discovered in our survey are
likely cluster members. We present V vs. V-I color-magnitude diagrams for the
monitored fields. A populous group of likely hot subdwarfs as well as numerous
candidates for blue stragglers can be noted in these diagrams. Our data
indicate that Omega Cen possesses the largest number of blue stragglers among
all galactic globulars.
