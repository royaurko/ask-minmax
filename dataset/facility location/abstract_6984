We investigate both free energy and complexity of the spherical bipartite
spin glass model. We first prove a variational formula in high temperature for
the limiting free energy based on the well-known Crisanti-Sommers
representation of the mixed p-spin spherical model. Next, we show that the mean
number of local minima at low levels of energy is exponentially large in the
size of the system and we derive a bound on the location of the ground state
energy.
