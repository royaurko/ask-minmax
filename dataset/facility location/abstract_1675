Charm and bottom production near threshold is sensitive to the multi-quark,
gluonic, and hidden-color correlations of hadronic and nuclear wavefunctions in
QCD since all of the target's constituents must act coherently within the small
interaction volume of the heavy quark production subprocess. Although such
multi-parton subprocess cross sections are suppressed by powers of $1/m^2_Q$,
they have less phase-space suppression and can dominate the contributions of
the leading-twist single-gluon subprocesses in the threshold regime. The small
rates for open and hidden charm photoproduction at threshold call for a
dedicated facility.
