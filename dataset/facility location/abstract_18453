We study high-resolution spectra of the `overlapping-trough' low-ionization
broad absorption line (LoBAL) quasar SDSS J030000.56+004828.0. The CaII, MgII
and MgI column densities in this object are the largest reported to date for
any BAL outflow. The broad CaII absorption is mildly blended, but the blending
can be disentangled to measure the CaII column density, which is large enough
that the outflow must include a strong hydrogen ionization front. The outflow
begins at a blueshift of ~1650 km/s from the systemic redshift. The lowest
velocity BAL region produces strong CaII absorption but does not produce
significant excited FeII absorption, while the higher velocity excited FeII
absorption region produces very little CaII absorption. We have found that only
a disk wind outflow can explain this segregation. Whether the outflow is smooth
or clumpy, we conclude that the CaII BAL region has a density high enough to
populate excited levels of FeII, but a temperature low enough to prevent them
from being significantly populated. This requirement means the CaII BAL region
has T<1000 K, and perhaps even T<550 K. This quasar also has an associated
absorption line system (AAL) that exhibits partial covering, and therefore is
likely located near the central engine. Its association with the BAL outflow is
unclear. Blending of the AAL with the BAL trough shows that the spatial region
covered by the BAL outflow can vary over velocity differences of ~1700 km/s.
