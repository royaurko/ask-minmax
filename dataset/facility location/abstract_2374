We review current experimental results on charm mixing and CP violation. We
survey experimental techniques, including time-dependent, time-independent, and
quantum-correlated measurements. We review techniques that use a slow pion tag
from D*+ --> pi+ D0 + c.c. decays and those that do not, and cover two-body and
multi-body D0 decay modes. We provide a summary of D-mixing results to date and
comment on future experimental prospects at the LHC and other new or planned
facilities.
