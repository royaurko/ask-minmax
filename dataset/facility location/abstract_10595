We analyze the resonant linear and nonlinear transmission through a photonic
crystal waveguide side-coupled to a Kerr-nonlinear photonic crystal resonator.
Firstly, we extend the standard coupled-mode theory analysis to photonic
crystal structures and obtain explicit analytical expressions for the
bistability thresholds and transmission coefficients which provide the basis
for a detailed understanding of the possibilities associated with these
structures. Next, we discuss limitations of standard coupled-mode theory and
present an alternative analytical approach based on the effective discrete
equations derived using a Green's function method. We find that the discrete
nature of the photonic crystal waveguides allows a novel, geometry-driven
enhancement of nonlinear effects by shifting the resonator location relative to
the waveguide, thus providing an additional control of resonant waveguide
transmission and Fano resonances. We further demonstrate that this enhancement
may result in the lowering of the bistability threshold and switching power of
nonlinear devices by several orders of magnitude. Finally, we show that
employing such enhancements is of paramount importance for the design of
all-optical devices based on slow-light photonic crystal waveguides.
