I discuss the stability of accretion disks when the black hole is considered
to be rotating. I show, how the fluid properties get changed for different
choices of angular momentum of black holes. I treat the problem in
pseudo-Newtonian approach with a suitable potential from Kerr geometry. When
the angular momentum of a black hole is considered to be significant, the valid
disk parameter region affects and a disk may become unstable. Also the
possibility of shock in an accretion disk around rotating black holes is
checked. When the black hole is chosen to be rotating, the sonic locations of
the accretion disk get shifted or disappear, making the disk unstable by means
of loosing entropy. To bring the disk in a stable situation, the angular
momentum of the accreting matter has to be reduced/enhanced (for
co/counter-rotating disk) by means of some physical process.
