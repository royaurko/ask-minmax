In this work, we present a new 3D face recognition method based on Speeded-Up
Local Descriptor (SULD) of significant points extracted from the range images
of faces. The proposed model consists of a method for extracting distinctive
invariant features from range images of faces that can be used to perform
reliable matching between different poses of range images of faces. For a given
3D face scan, range images are computed and the potential interest points are
identified by searching at all scales. Based on the stability of the interest
point, significant points are extracted. For each significant point we compute
the SULD descriptor which consists of vector made of values from the convolved
Haar wavelet responses located on concentric circles centred on the significant
point, and where the amount of Gaussian smoothing is proportional to the radii
of the circles. Experimental results show that the newly proposed method
provides higher recognition rate compared to other existing contemporary models
developed for 3D face recognition.
