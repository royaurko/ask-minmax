In this paper we study a class of Jacobi operators, such that each operator
is generated by the unit Borel measure with a support consisting of a finite
number of intervals on the real line R and a finite number of points in C,
located outside the convex hull of the intervals and symmetrically with respect
to R. In such a class of operators we have obtained the asymptotic behavior of
the diagonal Green's function and trace formulas for sequences of coefficients
corresponding to a given operator. Bibliography: 34 titles.
