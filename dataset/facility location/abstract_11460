Integrated-optic, astronomical, two-beam and three-beam, interferometric
combiners have been designed and fabricated for operation in the L band (3 - 4
microns) for the first time. The devices have been realized in
titanium-indiffused, x-cut lithium niobate substrates, and on-chip
electro-optic fringe scanning has been demonstrated. White light fringes were
produced in the laboratory using the two-beam combiner integrated with an
on-chip Y-splitter.
