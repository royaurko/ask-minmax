We show that non-Abelian lattice gauge fields can be simulated with a single
component ultra-cold atomic gas in an optical lattice potential. An optical
lattice can be viewed as a Bravais lattice with a $N$-point basis. An atom
located at different points of the basis can be considered as a {\it particle}
in different internal states. The appropriate engineering of tunneling
amplitudes of atoms in an optical lattice allows one to realize U$(N)$ gauge
potentials and control a mass of {\it particles} that experience such
non-Abelian gauge fields. We provide and analyze a concrete example of an
optical lattice configuration that allows for simulation of a static U(2) gauge
model with a constant Wilson loop and an adjustable mass of {\it particles}. In
particular, we observe that the non-zero mass creates large conductive gaps in
the energy spectrum, which could be important in the experimental detection of
the transverse Hall conductivity.
