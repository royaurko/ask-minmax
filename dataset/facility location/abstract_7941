We describe an algorithm for identifying point-source transients and moving
objects on reference-subtracted optical images containing artifacts of
processing and instrumentation. The algorithm makes use of the supervised
machine learning technique known as Random Forest. We present results from its
use in the Dark Energy Survey Supernova program (DES-SN), where it was trained
using a sample of 898,963 signal and background events generated by the
transient detection pipeline. After reprocessing the data collected during the
first DES-SN observing season (Sep. 2013 through Feb. 2014) using the
algorithm, the number of transient candidates eligible for human scanning
decreased by a factor of 13.4, while only 1 percent of the artificial Type Ia
supernovae (SNe) injected into search images to monitor survey efficiency were
lost, most of which were very faint events. Here we characterize the
algorithm's performance in detail, and we discuss how it can inform pipeline
design decisions for future time-domain imaging surveys, such as the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope and the Zwicky Transient Facility.
