Here we present an explicit counterexample to the widely spread beliefs about
an exclusive role of bimodality as the first order phase transition signal. On
the basis of an exactly solvable statistical model generalizing the statistical
multifragmentation model of nuclei we demonstrate that the bimodal nuclear
fragment size distributions can naturally appear in infinite system without a
phase transition. It appears at the supercritical temperatures due to the
negative values of the surface tension coefficient. The developed statistical
model corresponds to the compressible nuclear liquid with the tricritical
endpoint located at one third of the normal nuclear density.
