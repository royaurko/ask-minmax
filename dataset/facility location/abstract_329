A tandem Penning trap facility has been designed and is under construction at
the Texas A&M University Cyclotron Institute (TAMU-TRAP). The initial
experimental program will be the study of correlation parameters for T=2
superallowed beta-delayed proton emitters. The measurement trap is a unique
large-bore optimized 5-electrode cylindrical Penning trap, which features a 90
mm free radius, larger than in any existing Penning trap. This novel geometry
allows for full radial containment of decay products of interest. The trap has
also been designed to exhibit a "tunable" and "orthogonalized" geometry, which
is useful for alternate experiments.
