The recent uncovering of the \textit{Fermi} Bubbles/haze in the
\textit{Fermi} gamma-ray data has generated theoretical work to explain such a
signal of hard $\gamma$-rays in combination with the \textit{WMAP} haze signal.
Many of these theoretical models can have distinctively different implications
with regards to the production of high energy neutrinos. We discuss the
neutrino signals from different models proposed for the explanation of the
\textit{Fermi} Bubbles/haze, more explicitly, from Dark Matter annihilation in
the galactic halo with conditions of preferential CR diffusion, from recent AGN
jet activity, from periodic diffusive shock acceleration, from stochastic 2nd
order Fermi acceleration and from long time-scale star formation in the
galactic center in combination with strong galactic winds. We find that some of
these models will be probed by the IceCube DeepCore detector. Moreover, with a
km$^3$ telescope located at the north hemisphere, we will be able to
discriminate between the hadronic, leptonic and the DM models. Additionally
using the reconstructed neutrino spectra we will probe annihilation of TeV
scale dark matter towards the galactic center.
