We examine various properties of the continued fraction expansions of matrix
eigenvector slopes of matrices from the SL(2, Z) group. We calculate the
average period length, maximum period length, average period sum, maximum
period sum and the distributions of 1s 2s and 3s in the periods versus the
radius of the Ball within which the matrices are located. We also prove that
the periods of continued fraction expansions from the real irrational roots of
x2 + px + q = 0 are always palindromes.
