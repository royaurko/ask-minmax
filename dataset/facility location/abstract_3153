Since the 2011 VERITAS discovery of very high energy (VHE; E>100 GeV) gamma
rays from the Crab pulsar, there has been concerted effort by the gamma-ray
astrophysics community to detect other pulsars in the VHE band in order to
place better constraints on emission models. Pulsar modelling demonstrates that
much of the magnetosphere is opaque to VHE photons, limiting emission regions
to the outer magnetosphere or beyond the light cylinder. The locations of 19
known pulsars have been observed by VERITAS since full observations began in
2007 with 11 locations having more than 20 hours of observations. Observations
of VHE emission from more sources could provide key data to help constrain
current models of emission location and mechanisms. We present the status of
the ongoing VERITAS program searching for pulsed emission in archival data.
