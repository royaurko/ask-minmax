Analysis of spatially resolved ASCA spectra of the intracluster gas in Abell
496 confirms that metal abundances increase toward the center. We also find
spatial gradients in several abundance ratios, indicating that the fraction of
iron from SN Ia increases toward the cluster center. The dominant metal
enrichment mechanism near the cluster center must therefore be different than
in the outer parts. We show that ram pressure stripping of gas from cluster
galaxies cannot account for the central abundance enhancement. We suggest that
two successive stages of galactic winds contaminate intracluster gas:
protogalactic winds driven by SN II, followed by less energetic winds driven by
SN Ia, which have longer lived progenitors than SN II. The less energetic
secondary wind from a cD galaxy may be suppressed, due to its location at the
cluster center, leading to the observed central enhancement of SN Ia ejecta.
