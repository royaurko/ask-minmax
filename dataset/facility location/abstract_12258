By using analytical solution of a tight-binding model for armchair
nanoribbons, it is confirmed that the solution represents the standing wave
formed by intervalley scattering and that pseudospin is invariant under the
scattering. The phase space of armchair nanoribbon which includes a single
Dirac singularity is specified. By examining the effects of boundary
perturbations on the wave function, we suggest that the existance of a strong
boundary potential is inconsistent with the observation in a recent scanning
tunneling microscopy. Some of the possible electron-density superstructure
patterns near a step armchair edge located on top of graphite are presented. It
is demonstrated that a selection rule for the G band in Raman spectroscopy can
be most easily reproduced with the analytical solution.
