In this Letter we present the first images of the emission of SiO and H13CO+
in the nucleus of the starburst galaxy M82. Contrary to other molecular species
that mainly trace the distribution of the star-forming molecular gas within the
disk, the SiO emission extends noticeably out of the galaxy plane. The bulk of
the SiO emission is restricted to two major features. The first feature,
referred to as the SiO supershell, is an open shell of 150 pc diameter, located
120 pc west from the galaxy center.
  The SiO supershell represents the inner front of a molecular shell expanding
at 40 km/s, produced by mass ejection around a supercluster of young stars
containing supernova remnant SNR 41.95+57.5. The second feature is a vertical
filament, referred to as the SiO chimney, emanating from the disk at 200 pc
east from the galaxy center. The SiO chimney reaches a 500 pc vertical height,
and it is associated with the most prominent chimney identified in radio
continuum maps. The kinematics, morphology, and fractional abundances of the
SiO gas features in M82 can be explained in the framework of shocked chemistry
driven by local episodes of gas ejection from the starburst disk.
