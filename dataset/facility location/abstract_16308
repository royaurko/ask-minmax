we report the identification of a localised current structure inside the JET
plasma. It is a field aligned closed helical ribbon, carrying current in the
same direction as the background current profile (co-current), rotating
toroidally with the ion velocity (co-rotating). It appears to be located at a
flat spot in the plasma pressure profile, at the top of the pedestal. The
structure appears spontaneously in low density, high rotation plasmas, and can
last up to 1.4 s, a time comparable to a local resistive time. It considerably
delays the appearance of the first ELM.
