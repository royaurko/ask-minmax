The high-frequency cross-correlation existing between pairs of stocks traded
in a financial market are investigated in a set of 100 stocks traded in US
equity markets. A hierarchical organization of the investigated stocks is
obtained by determining a metric distance between stocks and by investigating
the properties of the subdominant ultrametric associated with it. A clear
modification of the hierarchical organization of the set of stocks investigated
is detected when the time horizon used to determine stock returns is changed.
The hierarchical location of stocks of the energy sector is investigated as a
function of the time horizon.
