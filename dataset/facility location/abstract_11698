In this paper, we have investigated the geodesics of neutral particles near a
five-dimensional charged black hole using a comparative approach. The effective
potential method is used to determine the location of the horizons and to study
radial and circular trajectories. This also helps us to analyze the stability
of radial and circular orbits. The radius of the innermost stable circular
orbits have also been determined. Contrary to the case of massive particles for
which, the circular orbits may have up to eight possible values of specific
radius, we find that the photons will only have two distinct values for the
specific radii of circular trajectories. Finally we have used the dynamical
systems analysis to determine the critical points and the nature of the
trajectories for the timelike and null geodesics.
