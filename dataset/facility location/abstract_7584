We investigate the distinct properties of two types of flares: eruptive
flares associated with CMEs and confined flares without CMEs. Our sample of
study includes nine M and X-class flares, all from the same active region (AR),
six of which are confined and three others are eruptive. The confined flares
tend to be more impulsive in the soft X-ray time profiles and show more slender
shapes in the EIT 195 A images, while the eruptive ones are of long-duration
events and show much more extended brightening regions. The location of the
confined flares are closer to the center of the AR, while the eruptive flares
are at the outskirts. This difference is quantified by the displacement
parameter, the distance between the AR center and the flare location: the
average displacement of the six confined flares is 16 Mm, while that of
eruptive ones is as large as 39 Mm. Further, through nonlinear force-free field
extrapolation, we find that the decay index of the transverse magnetic field in
the low corona (~10 Mm) have a larger value for eruptive flares than that for
confined one. In addition, the strength of the transverse magnetic field over
the eruptive flare sites is weaker than that over the confined ones. These
results demonstrate that the strength and the decay index of background
magnetic field may determine whether or not a flare be eruptive or confined.
The implication of these results on CME models is discussed in the context of
torus instability of flux rope.
