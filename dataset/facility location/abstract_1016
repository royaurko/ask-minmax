Partial wave analysis is a core tool in hadron spectroscopy. With the high
statistics data available at facilities such as the Beijing Spectrometer III,
this procedure becomes computationally very expensive. We have successfully
implemented a framework for performing partial wave analysis on graphics
processors. We discuss the implementation, the parallel computing frameworks
employed and the performance achieved, with a focus on the recent transition to
the OpenCL framework.
