The effect of local Coulomb interactions on the electronic properties of FeSe
is explored within dynamical mean field theory combined with finite-temperature
exact diagonalization. The low-energy scattering rate is shown to exhibit
non-Fermi-liquid behavior caused by the formation of local moments.
Fermi-liquid properties are restored at large electron doping. In contrast,
FeAsLaO is shown to be located on the Fermi-liquid side of this spin freezing
transition.
