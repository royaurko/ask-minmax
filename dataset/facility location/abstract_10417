Let W be a finite Coxeter group acting linearly on $R^n$. In this article we
study support properties of W-invariant partial differential operator D on
$\R^n$ with real analytic coefficients. Our assumption is that the principal
symbol of D has a special form, related to the root system corresponding to W.
In particular the zeros of the principal symbol are supposed to be located on
hyperplanes fixed by reflections in W. We show that conv(supp Df) = conv(supp
f) holds for all compactly supported smooth functions f so that conv(supp f) is
W-invariant. The main tools in the proof are Holmgren's uniqueness theorem and
some elementary convex geometry. Several examples and applications linked to
the theory of special functions associated with root systems are presented.
