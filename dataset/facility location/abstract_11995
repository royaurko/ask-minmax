The recently discovered circumbinary planets (Kepler-16 b, Kepler-34 b,
Kepler-35 b) represent the first direct evidence of the viability of planet
formation in circumbinary orbits. We report on the results of N-body
simulations investigating planetesimal accretion in the Kepler-16 b system,
focusing on the range of impact velocities under the influence of both stars'
gravitational perturbation and friction from a putative protoplanetary disk.
Our results show that planet formation might be effectively inhibited for a
large range in semi-major axis (1.75 < a_P < 4 AU), suggesting that the
planetary core must have either migrated from outside 4 AU, or formed in situ
very close to its current location.
