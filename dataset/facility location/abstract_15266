The site survey for the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope concluded
recently after more than two years of data gathering and analysis. Six
locations, including lake, island and continental sites, were thoroughly probed
for image quality and sky brightness. The present paper describes the analysis
methodology employed to determine the height stratification of the atmospheric
turbulence. This information is crucial because day-time seeing is often very
different between the actual telescope aperture (~30 m) and the ground. Two
independent inversion codes have been developed to analyze simultaneously data
from a scintillometer array and a solar differential image monitor. We show
here the results of applying them to a sample subset of data from May 2003,
which was used for testing. Both codes retrieve a similar seeing stratification
through the height range of interest. A quantitative comparison between our
analysis procedure and actual in situ measurements confirms the validity of the
inversions. The sample data presented in this paper reveal a qualitatively
different behavior for the lake sites (dominated by high-altitude seeing) and
the rest (dominated by near-ground turbulence).
