We present the instrumentation, the target selection method, the data
analysis pipeline and the preliminary results of the Thessaloniki Research for
Transits project (ThReT). ThReT is a new project aiming to discover Hot Jupiter
Planets, orbiting Sun-like stars. In order to locate the promising spots for
observations on the celestial sphere, we produced a sky-map of the Transit
Detection Probability by employing data from the Tycho Catalog and applying
several astrophysical and empirical relationships. For the data reduction we
used the ThReT pipeline, developed by our team for this specific purpose.
