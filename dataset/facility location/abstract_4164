Generalizing a result for the binary lens, similar alternative expressions
are also given for the Jacobian determinant for a gravitational lens consisting
of an arbitrary number of discrete lensing centres, with arbitrary masses and
locations in a plane. The results for a binary lens are recovered, agreeing
with some already known results, and correcting errors in others.
