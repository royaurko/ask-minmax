A seismic time reversal experiment based on Time Reversal Mirror (TRM)
technique was conducted in the mesoscopically scaled medium at the LSBB
Laboratory, France. Two sets of 50 Hz geophones were distributed at one meter
intervals in two horizontal and parallel galleries 100 m apart, buried 250 m
below the surface. The shot source used was a 4 kg sledgehammer. Analysis shows
that elastic seismic energy is refocused in space and time to the shot
locations with good accuracy. The refocusing ability of seismic energy to the
shot locations is roughly achieved for the direct field, and with excellent
quality, for the early and later coda. Hyper-focussing is achieved at the shot
points as a consequence of the fine scale randomly heterogeneous medium between
the galleries. TRM experiment is sensitive to the roughness of the mirror used.
Roughness induces a slight experimental discrepancy between recording and
re-emitting directions degrading the quality of the reversal process.
