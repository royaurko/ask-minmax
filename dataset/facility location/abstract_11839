We study experimentally and numerically the existence and stability
properties of discrete breathers in a periodic nonlinear electric line. The
electric line is composed of single cell nodes, containing a varactor diode and
an inductor, coupled together in a periodic ring configuration through
inductors and driven uniformly by a harmonic external voltage source. A simple
model for each cell is proposed by using a nonlinear form for the varactor
characteristics through the current and capacitance dependence on the voltage.
For an electrical line composed of 32 elements, we find the regions, in driver
voltage and frequency, where $n$-peaked breather solutions exist and
characterize their stability. The results are compared to experimental
measurements with good quantitative agreement. We also examine the spontaneous
formation of $n$-peaked breathers through modulational instability of the
homogeneous steady state. The competition between different discrete breathers
seeded by the modulational instability eventually leads to stationary
$n$-peaked solutions whose precise locations is seen to sensitively depend on
the initial conditions.
