We report the discovery of optical filamentary and diffuse emission from
G182.4+4.3 using 1.5-m Russian-Turkish telescope. We present the optical CCD
images obtained with Halpha filter revealing the presence of mainly filamentary
structure at the northwest, filamentary and diffuse structure at the centre,
south and north regions of the remnant. The bright optical filaments located in
northwest and south regions are well correlated with the prominent radio shell
of the remnant strongly suggesting their association. From the flux-calibrated
CCD imaging, the average [SII]/Halpha ratio is found to be ~0.9 and ~1.1 for
south and northwest regions, which clearly indicates that the emission
originates from the shock heated gas. We also present the results of X-ray data
obtained from XMM-Newton that show diffuse emission with a very low luminosity
of ~7.3x10^31 erg s^-1 at a distance of 3 kpc in 0.3-10 keV energy band.
Furthermore, we find a surprisingly young age of ~4400 yr for this remnant with
such a large radius of ~22 pc.
