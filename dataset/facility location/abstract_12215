We address the issue why the number and the location of magnetic monopoles
detected on lattice configurations are gauge dependent, in contrast with the
physical expectation that monopoles have a gauge invariant status. By use of
the Non-Abelian Bianchi Identities we show that monopoles are gauge invariant,
but the efficiency of the technique usually adopted to detect them depends on
the choice of the gauge in a well understood way. In particular we have studied
a class of gauges which interpolates between the Maximal Abelian gauge, where
all monopoles are observed, and the Landau gauge, where all monopoles escape
detection.
