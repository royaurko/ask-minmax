We report on preliminary results from our XMM-Newton observation of the Low
Mass X-ray Binary 4U 1850-087, located in the galactic globular cluster NGC
6712. It is an ultracompact binary system, with an orbital period of 20.6 min.
In previous low-resolution X-ray observations 4U 1850-087 displayed a soft
excess residual around 0.7 keV, possibly indicative of the presence of a high
Ne/O ratio. We discuss here our preliminary analysis of high resolution X-ray
spectra of 4U1850-087, and timing results.
