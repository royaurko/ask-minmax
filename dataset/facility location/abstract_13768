We study the crystal reconstruction in the presence of monovacancies (MVs),
divacancies (DVs) and linear vacancies (LVs) in a zigzag silicene nanoribbon
(ZSiNR) with transversal symmetry. Their influence on the electric and
thermoelectric properties is assessed by the density functional theory combined
with the nonequilibrium Green's functions. In particular, we focus on the spin
resolved conductance, magnetoresistance and current-voltage curves. A
5-atom-ring is formed in MVs, a 5-8-5 ring structure in DVs, and a 8-4-8-4 ring
structure in LVs. The linear conductance becomes strongly spin dependent when
the transversal symmetry is broken by vacancies especially if they are located
on the ribbon's edges. The giant magnetoresistance can be smeared by asymmetric
vacancies. Single spin negative differential resistance may appear in the
presence of LVs and asymmetric MVs or DVs. A strong spin Seebeck effect is
expected at room temperature in ZSiNRs with LVs.
