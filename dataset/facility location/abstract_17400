We wish to investigate the effects of cooling of the Compton cloud on the
outflow formation rate in an accretion disk around a black hole. We carry out a
time dependent numerical simulation where both the hydrodynamics and the
radiative transfer processes are coupled together. We consider a two-component
accretion flow in which the Keplerian disk is immersed into an accreting
low-angular momentum flow (halo) around a black hole. The soft photons which
originate from the Keplerian disk are inverse-Comptonized by the electrons in
the halo and the region between the centrifugal pressure supported shocks and
the horizon. We run several cases by changing the rate of the Keplerian disk
and see the effects on the shock location and properties of the outflow and the
spectrum. We show that as a result of Comptonization of the Compton cloud, the
cloud becomes cooler with the increase in the Keplerian disk rate. As the
resultant thermal pressure is reduced, the post-shock region collapses and the
outflow rate is also reduced. Since the hard radiation is produced from the
post-shock region, and the spectral slope increases with the reduction of the
electron temperature, the cooling produces softer spectrum. We thus find a
direct correlation between the spectral states and the outflow rates of an
accreting black hole.
