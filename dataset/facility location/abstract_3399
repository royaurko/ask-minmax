The deuteron to proton polarization transfer coefficients for the $d$--$p$
elastic scattering were precisely measured with an incoming deuteron energy of
135 MeV/u at the RIKEN Accelerator Research Facility. The data are compared to
theoretical predictions based on exact solutions of three-nucleon Faddeev
equations with high--precision nucleon--nucleon forces combined with different
three-nucleon forces (3NFs), representing the current, most popular models: the
$2\pi$-exchange Tucson-Melbourne model, a modification thereof closer to chiral
symmetry TM'(99), and the Urbana IX 3NF. Theory predicts large 3NF effects,
especially in the angular range around the cross section minimum, but the
present data only partially concurs, predominantly for
$K_{xx}^{y'}-K_{yy}^{y'}$ ($K_{xx}^{y'}$, $K_{yy}^{y'}$). For the induced
polarization, $P^{y'}$, the TM$'$(99) and Urbana IX 3NFs reproduce the data,
but the Tucson-Melbourne 3NF fails to describe the data. For the polarization
transfer coefficients, $K_{y}^{y'}$ and $K_{xz}^{y'}$, the predicted 3NF ffects
are in drastic conflict to the data. These facts clearly reveal the defects of
the 3NF models currently used.
