Astronomical datasets are growing in size and diversity, posing severe
technical problems. At the same time scientific goals increasingly require the
analysis of very large amounts of data, and data from multiple archives. The
Virtual Observatory (VO) initiative aims to make multiwavelength science and
large database science as seamless as possible. It can be seen as the latest
stage of a long term trend towards standardisation and collectivisation in
astronomy. Within this inevitable trend, we can avoid the high energy style of
building large fixed hierarchical teams, and keep the individualist style of
astronomical research, if the VO is used to build a facility class data
infrastructure. I describe how the VO works and how it may change in the Web
2.0 era.
