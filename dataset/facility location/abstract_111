Hadrontherapy is a novel technique of cancer radiation therapy which employs
beams of charged hadrons, protons and carbon ions in particular. Due to their
physical and radiobiological properties, they allow one to obtain a more
conformal treatment with respect to photons used in conventional radiation
therapy, sparing better the healthy tissues located in proximity of the tumour
and allowing a higher control of the disease. Hadrontherapy is the direct
application of research in high energy physics, making use of specifically
conceived particle accelerators and detectors. Protons can be considered today
a very important tool in clinical practice due to the several hospital-based
centres in operation and to the continuously increasing number of facilities
proposed worldwide. Very promising results have been obtained with carbon ion
beams, especially in the treatment of specific radio resistant tumours. To
optimize the use of charged hadron beams in cancer therapy, a continuous
technological challenge is leading to the conception and to the development of
innovative methods and instruments. The present status of hadrontherapy is
reviewed together with the future scientific and technological perspectives of
this discipline.
