Motivated by recent success of local electron tunneling into heavy fermion
materials, we study the local electronic structure around a single Kondo hole
in an Anderson lattice model and the Fano interference pattern relevant to STM
experiments. Within the Gutzwiller method, we find that an intragap bound state
exists in the heavy Fermi liquid regime. The energy position of the intragap
bound state is dependent on the on-site potential scattering strength in the
conduction and $f$-orbital channels. Within the same method, we derive a new
$dI/dV$ formulation, which includes explicitly the renormalization effect due
to the $f$-electron correlation. It is found that the Fano interference gives
asymmetric coherent peaks separated by the hybridization gap. The intragap peak
structure has a Lorenzian shape, and the corresponding $dI/dV$ intensity
depends on the energy location of the bound state.
