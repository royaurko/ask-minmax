Detailed electronic structure calculations of picene clusters doped by
potassium modeling the crystalline K3picene structure show that while two
electrons are completely transferred from potassium atoms to the LUMO of
pristine picene, the third one remains closely attached to both material
components. Multiconfigurational analysis is necessary to show that many
structures of almost degenerate total energies compete to define the cluster
ground state. Our results prove that the 4s orbital of potassium should be
included in any interaction model describing the material. We propose a quarter
filled two orbital model as the most simple model capable of describing the
electronic structure of K-intercalated picene. Precise solutions obtained by a
development of Lanczos method show low energy electronic excitations involving
orbitals located at different positions. Consequently, metallic transport is
possible in spite of the clear dominance of interaction over hopping.
