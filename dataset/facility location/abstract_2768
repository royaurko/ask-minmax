Detrended fluctuation analysis is used to investigate correlations between
the monthly average of the maximum daily temperatures for different locations
in the continental US and the different climates these locations have. When we
plot the scaling exponents obtained from the detrended fluctuation analysis
versus the standard deviation of the temperature fluctuations we observe
crowding of data points belonging to the same climates. Thus, we conclude that
by observing the long-time trends in the fluctuations of temperature it would
be possible to distinguish between different climates.
