We report on the VLBI follow-up observations using the Japanese VLBI Network
(JVN) array at 22 GHz for the largest X-ray flare of TeV blazar Mrk 421 that
occurred in mid-February, 2010. The total of five epochs of observations were
performed at intervals of about 20 days between March 7 and May 31, 2010. No
new-born component associated with the flare was seen directly in the total
intensity images obtained by our multi-epoch VLBI observations. However, one
jet component located at ~1 mas north-west from the core was able to be
identified, and its proper motion can be measured as -1.66+/-0.46 mas yr^-1,
which corresponds to an apparent velocity of -3.48+/-0.97 c. Here, this
negative velocity indicates that the jet component was apparently moving toward
the core. As the most plausible explanation, we discuss that the apparent
negative velocity was possibly caused by the ejection of a new component, which
could not be resolved with our observations. In this case, the obtained Doppler
factor of the new component is around 10 to 20, which is consistent with the
ones typically estimated by model fittings of spectral energy distribution for
this source.
