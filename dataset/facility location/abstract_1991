In the framework of the nuclear spectral function approach for incoherent
primary proton-nucleon and secondary pion-nucleon production processes we study
the inclusive $\phi$ meson production in the interaction of 2.83 GeV protons
with nuclei. In particular, the A- and momentum-dependences of the absolute and
relative phi meson yields are investigated within the different scenarios for
its in-medium width. Our model calculations take into account the acceptance
window of the ANKE facility used in a recent experiment performed at COSY. They
show that the pion-nucleon production channel contributes distinctly to the
"low-momentum" $\phi$ creation in heavy nuclei in the chosen kinematics and,
hence, has to be taken into consideration on close examination of the
dependences of the phi meson yields on the target mass number with the aim to
get information on its width in the medium.
