Taking the absolute value of consecutive differences of a cyclicly ordered
list of integers constitutes a simple dynamical system. For lists of lenght a
power of two the process will terminate in all zeros, but examples with
arbitarily long "lives" can be generated. For other lenghts the system can be
asymptotically cyclic.
