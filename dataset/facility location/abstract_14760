We present a study of the radio environment of the gamma-ray source 3EG
J1828+0142. This source presents a very high variability index in its gamma
emission and a steep high-energy spectral index $\Gamma\sim-2.8$. Large-scale
radio maps at different frequencies show the presence of a shell-type
non-thermal structure when the diffuse emission from the Galactic disk is
eliminated. At small scales, VLA radio images reveal the existence of several
weak point sources within the 95 % gamma-ray confidence location contour. Most
of these sources present non-thermal spectral indices, but it is not clear
whether they are extragalactic or not. We discuss the possibility of a scenario
where the large structure is a SNR and one of the compact radio sources is an
isolated black hole also produced in the original supernova explosion. The
black hole could be responsible for the variable gamma-ray emission according
to Punsly's (1998) model. INTEGRAL observations with IBIS imager could detect
the inverse Compton and blueshifted pair annihilation radiation from the
relativistic electron-positron jets of the hole. Some estimates are presented
in this regard.
