We conducted VLA observations at 0".06 resolution of the 22 GHz water masers
toward the Class 0 source S106 FIR (d=600 pc; 15" west of S106-IRS4) on two
epochs separated by ~3 months. Two compact clusters of the maser spots were
found in the center of the submillimeter core of S106 FIR. The separation of
the clusters was ~80 mas (48 AU) along P. A. = 70 degrees and the size of each
cluster was ~20 mas x 10 mas. The western cluster, which had three maser
components, was 7.0 km/s redshifted with respect to the ambient cloud velocity.
Each component was composed of a few spatially localized maser spots and was
aligned on a line connecting the clusters. We found relative proper motions of
the components with ~30 mas/yr (18 AU/yr) along the line. In addition, a series
of single-dish observations show that the maser components drifted with a
radial acceleration of ~1 km/s/yr.
  These facts indicate that the masers could be excited by a 10 AU-scale
jet-like accelerating flow ejected from an assumed protostar located between
the two clusters. The outflow size traced by the masers was 50 AU x 5 AU after
correction for an inclination angle of 10 degrees which was derived from the
relative proper motions and radial velocities of the maser components. The
three-dimensional outflow velocity ranged from 40 to 70 km/s assuming symmetric
motions for the blue and red components. Since no distinct CO molecular
outflows have been detected so far, we suggest that S106 FIR is an extremely
young protostar observed just after the onset of outflowing activity.
