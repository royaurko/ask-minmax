We present ground-based near-infrared (H-band) imaging of the circumstellar
disk around the nearby classical T Tauri star TW Hydrae. The scattered light
image shows a face-on disk with radius 4 arcseconds (corresponding to 225 AU)
and a morphology which agrees with recent images from the Hubble Space
Telescope and the Very Large Array. The best fit power-law for the disk's
radial surface brightness profile obeys the law r^{-3.3\pm0.3}. We use our
image and published continuum flux densities to derive properties of the disk
with a simple model of emission from an optically thick, flat disk. The
best-fit values for disk mass and inner radius are 0.03 M_{\odot} and 0.3 AU;
best-fit values for temperature, density, and grain opacity power law exponents
(q, p, and \beta) are 0.7, 1.3, and 0.9, respectively. These properties are
similar to those of disks around classical T Tauri stars located in more
distant molecular clouds. Because of TW Hydrae's nearby location and pole-on
orientation, it is a uniquely favorable object for future studies of radial
disk structure at the classical T Tauri stage.
