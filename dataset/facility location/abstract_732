SPINOR is a new spectro-polarimeter that will serve as a facility instrument
for the Dunn Solar Telescope at the National Solar Observatory. This instrument
is capable of achromatic polarimetry over a very broad range of wavelengths,
from 430 up to 1600 nm, allowing for the simultaneous observation of several
visible and infrared spectral regions with full Stokes polarimetry. Another key
feature of the design is its flexibility to observe virtually any combination
of spectral lines, limited only by practical considerations (e.g., the number
of detectors available, space on the optical bench, etc).
