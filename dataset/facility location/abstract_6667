We compare fits to piN elastic scattering data, based on a Chew-Mandelstam
K-matrix formalism. Resonances, characterized by T-matrix poles, are compared
in fits generated with and without explicit Chew-Mandelstam K-matrix poles.
Diagonalization of the S matrix yields the eigenphase representation. While the
eigenphases can vary significantly for the different parameterizations, the
locations of most T-matrix poles are relatively stable.
