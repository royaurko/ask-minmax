In the present document I review the current organizational structure of
Astronomy, Astrophysics and Space Physics in Greece. I briefly present the
institutions where professional astronomers are pursuing research, along with
some notes of their history, as well as the major astronomical facilities
currently available within Greece. I touch upon topics related to graduate
studies in Greece and present some statistics on the distribution of Greek
astronomers. Even though every attempt is made to substantiate all issues
mentioned, some of the views presented have inevitably a personal touch and
thus should be treated as such.
