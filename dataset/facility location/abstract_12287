We have investigated the electronic structures and magnetic properties of of
K3picene, which is a first hydrocarbon superconductor with high transition
temperature T_c=18K. We have shown that the metal-insulator transition (MIT) is
driven in K3picene by 5% volume enhancement with a formation of local magnetic
moment. Active bands for superconductivity near the Fermi level E_F are found
to have hybridized character of LUMO and LUMO+1 picene molecular orbitals.
Fermi surfaces of K3picene manifest neither prominent nesting feature nor
marked two-dimensional behavior. By estimating the ratio of the Coulomb
interaction U and the band width W of the active bands near E_F, U/W, we have
demonstrated that K3picene is located in the vicinity of the Mott transition.
