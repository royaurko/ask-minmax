News reports of the last few years indicated that several intelligence
agencies are able to monitor large networks or entire portions of the Internet
backbone. Such a powerful adversary has only recently been considered by the
academic literature. In this paper, we propose a new adversary model for
Location Based Services (LBSs). The model takes into account an uncontributorized
third party, different from the LBS provider itself, that wants to infer the
location and monitor the movements of a LBS user. We show that such an
adversary can extrapolate the position of a target user by just analyzing the
size and the timing of the encrypted traffic exchanged between that user and
the LBS provider. We performed a thorough analysis of a widely deployed
location based app that comes pre-installed with many Android devices:
GoogleNow. The results are encouraging and highlight the importance of devising
more effective countermeasures against powerful adversaries to preserve the
privacy of LBS users.
