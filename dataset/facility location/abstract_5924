Field-induced magnetization jumps with similar characteristics are observed
at low temperature for the intermetallic germanide Gd5Ge4and the mixed-valent
manganite Pr0.6Ca0.4Mn0.96Ga0.04O3. We report that the field location -and even
the existence- of these jumps depends critically on the magnetic field sweep
rate used to record the data. It is proposed that, for both compounds, the
martensitic character of their antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transitions
is at the origin of the magnetization steps.
