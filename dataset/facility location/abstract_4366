A method is presented which makes considerably more transparent possible
patterns behind low-energy scattering data. In particular, structures
associated with resonances, such as locations, widths and heights, become
visible with a naked eye. The method is illustrated with a study of the
$P$-wave $K\pi$ amplitude.
