Free variables occur frequently in mathematics and computer science with ad
hoc and altering semantics. We present the most recent version of our
free-variable framework for two-valued logics with properly improved
functionality, but only two kinds of free variables left (instead of three):
implicitly universally and implicitly existentially quantified ones, now simply
called "free atoms" and "free variables", respectively. The quantificational
expressiveness and the problem-solving facilities of our framework exceed
standard first-order and even higher-order modal logics, and directly support
Fermat's descente infinie. With the improved version of our framework, we can
now model also Henkin quantification, neither using quantifiers (binders) nor
raising (Skolemization). We propose a new semantics for Hilbert's epsilon as a
choice operator with the following features: We avoid overspecification (such
as right-uniqueness), but admit indefinite choice, committed choice, and
classical logics. Moreover, our semantics for the epsilon supports reductive
proof search optimally.
