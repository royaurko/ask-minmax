In the coming era of data-intensive science, it will be increasingly
important to be able to seamlessly move between scientific results, the data
analyzed in them, and the processes used to produce them. As observations,
derived data products, publications, and object metadata are curated by
different projects and archived in different locations, establishing the proper
linkages between these resources and describing their relationships becomes an
essential activity in their curation and preservation. In this paper we
describe initial efforts to create a semantic knowledge base allowing easier
integration and linking of the body of heterogeneous astronomical resources
which we call the Virtual Observatory (VO). The ultimate goal of this effort is
the creation of a semantic layer over existing resources, allowing applications
to cross boundaries between archives. The proposed approach follows the current
best practices in Semantic Computing and the architecture of the web, allowing
the use of off-the-shelf technologies and providing a path for VO resources to
become part of the global web of linked data.
