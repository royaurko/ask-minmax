We previously reported anomalous fiber-optic gyroscope signals observed above
rotating rings at temperatures close to liquid helium. Our results suggested
that the liquid helium itself may be the source of our observed phenomenon. We
constructed a new cryostat experiment that allows rotating a large quantity of
liquid helium together with a superconducting niobium tube. The facility is
built in such a way that our gyroscope can be placed directly in the center of
rotation along the axis; however, the cryostat is built around the gyroscope to
allow measuring without interference of helium liquid or gas. An anomalous
signal was found of similar value compared to our previous measurements with a
changed sign. As this measurement was done at a different location (center
position) with respect to our old setup (top position), first hints for a
possible field distribution of this phenomenon can be made. However, due to
lower angular velocities used in this new setup so far, our measurement
resolution was close to three times the resolution of our gyroscope and hence
our data represent work in progress.
