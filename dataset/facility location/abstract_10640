We investigate the sequence-dependent behaviour of localised excitations in a
toy, nonlinear model of DNA base-pair opening originally proposed by Salerno.
Specifically we ask whether ``breather'' solitons could play a role in the
facilitated location of promoters by RNA polymerase. In an effective potential
formalism, we find excellent correlation between potential minima and {\em
Escherichia coli} promoter recognition sites in the T7 bacteriophage genome.
Evidence for a similar relationship between phage promoters and downstream
coding regions is found and alternative reasons for links between AT richness
and transcriptionally-significant sites are discussed. Consideration of the
soliton energy of translocation provides a novel dynamical picture of sliding:
steep potential gradients correspond to deterministic motion, while ``flat''
regions, corresponding to homogeneous AT or GC content, are governed by random,
thermal motion. Finally we demonstrate an interesting equivalence between
planar, breather solitons and the helical motion of a sliding protein
``particle'' about a bent DNA axis.
