We describe a method for detecting, locating and quantifying sources of gas
emissions to the atmosphere using remotely obtained gas concentration data; the
method is applicable to gases of environmental concern. We demonstrate its
performance using methane data collected from aircraft. Atmospheric point
concentration measurements are modelled as the sum of a spatially and
temporally smooth atmospheric background concentration, augmented by
concentrations due to local sources. We model source emission rates with a
Gaussian mixture model and use a Markov random field to represent the
atmospheric background concentration component of the measurements. A Gaussian
plume atmospheric eddy dispersion model represents gas dispersion between
sources and measurement locations. Initial point estimates of background
concentrations and source emission rates are obtained using mixed L2-L1
optimisation over a discretised grid of potential source locations. Subsequent
reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo inference provides estimated values
and uncertainties for the number, emission rates and locations of sources
unconstrained by a grid. Source area, atmospheric background concentrations and
other model parameters are also estimated. We investigate the performance of
the approach first using a synthetic problem, then apply the method to real
data collected from an aircraft flying over: a 1600 km^2 area containing two
landfills, then a 225 km^2 area containing a gas flare stack.
