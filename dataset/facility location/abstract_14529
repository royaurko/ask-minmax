In order to understand the evolutionary status of the anomalous supergiant
UUHer, the prototype of the class of variable supergiants located at high
galactic latitudes, we obtained several high-resolution spectra of this star,
with the 6m telescope, over 5 years. This material was used for a search of
possible temporal variations of the radial velocity at the different depths in
the photosphere and for studying the chemical composition. The average radial
velocity Vr approximately 130 km/sec suggests that UUHer belongs to the old
population of the Galaxy. No systematic dependence of the velocity on depth of
the line formation layer or on ionization and excitation potential is observed.
The radial velocity of the H_alpha absorption differs strongly from the average
photospheric velocity. The iron abundance in the photosphere of UUHer is
significantly lower than that of the Sun: [Fe/H]=-1.32. The enhancement of
nitrogen relatively to iron content [N/Fe]=+0.40 in combination with the carbon
underabundance [C/Fe]=-0.30 suggests that only a first dredge-up episode
occurred. The Na content is normal relatively to iron, therefore there is no
evidence for dredging-up of Ne-Na cycle products. The heavy s-process metals Y,
Ba are depleted relative to H and Fe, which again implies that the third
dredge-up did not occur.
