We report the first broad-band (0.5-150 keV) simultaneous X-ray observations
of the very faint X-ray transient IGRJ17285-2922/XTEJ1728-295 performed with
XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL satellites during its last outburst, started on 2010,
August 28. XMM-Newton observed the source on 2010 September 9-10, for 22ks.
INTEGRAL observations were part of the publicly available Galactic Bulge
program, and overlapped with the times covered by XMM-Newton. The broad-band
spectroscopy resulted in a best-fit with an absorbed power law displaying a
photon index of 1.61+/-0.01, an absorbing column density of (5.10+/-0.05)E21
cm-2, and a flux of 2.4E-10 erg/cm2/s (1-100 keV), corrected for the
absorption. The data did not require either a spectral cut-off (E>50 keV) or an
additional soft component. The slopes of the XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL separate
spectra were compatible, within the uncertainties. The timing analysis does not
show evidence either for X-ray pulsations or for type I X-ray bursts. The broad
band X-ray spectrum as well as the power density spectrum are indicative of a
low hard state in a low mass X-ray binary, although nothing conclusive can be
said about the nature of the compact object (neutron star or black hole). The
results we are reporting here allow us to conclude that IGRJ17285-2922 is a low
mass X-ray binary, located at a distance greater than 4 kpc.
