A superconducting RF accelerator test facility is being constructed at
Fermilab. The existing New Muon Lab (NML) building is being converted for this
facility. The accelerator will consist of an electron gun, injector, beam
acceleration section consisting of 3 TTF-type or ILC-type cryomodules, multiple
downstream beam lines for testing diagnostics and conducting various beam
tests, and a high power beam dump. When completed, it is envisioned that this
facility will initially be capable of generating an 810 MeV electron beam with
ILC beam intensity. Expansion plans of the facility are underway that will
provide the capability to upgrade the accelerator to a total beam energy of 1.5
GeV. In addition to testing accelerator components, this facility will be used
to test RF power equipment, instrumentation, LLRF and controls systems for
future SRF accelerators such as the ILC and Project-X. This paper describes the
current status and overall plans for this facility.
