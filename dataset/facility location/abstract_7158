We describe two new -- stochastic-geometrical -- methods to obtain reliable
velocity field statistics from N-body simulations and from any general density
and velocity fluctuation field sampled at a discrete set of locations. These
methods, the Voronoi tessellation method and Delaunay tessellation method, are
based on the use of the Voronoi and Delaunay tessellations of the point
distribution defined by the locations at which the velocity field is sampled.
Adjusting themselves automatically to the density of sampling points, they
represent the optimal estimator for volume-averaged quantities. They are
therefore particularly suited for checking the validity of the predictions of
quasi-linear analytical density and velocity field perturbation theory through
the results of N-body simulations of structure formation. We illustrate the
subsequent succesfull application of the two methods to estimate the
bias-independent value of $\Omega$ in the N-body simulations on the basis of
the predictions of perturbation theory for the $\Omega$-dependence of the
moments and PDF of the velocity divergence in gravitational instability
structure formation scenarios with Gaussian initial conditions. We will also
shortly discuss practical and complicating issues involved in the obvious
extension of the Voronoi and Delaunay method to the analysis of observational
samples of galaxy peculiar velocities.
