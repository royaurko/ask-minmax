Risk is a well-known turn based board game where the primary objective is
nothing less than the world domination. Gameplay is based on battles between
armies located in adjacent territories on the map of Earth. The combat's
outcome is decided by rolling dice, and therefore a probabilistic approach can
be taken. Although several results are derived, the conclusions suggest that
the gameplay is highly depending on luck.
