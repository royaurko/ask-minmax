Localization of acoustic waves in a one dimensional water duct containing
many randomly distributed air filled blocks is studied. Both the Lyapunov
exponent and its variance are computed. Their statistical properties are also
explored extensively. The results reveal that in this system the single
parameter scaling is generally inadequate no matter whether the frequency we
consider is located in a pass band or in a band gap. This contradicts the
earlier observations in an optical case. We compare the results with two
optical cases and give a possible explanation of the origin of the different
behaviors.
