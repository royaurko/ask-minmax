We report on the first space-VLBI observations of the OH masers in two
main-line OH transitions at 1665 and 1667 MHz. The observations involved the
space radio telescope on board the Japanese satellite HALCA and an array of
ground radio telescopes. The maps of the maser region and images of individual
maser spots were produced with an angular resolution of 1 mas, which is several
times higher than the angular resolution available on the ground. The maser
spots were only partly resolved and a lower limit to the brightness temperature
6x10^12 K was obtained. The masers seem to be located in the direction of low
interstellar scattering.
