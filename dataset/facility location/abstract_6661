Tide gauge and satellite data indicate that the rate of sea level rise has
not increased significantly in response to the last 3/4 century of CO2
emissions, so there is no reason to expect that it will do so in response to
the next 3/4 century of CO2 emissions. The best prediction for sea level in the
future is simply a linear projection of the history of sea level at the same
location in the past. For Long Island, that is about 7-8 inches by 2080.
