An ab initio Green's function study of the electron transport properties of
the selected metal-porphyrin complexes has been performed. Transmission spectra
and current-voltage dependence have been calculated for the porphyrin molecule
located between gold electrodes in the presence of interaction with metal
atoms, which are most common in biochemistry (Fe(II), Fe(III), Mn(II), and
Zn(II)). It was shown that the estimated Fermi level almost coincides with the
LUMO level of Fe(II)-porphyrin and Fe(III)-porphyrin, resulting in significant
conductance at small voltage biases. Conductance of Mn(II)-porphyrin and
Zn(II)-porphyrin are much lower, and decrease from Mn to Zn. It was confirmed
that performing spin-unrestricted calculations is essential to account
splitting of the original molecular orbitals levels. Preformed calculations
demonstrate the principal possibility of experimental realization of porphyrin
based nanosensors.
