MRI quantification of cranial nerves such as anterior visual pathway (AVP) in
MRI is challenging due to their thin small size, structural variation along its
path, and adjacent anatomic structures. Segmentation of pathologically abnormal
optic nerve (e.g. optic nerve glioma) poses additional challenges due to
changes in its shape at unpredictable locations. In this work, we propose a
partitioned joint statistical shape model approach with sparse appearance
learning for the segmentation of healthy and pathological AVP. Our main
contributions are: (1) optimally partitioned statistical shape models for the
AVP based on regional shape variations for greater local flexibility of
statistical shape model; (2) refinement model to accommodate pathological
regions as well as areas of subtle variation by training the model on-the-fly
using the initial segmentation obtained in (1); (3) hierarchical deformable
framework to incorporate scale information in partitioned shape and appearance
models. Our method, entitled PAScAL (PArtitioned Shape and Appearance
Learning), was evaluated on 21 MRI scans (15 healthy + 6 glioma cases) from
pediatric patients (ages 2-17). The experimental results show that the proposed
localized shape and sparse appearance-based learning approach significantly
outperforms segmentation approaches in the analysis of pathological data.
