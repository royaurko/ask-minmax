A possibility of 5D gauge unification of $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ in $SU(3)_W$
is examined. The orbifold compactification allows fixed points where
$SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ representations can be assigned. We present a few
possibilities which give long proton lifetime, top-bottom mass hierarchy from
geometry, and reasonable neutrino masses. In general, these {\it chiral models}
can lead to fixed point anomalies. We can show easily, due to the simplicity of
the model, that these anomalies are cancelled by the relevant Chern-Simons
terms for all the models we consider. It is also shown that the fixed point
U(1)--graviton--graviton anomaly cancels without the help from the Chern-Simons
term. Hence, we conjecture that the fixed point anomalies can be cancelled if
the effective 4D theory is made anomaly free by locating chiral fermions at the
fixed points.
