This paper is devoted to the description of our recent results on the
spectral behavior of one-dimensional adiabatic quasi-periodic Schrodinger
operators. The specific operator we study is a slow periodic perturbation of an
incommensurate periodic Schrodinger operator, and we are interested in energies
where the perturbation creates a strong interaction between two consecutive
bands of the background periodic operator. We describe the location of the
spectrum and its nature and discuss the various new resonance phenomena due to
the interaction of the spectral bands of the unperturbed periodic operator.
