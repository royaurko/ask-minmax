Spin observables for the reaction $\gamma p \rightarrow K^+ \Lambda$ are
examined using three recent dynamical models and are compared to the general
features of such observables deduced earlier by Fasano, Tabakin and Saghai.
These general features, such as the energy dependence of spin observables and
the location of nodes in their angle dependence, are realized. Several
instructive surprises, which occur in this comparison to the conjectures of
Fasano et al., are then discussed. The sensitivity of spin observables to
isobar and {\it t-}channel dynamics is analyzed and suggestions for selecting
experiments which provide important dynamical information are presented.
