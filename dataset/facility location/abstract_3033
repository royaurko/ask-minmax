In proofs of L_2-differentiability, Lebesgue densities of a central
distribution are often assumed right from the beginning. Generalizing Theorem
4.2 of Huber[81], we show that in the class of smooth parametric group models
these densities are in fact consequences of a finite Fisher information of the
model, provided a suitable representation of the latter is used. The proof uses
the notions of absolute continuity in k dimensions and weak differentiability.
As examples to which this theorem applies, we spell out a number of models
including a correlation model and the general multivariate location and scale
model. As a consequence of this approach, we show that in the (multivariate)
location scale model, finiteness of Fisher information as defined here is in
fact equivalent to L_2-differentiability and to a log-likelihood expansion
giving local asymptotic normality of the model. Paralleling Huber's proofs for
existence and uniqueness of a minimizer of Fisher information to our situation,
we get existence of a minimizer in any weakly closed set of central
distributions F. If, additionally to analogue assumptions to those of
Huber[81], a certain identifiability condition for the transformation holds, we
obtain uniqueness of the minimizer. This identifiability condition is satisfied
in the multivariate location scale model.
