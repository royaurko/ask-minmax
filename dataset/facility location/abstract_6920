The phase structure of three-dimensional Z(N>4) lattice gauge theories at
finite temperature is investigated. Using the dual formulation of the models
and a cluster algorithm we locate the critical points of the two transitions,
determine various critical indices and compute average action and specific
heat. Results are consistent with two transitions of infinite order, belonging
to the universality class of two-dimensional Z(N) vector spin models.
