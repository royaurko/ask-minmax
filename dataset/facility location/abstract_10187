Based on universal arguments it is believed that there is a critical point
(E) in QCD on the temperature (T) versus chemical potential (\mu) plane, which
is of extreme importance for heavy-ion experiments. Using finite size scaling
and a recently proposed lattice method to study QCD at finite \mu we determine
the location of E in QCD with n_f=2+1 dynamical staggered quarks with
semi-realistic masses on $L_t=4$ lattices. Our result is T_E=160 \pm 3.5 MeV
and \mu_E= 725 \pm 35 MeV. For the critical temperature at \mu=0 we obtained
T_c=172 \pm 3 MeV.
