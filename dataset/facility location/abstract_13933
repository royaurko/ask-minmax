We investigate the atmospheric response to a small emerging flux region (EFR)
that occurred in the positive polarity of Active Region 11236 on 23 \,-\ 24
June 2011. Data from the \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory's Atmopheric
Imaging Assembly} (AIA), the \textit{Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager} (HMI)
and Hinode's \textit{EUV imaging spectrometer} (EIS) are used to determine the
atmospheric response to new flux emerging into a pre-existing active region.
  Brightenings are seen forming in the upper photosphere, chromosphere, and
corona over the EFR's location whilst flux cancellation is observed in the
photosphere. The impact of the flux emergence is far reaching, with new
large-scale coronal loops forming up to 43 Mm from the EFR and coronal upflow
enhancements of approximately 10 km s$^{-1}$ on the north side of the EFR. Jets
are seen forming in the chromosphere and the corona over the emerging
serpentine field. This is the first time that coronal jets have been seen over
the serpentine field.
