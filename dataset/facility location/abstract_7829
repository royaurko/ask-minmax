We report measurements of the complex Kerr rotation angle, $\Theta_K$, in
thin films of the magnetically doped topological insulator
$(\text{Cr}_{0.12}\text{Bi}_{0.26}\text{Sb}_{0.62})_2\text{Te}_3$ as a function
of photon energy in the range $0.8$ eV $<\hbar\omega<3.0$ eV. We observe a peak
in the real part of $\Theta_K(\omega)$ and corresponding zero crossing in the
imaginary part, that we attribute to resonant interaction with a spin-orbit
avoided crossing and Dirac band located $\approx$ 1.7 eV above the chemical
potential. The resonant enhancement allows measurement of the temperature and
magnetic field dependence of $\Theta_K$ in the ultrathin film limit, $d\geq2$
quintuple layers. We find a sharp transition to remnant $\Theta_K=0$ for $d<8$
QL, consistent with theories of the dependence of impurity spin interactions on
film thickness and their location relative to topological insulator surfaces.
