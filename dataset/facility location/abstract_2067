Technology leads discovery in astronomy, as in all other areas of science, so
growth in technology leads to the continual stream of new discoveries which
makes our field so fascinating. Derek de Solla Price had analysed the discovery
process in science in the 1960s and he introduced the terms 'Little Science'
and 'Big Science' as part of his discussion of the role of exponential growth
in science. I will show how the development of astronomical facilities has
followed this same trend from 'Little Science' to 'Big Science' as a field
matures. We can see this in the discoveries resulting in Nobel Prizes in
astronomy. A more detailed analysis of discoveries in radio astronomy shows the
same effect. I include a digression to look at how science progresses,
comparing the roles of prediction, serendipity, measurement and explanation.
Finally I comment on the differences between the 'Big Science' culture in
Physics and in Astronomy.
