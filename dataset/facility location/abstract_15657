We demonstrate the accuracy of the hypernetted chain closure and of the
mean-field approximation for the calculation of the fluid-state properties of
systems interacting by means of bounded and positive-definite pair potentials
with oscillating Fourier transforms. Subsequently, we prove the validity of a
bilinear, random-phase density functional for arbitrary inhomogeneous phases of
the same systems. On the basis of this functional, we calculate analytically
the freezing parameters of the latter. We demonstrate explicitly that the
stable crystals feature a lattice constant that is independent of density and
whose value is dictated by the position of the negative minimum of the Fourier
transform of the pair potential. This property is equivalent with the existence
of clusters, whose population scales proportionally to the density. We
establish that regardless of the form of the interaction potential and of the
location on the freezing line, all cluster crystals have a universal Lindemann
ratio L = 0.189 at freezing. We further make an explicit link between the
aforementioned density functional and the harmonic theory of crystals. This
allows us to establish an equivalence between the emergence of clusters and the
existence of negative Fourier components of the interaction potential. Finally,
we make a connection between the class of models at hand and the system of
infinite-dimensional hard spheres, when the limits of interaction steepness and
space dimension are both taken to infinity in a particularly described fashion.
