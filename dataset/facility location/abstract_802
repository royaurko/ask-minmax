We give predictions for the leading order amplitudes for deeply virtual
Compton scattering and hard meson electroproduction reactions at large Q^2 in
the valence region in terms of skewed quark distributions. We give first
estimates for the power corrections to these leading order amplitudes. In
particular, we outline examples of experimental opportunities to access the
skewed parton distributions at the current high-energy lepton facilities :
JLab, HERMES and COMPASS.
