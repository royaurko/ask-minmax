New optical spectra of the original narrow-line quasar 1E 0449.4-1823 show
that it now has broad emission lines of considerable strength, eliminating it
as a "type 2 QSO" candidate. We suggest that the behavior of 1E 0449.4-1823 is
the same as that of some Seyfert 1.8 and 1.9 galaxies, in which Goodrich
attributed long-term variations of their broad Balmer lines to dynamical
motions of obscuring material located in or around the broad-line region. The
optical continuum and broad emission-line regions of 1E 0449.4-1823 may still
be partly covered in our line of sight, which would explain its large
forbidden-line equivalent widths and flat alpha_ox relative to other
low-redshift QSOs. Also present are apparent absorption features in the broad
Balmer lines and in Mg II, which may be related to the past obscuration and
current emergence of the broad-line region. However, it is difficult to
distinguish absorption from broad emission-line peaks that are displaced in
velocity; we consider the latter a plausible competing interpretation of these
peculiar line profiles. An ASCA X-ray spectrum of 1E 0449.4-1823 can be fitted
with a power-law of Gamma = 1.63, intrinsic N_H < 9 x 10^20 cm-2, and no Fe
Kalpha line emission. Its 2-10 keV luminosity is 6.7 x 10^44 ergs/s. With
regard to the still hypothetical type 2 QSOs, we argue that there is little
evidence for the existence of any among X-ray selected samples.
