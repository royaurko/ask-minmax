The theory of radiation driven wind including stellar rotation is
re-examined. After a suitable change of variables, a new equation for the mass
loss rate is derived analytically. The solution of this equation remains within
1% confidence when compared with numerical solutions. Also, a non-linear
equation for the position of the critical (singular) point is obtained. This
equation shows the existence of an additional critical point, besides the
standard m--CAK critical point. For a stellar rotation velocity larger than
aprox. 0.7 - 0.8 V_{breakup}, there exists only one critical point, located
away from the star's surface. Numerical solutions crossing through this new
critical point, are attained. In these cases, the wind has a very low terminal
velocity and therefore a higher density wind. Disk formation in Be stars is
discussed in the frame of this new line driven stellar wind solution.
