We propose a new framework for designing test and query functions for complex
structures that vary across a given parameter such as genetic marker position.
The operations we are interested in include equality testing, set operations,
isolating unique states, duplication counting, or finding equivalence classes
under identifiability constraints. A motivating application is locating
equivalence classes in identity-by-descent (IBD) graphs, graph structures in
pedigree analysis that change over genetic marker location. The nodes of these
graphs are unlabeled and identified only by their connecting edges, a
constraint easily handled by our approach. The general framework introduced is
powerful enough to build a range of testing functions for IBD graphs, dynamic
populations, and other structures using a minimal set of operations. The
theoretical and algorithmic properties of our approach are analyzed and proved.
Computational results on several simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach.
