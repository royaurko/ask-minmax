We report on the application of a feedback-controlled electromigration
technique for the formation of nanometer-sized gaps in mesoscopic gold wires
and rings. The effect of current density and temperature, linked via Joule
heating, on the resulting gap size is investigated. Experimentally, a good
thermal coupling to the substrate turned out to be crucial to reach electrode
spacings below 10 nm and to avoid overall melting of the nanostructures. This
finding is supported by numerical calculations of the current-density and
temperature profiles for structure layouts subjected to electromigration. The
numerical method can be used for optimizing the layout so as to predetermine
the location where electromigation leads to the formation of a gap.
