We study the ground state of the attractive one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard
model, and in particular the nature of the crossover between the weak
interaction and strong interaction regimes for finite system sizes. Indicator
properties like the gap between the ground and first excited energy levels, and
the incremental ground-state wavefunction overlaps are used to locate different
regimes. Using mean-field theory we predict that there are two distinct
crossovers connected to spontaneous symmetry breaking of the ground state. The
first crossover arises in an analysis valid for large L with finite N, where L
is the number of lattice sites and N is the total particle number. An
alternative approach valid for large N with finite L yields a second crossover.
For small system sizes we numerically investigate the model and observe that
there are signatures of both crossovers. We compare with exact results from
Bethe ansatz methods in several limiting cases to explore the validity for
these numerical and mean-field schemes. The results indicate that for finite
attractive systems there are generically three ground-state phases of the
model.
