The ELODIE archive contains the complete collection of high-resolution
echelle spectra accumulated over the last decade using the ELODIE spectrograph
at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence 1.93-m telescope. This article presents
the different data products and the facilities available on the web to
re-process these data on-the-fly. Users can retrieve the data in FITS format
from http://atlas.obs-hp.fr/elodie and apply to them different functions:
wavelength resampling and flux calibration in particular.
