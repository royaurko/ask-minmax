We present K-band spectra of more than 110 M giants in Galactic bulge fields
interior to -4 degrees and as close as 0.2 degrees of the Galactic Center. From
the equivalent widths of three features in these spectra, EW(Na),EW(Ca), and
EW(CO) we calculate [Fe/H] for the stars with a calibration derived from
globular clusters Stephens et al (2000). The mean [Fe/H] for each field is in
good agreement with the results from Frogel et al. (1999) based on the slope of
the giant branch method. We find no evidence for a metallicity gradient along
the minor or major axes of the inner bulge (R < 0.6 kpc). A metallicity
gradient along the minor axis, found earlier, arises when fields located at
larger galactic radius are included. However, these more distant fields are
located outside of the infrared bulge defined by the COBE/DIRBE observations.
We compute the [Fe/H] distribution for the inner bulge and find a mean value of
-0.21 dex with a full width dispersion of 0.30 dex, close to the values found
for Baade's Window (BW) by Sadler et al. (1996) and to a theoretical prediction
for a bulge formed by dissipative collapse Molla et al (2000).
