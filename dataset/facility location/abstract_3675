Agent-based models are becoming indispensable tools in building design,
safety assessments as well as management of emergency egress. However, reliable
calibrations of these models should be mandatory before they are used in
practice. To improve the database for model calibration we present results from
two experiments at a T-junction and a corner. In such structures the dynamics
of pedestrian streams is complex and up to now not studied systematically. To
understand it deeply, series of well-controlled laboratory experiments are
conducted. The Voronoi method, which is used to analyze the experiments, allows
high resolution and small fluctuation in time and space. From the results, it
is found that the fundamental diagrams of pedestrian flow in T-junction are not
the same before and after merging. At the same density, the velocities of
pedestrians before merging are smaller than that after merging. To analyze
whether turning or merging of the stream is responsible for this discrepancy,
we compare the fundamental diagrams of pedestrian flow in T-junction with the
flow at a single corner. The fundamental diagrams of the streams in front and
behind the corner agree well and are also in accordance with that from
T-junction flow after merging. Besides, space-resolved measurements for the
density, velocity profiles are obtained using Voronoi method. These maps offer
important information about dangerous spots and thus enable to improve egress
management and facility design.
