UGC 12281 has been classified as having a pure disk and being a low surface
brightness galaxy (LSBG), thus being an obvious member of the so-called
superthin galaxies. At the same time it represents an extremely untypical type
of LSBG due to its remarkable amount of current star formation and evidence for
extraplanar ionized gas. This makes it become a perfect tool to investigate the
triggering of star formation in LSB galaxies, located in an alleged isolated
area. By means of deep photometry and long-slit spectroscopy we analyse the
H$\alpha$ halo and verify the existence of a potential dwarf companion which we
found on processed SDSS images.
