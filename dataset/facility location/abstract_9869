Detailed study of torsional oscillator experiments under steady rotation up
to 6.28 rad/sec is reported for a 4He superfluid monolayer film formed in 1
micrometer-pore diameter porous glass. We found a new dissipation peak with the
height being in proportion to the rotation speed, which is located to the lower
temperature than the vortex pair unbinding peak observed in the static state.
We propose that 3D coreless vortices ("pore vortices") appear under rotation to
explain this new peak. That is, the new peak originates from dissipation close
to the pore vortex lines, where large superfluid velocity shifts the vortex
pair unbinding dissipation to lower temperature. This explanation is confirmed
by observation of nonlinear effects at high oscillation amplitudes.
