The extinction transition on a one dimensional heterogeneous substrate with
diffusive correlations is studied. Diffusively correlated heterogeneity is
shown to affect the location of the transition point, as the reactants adapt to
the fluctuating environment. At the transition point the density decays like
$t^{-0.159}$, as predicted by the theory of directed percolation. However, the
scaling function describing the behavior away from the transition shows
significant deviations from the DP predictions; it is suggested, thus, that the
off-transition behavior of the system is governed by local adaptation to
favored regions.
