Strong variations of the intensity of secondary cosmic rays during
thunderstorms are found to be accompanied in some cases by very clear
pulsations of the geomagnetic field. The experiment is carried out in the
Baksan Valley, North Caucasus, the Carpet air shower array being used as a
particle detector. Magnetic field measurements are made with high-precision
magnetometers located deep underground in the tunnel of the Baksan Neutrino
Observatory, several kilometers apart from the air shower array.
