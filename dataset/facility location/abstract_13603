With the SDO/AIA instrument, continuous and intermittent plasma outflows are
observed on the boundaries of an active region along two distinct open coronal
loops. %with the speed of 30$\sim$200 km s$^{-1}$. By investigating the
temporal sequence magnetograms obtained from HMI/SDO, it is found that
small-scale magnetic reconnection probably plays an important role in the
generation of the plasma outflows in the coronal loops. It is found that the
origin of the plasma outflows coincides with the locations of the small-scale
magnetic fields with mixed polarities, which suggests that the plasma outflows
along coronal loops probably results from the magnetic reconnection between the
small-scale close emerging loops and the large-scale open active region coronal
loops.
