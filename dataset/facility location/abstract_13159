The Edelweiss experiment uses Ge-bolometers with an improved background
rejection (interleaved electrode design) to search for WIMP dark matter. The
setup is located in the underground laboratory, Laboratoire Souterrain de
Modane (LSM, France). In 2009-2010 the collaboration successfully operated ten
400-g bolometers together with an active muon veto shielding. Published
analysis of this measurement campaign was optimized for WIMP masses above 50
GeV. Recently, the analysis was extended to the low-mass WIMP region using a
quality subset of the 2009-2010 data setting new limits on the spin-independent
WIMP-nucleon scattering cross-section. We present the low-mass WIMP analysis,
background investigations and the latest measurements with a subset of the
forty 800-g detectors that will be installed for the Edelweiss-III. Ongoing
installation works of the Edelweiss-III setup and further plans for a next
generation experiment, EURECA, are discussed.
