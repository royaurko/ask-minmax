Consider the following forest fire model where the possible locations of
trees are the sites of $\mathbb{Z}$. Each site has three possible states:
'vacant', 'occupied' or 'burning'. Vacant sites become occupied at rate $1$. At
each site, ignition (by lightning) occurs at rate $\lambda$. When a site is
ignited, a fire starts and propagates to neighbors at rate $\pi$. We study the
asymptotic behavior of this process as $\lambda\to0$ and $\pi\to\infty$. We
show that there are three possible classes of scaling limits, according to the
regime in which $\lambda\to0$ and $\pi\to\infty$.
