We present a study of the gaseous and stellar emission in I Zw18, the most
metal-poor star-forming galaxy known. Archival HST WFPC2 and FOS data have been
used to analyze the spatial distribution of [OIII], Halpha, and HeII 4686. The
latter is used to identify Wolf-Rayet stars found by ground-based spectroscopy
and to locate nebular HeII emission. Most of the HeII emission is associated
with the NW stellar cluster, displaced from the surrounding shell-like [OIII]
and Halpha emission. We found evidence for HeII sources compatible with 5-9 WNL
stars and/or compact nebular HeII emission as well as residual diffuse
emission. New evolutionary tracks and synthesis models at the appropriate
metallicity predict a mass limit M_WR ~90 Msun for WR stars to become WN and
WC/WO. The observed equivalent widths of the WR lines are in good agreement
with an instantaneous burst model with a Salpeter IMF extending up to M_up ~
120-150 Msun. Our model is also able to fully reproduce the observed equivalent
widths of nebular HeII emission due to the presence of WC/WO stars. This
finding together with the spatial distribution of nebular HeII further supports
the hypothesis that WR stars are responsible for nebular HeII emission in
extra-galactic HII regions. Finally we discuss the implications on stellar mass
loss, chemical yields, final stellar masses, and the ionizing flux of starburst
galaxies at very low metallicities.
