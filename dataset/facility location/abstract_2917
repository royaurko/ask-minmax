Hawaiian monk seals (Monachus schauinslandi) are endemic to the Hawaiian
Islands and are the most endangered species of marine mammal that lives
entirely within the jurisdiction of the United States. The species numbers
around 1300 and has been declining owing, among other things, to poor juvenile
survival which is evidently related to poor foraging success. Consequently,
data have been collected recently on the foraging habitats, movements, and
behaviors of monk seals throughout the Northwestern and main Hawaiian Islands.
Our work here is directed to exploring a data set located in a relatively
shallow offshore submerged bank (Penguin Bank) in our search of a model for a
seal's journey. The work ends by fitting a stochastic differential equation
(SDE) that mimics some aspects of the behavior of seals by working with
location data collected for one seal. The SDE is found by developing a time
varying potential function with two points of attraction. The times of location
are irregularly spaced and not close together geographically, leading to some
difficulties of interpretation. Synthetic plots generated using the model are
employed to assess its reasonableness spatially and temporally. One aspect is
that the animal stays mainly southwest of Molokai. The work led to the
estimation of the lengths and locations of the seal's foraging trips.
