The properties of strange and charm mesons in nuclear matter and nuclei are
reviewed. Different frameworks are presented and discussed paying a special
attention to unitarized coupled-channel approaches. Possible experimental
signatures of the in-medium properties of these mesons are also addressed, in
particular in connection with the future FAIR facility at GSI.
