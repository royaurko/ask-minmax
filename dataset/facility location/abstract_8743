Between the launch of the Ulysses spacecraft in 1990 October and the entry of
Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO) into the atmosphere of Venus in 1992 October,
concurrent coverage by Ulysses, PVO, the WATCH experiments aboard the Granat
and EURECA spacecraft, and the SIGMA and PHEBUS experiments aboard the Granat
spacecraft was obtained for numerous gamma-ray bursts. 15 of them were detected
by 3 or more instruments on spacecraft separated by distances of several AU,
and could therefore be accurately localized by triangulation. In some cases
independent, accurate locations were obtained by SIGMA and/or WATCH. We present
these localizations, which range in area from 0.9 to 530 arcminutes$^2$.
