This article is concerned with pointwise growth and spreading speeds in
systems of parabolic partial differential equations. Several criteria exist for
quantifying pointwise growth rates. These include the location in the complex
plane of singularities of the pointwise Green's function and pinched double
roots of the dispersion relation. The primary aim of this work is to establish
some rigorous properties related to these criteria and the relationships
between them. In the process, we discover that these concepts are not
equivalent and point to some interesting consequences for nonlinear front
invasion problems. Among the more striking is the fact that pointwise growth
does not depend continuously on system parameters. Other results include a
determination of the circumstances under which pointwise growth on the real
line implies pointwise growth on a semi-infinite interval. As a final
application, we consider invasion fronts in an infinite cylinder and show that
the linear prediction always favors the formation of stripes in the leading
edge.
