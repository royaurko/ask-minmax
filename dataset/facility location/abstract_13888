Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) is the only method we currently have to
measure connections between different parts of the human brain in vivo. To
elucidate the structure of these connections, algorithms for tracking bundles
of axonal fibers through the subcortical white matter rely on local estimates
of the fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) in different parts of the
brain. These functions describe the relative abundance of populations of axonal
fibers crossing each other in each location. Multiple models exist for
estimating fODFs. The quality of the resulting estimates can be quantified by
means of a suitable measure of distance on the space of fODFs. However, there
are multiple distance metrics that can be applied for this purpose, including
smoothed $L_p$ distances and the Wasserstein metrics. Here, we give four
reasons for the use of the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) equipped with the
arc-length, as a distance metric. (continued)
