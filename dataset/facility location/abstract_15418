It is well known that the radial displacement of the $m=1$ internal kink mode
in a periodic screw pinch has a steep jump at the resonant surface where
$\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{B}=0$. In a line-tied system, relevant to solar and
astrophysical plasmas, the resonant surface is no longer a valid concept. It is
then of interest to see how line-tying alters the aforementioned result for a
periodic system. If the line-tied kink also produces a steep gradient,
corresponding to a thin current layer, it may lead to strong resistive effects
even with weak dissipation. Numerical solution of the eigenmode equations shows
that the fastest growing kink mode in a line-tied system still possesses a jump
in the radial displacement at the location coincident with the resonant surface
of the fastest growing mode in the periodic counterpart. However, line-tying
thickens the inner layer and slows down the growth rate. As the system length
$L$ approaches infinity, both the inner layer thickness and the growth rate
approach the periodic values. In the limit of small $\epsilon\sim
B_{\phi}/B_{z}$, the critical length for instability $L_{c}\sim\epsilon^{-3}$.
The relative increase in the inner layer thickness due to line-tying scales as
$\epsilon^{-1}(L_{c}/L)^{2.5}$.
