A straightforward interpretation of the MACHO microlensing results in the
direction of the Magellanic Clouds suggests that an important fraction of the
baryonic dark matter component of our Galaxy is in the form of old white
dwarfs. If correct, this has serious implications for the early generations of
stars that formed in the Universe and also on the manner in which galaxies
formed and enriched themselves in heavy elements. I examine this scenario in
some detail and in particular explore whether the searches currently being
carried out to locate local examples of these MACHOs can shed any light at all
on this scenario.
