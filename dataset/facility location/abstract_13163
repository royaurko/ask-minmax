Many Internet service providers (ISPs) throughout the world are now in the
process of integrating IPv6 into their Internet access products for retail
customers and corporate clients. One of the most important features of the IPv6
protocol is its huge address space. This will enable users to assign a
life-long stable, unique and globally routable IP address to each personal
device. All users will be able to set up public services at home and be able to
communicate from and to their devices from any point in the network. The
resulting end-to-end reachability is considered a major improvement over the
current situation.IPv6 evoked a new debate between privacy and security in
order to attract more unique IP addresses to locate users, especially with the
advent of mobile devices. While the initial IPv6 specification from 1995 does
already contain a variety of security considerations (namely, message integrity
protection as well as encryption based on IPsec), privacy aspects have not
played a major role in the beginning.
