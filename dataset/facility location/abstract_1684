The two-flavor color superconductivity is examined over a wide range of
baryon density with a single model. To study the structural change of Cooper
pairs, quark correlation in the color superconductor is calculated both in the
momentum space and in the coordinate space. At extremely high baryon density,
our model becomes equivalent to the usual perturbative QCD treatment and the
gap is shown to have a sharp peak near the Fermi surface due to the
weak-coupling nature of QCD. On the other hand, the gap is a smooth function of
the momentum at lower densities due to strong color magnetic and electric
interactions. The size of the Cooper pair is shown to become comparable to the
averaged inter-quark distance at low densities, which indicates a crossover
from BCS to BEC (Bose-Einstein condensation) of tightly bound Cooper pairs may
take place at low density.
