We present a variety of numerical data supporting the Center Vortex theory of
confinement. A method is introduced for identifying the location of center
vortices, in thermalized gauge-field configurations generated by lattice Monte
Carlo. Fluctuations in the number of such vortices, linked to fundamental
representation Wilson loops, appear to be responsible for the asymptotic string
tension extracted from those loops.
