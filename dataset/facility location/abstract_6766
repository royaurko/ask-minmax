The Double Chooz experiment is meant to search for the neutrino mixing angle
theta13 taking advantage of the neutrinos generated at the nuclear power plant
of Chooz. Double Chooz relies on neutrino flux measurements at two different
locations, the so-called far and near detectors, although the first phase runs
only with the far detector. The commissioning of the far detector started in
January 2011 and first results improving the current limit on theta13 are
expected by the summer 2011. The status of the Double Chooz experiment is
presented.
