While traditional radio stations are subject to extensive government
regulations, Internet radio stations remain largely unregulated. As Internet
radio usage has increased certain stakeholders have begun to argue that these
Internet radio broadcasters are providing significant and diverse programming
to American audiences and that government regulation of spectrum-using radio
station ownership may be further relaxed.
  One of the primary justifications for regulation of ownership has been to
protect diversity in broadcasting. This study hypothesizes that Internet radio
broadcasting does add diversity to the radio broadcasting industry and that it
should be considered as relevant by regulators.
  This study evaluates the role of Internet radio broadcasters according to
five criteria intended to gauge the level of diversity being delivered to
listeners online. By measuring the levels of format, channel, ownership,
location and language diversity among Internet radio stations, it is possible
to draw benchmark lessons about the new medium's ability to provide Americans
with diverse broadcasting options.
  The study finds that Internet radio broadcasters are in fact adding
measurable diversity to the radio broadcasting industry. Internet broadcasters
are providing audiences with access to an increasing number of stations,
owners, formats, and language choices, and it is likely that technologies
aiding in the mobility of access as well as broadband evolution will reinforce
these findings.
