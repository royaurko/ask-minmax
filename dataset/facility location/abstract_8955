Orbits of known extrasolar planets that are located outside the tidal
circularization regions of their parent stars are often substantially
eccentric. By contrast, planetary orbits in our Solar System are approximately
circular, reflecting planet formation within a nearly axisymmetric, circumsolar
disk. We propose that orbital eccentricities may be generated by divergent
orbital migration of two planets in a viscously accreting circumstellar disk.
The migration is divergent in the sense that the ratio of the orbital period of
the outer planet to that of the inner planet grows. As the period ratio
diverges, the planets traverse, but are not captured into, a series of
mean-motion resonances that amplify their orbital eccentricities in rough
inverse proportion to their masses. Strong viscosity gradients in
protoplanetary disks offer a way to reconcile the circular orbits of Solar
System gas giants with the eccentric orbits of currently known extrasolar
planets.
