Some wave features found in the C-ring of Saturn appear to be excited by
resonances with normal mode oscillations of the planet. The waves are found at
locations in the rings where the ratio of orbital to oscillation frequencies is
given by m : m+1 where m is a small integer. I suggest here that it is
plausible that ring waves may also be launched at second order resonances,
where the frequency ratio would be m : m+2. Indeed, otherwise unassociated wave
features are found at such locations in the C-ring. If confirmed the
association of planetary modes with additional C-ring wave features would
measure additional oscillation frequencies of Saturn and improve the utility of
the waves for constraining the internal structure of the planet. Second-order
resonances in general do not lie near first order ring resonance locations and
thus are not the explanation for the apparent frequency splitting of modes.
