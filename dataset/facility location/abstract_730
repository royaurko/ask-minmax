To determine the parameters (masses, orbital period) of a binary, one
requires among others the inclination, which is best determined from a visual
orbit. The next generation of interferometers can provide visual orbits for a
large number of binaries. We then can investigate with what parameters binaries
are born, and how these parameters evolve, and thus understand the galactic
binary population. Results can be obtained quickly by carefully selecting
binaries for the study of evolutionary processes. Full knowledge of properties
of binaries at birth requires a large, dedicated programme, which is best
limited to spectroscopic binaries with primary masses >0.8Msun and orbital
periods <50yr.
