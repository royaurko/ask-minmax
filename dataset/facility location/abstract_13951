Although Type Ia supernovae have been heavily scrutinized due to their use in
making cosmological distance estimates, we are still unable to definitively
identify the progenitors for the entire population. While answers have been
presented for certain specific systems, a complete solution remains elusive. We
present observations of two supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Large Magellanic
Cloud, SNR 0505-67.9 and SNR 0509-68.7, for which we have identified the center
of the remnant and the 99.73% containment central region in which any companion
star left over after the supernova must be located. Both remnants have a number
of potential ex-companion stars near their centers; all possible single and
double degenerate progenitor models remain viable for these two supernovae.
Future observations may be able to identify the true ex-companions for both
remnants.
