Using even-order frequency splitting coefficients of global p-modes it is
possible to infer the magnetic field in the solar interior as a function of
radial distance and latitude. Results obtained using GONG and MDI data are
discussed. While there is some signal of a possible magnetic field in the
convection zone, there is little evidence for any temporal variation of the
magnetic field in the solar interior. Limits on possible magnetic field in the
solar core are also discussed. It is generally believed that the solar dynamo
is located in the tachocline region. Seismic studies do not show any
significant temporal variation in the tachocline region, though a significant
latitudinal variation in the properties of the tachocline are found. There is
some evidence to suggest that the latitudinal variation is not continuous and
the tachocline may consist of two parts.
