Refraction of pulsar radiation by electron density irregularities in the
interstellar medium sometimes produces multiple imaging of pulsars which can
lead to periodic oscillations of intensity in pulsar dynamic spectra records.
Such events can be used as tools to resolve the emission regions in pulsar
magnetospheres. Here we describe results from the recent observation of a
double imaging event for PSR B1133+16, which place fairly tight constraints on
the location of the emission regions. Our analysis constrains the location of
the scattering object to the shell of the Local Bubble. The phase of the
oscillations shows significant variations across the pulse. The minimum value
for the transverse separation of the emitting regions at the two edges of the
pulse is inferred to be 3 x 10^5 m. This translates to a minimum emission
altitude of 2.6 x 10^6 m. The non-monotonic variations of the fringe phase with
pulse longitude are interpreted as variations of the altitude of the emission
regions for the orthogonal polarization modes of this pulsar. This is in
agreement with theories where propagation effects, such as refraction, are
responsible for the orthogonal modes.
