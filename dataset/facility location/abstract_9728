We present the exact solution for a set of nonlinear algebraic equations
$\frac{1}{z_l}= \pi d + \frac{2 d}{n} \sum_{m \neq l} \frac{1}{z_l-z_m}$. These
were encountered by us in a recent study of the low energy spectrum of the
Heisenberg ferromagnetic chain \cite{dhar}. These equations are low $d$
(density) ``degenerations'' of more complicated transcendental equation of
Bethe's Ansatz for a ferromagnet, but are interesting in themselves. They
generalize, through a single parameter, the equations of Stieltjes,
  $x_l = \sum_{m \neq l} 1/(x_l-x_m)$, familiar from Random Matrix theory.
  It is shown that the solutions of these set of equations is given by the
zeros of generalized associated Laguerre polynomials. These zeros are
interesting, since they provide one of the few known cases where the location
is along a nontrivial curve in the complex plane that is determined in this
work.
  Using a ``Green's function'' and a saddle point technique we determine the
asymptotic distribution of zeros.
