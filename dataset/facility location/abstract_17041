The influence of rotational mixing on the global parameters and asteroseismic
properties of red giant stars is reviewed. While red giants are generally
characterised by low surface rotational velocities, they may have been rotating
much more rapidly during the main sequence, so that the rotational history of a
star has a large impact on its properties during the red giant phase. For stars
massive enough to ignite helium burning in non-degenerate conditions,
rotational mixing leads to a significant increase of the stellar luminosity and
shifts the location of the core helium burning phase to a higher luminosity in
the HR diagram. This results in a change of the seismic properties of red
giants and of the fundamental parameters of a red giant star as determined by
performing an asteroseismic calibration. For red giants with a lower mass that
undergo the helium flash, rotational mixing decreases the luminosity of the
bump at solar metallicity changing thereby the global and asteroseismic
properties of these stars.
