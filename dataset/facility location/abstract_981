In this proceeding, we report the recent measurements of the CKM angle
\phi_1(\beta) using large data samples collected by the Belle and BaBar
experiments. The experiments have collected more than 1 billion B anti-B pairs
of data sample at the \Upsilon(4S) resonance using the facilities of the
asymmetric-energy e+e- colliders KEKB and PEP-II.
