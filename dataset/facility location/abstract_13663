We propose a simple probabilistic model to explain the spatial structure of
the rent distribution of housing market in city of Sapporo. Here we modify the
mathematical model proposed by Gauvin et. al. Especially, we consider the
competition between two distances, namely, the distance between house and
center, and the distance between house and office. Computer simulations are
carried out to reveal the self-organized spatial structure appearing in the
rent distribution. We also compare the resulting distribution with empirical
rent distribution in Sapporo as an example of cities designated by ordinance.
We find that the lowest ranking agents (from the viewpoint of the lowest
`willing to pay') are swept away from relatively attractive regions and make
several their own `communities' at low offering price locations in the city.
