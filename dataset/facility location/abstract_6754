One of the first step in the realization of an automatic system of check
recognition is the extraction of the handwritten area. We propose in this paper
an hybrid method to extract these areas. This method is based on digit
recognition by Fourier descriptors and different steps of colored image
processing . It requires the bank recognition of its code which is located in
the check marking band as well as the handwritten color recognition by the
method of difference of histograms. The areas extraction is then carried out by
the use of some mathematical morphology tools.
