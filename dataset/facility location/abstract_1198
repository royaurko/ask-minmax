We study how to search for photon-photon scattering in vacuum at present
petawatt laser facilities such as HERCULES, and test Quantum Electrodynamics
and non-standard models like Born-Infeld theory or scenarios involving
minicharged particles or axion-like bosons. First, we compute the phase shift
that is produced when an ultra-intense laser beam crosses a low power beam, in
the case of arbitrary polarisations. This result is then used in order to
design a complete test of all the parameters appearing in the low energy
effective photonic Lagrangian. In fact, we propose a set of experiments that
can be performed at HERCULES, eventually allowing either to detect
photon-photon scattering as due to new physics, or to set new limits on the
relevant parameters, improving by several orders of magnitude the current
constraints obtained recently by PVLAS collaboration. We also describe a
multi-cross optical mechanism that can further enhance the sensitivity,
enabling HERCULES to detect photon-photon scattering even at a rate as small as
that predicted by QED. Finally, we discuss how these results can be improved at
future exawatt facilities such as ELI, thus providing a new class of precision
tests of the Standard Model and beyond.
