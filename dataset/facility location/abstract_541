We study the scaling regime of nucleon - anti-nucleon annihilation into a
deeply virtual photon and a meson, bar p N -> gamma* pi. We obtain the leading
twist amplitude in the kinematical region where it factorizes into an
antiproton distribution amplitude, a short-distance matrix element related to
nucleon form factor and the long-distance dominated transition distribution
amplitudes which describe the nucleon to meson transition. We give the Q^2
evolution equation for these transition distribution amplitudes. The scaling of
the cross section of this process may be tested at the proposed GSI intense
anti-proton beam facility FAIR with the PANDA or PAX detectors. We comment on
related processes such as pi N -> N' gamma* and gamma* N -> N' pi which may be
experimentally studied at intense meson beams facilities and at JLab or Hermes,
respectively.
