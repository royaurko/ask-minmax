Until recently, the preferred strategy to identify stationary points in the
scalar potential of SO(8)-gauged N=8 supergravity in D=4 has been to consider
truncations of the potential to sub-manifolds of E_{7(+7)}/SU(8) that are
invariant under some postulated residual gauge group G of SO(8). As powerful
alternative strategies have been shown to exist that allow one to go far beyond
what this method can achieve -- and in particular have produced numerous
solutions that break the SO(8) gauge group to no continuous residual symmetry
-- independent verification of results becomes a problem due to both the
complexity of the scalar potential and the large number of new solutions. This
article introduces a conceptually simple self-contained piece of computer code
that allows independent numerical validation of claims on the locations of
newly discovered stationary points.
