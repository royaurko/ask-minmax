The Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation search (MINOS) uses two detectors
separated by 735km to measure a beam of neutrinos created by the Neutrinos at
the Main Injector (NuMI) facility at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The
experiment has recently reported an observation of muon-neutrino disappearance
consistent with neutrino oscillations. We describe the manner in which the
experiment's results depend on the correct understanding and modeling of
hadronic systems.
