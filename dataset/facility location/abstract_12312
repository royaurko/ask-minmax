The most important goal of studying an extensive air shower is to find the
energy, mass and arrival direction of its primary cosmic ray. In order to find
these parameters, the core position and arrival direction of the shower should
be determined. In this paper, a new method for finding core location has been
introduced that utilizes trigger time information of particle detectors. We
have also developed a simple technique to reconstruct the arrival direction.
Our method is not based upon density-sensitive detectors which are sensitive to
the number of crossing particles and is also independent of lateral
distribution models. This model has been developed and examined by the analysis
of simulated shower events generated by the CORSIKA package.
