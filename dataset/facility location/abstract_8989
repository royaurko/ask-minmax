We present images of the Vega system obtained with the IRAM Plateau de Bure
interferometer at 1.3 millimeters wavelength with sub-mJy sensitivity and
$\sim2\farcs5$ resolution (about 20 AU). These observations clearly detect the
stellar photosphere and two dust emission peaks offset from the star by
$9\farcs5$ and $8\farcs0$ to the northeast and southwest, respectively. These
offset emission peaks are consistent with the barely resolved structure visible
in previous submillimeter images, and they account for a large fraction of the
dust emission. The presence of two dust concentrations at the observed
locations is plausibly explained by the dynamical influence of an unseen planet
of a few Jupiter masses in a highly eccentric orbit that traps dust in
principle mean motion resonances.
