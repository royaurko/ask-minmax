We report on the discovery and analysis of 14 short-period variable stars in
the field of the southern globular cluster NGC 3201, located within roughly two
magnitudes on either side of the main-sequence turnoff. 11 of these variable
stars are eclipsing binaries, one is an RR Lyrae, and two are thus far
unclassified systems. Among the eclipsing binary stars, nine are of the W Ursa
Majoris (W UMa) type, one an Algol (EA) system, and one a detached system.
Using spectroscopic follow-up observations as well as analysis of the
variables' locations in the color-magnitude diagram of the cluster, we find
that only one variable star (a W UMa type blue straggler) is actually a member
of NGC 3201. We present the phased photometry lightcurves for all the variable
star systems as well as their locations in the field-of-view and in the
color-magnitude diagram.
