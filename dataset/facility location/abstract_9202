We present the results of stellar photometry of polar-ring galaxies NGC 2685
and NGC 4650A, using the archival data obtained with the Hubble Space
Telescope's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2. Polar rings of these galaxies were
resolved into ~800 and ~430 stellar objects in the B, V and Ic bands,
considerable part of which are blue supergiants located in the young stellar
complexes. The stellar features in the CM-diagrams are best represented by
isochrones with metallicity Z = 0.008. The process of star formation in the
polar rings of both galaxies was continuous and the age of the youngest
detected stars is about 9 Myr for NGC 2685 and 6.5 Myr for NGC 4650A.
