Pursuant to recommendations of the United Nations Conference on the
Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE III) and deliberations
of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNCOPUOS),
annual UN/European Space Agency workshops on basic space science have been held
around the world since 1991. These workshops contributed to the development of
astrophysics and space science, particularly in developing nations. Following a
process of prioritization, the workshops identified the following elements as
particularly important for international cooperation in the field: (i)
operation of astronomical telescope facilities implementing TRIPOD, (ii)
virtual observatories, (iii) astrophysical data systems, (iv) concurrent design
capabilities for the development of international space missions, and (v)
theoretical astrophysics such as applications of nonextensive statistical
mechanics. Beginning in 2005, the workshops focus on preparations for the
International Heliophysical Year 2007 (IHY2007). The workshops continue to
facilitate the establishment of astronomical telescope facilities as pursued by
Japan and the development of low-cost, ground-based, world-wide instrument
arrays as lead by the IHY secretariat.
