We present JHK photometry of Palomar 6. Our photometric measurements range
from the RGB-tip to 2 mag below the RHB and our CMDs show that Palomar~6
appears to have a well-defined RHB population. The distance modulus and
interstellar reddening of the cluster are estimated by comparing the magnitude
and color of Palomar 6 RHB stars with respect to those of 47 Tuc. We obtain
(m-M)_0 = 14.28 mag and E(B-V) = 1.30 mag for the cluster and our study
suggests that Palomar~6 is clearly located in the Galaxy's central regions. We
also discuss the metallicity of the cluster using the slope of the RGB. We
obtain [Fe/H] = -1.2 for Palomar~6 and our metallicity estimate is 0.5 - 1.0
dex lower than previous estimates by others.
