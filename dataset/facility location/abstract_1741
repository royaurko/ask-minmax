Spallation residues produced in 1 GeV per nucleon $^{208}$Pb on proton
reactions have been studied using the FRagment Separator facility at GSI.
Isotopic produc- tion cross-sections of elements from $_{61}$Pm to $_{82}$Pb
have been measured down to 0.1 mb with a high accuracy. The recoil kinetic
energies of the produced fragments were also determined. The obtained
cross-sections agree with most of the few existing gamma-spectroscopy data.
Data are compared with different intra nuclear-cascade and evaporation-fission
models. Drastic deviations were found for a standard code used in technical
applications.
