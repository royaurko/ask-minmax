The recent extensive availability of "big data" platforms calls for a more
widespread adoption by the formal verification community. In fact, formal
verification requires high performance data processing software for extracting
knowledge from the unprecedented amount of data which come from analyzed
systems. Since cloud based computing resources have became easily accessible,
there is an opportunity for verification techniques and tools to undergo a deep
technological transition to exploit the new available architectures. This has
created an increasing interest in parallelizing and distributing verification
techniques. In this paper we introduce a distributed approach which exploits
techniques typically used by the "big data" community to enable verification of
Computation Tree Logic (CTL) formulas on very large state spaces using
distributed systems and cloud computing facilities. The outcome of several
tests performed on benchmark specifications are presented, thus showing the
convenience of the proposed approach.
