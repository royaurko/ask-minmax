Recursive modelling for the kinematics of a 3-PRP planar parallel robot is
presented in this paper. Three planar chains connecting to the moving platform
of the manipulator are located in a vertical plane. Knowing the motion of the
platform, we develop the inverse kinematics and determine the positions,
velocities and accelerations of the robot. Several matrix equations offer
iterative expressions and graphs for the displacements, velocities and
accelerations of three prismatic actuators.
