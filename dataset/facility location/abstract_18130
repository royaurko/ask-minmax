Both theoretical and experimental evidence are presented in this work in
order to validate the existence of an Energy/Frequency Convexity Rule, which
relates energy consumption and microprocessor frequency for nanometer-scale
microprocessors. Data gathered during several month-long experimental
acquisition campaigns, supported by several independent publications, suggest
that energy consumed is indeed depending on the microprocessor's clock
frequency, and, more interestingly, the curve exhibits a clear minimum over the
processor's frequency range. An analytical model for this behavior is presented
and motivated, which fits well with the experimental data. A parameter
sensitivity analysis shows how parameters affect the energy minimum in the
clock frequency space. The conditions are discussed under which this convexity
rule can be exploited, and when other methods are more effective, with the aim
of improving the computer system's energy management efficiency. We show that
the power requirements of the computer system, besides the microprocessor, and
the overhead affect the location of the energy minimum the most. The
sensitivity analysis of the Energy/Frequency Convexity Rule puts forward a
number of simple guidelines especially for by low-power systems, such as
battery-powered and embedded systems, and less likely by high-performance
computer systems.
