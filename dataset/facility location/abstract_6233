Coulomb energy differences between mirror nuclei with $A \le 70$ are
calculated within the framework of the nuclear shell model using an effective
Coulomb plus isovector and isotensor interaction. Absolute binding energies for
proton-rich nuclei are predicted by adding the calculated Coulomb shifts to
experimentally measured binding energies for the neutron-rich mirror. The
location of the proton drip-line is investigated, as well as candidates for the
exotic decay mode known as di-proton emission. Taking into account the
lifetimes of competing decay modes and limits imposed by experimental setups,
it is concluded that the best candidates for the observation of correlated
di-proton emission are $^{45}$Fe, $^{48}$Ni, and $^{63}$Se.
