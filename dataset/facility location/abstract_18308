We have obtained HST-NICMOS observations of five of M31's most metal rich
globular clusters: G1, G170, G174, G177 & G280. For the two clusters farthest
from the nucleus we statistically subtract the field population and estimate
metallicities using K-(J-K) color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). Based on the
slopes of their infrared giant branches we estimate [Fe/H]=-1.22+/-0.43 for G1
and -0.15+/-0.37 for G280. We combine our infrared observations of G1 with two
epochs of optical HST-WFPC2 V-band data and identify at least one LPV based on
color and variability. The location of G1's giant branch in the K-(V-K) CMD is
very similar to that of M107, indicating a higher metallicity than our purely
infrared CMD: [Fe/H]=-0.9+/-0.2.
  For the field surrounding G280, we estimate the metallicity to be -1.3 with a
spread of 0.5 from the slope and width of the giant branch. Based on the
numbers and luminosities of the brightest giants, we conclude that only a small
fraction of the stars in this field could be as young as 2 Gyr, while the
majority have ages closer to 10 Gyr.
  The K-band luminosity functions (LFs) of the upper few magnitudes of G1 and
G280, as well as for the fields surrounding all clusters, are indistinguishable
from the LF measured in the bulge of our Galaxy. This indicates that these
clusters are very similar to Galactic clusters, and at least in the surrounding
fields observed, there are no significant populations of young luminous stars.
