A collaboration between Fermilab and the Institute for High Energy Physics
(IHEP), Beijing, has developed a beam position monitor for the IHEP test beam
facility. This telescope is based on 5 stations of silicon strip detectors
having a pitch of 60 microns. The total active area of each layer of the
detector is about 12x10 cm2. Readout of the strips is provided through the use
of VA1` ASICs mounted on custom hybrid printed circuit boards and interfaced to
Adapter Cards via copper-over-kapton flexible circuits. The Adapter Cards
amplify and level-shift the signal for input to the Fermilab CAPTAN data
acquisition nodes for data readout and channel configuration. These nodes
deliver readout and temperature data from triggered events to an analysis
computer over gigabit Ethernet links.
