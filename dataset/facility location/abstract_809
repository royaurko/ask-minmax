The capabilities of a neutrino factory in the determination of polarized
parton distributions from charged-current deep-inelastic scattering experiments
is discussed. We present a study of the accuracy in the determination of
polarized parton distributions that would be possible with such a facility. We
show that these measurements have the potential to distinguish between
different theoretical scenarios for the proton spin structure.
