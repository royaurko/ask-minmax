We have measured the 4He(e,e'p)3H reaction at missing momenta of 130-300
MeV/c using the three-spectrometer facility at the Mainz microtron MAMI. Data
were taken in perpendicular kinematics to allow us to determine the response
function Rlt and the asymmetry term Atl. The data are compared to both
relativistic and non-relativistic calculations.
