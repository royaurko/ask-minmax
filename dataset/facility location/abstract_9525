The All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) is monitoring all sky to about 14 mag
with a cadence of about 1 day; it has discovered about 10^5 variable stars,
most of them new. The instrument used for the survey had aperture of 7 cm. A
search for planetary transits has lead to the discovery of about a dozen
confirmed planets, so called 'hot Jupiters', providing the information of
planetary masses and radii. Most discoveries were done with telescopes with
aperture of 10 cm.
  We propose a search for optical transients covering all sky with a cadence of
10 - 30 minutes and the limit of 12 - 14 mag, with an instant verification of
all candidate events. The search will be made with a large number of 10 cm
instruments, and the verification will be done with 30 cm instruments.
  We also propose a system to be located at the L_1 point of the Earth - Sun
system to detect 'killer asteroids'. With a limiting magnitude of about 18 mag
it could detect 10 m boulders several hours prior to their impact, provide
warning against Tunguska-like events, as well as to provide news about
spectacular but harmless more modest impacts.
