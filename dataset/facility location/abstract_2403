The decay of $^{19}$O($\beta^-$) and $^{19}$Ne($\beta^+$) implanted in
niobium in its superconducting and metallic phase was measured using purified
radioactive beams produced by the SPIRAL/GANIL facility. Half-lives and
branching ratios measured in the two phases are consistent within one-sigma
error bar. This measurement casts strong doubts on the predicted strong
electron screening in superconductor, the so-called superscreening. The
measured difference in screening potential energy is 110(90) eV for $^{19}$Ne
and 400(320) eV for $^{19}$O. Precise determinations of the half-lives were
obtained for $^{19}$O: 26.476(9) s and $^{19}$Ne: 17.254(5) s.
