We present the first three-dimensional simulations of the evolution of a
microquasar jet inside the binary-star system. The aim is to study the
interaction of these jets with the stellar wind from a massive companion and
the possible locations of high-energy emission sites. We have simulated two
jets with different injection power in order to give a hint on the minimum
power required for the jet to escape the system and become visible in larger
scales. In the setup, we include a massive star wind filling the grid through
which the jet evolves. We show that jets should have powers of the order of
$10^{37}\rm{erg/s}$ or more in order not to be destroyed by the stellar wind.
The jet-wind interaction results in regions in which high energy emission could
be produced. These results imply the possible existence of a population of
X-ray binaries not detected in the radio band due to jet disruption inside the
region dominated by the stellar wind.
