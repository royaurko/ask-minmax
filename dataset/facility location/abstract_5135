In this paper we address the challenging problem of multiple source
localization in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). We develop an efficient
statistical algorithm, based on the novel application of Sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC) sampler methodology, that is able to deal with an unknown number of
sources given quantized data obtained at the fusion center from different
sensors with imperfect wireless channels. We also derive the Posterior
Cram\'er-Rao Bound (PCRB) of the source location estimate. The PCRB is used to
analyze the accuracy of the proposed SMC sampler algorithm and the impact that
quantization has on the accuracy of location estimates of the sources.
Extensive experiments show that the benefits of the proposed scheme in terms of
the accuracy of the estimation method that are required for model selection
(i.e., the number of sources) and the estimation of the source characteristics
compared to the classical importance sampling method.
