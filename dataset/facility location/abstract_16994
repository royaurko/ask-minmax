We discuss the possibility and the description of bound states between $B$
and $\bar{B}^*$ mesons. We argue that the existence of such a bound state can
be deduced from (i) the weakly bound X(3872) state, (ii) certain assumptions
about the short range dynamics of the $D\bar{D}^*$ system and (iii) heavy quark
symmetry. From these assumptions the binding energy of the possible
$B\bar{B}^*$ bound states is determined, first in a theory containing only
contact interactions which serves as a straightforward illustration of the
method, and then the effects of including the one pion exchange potential are
discussed. In this latter case three isoscalar states are predicted: a positive
and negative C-parity $^3S_1-{}^3D_1$ state with a binding energy of $20\,{\rm
MeV}$ and $6\,{\rm MeV}$ below threshold respectively, and a positive C-parity
$^3P_0$ shallow state located almost at the $B\bar{B}^*$ threshold. However,
large uncertainties are generated as a consequence of the $1/m_Q$ corrections
from heavy quark symmetry. Finally, the newly discovered isovector $Z_b(10610)$
state can be easily accommodated within the present framework by a minor
modification of the short range dynamics.
