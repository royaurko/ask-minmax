The supranova model for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has recently gained
popularity. In this scenario the GRB occurs weeks to years after a supernova
explosion, and is located inside a pulsar wind bubble (PWB). High energy
protons from the PWB can interact with photons from the rich radiation field
inside the PWB or collide with cold protons from the supernova remnant,
producing pions which decay into \sim 10-10^3 TeV neutrinos. The predicted
neutrino flux from the PWBs that host the GRBs should be easily detectable by
planned 1 km^2 detectors.
