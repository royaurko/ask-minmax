We present a thorough study of the specific star formation rates for MIPS
24um selected galaxies in the Coma cluster. We build galaxy spectral energy
distributions using optical (u',g',r',i',z'), Near-infrared (J,H,Ks), and Mid
to Far-infrared (IRAC and MIPS) photometry. New and archival spectra confirm
210 cluster members. Subsequently, the total infrared luminosity, galaxy
stellar mass, and specific star formation rate for the members are determined
by measuring best fit templates. Using an array of complementary diagnostics,
we search for contaminating AGN, but find few. We compare obscured star
formation rates to unobscured rates derived from extinction-corrected H-alpha
emission line measurements. The agreement between these two values leads us to
conclude that there is no evidence for an additionally obscured component. In
our spectroscopic sample, complete to 80% for r' < 19.5, we find that all
starbursts are blue and are dwarfs, having masses < 10^9 solar masses.
Examining the location of these starbursts within the cluster, we confirm that
there is a lower fraction in the cluster core.
