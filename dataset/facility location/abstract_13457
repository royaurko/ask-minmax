Singular solutions of the harmonic Einstein evolution equation are
constructed which are related to spatially global and time-local solutions for
a certain class of quasilinear hyperbolic systems of second order. The
constructed singularities of curvature invariants occur generically and are
accessible by g.a.p. curves. The singularities are not strongly censored, and
for strongly asymptotically predictable space-times, they are located in the
causal past of the future null infinity, and are, hence, not shielded by a
black hole. This is an alternative construction of singularities, which may be
applied to other hyperbolic equations such as the Euler equation (cf. [3] for a
different construction method- both of our constructions are fundamentally
different from supercritical blow-up constructions in the Katz-Pavlovic model
or singular solution constructions for heat-flow maps in specific dimensions).
