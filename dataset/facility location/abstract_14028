The interference between optical beams of different polarizations plays a
fundamental role in reproducing the optical analog of the electron spin weak
measurement. The extraordinary point in optical weak measurements is
represented by the possibility to estimate with great accuracy the
Goos-Haenchen (GH) shift by measuring the distance between the peak of the
outgoing beams for two opposite rotation angles of the polarizers located
before and after the dielectric block. Starting from the numerical calculation
of the GH shift, which clearly shows a frequency crossover for incidence near
to the critical angle, we present a detailed study of the interference between
s and p polarized waves in the critical region. This allows to determine in
which conditions it is possible to avoid axial deformations and reproduce the
GH curves. In view of a possible experimental implementation, we give the
expected weak measurement curves for Gaussian lasers of different beam waist
sizes propagating through borosilicate (BK7) and fused silica dielectric
blocks.
