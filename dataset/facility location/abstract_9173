Between 7 March 2002 and 15 June 2002, intensive X-ray observations were
carried out on the extreme BL Lac object H1426+428 with instruments on board
the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). These instruments provide measurements
of H1426+428 in the crucial energy range that characterizes the first peak of
its spectral energy distribution. This peak, which is almost certainly due to
synchrotron emission, has previously been inferred to be in excess of 100 keV.
By taking frequent observations over a four-month campaign, which included
$\sim$450 ksec of RXTE time, studies of flux and spectral variability on
multiple timescales were performed, along with studies of spectral hysteresis.
The 3-24 keV X-ray flux and spectra exhibited significant variability, implying
variability in the location of the first peak of the spectral energy
distribution. Hysteresis patterns were observed, and their characteristics have
been discussed within the context of emission models.
