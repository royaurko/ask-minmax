We obtained R- and I-band CCD photometry of the soft X-ray transient/neutron-
star binary Aql X-1 in 1998 June while it was at quiescence. We find that its
light curve is dominated by ellipsoidal variations, although the ellipsoidal
variations are severely distorted and have unequal maxima. After we correct for
the contaminating flux from a field star located only 0.46" away, the
peak-to-peak amplitude of the modulation is ~0.25 mag in the R band, which
requires the orbital inclination to be greater than 36 degrees. The orbital
period we measure is consistent with the 18.95 h period measured by Chevalier &
Ilovaisky (1998). During its outbursts the light curve of Aql X-1 becomes
single humped. The outburst light curve observed by Garcia et al. (1999) agrees
in phase with our quiescent light curve. We show that the single humped
variation is caused by a ``reflection effect,'' that is, by heating of the side
of the secondary star facing towards the neutron star.
