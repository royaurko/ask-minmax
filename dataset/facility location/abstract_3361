This paper gives results for the spectrum, all allowed E1 radiative partial
widths (and some important M1 widths) and all open-charm strong decay
amplitudes of all 40 c-cbar states expected up to the mass of the 4S multiplet,
just above 4.4 GeV. The spectrum and radiative widths are evaluated using two
models, the relativized Godfrey-Isgur model and a nonrelativistic potential
model. The electromagnetic transitions are evaluated using Coulomb plus linear
plus smeared hyperfine wavefunctions, both in a nonrelativistic potential model
and in the Godfrey-Isgur model. The open-flavor strong decay amplitudes are
determined assuming harmonic oscillator wavefunctions and the 3P0 decay model.
This work is intended to motivate future experimental studies of higher-mass
charmonia, and may be useful for the analysis of high-statistics data sets to
be accumulated by the BES, CLEO and GSI facilities.
