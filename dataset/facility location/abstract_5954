In this letter, elastic properties of highly anisotropic cellular
poly(propylene) films are reported. The material shows peculiar elastic
properties compared to other foams in the literature. The data is displayed as
the relative Young's modulus $E^*/E_s$ versus relative density $\rho^*/\rho_s$.
Almost all the data from the literature are located on the region
$E^*/E_s=(\rho^*/\rho_s)^n$ with $1\le n\le6$. The introduced material on the
other hand have lower relative Young's modulus at high relative densities,
$n\ge6$.
