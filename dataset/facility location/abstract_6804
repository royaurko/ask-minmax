We consider a trapped quasi2D dipolar Bose Einstein condensate (q2D DBEC)
with a polariza- tion tilted into the plane of motion. We show that by tilting
the polarization axis, the coherence properties are anisotropic. Such a system
will have density fluctuations whose amplitude strongly depend on their trap
location relative to the polarization axis. Additionally, interference contrast
will also be anisotropic despite an isotropic density profile. The anisotropy
is related to a roton like mode that becomes unstable and supports local
collapse along the polarization axis.
