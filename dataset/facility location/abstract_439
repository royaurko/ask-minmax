Proton (and ion) cancer therapy has proven to be an extremely effective even
supe-rior method of treatment for some tumors 1-4. A major problem, however,
lies in the cost of the particle accelerator facilities; high procurement costs
severely limit the availability of ion radiation therapy, with only ~26 centers
worldwide. Moreover, high operating costs often prevent economic operation
without state subsidies and have led to a shutdown of existing facilities 5,6.
Laser-accelerated proton and ion beams have long been thought of as a way out
of this dilemma, with the potential to provide the required ion beams at lower
cost and smaller facility footprint 7-14. The biggest challenge has been the
achievement of sufficient particle energy for therapy, in the 150-250 MeV range
for protons 15,16. For the last decade, the maximum exper-imentally observed
energy of laser-accelerated protons has remained at ~60 MeV 17. Here we the
experimental demonstration of laser-accelerated protons to energies exceeding
150 MeV, reaching the therapy window. This was achieved through a dif-ferent
acceleration regime rather than a larger laser, specifically a 150 TW laser
with CH2 nano-targets in the relativistically transparent regime 18,19. We also
demonstrate a clear scaling law with laser intensity based on analytical
theory, computer simulations and experimental validation that will enable
design of a pro-totype system spanning the full range of therapeutically
desirable energies.
