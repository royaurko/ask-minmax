Cao et al. (2013) reported a possible progenitor detection for the type Ib
supernovae iPTF13bvn for the first time. We find that the progenitor is in fact
brighter than the magnitudes previously reported by approximately 0.7 to 0.2
mag with a larger error in the bluer filters. We compare our new magnitudes to
our large set of binary evolution models and find that many binary models with
initial masses in the range of 10 to 20M(Sun) match this new photometry and
other constraints suggested from analysing the supernova. In addition these
lower mass stars retain more helium at the end of the model evolution
indicating that they are likely to be observed as type Ib supernovae rather
than their more massive, Wolf-Rayet counter parts. We are able to rule out
typical Wolf-Rayet models as the progenitor because their ejecta masses are too
high and they do not fit the observed SED unless they have a massive companion
which is the observed source at the supernova location. Therefore only
late-time observations of the location will truly confirm if the progenitor was
a helium giant and not a Wolf-Rayet star.
