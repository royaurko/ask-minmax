The neutrino emission characteristics of the first full-scale
three-dimensional supernova simulations with sophisticated three-flavor
neutrino transport for three models with masses 11.2, 20 and 27 M_sun are
evaluated in detail. All the studied progenitors show the expected
hydrodynamical instabilities in the form of large-scale convective overturn. In
addition, the recently identified LESA phenomenon (lepton-number emission
self-sustained asymmetry) is generic for all our cases. Pronounced SASI
(standing accretion-shock instability) activity appears in the 20 and 27 M_sun
cases, partly in the form of a spiral mode, inducing large but direction and
flavor-dependent modulations of neutrino emission. These modulations can be
clearly identified in the existing IceCube and future Hyper-Kamiokande
detectors, depending on distance and detector location relative to the main
SASI sloshing direction.
