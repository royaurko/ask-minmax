This Resource Letter provides a guide to literature on the Standard Model of
elementary particles and possible extensions. In the successful theory of
quarks and leptons and their interactions, important questions remain, such as
the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking, the origin of quark and lepton
masses, the source of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, and the makeup of
its matter and energy density. References are cited for quarks and leptons,
gauge theories, color and chromodynamics, weak interactions, electroweak
unification, CP violation, dynamics of heavy quarks, Higgs bosons, precision
electroweak measurements, supersymmetry, dynamical electroweak symmetry
breaking, composite quarks and leptons, grand unification and extended gauge
groups, string theories, large extra dimensions, neutrino masses, cosmic
microwave background radiation, dark matter, dark energy, accelerator
facilities, and non-accelerator experiments.
