The present work investigates the structural and dynamical properties of
aNobii\footnote{http://www.anobii.com/}, a social bookmarking system designed
for readers and book lovers. Users of aNobii provide information about their
library, reading interests and geographical location, and they can establish
typed social links to other users. Here, we perform an in-depth analysis of the
system's social network and its interplay with users' profiles. We describe the
relation of geographic and interest-based factors to social linking.
Furthermore, we perform a longitudinal analysis to investigate the interplay of
profile similarity and link creation in the social network, with a focus on
triangle closure. We report a reciprocal causal connection: profile similarity
of users drives the subsequent closure in the social network and, reciprocally,
closure in the social network induces subsequent profile alignment. Access to
the dynamics of the social network also allows us to measure quantitative
indicators of preferential linking.
