We develop a new discrimination procedure for separating electron neutrinos
from muon neutrinos, based on detailed simulations carried out with GEANT3.21
and with mean angular distribution functions and their relative fluctuations.
Using our procedure we are able to discriminate muons from electrons in Fully
Contained Events in Super-Kamioknade Experiment with a probability of error
ofless than several %. Also we have checked geometrical resolution on both
cases, considering only the ring-like structure of the Cherenkov image and a
geometrical reconstruction procedure utilizing the full distribution. Even the
methodologically correct approach we have adopted, we cannot reproduce the
accuracies for particle discrimination, momentum resolution, interaction vertex
location, and angular resolution obtained by the Super-Kamiokande
Collaboration.
