The HENP computing facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory supports both
the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and US involvement in the ATLAS LHC
experiment. The facility includes 150 TBytes of centralized online (disk)
storage, which is served to a processor farm of 2000 CPU's. Multiple levels of
virtualization are used in the deployment of this storage. This allows for a
great deal of flexibility in the maintenance, performance tuning, and expansion
of the resource in a manner which is transparent to it's users. The tools and
strategies employed and the additional functionality achieved will be
discussed.
