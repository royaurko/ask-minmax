We study the galaxy alignment in the sample of very rich Abell clusters
located in and outside superclusters. The statistically significant difference
among investigated samples exists. We found that in contrast to whole sample of
cluster, where alignment increase with the cluster richness, the cluster
belonging to the superclusters does not show this effect. Moreover, the
alignment decreased with the supercluster richness. One should note however
that orientations of galaxies in analyzed clusters are not random, both in the
case when we analyzed whole sample of the clusters and only clusters belonging
to the superclusters. The observed trend, dependence of galaxy alignment on
both cluster location and supercluster richness clearly supports the influence
of environmental effects to the origin of galaxy angular momenta.
