Along with the running of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) located at CERN in
November 2009, a large number of data samples of $B_c$ meson have been
collected and some hadronic $B_c$ decay modes have been measured by the LHC
experiments. In view of the special and important roles of $B_c$ meson decays
playing in the heavy flavor sector, we here give a short review on the status
of two body hadronic decays $B_c \to M_1 M_2$ at both experimental and
theoretical aspects. For the theoretical progresses, specifically, we will show
lots of theoretical studies on two body hadronic $B_c$ decays involving
pseudoscalar, vector, scalar, axial-vector, even tensor meson(s) in the final
states by employing the perturbative QCD (pQCD) factorization approach. We will
present a general analysis about the two-body hadronic decays of the heavy
$B_c$ meson and also provide some expectations for the future developments.
