Activation of the surroundings of an accelerator must be quantified and those
data provided to the official agencies. This is a necessary step in obtaining
the contributorization to operate such an accelerator. SwissFEL, being a fourth
generation light source, will produce more accelerated charges, which are
dumped or lost, than conventional third generation light source, such as the
Swiss Light Source. We have simulated the propagation of a dark current beam
produced in the photoelectron gun using tracking codes like ASTRA and Elegant
for the current layout of SwissFEL. Experimental studies have been carried out
at the SwissFEL test facilities at PSI (C-Band RF Stand and SwissFEL Injector
Test Facility), in order to provide necessary input data for detailed study of
components (RF gun and C-band RF structures) using the simulation code OPAL. A
summary of these studies are presented.
