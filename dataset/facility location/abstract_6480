The Inner Tracking System (ITS) is the detector of the ALICE central barrel
located closest to the beam axis and it is therefore a key detector for
tracking and vertexing performance. Here, the main results from the ITS
commissioning with atmospheric muons in 2008 are presented, focusing in
particular on the detector operation and calibration and on the methods
developed for the alignment of the ITS detectors using reconstructed tracks.
