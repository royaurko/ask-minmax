Blazars are the most plentiful gamma-ray source at GeV energies, and despite
detailed study, there is much that is not known about these sources. In this
review I explore some recent results on blazars, including the controversy of
the "blazar sequence", the curvature in the LAT spectra, and the location along
the jet of the gamma-ray emitting region. I conclude with a discussion of
alternative modeling possibilities.
