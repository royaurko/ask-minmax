The goal of this paper is to contribute to the field of nondestructive
testing by eddy currents. We provide a mathematical analysis and a numerical
framework for simulating the imaging of arbitrarily shaped small volume
conductive inclusions from electromagnetic induction data. We derive, with
proof, a small-volume expansion of the eddy current data measured away from the
conductive inclusion. The formula involves two polarization tensors: one
associated with the magnetic contrast and the second with the conductivity of
the inclusion. Based on this new formula, we design a location search
algorithm. We include in this paper a discussion on data sampling, noise
reduction, and on probability of detection. We provide numerical examples that
support our findings.
