The elastic scattering of the radioactive halo nucleus 6He on 27Al target was
measured at four energies close to the Coulomb barrier using the RIBRAS
(Radioactive Ion Beams in Brazil) facility. The Sao Paulo Potential(SPP) was
used and its diffuseness and imaginary strength were adjusted to fit the
elastic scattering angular distributions. Reaction cross-sections were
extracted from the optical model fits. The reduced reaction cross-sections of
6He on 27Al are similar to those for stable, weakly bound projectiles as
{6,7}Li, 9Be and larger than stable, tightly bound projectile as 16O on 27Al.
