This paper presents a technique for reducing speckle in Polarimetric
Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) imagery using Nonlocal Means and a
statistical test based on stochastic divergences. The main objective is to
select homogeneous pixels in the filtering area through statistical tests
between distributions. This proposal uses the complex Wishart model to describe
PolSAR data, but the technique can be extended to other models. The weights of
the location-variant linear filter are function of the p-values of tests which
verify the hypothesis that two samples come from the same distribution and,
therefore, can be used to compute a local mean. The test stems from the family
of (h-phi) divergences which originated in Information Theory. This novel
technique was compared with the Boxcar, Refined Lee and IDAN filters. Image
quality assessment methods on simulated and real data are employed to validate
the performance of this approach. We show that the proposed filter also
enhances the polarimetric entropy and preserves the scattering information of
the targets.
