IceCube is a one-gigaton instrument located at the geographic South Pole,
designed to detect cosmic neutrinos, iden- tify the particle nature of dark
matter, and study high-energy neutrinos themselves. Simulation of the IceCube
detector and processing of data require a significant amount of computational
resources. IceProd is a distributed management system based on Python, XML-RPC
and GridFTP. It is driven by a central database in order to coordinate and
admin- ister production of simulations and processing of data produced by the
IceCube detector. IceProd runs as a separate layer on top of other middleware
and can take advantage of a variety of computing resources, including grids and
batch systems such as CREAM, Condor, and PBS. This is accomplished by a set of
dedicated daemons that process job submission in a coordinated fashion through
the use of middleware plugins that serve to abstract the details of job
submission and job management from the framework.
