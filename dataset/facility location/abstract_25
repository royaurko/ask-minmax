The Pierre Auger Observatory in Malarg\"ue, Argentina, is designed to study
the properties of ultra-high energy cosmic rays with energies above 1018 eV. It
is a hybrid facility that employs a Fluorescence Detector to perform nearly
calorimetric measurements of Extensive Air Shower energies. To obtain reliable
calorimetric information from the FD, the atmospheric conditions at the
observatory need to be continuously monitored during data acquisition. In
particular, light attenuation due to aerosols is an important atmospheric
correction. The aerosol concentration is highly variable, so that the aerosol
attenuation needs to be evaluated hourly. We use light from the Central Laser
Facility, located near the center of the observatory site, having an optical
signature comparable to that of the highest energy showers detected by the FD.
This paper presents two procedures developed to retrieve the aerosol
attenuation of fluorescence light from CLF laser shots. Cross checks between
the two methods demonstrate that results from both analyses are compatible, and
that the uncertainties are well understood. The measurements of the aerosol
attenuation provided by the two procedures are currently used at the Pierre
Auger Observatory to reconstruct air shower data.
