Objectives - The contributors' aim was to investigate the representations, wishes,
and fears of family caregivers (FCs) regarding 14 innovative technologies (IT)
for care aiding and burden alleviation, given the severe physical and
psychological stress induced by dementia care, and the very slow uptake of
these technologies in our society. Methods - A cluster sample survey based on a
self-administered questionnaire was carried out on data collected from 270
families of patients with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders, located in
the greater Paris area. Multiple Correspondence Analysis was used in addition
to usual statistical tests to identify homogenous FCs clusters concerning the
appreciation or rejection of the considered technologies. Results - Two
opposite clusters were clearly defined: FCs in favor of a substantial use of
technology, and those rather or totally hostile. Furthermore the distributions
of almost all the answers of appreciations were U shaped. Significant relations
were demonstrated between IT appreciation and FC's family or gender statuses
(e.g., female FCs appreciated more than male FCs a tracking device for quick
recovering of wandering patients: p=0.0025, N=195). Conclusions - The study
provides further evidence of the contrasted perception of technology in
dementia care at home, and suggests the development of public debates based on
rigorous assessment of practices and a strict ethical aim to protect against
misuse.
