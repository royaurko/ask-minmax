The ATLAS pixel detector is a high precision silicon tracking device located
closest to the LHC interaction point. It belongs to the first generation of its
kind in a hadron collider experiment. It will provide crucial pattern
recognition information and will largely determine the ability of ATLAS to
precisely track particle trajectories and find secondary vertices. It was the
last detector to be installed in ATLAS in June 2007, has been fully connected
and tested in-situ during spring and summer 2008. It is currently in a
commissioning phase using cosmic-ray events. We present the highlights of the
past and future commissioning activities of the ATLAS pixel system.
