Four Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs) have now been identified with certainty, and
a fifth has possibly been detected. I will review their X-ray and gamma-ray
properties in both outburst and quiescence. The magnetar model accounts fairly
well for the observations of SGR1806-20 and SGR1900+14, but data are still
lacking for SGR1627-41 and SGR0525-66. The locations of the SGRs with respect
to their supernova remnants suggest that they are high velocity objects.
