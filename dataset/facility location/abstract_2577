This work reports high quality NIR spectra, and their respective
interpretations, for eight Vp type asteroids, as defined by Carvano et al.
(2010), that were observed at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on January
14, 2013 UT. They include (3867) Shiretoko, (5235) Jean-Loup, (5560) Amytis,
(6331) 1992 FZ1, (6976) Kanatsu, (17469) 1991 BT, (29796) 1999 CW77, and
(30872) 1992 EM17. All eight asteroids exhibit the broad 0.9 and 1.9 micron
mineral absorption features indicative of pyroxene on each asteroid's surface.
Data reduction and analysis via multiple techniques produced consistent results
for the derived spectral absorption band centers and average pyroxene surface
chemistries for all eight asteroids (Reddy et al., 2012; Lindsay et al.,
2013,2014; Gaffey et al., 2002; Burbine et al., 2009). (3867) Shiretoko is most
consistent with the eucrite meteorites while the remaining seven asteroids are
most consistent with the howardite meteorites. The existing evidence suggests
that all eight of these Vp type asteroids are genetic Vestoids that probably
originated from Vesta's surface.
