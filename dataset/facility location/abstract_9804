We analyze the thermal transport properties of the Falicov-Kimball model
concentrating on locating regions of parameter space where the thermoelectric
figure-of-merit ZT is large. We focus on high temperature for power generation
applications and low temperature for cooling applications. We constrain the
static particles (ions) to have a fixed concentration, and vary the conduction
electron concentration as in the binary-alloy picture of the Falicov-Kimball
model. We find a large region of parameter space with ZT>1 at high temperature
and we find a small region of parameter space with ZT>1 at low temperature for
correlated systems, but we believe inclusion of the lattice thermal
conductivity will greatly reduce the low-temperature figure-of-merit.
