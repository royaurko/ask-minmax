A static and circularly symmetric lens characterized by mass and scalar
charge parameters is constructed. For the small values of the scalar charge to
the mass ratio, the gravitational lensing is qualitatively similar to the case
of the Schwarzschild lens; however, for large values of this ratio the lensing
characteristics are significantly different. The main features are the
existence of two or nil Einstein ring(s) and a radial critical curve, formation
of two or four images and possibility of detecting three images near the lens
for sources located at relatively large angular positions. Such a novel lens
may also be treated as a naked singularity lens.
