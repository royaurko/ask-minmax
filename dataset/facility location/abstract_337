This chapter provides an overview of the basic requirements for ion sources
designed and operated in radioactive ion beam facilities. The facilities where
these sources are operated exploit the isotope separation online (ISOL)
technique, in which a target is combined with an ion source to maximize the
secondary beam intensity and chemical element selectivity. Three main classes
of sources are operated, namely surface-type ion sources, arc discharge-type
ion sources, and finally radio-frequency-heated plasma-type ion sources.
