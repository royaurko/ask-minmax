Copious production of microscopic black holes is one of the least
model-dependent predictions of TeV-scale gravity scenarios. We review the
arguments behind this assertion and discuss opportunities to track the striking
associated signatures in the near future. These include searches at neutrino
telescopes, such as AMANDA and RICE, at cosmic ray air shower facilities, such
as the Pierre Auger Observatory, and at colliders, such as the Large Hadron
Collider.
