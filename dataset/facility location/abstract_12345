Due to an excellent mass resolution and a large amount of available data, the
CDF experiment, located at the Tevatron proton-antiproton accelerator, allows
the precise measurement of spectroscopic properties, like mass and decay width,
of a variety of states. This was exploited to examine the first orbital
excitations of the Lambda_c baryon, the resonances Lambda_c(2595) and
Lambda_c(2625), in the decay channel Lambda_c^+ pi^+ pi^-, as well as the
Lambda_c spin excitations Sigma_c(2455) and Sigma_c(2520) in its decays to
Lambda_c^+ pi^- and Lambda_c^+ pi^+ final states in a data sample corresponding
to an integrated luminosity of 5.2 invfb. We present measurements of the mass
differences with respect to the Lambda_c and the decay widths of these states,
using significantly higher statistics than previous experiments.
