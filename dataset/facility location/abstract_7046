We extend the results of Arguin et al and A\"\i{}d\'ekon et al on the
convergence of the extremal process of branching Brownian motion by adding an
extra dimension that encodes the "location" of the particle in the underlying
Galton-Watson tree. We show that the limit is a cluster point process on
$\mathbb{R}_+\times \mathbb{R}$ where each cluster is the atom of a Poisson
point process on $\mathbb{R}_+\times \mathbb{R}$ with a random intensity
measure $Z(dz) \times Ce^{-\sqrt 2x}$, where the random measure is explicitly
constructed from the derivative martingale. This work is motivated by an
analogous conjecture for the Gaussian free field by Biskup and Louidor.
