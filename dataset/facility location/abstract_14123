We study the X-ray emission from five symbiotic stars observed with Suzaku.
These objects were selected for deeper observations with Suzaku after their
first detection with ROSAT and Swift. We found that the X-ray spectra can be
adequately fit with absorbed optically thin thermal plasma models, either
single or multi-temperature. Such a model is compatible with the X-ray emission
being originated in the innermost region of the accretion disk, i.e. a boundary
layer. Based on the large flickering amplitude (only detected in 4 Dra), the
high plasma temperature and previous measurements of UV variability and
luminosity, we conclude that all five sources are accretion-powered through
predominantly opticall thick boundary layer.
  Given the time lapse between previous and these observations, we were able to
study the long term variability of their X-ray emission and found that the
intrinsic X-ray flux and the intervening absorption column can vary by factors
of three or more. However, it is still elusive the location of the absorber and
how the changes in the accretion rate and absorption are related.
