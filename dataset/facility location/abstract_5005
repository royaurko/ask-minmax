In this paper, we present a simple yet fast and robust algorithm which
exploits the spatio-temporal context for visual tracking. Our approach
formulates the spatio-temporal relationships between the object of interest and
its local context based on a Bayesian framework, which models the statistical
correlation between the low-level features (i.e., image intensity and position)
from the target and its surrounding regions. The tracking problem is posed by
computing a confidence map, and obtaining the best target location by
maximizing an object location likelihood function. The Fast Fourier Transform
is adopted for fast learning and detection in this work. Implemented in MATLAB
without code optimization, the proposed tracker runs at 350 frames per second
on an i7 machine. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed
algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods in terms of
efficiency, accuracy and robustness.
