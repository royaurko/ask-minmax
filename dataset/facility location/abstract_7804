Fast multiple change-point segmentation methods, which additionally provide
faithful statistical statements on the number, locations and sizes of the
segments, have recently received great attention. In this paper, we propose a
multiscale segmentation method, FDRSeg, which controls the false discovery rate
(FDR) in the sense that the number of false jumps is bounded linearly by the
number of true jumps. In this way, it adapts the detection power to the number
of true jumps. We prove a non-asymptotic upper bound for its FDR in a Gaussian
setting, which allows to calibrate the only parameter of FDRSeg properly.
Change-point locations, as well as the signal, are shown to be estimated in a
uniform sense at optimal minimax convergence rates up to a log-factor. The
latter is w.r.t. $L^p$-risk, $p \ge 1$, over classes of step functions with
bounded jump sizes and either bounded, or possibly increasing, number of
change-points. FDRSeg can be efficiently computed by an accelerated dynamic
program; its computational complexity is shown to be linear in the number of
observations when there are many change-points. The performance of the proposed
method is examined by comparisons with some state of the art methods on both
simulated and real datasets. An R-package is available online.
