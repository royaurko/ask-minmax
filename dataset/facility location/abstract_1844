The Pohang Accelerator Laboratory operates an electron linac for the pulsed
neutron source as one of the long-term nuclear R&D programs at the Korea Atomic
Energy Research Institute. The designed beam parameters are as follows; The
nominal beam energy is 100 MeV, the maximum beam power is 10 kW, and the beam
current is varied from 300 mA to 5A depends on the pulse repetition. The linac
has two operating modes: one for short pulse modes with the various repetitions
between 2 ns and 100 ns and the other for long pulse modes with 1 ms
repetition. We have constructed and tested an electron linac based on the
existing equipment such as a SLAC-5045 klystron, two constant gradient
accelerating sections, and a thermionic RF-gun. We present the characteristics
of the linac and report the status of the pulsed neutron source facilities
include a target system and time-of-flight paths.
