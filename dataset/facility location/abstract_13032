Document segmentation is a method of rending the document into distinct
regions. A document is an assortment of information and a standard mode of
conveying information to others. Pursuance of data from documents involves ton
of human effort, time intense and might severely prohibit the usage of data
systems. So, automatic information pursuance from the document has become a big
issue. It is been shown that document segmentation will facilitate to beat such
problems. This paper proposes a new approach to segment and classify the
document regions as text, image, drawings and table. Document image is divided
into blocks using Run length smearing rule and features are extracted from
every blocks. Discipulus tool has been used to construct the Genetic
programming based classifier model and located 97.5% classification accuracy.
