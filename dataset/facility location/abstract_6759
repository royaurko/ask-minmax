A novel hybrid Monte Carlo transport scheme is demonstrated in a scene with
solar illumination, scattering and absorbing 2D atmosphere, a textured
reflecting mountain, and a small detector located in the sky (mounted on a
satellite or a airplane). It uses a deterministic approximation of an adjoint
transport solution to reduce variance, computed quickly by ignoring atmospheric
interactions. This allows significant variance and computational cost
reductions when the atmospheric scattering and absorption coefficient are
small. When combined with an atmospheric photon-redirection scheme, significant
variance reduction (equivalently acceleration) is achieved in the presence of
atmospheric interactions.
