Recent studies on the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G344.7-0.1 have
commonly claimed its origin to be a core-collapse supernova (SN) explosion,
based on its highly asymmetric morphology and/or proximity to a star forming
region. In this paper, however, we present an X-ray spectroscopic study of this
SNR using Suzaku, which is supportive of a Type Ia origin. Strong K-shell
emission from lowly ionized Fe has clearly been detected, and its origin is
determined, for the first time, to be the Fe-rich SN ejecta. The abundance
pattern is highly consistent with that expected for a somewhat-evolved Type Ia
SNR. It is suggested, therefore, that the X-ray point-like source CXOU
J170357.8-414302 located at the SNR's geometrical center is not associated with
the SNR but is likely to be a foreground object. Our result further indicates
that G344.7-0.1 is the first possible Type Ia SNR categorized as a member of
the so-called "mixed-morphology" class. In addition, we have detected emission
from He-like Al at ~1.6 keV, the first clear detection of this element in the
spectrum of an extended X-ray source. The possible enhancement of the Al/Mg
abundance ratio from the solar value suggests that the ambient interstellar
medium has a relatively high metallicity (not less than 10% of the solar
value), if this SNR has indeed a Type Ia origin. We also report marginal
detection of Cr and Mn, although the measured fluxes have large statistical and
systematic uncertainties.
