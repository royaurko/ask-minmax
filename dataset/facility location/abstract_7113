This paper attempts to situate statistics in relation to qualitative research
methods and other means of "finding out". It compares and contrasts aspects of
qualitative research methods and statistical inquiry and attempts to answer the
question of whether and how elements of qualitative research methods should be
included in statistics teaching.
