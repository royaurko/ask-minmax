High resolution observations of Sgr A* have revealed a wide variety of
phenomena, ranging from intense rapid flares to quasi-periodic oscillations,
making this object an ideal system to study the properties of low luminosity
accreting black holes. In this paper, we use a pseudo-spectral algorithm to
construct and evolve a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model of the
accretion disk in Sgr A*. Assuming a hybrid thermal-nonthermal emission scheme,
we show that the MHD turbulence can by itself only produce factor of two
fluctuations in luminosity. These amplitudes in variation cannot explain the
magnitude of flares observed in this system. However, we also demonstrate that
density perturbations in the disk do produce outbursts qualitatively similar to
those observed by XMM-Newton in X-rays and ground-based facilities in the near
infrared. Quasi-periodic oscillations emerge naturally in the simulated
lightcurves. We attribute these to non-axisymmetric density perturbations that
emerge as the disk evolves back toward its quiescent state.
