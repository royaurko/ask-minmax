We have shown that the Unruh quantization scheme can be realized in Minkowski
spacetime in the presence of Bose-Einstein condensate containing infinite
average number of particles in the zero boost mode and located basically inside
the light cone. Unlike the case of an empty Minkowski spacetime the condensate
provides the boundary conditions necessary for the Fulling quantization of the
part of the field restricted only to the Rindler wedge of Minkowski spacetime.
