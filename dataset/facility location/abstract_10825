The influence of the atomic-scale inhomogeneities of the pairing interaction
on the superconducting order parameter distribution and the LDOS is studied in
the framework of mean-field BCS theory for two-dimensional lattice model. It is
found that the ratio of the local low-temperature gap in differential
conductance to the local temperature of vanishing the gap $2\Delta_g/T_p$ can
take large enough values compared to the homogeneous case. This ratio
practically does not depend on the location in the sample and is independent on
the concentration of local pair interaction perturbations in wide range of
concentrations. The obtained results could bear a relation to the recent
measurements by Gomes {\it et. al} Nature, 447, 569 (2007).
