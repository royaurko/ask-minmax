The Penning trap mass spectrometer JYFLTRAP, coupled to the Ion-Guide Isotope
Separator On-Line (IGISOL) facility at Jyvaskyla, was employed to measure the
atomic masses of neutron rich 85 to 92Br and 94 to 97Rb isotopes with a typical
accuracy less than 10 keV. Discrepancies with the older data are discussed.
Comparison to different mass models is presented. Details of nuclear structure,
shell and subshell closures are investigated by studying the two-neutron
separation energy and the shell gap energy.
