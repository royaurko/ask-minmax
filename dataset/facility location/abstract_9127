We have used the BeppoSAX satellite to study the broad band (0.5-100 keV)
X-ray spectrum of the Seyfert 1.5 galaxy MKN6. The source is characterized by a
power law of Gamma=1.7 [+0.08, -0.07] and there is no strong evidence for
either a reflection bump or a high energy cut-off. We have detected a narrow
iron line at 6.4 keV (rest frame) with an equivalent width of 98 [+33, -35] eV.
MKN6 also exhibits strong and complex absorption. At least two components (NH_1
=1.34 [+0.4,-0.4] x 10^(22) cm^(-2) and NH_2 = 4.18 [+2.2, -1.3] x 10^(22)
cm^(-2)) are present and they both partially cover the source with covering
fractions of ~90% and ~50% respectively. Comparison with a previous ASCA
observation indicates that in both absorbing columns the NH is variable over a
2 year timescale, while the covering fractions are constant over the same
amount of time. The state of each absorber is cold or mildly photoionized. The
Broad Line Region (BLR) is suggested as the possible location for this complex
absorption.
