The PINTEX facility at the IUCF Cooler ring, dedicated to the study of spin
dependence in nucleon-nucleon interactions, has been used to measure
polarization observables of the reaction pp -> pp pi0 at beam energies between
325 and 400 MeV. The stored polarized proton beam had spin projections both in
the longitudinal and the transverse directions with respect to the beam
momentum. We report here on the measurements of the relative transverse and
longitudinal spin-dependent cross sections, deltasigma_T/sigma_tot and
deltasigma_L/sigma_tot, and how from these observables the initial spin singlet
and triplet cross sections are obtained. Considering angular momentum states
less or equal to one, the contribution of the Ps partial waves to the cross
section can be extracted.
