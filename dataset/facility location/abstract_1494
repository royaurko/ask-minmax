We present results from a study of two luminous IRAS sources thought to be
young massive star-forming regions and which have no previously detected radio
continuum emission: IRAS 15596-5301 and IRAS 16272-4837. Our study incorporates
sensitive ATCA radio continuum data, SEST 1.2-mm continuum (using the new SIMBA
bolometer) and line data, as well as data taken from the MSX database. The
results show that both sources are associated with dense molecular cores which
appear to host recently formed massive stars. We argue that IRAS16272 is in a
very early stage of evolution, prior to the formation of an ultra compact HII
region and that IRAS15596 is in a more advanced stage and hosts a cluster of
B-type stars.
