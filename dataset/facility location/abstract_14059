We conducted a continuous survey of infrared and visual images of 18020 2MFGC
galaxies which were selected on an automatic basis from 1.64 mln extended
objects of the 2MASS XSC catalog based on the ratio of the infrared axes
a/b>=3. This work aims to exclude "false" objects from the list of flat
galaxies. Having observed more than 80 thousand images in different filters, we
were able to detect 1512 such objects (8.4% of the total number). We found 23
galaxies duplicated in 2MASS, which have two 2MFGC numbers correspondingly, and
three flat galaxies which are not included in other catalogs and are located
close to three "false" galaxies. Galaxies with magnitudes fainter than K_s =13
mag compose the main part of the excluded objects. They show small angular
sizes, low surface brightnesses and concentration ratios. The results of the
work in the form of the 2MFGC table with notes are given in the astronomical
databases VizieR, NED, HyperLeda.
