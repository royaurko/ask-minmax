We study large-distance contributions to the nucleon parton densities in the
transverse coordinate (impact parameter) representation based on generalized
parton distributions (GPDs). Chiral dynamics generates a distinct component of
the partonic structure, located at momentum fractions x ~< M_pi/M_N and
transverse distances b ~ 1/M_pi. We analyze the phenomenological "pion cloud"
model of the flavor asymmetry dbar(x) - ubar(x) and quantify what fraction of
the calculated asymmetry results from the universal large-distance region. Our
findings indicate that a two-component picture of the nucleon's partonic
structure, with a "core" antiquark distribution at b < b_core ~= 0.55 fm which
vanishes at x -> 0 and the universal large-distance pion cloud, could naturally
account for the x-dependence of the measured asymmetry.
