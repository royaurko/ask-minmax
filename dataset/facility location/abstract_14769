Motivated by the various examples of spatial variability in the power of the
acoustic spectrum, we attempted to look for spatial variability in the peak
frequency of the spectrum. However, the determination of this peak frequency on
a spatial scale of a single pixel (8 arc seconds for the GONG data) is limited
by the stochastic variations in the power spectrum presumably caused by the
stochastic nature of the excitation process. Averaging over a large number of
spectra (100 spectra from a 10 $\times$ 10 pixels area) produced stabler
spectra. The peak frequencies of 130 such locations were found to be
distributed with a FWHM of about 130 $\mu$Hz. A map of the spatial variation of
this peak frequency did not show any strong feature with statistically
significant deviation from the mean of the distribution. Likewise, the scatter
in the peak frequencies masked the detection of magnetic field induced changes
in the peak frequency. On a much larger scale, the N latitudes showed a
slightly lower value of the peak frequency as compared to the S latitudes,
although the difference (25 $\mu$Hz) is barely larger than the {\it rms} spread
(20 $\mu$Hz).
