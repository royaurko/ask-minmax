We propose a new version of the spatial model of voting. Platforms of five
parties are evolving in a two-dimensional landscape of political issues so as
to get maximal numbers of voters. For a Gaussian landscape the evolution leads
to a spatially symmetric state, where the platform centers form a pentagon
around the Gaussian peak. For a bimodal landscape the platforms located at
different peaks get different numbers of voters.
