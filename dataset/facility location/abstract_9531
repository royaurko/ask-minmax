We provide elements for a discussion of the expected neutrino signal from
Supernova Remnants (SNR) in the Milky Way. After recalling why SNR are
interesting and certain remarkable achievements of H.E.S.S., we describe a
simple and straightforward method to evaluate the neutrino fluxes from
gamma-ray data. For an ideal detector (=unit efficiency above the threshold),
we get a flux of 5 thoroughgoing muons per km square per year from RX
J1713.7-3946 in ANTARES location and above a threshold of E(th)=50 GeV; similar
calculations for Vela Jr show that the number of events, to be evaluated
precisely after the next detailed observations of H.E.S.S., are larger. We
comment on the role of neutrino oscillations.
