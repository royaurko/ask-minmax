Galactic very high energy (VHE, > 100 GeV) gamma ray sources in the inner
Galaxy H.E.S.S. survey tend to cluster within 1 degree in latitude around the
Galactic plane. HESS J1507-622 instead is unique, since it is located at
latitude of ~3.5 degrees. HESS J1507-622 is slightly extended over the PSF of
the instrument and hence its Galactic origin is clear. The search for
counterparts in other wavelength regimes (radio, infrared and X-rays) failed to
show any plausible counterparts; and given its position off the Galactic plane
and hence the absorption almost one order of magnitude lower, it is very
surprising to not see any counterparts especially at X-rays wavelengths (by
ROSAT, XMM Newton and Chandra). Its latitude implies that it is either rather
close, within about 1 kpc, or is located well off the Galactic plane. And also
the models reflect the uniqueness of this object: a leptonic PWN scenario would
place this source due to its quite small extension to multi-kpc distance
whereas a hadronic scenario would preferentially locate this object at
distances of < 1 kpc where the density of target material is higher.
