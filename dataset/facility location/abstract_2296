NbSe3 exhibits remarkable anisotropy in most of its physical properties and
has been a model system for studies of quasi-one-dimensional
charge-density-wave (CDW) phenomena. Herein, we report the synthesis,
characterization, and electrical transport of single-crystalline NbSe3
nanoribbons by a facile one-step vapour transport process involving the
transport of selenium powder onto a niobium foil substrate. Our investigations
aid the understanding of the CDW nature of NbSe3 and the growth process of the
material. They also indicate that NbSe3 nanoribbons have enhanced CDW
properties compared to those of the bulk phase due to size confinement effects,
thus expanding the search for new mesoscopic phenomena at the nanoscale level.
Single nanoribbon measurements on the electrical resistance as a function of
temperature show charge-density wave transitions at 59 K and 141 K. We also
demonstrate significant enhancement in the depinning effect and sliding regimes
mainly attributed to finite size effects.
