Precision studies of the reaction $^{3}$He(e,e$^\prime$p) using the
three-spectrometer facility at the Mainz microtron MAMI are presented. All data
are for quasielastic kinematics at $|\vec{q} | =685$ MeV/c. Absolute cross
sections were measured at three electron kinematics. For the measured missing
momenta range from 10 to 165 MeV/c, no strength is observed for missing
energies higher than 20 MeV. Distorted momentum distributions were extracted
for the two-body breakup and the continuum. The longitudinal and transverse
behavior was studied by measuring the cross section for three photon
polarizations. The longitudinal and transverse nature of the cross sections is
well described by a currently accepted and widely used prescription of the
off-shell electron-nucleon cross-section. The results are compared to modern
three-body calculations and to previous data.
