We show that in small and low density systems described by a lattice gas
model with fixed number of particles the location of a thermodynamic phase
transition can be detected by means of the distribution of the fluctuations
related to an order parameter which is chosen to be the size of the largest
fragment. We show the correlation between the size of the system and the
observed order of the transition. We discuss the implications of this
correlation on the analysis of experimental fragmentation data.
