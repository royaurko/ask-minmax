We calculate accurately the number of solar neutrino events expected as a
function of solar zenith angle, with and without neutrino oscillations, for
detectors at the locations of Super-Kamiokande, SNO, and the Gran Sasso
National Laboratory. Using different earth models to estimate geophysical
uncertainties, and different solar models to estimate solar uncertainties, we
evaluate distortions predicted by the MSW effect in the zenith angle
distributions of solar neutrino events. The distortions are caused by
oscillations and by $\nu-e$ interactions in the earth that regenerate $\nu_e$
from $\nu_\mu$ or $\nu_\tau$. We show that the first two moments of the
zenith-angle distribution are more sensitive to the small mixing angle MSW
solution than the conventionally studied day-night asymmetry. We present
iso-sigma contours that illustrate the potential of Super-Kamiokande, SNO,
BOREXINO, ICARUS and HERON/HELLAZ for detecting the earth regeneration effect
at their actual locations (and at the equator). MSW solutions favored by the
four pioneering solar neutrino experiments predict characteristic distortions
for Super-Kamiokande, SNO, BOREXINO, and ICARUS that range from being
unmeasurably small to $> 5\sigma$ (stat) after only a few years of
observations.
