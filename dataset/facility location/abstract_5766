It is shown that Einstein-Rosen bridges (wormholes) hypothetical objects that
topologically connect separate locations in the Universe can be static
solutions of the Einstein equations. The corresponding equations for bridges
are reduced to a form convenient for their analysis and numerical solution. The
matter forming the bridge must have a sufficiently hard and anisotropic
equation of state. Our results are compared with a previously known analytic
solution for a bridge, which is a special case of the general solution in the
framework of general relativity. The deflection of photons by the bridge
(gravitational lensing) is studied.
