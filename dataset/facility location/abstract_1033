We present the VOEventNet infrastructure for large-scale rapid follow-up of
astronomical events, including selection, annotation, machine intelligence, and
coordination of observations. The VOEvent standard is central to this vision,
with distributed and replicated services rather than centralized facilities. We
also describe some of the event brokers, services, and software that are
connected to the network. These technologies will become more important in the
coming years, with new event streams from Gaia, LOFAR, LIGO, LSST, and many
others.
