Traffic is constrained by the information involved in locating the receiver
and the physical distance between sender and receiver. We here focus on the
former, and investigate traffic in the perspective of information handling. We
re-plot the road map of cities in terms of the information needed to locate
specific addresses and create information city networks with roads mapped to
nodes and intersections to links between nodes. These networks have the broad
degree distribution found in many other complex networks. The mapping to an
information city network makes it possible to quantify the information
associated with locating specific addresses.
