We study gradient percolation for site percolation on the triangular lattice.
This is a percolation model where the percolation probability depends linearly
on the location of the site. We prove the results predicted by physicists for
this model. More precisely, we describe the fluctuations of the interfaces
around their (straight) scaling limits, and the expected and typical lengths of
these interfaces. These results build on the recent results for critical
percolation on this lattice by Smirnov, Lawler, Schramm and Werner, and on the
scaling ideas developed by Kesten.
