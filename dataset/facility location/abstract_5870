The phase transitions of liquid Helium 3 are described by truncations of an
exact nonperturbative renormalization group equation. The location of the first
order transition lines and the jump in the order parameter are computed
quantitatively. At the triple point we find indications for partially universal
behaviour. We suggest experiments that could help to determine the effective
interactions between fermion pairs.
