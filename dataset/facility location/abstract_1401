Various techniques are being used to search for extra-solar planetary
signatures, including accurate measurement of radial velocity and positional
(astrometric) displacements, gravitational microlensing, and photometric
transits. Planned space experiments promise a considerable increase in the
detections and statistical knowledge arising especially from transit and
astrometric measurements over the years 2005-15, with some hundreds of
terrestrial-type planets expected from transit measurements, and many thousands
of Jupiter-mass planets expected from astrometric measurements.
  Beyond 2015, very ambitious space (Darwin/TPF) and ground (OWL) experiments
are targeting direct detection of nearby Earth-mass planets in the habitable
zone and the measurement of their spectral characteristics. Beyond these, `Life
Finder' (aiming to produce confirmatory evidence of the presence of life) and
`Earth Imager' (some massive interferometric array providing resolved images of
a distant Earth) appear as distant visions.
  This report, to ESA and ESO, summarises the direction of exo-planet research
that can be expected over the next 10 years or so, identifies the roles of the
major facilities of the two organisations in the field, and concludes with some
recommendations which may assist development of the field.
  The report has been compiled by the Working Group members and experts over
the period June-December 2004.
