We report the discovery of a thin stellar stream found in Pan-STARRS1
photometry near the Galactic bulge in the constellation of Ophiuchus. It
appears as a coherent structure in the colour-selected stellar density maps
produced to search for tidal debris around nearby globular clusters. The stream
is exceptionally short and narrow; it is about 2.5{\deg} long and 6' wide in
projection. The colour-magnitude diagram of this object, which harbours a blue
horizontal-branch, is consistent with an old and relatively metal-poor
population ([Fe/H]~-1.3) located 9.5 +/- 0.9 kpc away at (l,b) ~
(5{\deg},+32{\deg}), and 5.0 +/- 1.0 kpc from the Galactic centre. These
properties argue for a globular cluster as progenitor. The finding of such a
prominent, nearby stream suggests that many streams could await discovery in
the more densely populated regions of our Galaxy.
