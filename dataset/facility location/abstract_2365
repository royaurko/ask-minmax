We study a chiral Lagrangian which describes the two- and three-body decays
of a pseudoscalar glueball into scalar and pseudoscalar mesons. The various
branching ratios are a parameter-free prediction of our approach. We compute
the decay channels for a pseudoscalar glueball with a mass of 2.6 GeV, as
predicted by Lattice QCD in the quenched approximation, which is in the reach
of the PANDA experiment at the upcoming FAIR facility. For completeness, we
also repeat the calculation for a glueball mass of 2.37 GeV which corresponds
to the mass of the resonance X(2370) measured in the BESIII experiment.
