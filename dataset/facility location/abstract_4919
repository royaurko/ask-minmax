We show that the Gamma distribution is not an adequate fit for the
probability density function of drop diameters using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
goodness of fit test. We propose a different parametrization of drop size
distributions, which not depending by any particular functional form, is based
on the adoption of standardized central moments. The first three standardized
central moments are sufficient to characterize the distribution of drop
diamters at the ground. These parameters together with the drop count form a
4-tuple which fully describe the variability of the drop size distributions.
The Cartesian product of this 4-tuple of parameters is the rainfall phase
space. Using disdrometer data from 10 different locations we identify
invariant, not depending on location, properties of the rainfall phenomenon.
