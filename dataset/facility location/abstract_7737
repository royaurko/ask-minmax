We analysed archival data of Chandra pre-explosion observations of the
position of SN2014J in M82. No X-ray source at this position was detected in
the data, and we calculated upper limits on the luminosities of the progenitor.
These upper limits allow us to firmly rule out an unobscured supersoft X-ray
source progenitor with a photospheric radius comparable to the radius of white
dwarf near the Chandrasekhar mass (~1.38 M_sun) and mass accretion rate in the
interval where stable nuclear burning can occur. However, due to a relatively
large hydrogen column density implied by optical observations of the supernova,
we cannot exclude a supersoft source with lower temperatures, kT < 80 eV. We
find that the supernova is located in the centre of a large structure of soft
diffuse emission, about 200 pc across. The mass, ~3x10^4 M_sun and short
cooling time of the gas, tau_cool ~ 8 Myrs, suggest that it is a
supernova-inflated super-bubble, associated with the region of recent star
formation. If SN2014J is indeed located inside the bubble, it likely belongs to
the prompt population of type Ia supernovae, with a delay time as short as ~ 50
Myrs. Finally, we analysed the one existing post-supernova Chandra observation
and placed upper limit of ~ (1-2) 10^37 erg/s on the X-ray luminosity of the
supernova itself.
