Quantum thermal effect of Dirac particles in an arbitrarily accelerating
Kinnersley black hole is investigated by using the method of generalized
tortoise coordinate transformation. Both the location and the temperature of
the event horizon depend on the advanced time and the angles. The Hawking
thermal radiation spectrum of Dirac particles contains a new term which
represents the interaction between particles with spin and black holes with
acceleration. This spin-acceleration coupling effect is absent from the thermal
radiation spectrum of scalar particles.
