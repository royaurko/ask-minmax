NGC 2264 is a young (3 Myr), populous star forming region for which our
optical studies have revealed a very high density of potential brown dwarf (BD)
candidates - 236 in less than 1 sq. deg. - from the substellar limit down to 20
Mjup. Candidate BD were first selected using wide field (I,z) band imaging with
CFHT/12K, by reference to current theoretical isochrones. Subsequently, around
50% of the I,z sample were found to have near-infrared (2MASS) photometry,
allowing further selection by comparison with the location of DUSTY isochrones
in colour-colour diagrams involving combinations of IJHK colours. After
rejection of objects with only upper limits to J, six candidates were selected
from the I-K,J-H diagram which afforded the best separation of candidate and
field objects; of these, 2 also lie close to the model predictions in the
I-J,I-K and I-J,H-K plots. After dereddening, all six remain probable very
low-mass NGC 2264 members, in spite of their low Av, while a different group of
objects are shown to be highly reddened background giants. A further three
brighter (at $I$) objects selected by their I-J,I-K colours, lie at the
substellar limit and are likely cluster objects, as are 2 intermediate mass
objects selected by their I-K and H-K colours. These objects potentially
constitute a hitherto unknown population of young, low-mass BD in this region;
only slighty deeper observations could reveal a new laboratory for the study of
near-planetary-mass objects.
