We carry out computer simulations of a simple, two-dimensional off-lattice
model that exhibits inverse melting. The monodisperse system comprises
core-softened disks interacting through a repulsive square shoulder located
inside an attractive square well. By systematically varying the potential
parameters, we increase the pressure range over which the liquid freezes to a
crystal upon isobaric heating. The effect is largely controlled by the extent
of the shoulder. Despite occurring in two dimensions, the melting transition is
first order and to a liquid, rather than to a hexatic or quasicrystal phase. We
also provide comment on a commonly employed correlation function used to
determine the degree of translational ordering in a system.
