X-ray Talbot-Lau interferometer has been used most widely to perform X-ray
phase-contrast imaging with a conventional low-brilliance X-ray source, it
yields high-sensitivity phase and dark-field images of sample producing low
absorption contrast, thus bearing tremendous potential for future clinical
diagnosis. In this manuscript, while changing accelerating voltage of the X-ray
tube from 35KV to 45KV, X-ray phase-contrast imaging of a test sample were
performed at each integer KV position to investigate the characteristic of an
X-ray Talbot-Lau interferometer (located in the Institute of Multidisciplinary
Research for Advanced Materials, Tohoku University, Japan) vs. tube voltage.
Experimental results and data analysis show that this X-ray Talbot-Lau
interferometer is insensitive to the tube accelerating voltage within a certain
range, fringe visibility around 44% is maintained in the aforementioned tube
voltage range. This experimental research implies that potential new dual
energy phase-contrast X-ray imaging strategy and rough refraction spectrum
measurement is feasible with this X-ray Talbot-Lau interferometer.
