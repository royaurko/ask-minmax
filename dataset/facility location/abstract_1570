The Arecibo Galaxy Environments Survey (AGES) is a 2000-hour neutral hydrogen
(HI) survey using the new Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) multibeam instrument
at Arecibo Observatory. It will cover 200 square degrees of sky, sampling a
range of environments from the Local Void through to the Virgo Cluster with
higher sensitivity, spatial resolution and velocity resolution than previous
neutral hydrogen surveys.
