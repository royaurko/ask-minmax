The XMM Large Scale Structure Survey (XMM-LSS) is a major project to map the
large scale structure of the universe out to cosmological distances. An 8
degree by 8 degree region will be surveyed by XMM with planned optical
follow-up to produce a three-dimensional map of many hundreds of clusters out
to a redshift of z = 1. To explore the relation of the large scale structure to
the location and properties of extragalactic radio sources, the XMM-LSS project
also includes a low frequency radio survey of this region. This combination
will provide unprecedented insight into how the radio source formation and
evolution are affected by the local environment. Here, we present preliminary
results from our 325 MHz and 74 MHz surveys in this region. At 325 MHz, we have
a flux limit of 4 mJy/beam, a resolution of 6.3", and a total of 256 source
detections over 5.6 square degrees. At 74 MHz, we have a flux limit of 275
mJy/beam, a resolution of 30", and a total of 211 source detections over 110
square degrees. We describe these results and explore what they tell us about
the population of extra-galactic low frequency radio sources. The 74 MHz survey
represents the first presentation of a deep, sub-arcminute resolution survey at
such a low frequency. This was made possible by recent advances in both
hardware and data reduction algorithms which we describe in detail.
