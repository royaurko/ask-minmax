The Tri$\mu$P facility at KVI is dedicated to provide short lived radioactive
isotopes at low kinetic energies to users. It comprised different cooling
schemes for a variety of energy ranges, from GeV down to the neV scale. The
isotopes are produced using beam of the AGOR cyclotron at KVI. They are
separated from the primary beam by a magnetic separator. A crucial part of such
a facility is the ability to stop and extract isotopes into a low energy
beamline which guides them to the experiment. In particular we are
investigating stopping in matter and buffer gases. After the extraction the
isotopes can be stored in neutral atoms or ion traps for experiments. Our
research includes precision studies of nuclear $\beta$-decay through
$\beta$-$\nu$ momentum correlations as well as searches for permanent electric
dipole moments in heavy atomic systems like radium. Such experiments offer a
large potential for discovering new physics.
