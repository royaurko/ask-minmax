Our work aims at using quantitative imaging tools to complement the
limitation of noise encountered by high resolution fluorescence microscopy
methods. Several cycles of fluorophore activation, imaging and deactivation
produce a sequence of images in which the signals of individual fluorophores do
not overlap, due to the low light intensity during their activation. The
centroid position of each fluorophore is then determined by Gaussian fitting of
each signal, where the final resolution depends on the precision with which
each fluorphore is localized. Superimposing the images will result in having
the same fluorophore mapped onto a `cloud' of locations. The most significant
information of the superimposed images is contained in the macro-structures
identifying microtubules, mitochondria or other organelles. Cascades of binary
image processing algorithms are applied in order to isolate the larger
organelles. A Markovian algorithm selecting the nearest neighbour is finally
applied to the de-noised images, to automatically extract relevant information
on microtubules. Our work supplements advancements in experimental technologies
with computational methods, helping quantifying sub-cellular properties with
high accuracy.
