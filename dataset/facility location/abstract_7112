Published articles concerning the intermediate (third) subgroup of GRBs are
surveyed. From a statistical perspective this subgroup may exist, however its
significance depends on which data set is used. Its astrophysical meaning is
unclear because the occurrence of this subgroup can also be an artificial
selection effect. Hence, GRBs from this subgroup need not be given by a
physically different phenomenon. The aim of this contribution is to search for
the answer to the question in the title.
