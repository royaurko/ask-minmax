Radio galaxy PKS 1138-262 is a massive galaxy at z=2.16, located in a dense
environment. We have found an overdensity of Ly-alpha emitting galaxies in this
field, consistent with a proto-cluster structure associated with the radio
galaxy. Recently, we have discovered forty candidate H-alpha emitters by their
excess near infrared narrow band flux. Here, we present infrared spectroscopy
of nine of the brightest candidate H-alpha emitters. All these candidates show
an emission line at the expected wavelength. The identification of three of
these lines with H-alpha is confirmed by accompanying [NII] emission. The
spectra of the other candidates are consistent with H-alpha emission at z~2.15,
one being a QSO as indicated by the broadness of its emission line. The
velocity dispersion of the emitters (360 km/s) is significantly smaller than
that of the narrow band filter used for their selection (1600 km/s). We
therefore conclude that the emitters are associated with the radio galaxy. The
star formation rates (SFRs) deduced from the H-alpha flux are in the range 6-44
M_solar/yr and the SFR density observed is 5-10 times higher than in the HDF-N
at z=2.23. The properties of the narrow emission lines indicate that the
emitters are powered by star formation and contain very young (< 100 Myr)
stellar populations with moderately high metallicities.
