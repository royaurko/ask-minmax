Zinc and cadmium clusters interacting with a Gupta potential have previously
been identified as prototypical metallic systems that exhibiting disordered
cluster structures. Here, putative global minima of the potential energy have
been located for these clusters for all sizes up to N<125. Although none of the
usual structural forms are lowest in energy and many of the clusters have no
overall order, strong structural preferences have been identified.Many of the
clusters are based on distorted oblate Marks decahedra, where the distortion
involves the bringing together of atoms on either side of a re-entrant groove
of the Marks decahedron.
