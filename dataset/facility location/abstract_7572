We present the full results of our 3-year long Submillimeter Array survey of
protoplanetary disks in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We imaged 23 fields at 880
microns and 2 fields at 1330 microns, covering an area of ~6.5 arcmin^2 and
containing 67 disks. We detected 42 disks with fluxes between 6-135 mJy and at
rms noise levels between 0.6 to 5.3 mJy/beam. Thermal dust emission above any
free-free component was measured in 40 of the 42 detections, and the inferred
disk masses range from 0.003-0.07 Msolar. We find that disks located within 0.3
pc of theta^1 Ori C have a truncated mass distribution, while disks located
beyond 0.3 pc have masses more comparable to those found in low-mass star
forming regions. The disk mass distribution in Orion has a distance dependence,
with a derived relationship max(M_(disk)) = 0.046Msolar(d/0.3pc)^0.33 for the
maximum disk masses. We found evidence of grain growth in disk 197-427, the
only disk detected at both 880 microns and 1330 microns with the SMA. Despite
the rapid erosion of the outer parts of the Orion disks by photoevaporation,
the potential for planet formation remains high in this massive star forming
region, with approximately 18% of the surveyed disks having masses greater than
or equal to 0.01 Msolar within 60 AU.
