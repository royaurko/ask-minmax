We discuss possible applications of the equations of motion in the
generalized Wilson loop space to the phenomenology of the three-dimensional
parton distribution functions in the large-$x_B$ approximation. This regime is
relevant for future experimental programs to be launched at the (approved)
Jefferson Lab 12 GeV upgrade and the (planned) Electron-Ion Collider. We show
that the geometrical evolution of the Wilson loops corresponds to the combined
rapidity and renormalization-group equation of the transverse-distance
dependent parton densities in the large-$x_B$ factorization scheme.
