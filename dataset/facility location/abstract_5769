Stars at the end of their lives return much of their mass back to the ISM.
This process is the main source of dust in the ISM, and potentially a source of
large molecules. I discuss several areas where SKA will have major impact on
our understanding of the mass loss and the circumstellar processes. The
resulting requirements for SKA, including frequency coverage and location, are
discussed.
