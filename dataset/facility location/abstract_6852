We report on the enhancement of surface plasmon resonances in a holey
bidimensional grating of subwavelength size, drilled in a gold thin film coated
by a graphene sheet. The enhancement originates from the coupling between
charge carriers in graphene and gold surface plasmons. The main plasmon
resonance peak is located around 1.5 microns. A lower constraint on the
gold-induced doping concentration of graphene is specified and the interest of
this architecture for molecular sensing is also highlighted.
