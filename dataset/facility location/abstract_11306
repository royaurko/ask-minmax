Using neutron scattering, we investigate the effect of a magnetic field on
the static and dynamic spin response in heavily underdoped superconducting
YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+x}$ (YBCO$_{6+x}$) with x=0.33 (T$_{c}$=8 K) and 0.35
(T$_{c}$=18 K). In contrast to the heavily doped and superconducting monolayer
cuprates, the elastic central peak characterizing static spin correlations does
not respond observably to a magnetic field which suppresses superconductivity.
Instead, we find a magnetic field induced resonant enhancement of the spin
fluctuations. The energy scale of the enhanced fluctuations matches the Zeeman
energy within both the normal and vortex phases while the momentum dependence
is the same as the zero field bilayer response. The magnitude of the
enhancement is very similar in both phases with a fractional intensity change
of $(I/I_{0}-1) \sim 0.1$. We suggest that the enhancement is not directly
correlated with superconductivity but is the result of almost free spins
located near hole rich regions.
