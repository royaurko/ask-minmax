NGC6611, Trumpler 14, Trumpler 15, Trumpler 16, Collinder 232 are very young
open clusters located in star-formation regions of the Eagle Nebula or the
Carina in the MW, and NGC346 in the SMC. With different instrumentations and
techniques, it was possible to detect and classify new Herbig Ae/Be stars,
classical Be stars and to provide new tests / comparisons about the Be stars
appearance models. Special stars (He-strong) of these star-formation regions
are also presented.
