We study the collective transport of paramagnetic colloids driven above a
magnetic bubble lattice by an external rotating magnetic ?eld. We measure a
direct ratchet current which rises in integer and fractional steps with the
?eld amplitude. The stepwise increase is caused by excluded volume interactions
between the particles, which form composite clusters above the bubbles with
mobile and immobile occupation sites. Transient energy minima located at the
interstitials between the bubbles cause the colloids to hop from one composite
cluster to the next with synchronous and period doubled modes of transport. The
colloidal current may be polarized to make selective use of type up or type
down interstitials.
