Very recently, two hidden-charmed resonances $P_c(4380)$ and $P_c(4450)$
consistent with pentaquark states were observed at the LHCb detector. The two
$P_c$ states locate just below the $\bar{D}\Sigma^*_c$ and $\bar{D}^*\Sigma_c$
thresholds with mass gaps about and 15 MeV, respectively. Inspired by this fact
we perform a dynamical investigation about the $\bar{D}\Sigma_c^*(2520)$ and
$\bar{D}^*\Sigma_c(2455)$ interactions which are described by the meson
exchanges. A bound state that carries spin-parity $J^P=3/2^-$ is produced from
the $\bar{D}\Sigma^*_c(2520)$ interaction, which is consistent with the
$P_c(4380)$ observed at LHCb detector. From the $D^*\Sigma_c(2455)$
interaction, a bound state with $5/2^+$ is produced, which can be related to
the $P_c(4450)$. The results suggest that the $P_c(4380)$ and $P_c(4450)$ are
good candidates of $\bar{D}\Sigma_c^*(2520)$ and $\bar{D}^*\Sigma_c(2455)$
molecular states, respectively.
