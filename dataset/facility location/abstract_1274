This work presents a mobile sign-on scheme, which utilizes Bluetooth Low
Energy beacons for location awareness and Attribute-Based Encryption for
expressive, broadcast-style key exchange. Bluetooth Low Energy beacons
broadcast encrypted messages with encoded access policies. Within range of the
beacons, a user with appropriate attributes is able to decrypt the broadcast
message and obtain parameters that allow the user to perform a short or
simplified login. The effect is a "traveling" sign-on that accompanies the user
throughout different locations.
