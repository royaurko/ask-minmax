The traffic of molecular motors through open tube-like compartments is
studied using lattice models. These models exhibit boundary-induced phase
transitions related to those of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP)
in one dimension. The location of the transition lines depends on the boundary
conditions at the two ends of the tubes. Three types of boundary conditions are
studied: (A) Periodic boundary conditions which correspond to a closed
torus-like tube. (B) Fixed motor densities at the two tube ends where radial
equilibrium holds locally; and (C) Diffusive motor injection at one end and
diffusive motor extraction at the other end. In addition to the phase diagrams,
we also determine the profiles for the bound and unbound motor densities using
mean field approximations and Monte Carlo simulations. Our theoretical
predictions are accessible to experiments.
