We argue that NSV 11749, an eruption observed in the early twentieth century,
was a rare event known as "very late thermal pulse" (VLTP). To support our
argument we compare the lightcurve of NSV 11749 with those of the two bonafide
VLTP objects known to date, V4334 Sgr and V605 Aql, and with those predicted by
state of the art stellar evolution models. Next, we explore the IPHAS and 2MASS
catalogues for possible counterparts of the eruption. Our analysis shows that
the VLTP scenario outperforms all other proposed scenarios as an explanation of
NSV 11749. We identify an IPHAS/2MASS source at the eruption location of NSV
11749. The derived colors suggest that the object is not enshrouded in a thick
dust shell as V605 Aql and V4334 Sgr. Also the absence of an apparent planetary
nebula (PN) at the eruption location suggests differences with known VLTP
objects which might be linked to the intensity of the eruption and the mass of
the object. Further exploration of this source and scenario seems desirable. If
NSV 11749 was a born again star, it would be the third event of its kind to
have been observed and will strongly help us to increase our understanding on
the later stages of stellar evolution and violent reactive convective burning.
