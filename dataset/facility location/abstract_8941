The late infall of cold dark matter onto our galaxy produces discrete flows
and caustics in its halo. The recently discovered ring of stars near
galactocentric distance 20 kpc and a series of sharp rises in the Milky Way
rotation curve are interpreted as due to the presence of caustic rings of dark
matter in the galactic plane. Their locations are consistent at the 3% level
with the predictions of the self-similar infall model for the caustic ring
radii. Also, a triangular feature in the IRAS map of the galactic plane is
consistent with the imprint of a caustic ring of dark matter upon the baryonic
matter. These observations imply that the dark matter in our neighborhood is
dominated by a single flow whose density and velocity vector are estimated.
