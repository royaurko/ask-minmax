The paper presents the compliance errors compensation technique for
over-constrained parallel manipulators under external and internal loadings.
This technique is based on the non-linear stiffness modeling which is able to
take into account the influence of non-perfect geometry of serial chains caused
by manufacturing errors. Within the developed technique, the deviation
compensation reduces to an adjustment of a target trajectory that is modified
in the off-line mode. The advantages and practical significance of the proposed
technique are illustrated by an example that deals with groove milling by the
Orthoglide manipulator that considers different locations of the workpiece. It
is also demonstrated that the impact of the compliance errors and the errors
caused by inaccuracy in serial chains cannot be taken into account using the
superposition principle.
