We show that the continuum X-ray spectrum of 4U 1630-472 with iron absorption
lines can be satisfactorily modeled by the spectrum from an accretion disk
atmosphere. We performed full radiative transfer calculations using our code
ATM21 to model the emission from an accretion disk surface that is seen at
different viewing angles. Computed models are then fitted to the
high-resolution X-ray spectra of 4U 1630-472 obtained by {\it Suzaku}
satellite. Absorption lines of highly ionized iron originating in a hot
accretion-disk atmospheres are important part of the observed line profile, and
can be an alternative or complementary explanation to the wind model usually
favored for this type of sources. Next, assuming that absorption lines
originate from the wind illuminated by X-ray central source in LMXBs, we can
put constrains on the wind location only if we know the volume density number
of the absorbing material. There are a few derivations of the distance to the
wind in X-ray binaries. We show here, that the density number and the wind
location agree with the density of an upper disk atmosphere at optical depth of
two-thirds, at the same distance from the black hole. This comparison is done
assuming optically thick, geometrically thin standard accretion disk model.
Nevertheless, it shows that the wind physical conditions are the same as in
thermalized disk gas, and we only have to figure out how the wind is blowing?
