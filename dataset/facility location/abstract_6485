The study of supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae was one of the Key
Science Projects for the first two years of VERITAS observations. VERITAS is an
array of four imaging Cherenkov telescopes located at the Whipple Observatory
in southern Arizona. Supernova remnants are widely considered to be the
strongest candidate for the source of cosmic rays below the knee at around
10^15 eV. Pulsar wind nebulae are synchrotron nebulae powered by the spin-down
of energetic young pulsars, and comprise one of the most populous
very-high-energy gamma-ray source classes. This poster will summarize the
results of this observation program.
