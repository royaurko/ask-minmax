We investigate the influence of close neighbor galaxies on the properties of
supernovae (SNe) and their host galaxies using 56 SNe located in pairs of
galaxies with different levels of star formation (SF) and nuclear activity. The
mean distance of type II SNe from nuclei of hosts is greater by about a factor
of 2 than that of type Ibc SNe. The distributions and mean distances of SNe are
consistent with previous results compiled with the larger sample. For the first
time it is shown that SNe Ibc are located in pairs with significantly smaller
difference of radial velocities between components than pairs containing SNe Ia
and II. We consider this as a result of higher star formation rate (SFR) of
these closer systems of galaxies.
