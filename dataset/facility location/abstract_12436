The Clowes & Campusano (1991) Large Quasar Group (LQG) at <z> = 1.28 has been
re-examined using the quasar data from the DR7QSO catalogue of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. In the 1991 discovery, the LQG impinged on the northern,
southern and eastern limits of the survey. In the DR7QSO data, the western,
northern and southern boundaries of the LQG remain essentially the same, but an
extension eastwards of \sim 2 deg is indicated. In the DR7QSO data, the LQG has
34 members, with <z> = 1.28. A new group of 38 members is indicated at <z> =
1.11 and within \sim 2.0 deg of the Clowes & Campusano LQG. The characteristic
sizes of these two LQGs, \sim 350-400 Mpc, appear to be only marginally
consistent with the scale of homogeneity in the concordance cosmology. In
addition to their intrinsic interest, these two LQGs provide locations in which
to investigate early large-scale structure in galaxies and to identify high-z
clusters. A method is presented for assessing the statistical significance and
overdensity of groups found by linkage of points.
