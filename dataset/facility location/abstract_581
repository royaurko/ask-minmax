Data on the photoproduction of omega mesons on nuclei have been re-analyzed
in search for in-medium modifications. The data were taken with the Crystal
Barrel(CB)/TAPS detector system at the ELSA accelerator facility in Bonn. The
extracted omega line shape was found to be sensitive to the background
subtraction. In experiments at the tagged photon facility of the Mainz MAMI
accelerator photoproduction of mesons from light nuclear targets (deuteron and
3He) has been studied. The experiments used the combined Crystal Ball/TAPS
setup in Mainz. Measurements of eta- and pi0-photoproduction off a liquid
3He-target have been used for the search for the formation of eta-mesic 3He.
The installation of the WASA detector at COSY opened a unique possibility to
search for the 4He-eta bound state with high statistics and high acceptance. We
are conducting a search via an exclusive measurement of the excitation function
for the dd -> 3He p pi- reaction.
