The question "Are supernovae important sources of dust?" is a contentious
one. Observations with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) and the
Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) only detected very small amounts of hot dust
in supernova remnants. Here, we review observations of two young Galactic
remnants with the Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA), which
imply that large quantities of dust are produced by supernovae. The association
of dust with the Cassiopeia A remnant is in question due to the contamination
of foreground material. In this article, we compare the emission from cold dust
with CO emission towards Kepler's supernova remnant. We detect very little CO
at the location of the submillimetre peaks. A comparison of masses from the CO
and the dust clouds are made, and we estimate the 3 sigma upper limit on the
gas-to-dust ratios to range from 25 - 65 suggesting that we cannot yet rule out
freshly-formed or swept up circumstellar dust in Kepler's supernova remnant.
