Precision tests of the standard model are essential for constraining models
of new physics. Neutrino-electron elastic scattering offers a clean probe into
many electroweak effects that are complimentary to the more canonical
measurements done at collider facilities. Such reactions are rare, even as
compared with the already tiny cross-sections for neutrino-nucleon scattering,
and competitive precision measurements have historically been challenging to
obtain. Due to new existing and proposed high-flux neutrino sources, this is
about to change. We present a topical survey of precision measurements that can
be done with neutrino-electron scattering in light of these new developments.
Specifically, we consider four distinct neutrino sources: nuclear reactors,
neutrino factories, beta-beams, and conventional beams. For each source we
estimate the expected future precision of several representative observables,
including the weak mixing angle, neutrino magnetic moments, and potential
leptonic Z' couplings. We find that future neutrino-electron scattering
experiments should add non-trivially to our understanding of fundamental
physics.
