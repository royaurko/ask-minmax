The reaction $\gamma p\to p\pi^0\eta$ has been studied with the CBELSA
detector at the tagged photon beam of the Bonn electron stretcher facility. The
reaction shows contributions from $\Delta^+(1232)\eta$, $N(1535)^+\pi^0$ and
$pa_0(980)$ as intermediate states. A partial wave analysis suggests that the
reaction proceeds via formation of six $\Delta$ resonances,
$\Delta(1600)P_{33}$, $\Delta(1920)P_{33}$, $\Delta(1700)D_{33}$,
$\Delta(1940)D_{33}$, $\Delta(1905)F_{35}$, $\Delta(2360)D_{33}$, and two
nucleon resonances $N(1880)P_{11}$ and $N(2200)P_{13}$, for which pole
positions and decay branching ratios are given.
