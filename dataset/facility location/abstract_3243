We present the results of ATCA HI line and 20-cm radio continuum observations
of the galaxy Quartet NGC 6845. The HI emission extends over all four galaxies
but can only be associated clearly with the two spiral galaxies, NGC 6845A and
B, which show signs of strong tidal interaction. We derive a total HI mass of
at least 1.8 x 10^10 Msun, most of which is associated with NGC 6845A, the
largest galaxy of the group. We investigate the tidal interaction between NGC
6845A and B by studying the kinematics of distinct HI components and their
relation to the known HII regions. No HI emission is detected from the two
lenticular galaxies, NGC 6845C and D. A previously uncatalogued dwarf galaxy,
ATCA J2001-4659, was detected 4.4' NE from NGC 6845B and has an HI mass of
about 5 x 10^8 Msun. No HI bridge is visible between the group and its newly
detected companion.
  Extended 20-cm radio continuum emission is detected in NGC 6845A and B as
well as in the tidal bridge between the two galaxies. We derive star formation
rates of 15 to 40 Msun/yr.
