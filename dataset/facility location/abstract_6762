The perturbation theory is developed for joint statistics of the advanced and
retarded Green's functions of the 1D Schrodinger equation with a
piecewise-constant random potential. Using this method, analytical expressions
are obtained for spectral dependence of the degree of localization and for the
limiting (at $t\rightarrow\infty$) probability to find the particle at the
point it was located at $t = 0$ (Andeson criterion). Definition of the
localization length is introduced. The computer experiments confirming
correctness of the calculations are described.
