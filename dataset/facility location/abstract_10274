We propose a minimal SO(10) model in 5 space-time dimensions. The single
extra spatial dimension is compactified on the orbifold S^1/(Z_2 x Z_2')
reducing the gauge group to that of Pati-Salam. The breaking down to the
standard model group is obtained through an ordinary Higgs mechanism taking
place at the Pati-Salam brane, giving rise to a proper gauge coupling
unification. We achieve a correct description of fermion masses and mixing
angles by describing first and second generations as bulk fields, and by
embedding the third generation into four multiplets located at the Pati-Salam
brane. The Yukawa sector is simple and compact and predicts a neutrino spectrum
of normal hierarchy type. Concerning proton decay, dimension five operators are
absent and the essentially unique localization of matter multiplets implies
that the minimal couplings between the super-heavy gauge bosons and matter
fields are vanishing. Non-minimal interactions are allowed but the resulting
dimension six operators describing proton decay are too suppressed to produce
observable effects, even in future, super-massive detectors.
