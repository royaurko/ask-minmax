The original shipping strategy of FedEx is to fly all packages to a hub
location during the afternoon and evening, sort them there, and then fly them
to their destinations during the night for delivery the next day. This leads to
interesting mathematical questions: Given a population represented by points in
Euclidean space or on a sphere, what is the location of the point of the hub
that minimizes the total distance to all the points? Is such a point unique?
Then using census data from 2000 we examine how close the FedEx hub in Memphis
is to the hub for the U.S. population.
