The CNES/European space mission COROT will monitor asteroseismic targets
located in selected fields to probe stellar interiors. Therefore, suitable
candidate targets have to be searched for in order to optimize the scientific
return of the mission. However, to be able to use the asteroseismic tools on
the stars, their physical parameters must be known in advance. In this work, we
detail the process of building a photometric database of all the stars brighter
than V=8.0 mag in the field of view of COROT and the process of selecting
suitable delta Scuti and gamma Dor-type stars for the mission.
