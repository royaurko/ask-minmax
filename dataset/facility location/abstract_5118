We study the relationship between chiral symmetry breaking and baryons in
holographic QCD. We construct a soliton with unit baryon charge in the presence
of a nonzero mean value of the scalar bifundamental field, which is dual to the
chiral condensate. We obtain a relation between the chiral condensate and the
mass of the baryon and find in a clear-cut way that at large values of the
condensate the holographic soliton is no longer located on the IR wall. Instead
it is split into two halves, which are symmetrically located on the left and
right flavor branes. On the other hand we find that the local value of the
quark condensate is suppressed in the core of the soliton, which is evidence
for a partial chiral symmetry restoration inside the baryon.
