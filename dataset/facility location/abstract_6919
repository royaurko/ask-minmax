Recent surveys have detected RR Lyrae stars in M33, the Triangulum Galaxy.
These variable stars are excellent tracers of ancient stellar populations. The
RR Lyrae stars have been used to estimate metallicities at various locations
within M33, as well as determining the distance to the galaxy. A summary of the
M33 RR Lyrae stars is presented here as well as an analysis on what their
properties imply for the unique M33 galaxy
