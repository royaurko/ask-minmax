Clustering analysis is a method to organize raw data into categories based on
a measure of similarity. It has been successfully applied to diverse fields
from science to business and engineering. By endowing data points with physical
meaning like particles in the physical world and then leaning their evolving
tendency of moving from higher to lower potentials, data points in the proposed
clustering algorithm sequentially hop to the locations of their transfer points
and gather, after a few steps, at the locations of cluster centers with the
locally lowest potentials, where cluster members can be easily identified. The
whole clustering process is simple and efficient, and can be performed either
automatically or interactively, with reliable performances on test data of
diverse shapes, attributes, and dimensionalities.
