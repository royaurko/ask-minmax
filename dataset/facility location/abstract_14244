Mobility predictors proposed so far exploit the patterns from the past
mobility trajectory collected by an individual user. Thus, if the training data
collected by each user (i.e., the past trajectory) is not sufficient due to
short training period or energy constraint, those predictors suffer from the
low prediction accuracy. In this paper, we develop cluster-aided mobility
predictors which use the data collected by all users to predict the next
location of a given user. More specifically, based on a non-parametric bayesian
statistics in which a clustering technique is involved, the proposed predictor
exploits the data of other users whose mobility patterns are similar (i.e.,
associated to a same cluster). We analytically prove the consistency of the
proposed predictor, and evaluate its performance using real mobility datasets.
