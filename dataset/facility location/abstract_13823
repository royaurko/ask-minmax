We study the scattering of vortex rings by a superfluid line vortex using the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation in a parameter regime where a hydrodynamic
description based on a vortex filament approximation is applicable. By using a
vortex extraction algorithm, we are able to track the location of the vortex
ring as a function of time. Using this, we show that the scattering of the
vortex ring in our Gross-Pitaevskii simulations is well captured by the local
induction approximation of a vortex filament model for a wide range of impact
parameters. The scattering of a vortex ring by a line vortex is characterised
by the initial offset of the centre of the ring from the axis of the vortex. We
find that a strong asymmetry exists in the scattering of a ring as a function
of this initial scattering parameter.
