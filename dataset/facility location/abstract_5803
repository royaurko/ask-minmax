The non-conserved $\phi^4$ model defined by a Langevin equation with external
non-white noise is studied by means of the Dynamic Renormalization Group. The
correlation time of the noise changes the critical point location but does not
affect the critical exponents up to order $\varepsilon^2$. The same effect is
obtained when the correlation length of the noise is considered. These results
are shown to be in agreement with previous numerical simulations.
