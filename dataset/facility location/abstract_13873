Biological and social systems consist of myriad interacting units. The
interactions can be intuitively represented in the form of a graph or network.
Measurements of these graphs can reveal the underlying structure of these
interactions, which provides insight into the systems that generated the
graphs. Moreover, in applications such as neuroconnectomics, social networks,
and genomics, graph data is accompanied by contextualizing measures on each
node. We leverage these node covariates to help uncover latent communities in a
graph, using a modification of spectral clustering. Statistical guarantees are
provided under a joint mixture model that we call the Node Contextualized
Stochastic Blockmodel, including a bound on the mis-clustering rate. For most
simulated conditions, covariate assisted spectral clustering yields superior
results relative to both regularized spectral clustering without node
covariates and an adaptation of canonical correlation analysis. We apply
covariate assisted spectral clustering to large brain graphs derived from
diffusion MRI data, using the node locations or neurological region membership
as covariates. In both cases, covariate assisted spectral clustering yields
clusters that are easier to interpret neurologically.
