A simple setup for the generation of ultra-intense quasistatic magnetic
fields, based on the generation of electron currents with a predefined geometry
in a curved 'escargot' target, is proposed and analysed. Particle-In-Cell
simulations and qualitative estimates show that giga-Gauss scale magnetic
fields may be achieved with existent laser facilities. The described mechanism
of the strong magnetic field generation may be useful in a wide range of
applications, from laboratory astrophysics to magnetized ICF schemes.
