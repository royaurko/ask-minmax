A complete sample of bright ROSAT sources with hard XRB-like spectra in the
Galactic Plane (|b| < 15 deg.) has been tentatively identified with radio
sources in the GB6/PMN/NVSS surveys, and subsequently observed with the
Australia Telescope Compact Array and the Very Large Array. Most of them are
unresolved at the sub-arcsec scale and have flat or inverted spectra. Precise
radio coordinates have made unambiguous optical identifications possible,
which, after the removal of galaxies, yielded a final list of 40 microquasar
candidates. They are successfully going through the moderate dispersion
spectroscopy by the 4-m telescope of the Anglo-Australian Observatory. Our goal
is to obtain evidence for a characteristic accreting behaviour and establish
binarity, thence permitting actual microquasar classification. VLBI
observations of the brightest candidates are also underway. We expect some of
these objects could be QSOs, or radio galaxies, or cataclysmic variables.
However, this would be a valuable by-product of the proposed program.
Photometry of these objects dedicated to find possible eclipses and, also,
characteristic accreting disc driven flares.
