We present results from two statistical analyses applied to an neutral
hydrogen (HI) dataset of the nearby tidal bridge in the Magellanic System.
Primarily, analyses of the Spatial Power Spectrum suggest that the Magellanic
Bridge, historically considered to be a single contiguous feature, may in fact
be a projection of two kinematically and morphologically distinct structures.
The southern and more obviously turbulent parts appear to show structure
organized similarly to the adjacent Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), while the
northern regions are shown to be relatively deficient in large scale power. The
extent of modification to the spatial power index by the velocity fluctuations
is also highly variant across these parts of the Bridge. We find again that the
northern part appears distinct from the southern part and from the SMC, in that
the power spectrum is significantly more affected by slower velocity
perturbations.
  We also probe the rate of spectral variation of the HI by measuring the
Spectral Correlation Function over selected regions. The results from this
analysis highlight a tendency for the HI spectra within the bright parts of the
Bridge to have a more persistent correlation in the E-W direction than in the
N-S direction. These results are considered to be quantitative evidence for the
tidal processes which are thought to have been active throughout the evolution
of the Magellanic Bridge
