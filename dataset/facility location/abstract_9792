We analyze the effects of a long-ranged step-step interaction on thermal
roughening within the framework of a solid-on-solid model of a crystal surface
by means of Monte Carlo simulation. A repulsive step-step interaction is
modeled by elastic dipoles located on sites adjacent to the steps. In order to
reduce the computational effort involved in calculating interaction energy
based on long-ranged potentials, we employ a multi-grid scheme. As a result of
the long-range character of the step interaction, the roughening temperature
increases drastically compared to a system with short-range cutoff as a
consequence of anti-correlations between surface defects.
