We define and study a transform whose iterates bring to the fore interesting
relations between Pisot numbers and primes. Although the relations we describe
are general, they take a particular form in the Pisot limit points. We give
three elegant formulae, which permit to locate on the whole semi-line all limit
points that are not integer powers of other Pisot numbers.
