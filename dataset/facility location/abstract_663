We outline a method for controlling the location of stable and unstable
manifolds in the following sense. From a known location of the stable and
unstable manifolds in a steady two-dimensional flow, the primary segments of
the manifolds are to be moved to a user-specified time-varying location which
is near the steady location. We determine the nonautonomous perturbation to the
vector field required to achieve this control, and give a theoretical bound for
the error in the manifolds resulting from applying this control. The efficacy
of the control strategy is illustrated via a numerical example.
