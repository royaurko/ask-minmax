We show that time-dependent fluctuations $\{\Delta x\}$ in foreign exchange
rates are accurately described by a random walk in a complex plane that is
demarcated into the gain (+) and loss (-) sectors. $\{\Delta x\}$ is the
outcome of $N$ random steps from the origin and $|\Delta x|$ is the square of
the Euclidean distance of the final $N$-th step position. Sign of $\{\Delta
x(t)\}$ is set by the $N$-th step location in the plane. The model explains not
only the exponential statistics of the probability density of $\{\Delta x\}$
for G7 markets but also its observed asymmetry, and power-law dependent
broadening with increasing time delay.
