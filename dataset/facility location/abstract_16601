The INTEGRAL Burst Alert System (IBAS) has been developed to detect and
locate in real time the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) serendipitously observed by
INTEGRAL. The IBAS software runs automatically at the INTEGRAL Science Data
Centre (ISDC), where the satellite data are received with a delay of only a few
seconds. The sky coordinates of the GRBs occurring in the field of view of the
IBIS instrument are distributed via Internet in real time. The localizations
have a typical uncertainty radius of 2 arcmin (90% c.l.) and in most cases are
available within a few tens of seconds after the beginning of the GRB. In ten
years of operations IBAS has localized about 90 GRBs, most of which in near
real time, and distributed alerts also for other kinds of astrophysical
transient events, such as type I bursts from low mass X-ray binaries, flares
and bursts from magnetars, and outbursts of Galactic transients. IBAS also
provides the light curves for the GRBs detected with the anti-coincidence
shield of the SPI instrument. Here I summarize the main properties of the GRBs
detected in the field of view of IBIS during the first ten years of the
INTEGRAL mission.
