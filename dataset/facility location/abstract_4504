Using the Australia Telescope Compact Array we have detected CO(1-0) and
CO(5-4) from TNJ0924-2201 at z=5.2, the most distant radio galaxy known to
date. This is the second highest redshift detection of CO published so far. The
CO(1-0) is 250-400 km/sec wide with a peak flux density of 520 +- 115
microJy/beam whilst the CO(5-4) line emission is 200-300 km/sec wide with a
peak flux density of 7.8 +- 2.7 mJy/beam. Both transitions are spatially
unresolved but there is marginal evidence for spatial offsets between the CO
and the host galaxy; the CO(1-0) is located 28 +- 11 kpc (4.5 +- 1.7 arcsec)
north of the radio galaxy whilst the CO(5-4) is located 18 +- 8 kpc (2.8 +- 1.2
arcsec) south of the radio galaxy. Higher spatial resolution observations are
required to determine the reality of these offsets. Our result is the second
detection of CO in a high redshift galaxy without pre-selection based on a
massive dust content.
