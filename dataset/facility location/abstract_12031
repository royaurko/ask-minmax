We formulate a model for intermittent communications that can capture bursty
transmissions or a sporadically available channel, where in either case the
receiver does not know a priori when the transmissions will occur. Focusing on
the point-to point case, we develop two decoding structures and their
achievable rates for such communication scenarios. One structure determines the
transmitted codeword, and another scheme first detects the locations of
codeword symbols and then uses them to decode. We introduce the concept of
partial divergence and study some of its properties in order to obtain stronger
achievability results. As the system becomes more intermittent, the achievable
rates decrease due to the additional uncertainty about the positions of the
codeword symbols at the decoder. Additionally, we provide upper bounds on the
capacity of binary noiseless intermittent communication with the help of a
genie-aided encoder and decoder. The upper bounds imply a tradeoff between the
capacity and the intermittency rate of the communication system. Finally, we
obtain lower and upper bounds on the capacity per unit cost of intermittent
communication.
