Understanding how spatial configurations of economic activity emerge is
important when formulating spatial planning and economic policy. A simple model
was proposed by Simon, who assumed that firms grow at a rate proportional to
their size, and that new divisions of firms with certain probabilities relocate
to other firms or to new centres of economic activity. Simon's model produces
realistic results in the sense that the sizes of economic centres follow a Zipf
distribution, which is also observed in reality. It lacks realism in the sense
that mechanisms such as cluster formation, congestion (defined as an overly
high density of the same activities) and dependence on the spatial distribution
of external parties (clients, labour markets) are ignored.
  The present paper proposed an extension of the Simon model that includes both
centripetal and centrifugal forces. Centripetal forces are included in the
sense that firm divisions are more likely to settle in locations that offer a
higher accessibility to other firms. Centrifugal forces are represented by an
aversion of a too high density of activities in the potential location. The
model is implemented as an agent-based simulation model in a simplified spatial
setting. By running both the Simon model and the extended model, comparisons
are made with respect to their effects on spatial configurations. To this end a
series of metrics are used, including the rank-size distribution and indices of
the degree of clustering and concentration.
