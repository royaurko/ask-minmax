We describe a general N-solitonic solution of the focusing NLSE in the
presence of a condensate by using the dressing method. We give the explicit
form of one- and two- solitonic solutions and study them in detail. We
distinguish a special class of solutions that we call regular solitonic
solutions. Regular solitonic solutions do not disturb phases of the condensate
at infinity by coordinate. All of them can be treated as localized
perturbations of the condensate. We find a broad class of superregular
solitonic solutions which are small perturbations at certain a moment of time.
Superregular solitonic solutions are generated by pairs of poles located on
opposite sides of the cut. They describe the nonlinear stage of the modulation
instability of the condensate and play an important role in the theory of freak
waves.
