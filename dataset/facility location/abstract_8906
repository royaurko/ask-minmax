We discuss some of the practical considerations that need to be made in the
design of extra-galactic field surveys using FIRST. We investigate the various
limitations that confusion noise imposes on possible FIRST surveys and the
benefits of super resolution or decconvolution techniques. We consider the
possible sizes and depths of survey fields in order to meet many of the
scientific objectives of the FIRST mission. In particular we discuss the
factors that need to be taken into account in selecting the survey fields. The
final choice of fields will be influenced by the location of other surveys that
are currently being planned; so it is vital that the FIRST community begin
debating this issue now. We conclude that a substantial survey of order of 100
square degrees is likely to be sited in the region of the SIRTF Legacy survey,
SWIRE.
