We use the Gorkov formulation of the Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov
approximation to nuclear pairing to study the ^1S_0 nucleon-nucleon
correlations in nuclear matter. We find the short-range correlations of the
^1S_0 pairing fields to be almost identical to those of the two-nucleon virtual
state. We obtain mutually consistent results for the pairing fields, using
several different sets of effective interaction parameters, when we demand that
each of these sets places the virtual-state pole at its physical location.
