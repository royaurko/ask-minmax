Accretion rates from disks around pre-main sequence stars are of importance
for our understanding of planetary formation and disk evolution. We provide in
this paper estimates of the mass accretion rates in the disks around a large
sample of Herbig Ae stars. We obtained medium resolution 2 micron spectra and
used the results to compute values of Macc from the measured luminosity of the
Br_gamma emission line, using a well established correlation between
L(Br_gamma) and the accretion luminosity Lacc. We find that 80% of the stars,
all of which have evidence of an associated circumstellar disk, are accreting
matter, with rates 3x10^{-9} < Macc} < 10^{-6} Msun/yr; for 7 objects, 6 of
which are located on the ZAMS in the HR diagram, we do not detect any line
emission. Few HAe stars (25%) have Macc>10^{-7} Msun/yr. In most HAe stars the
accretion rate is sufficiently low that the gas in the inner disk, inside the
dust evaporation radius, is optically thin and does not prevent the formation
of a puffed-up rim, where dust is directly exposed to the stellar radiation.
When compared to the Macc values found for lower-mass stars in the star forming
regions Taurus and Ophiuchus, HAe stars have on average higher accretion rates
than solar-mass stars; however, there is a lack of very strong accretors among
them, probably due to the fact that they are on average older.
