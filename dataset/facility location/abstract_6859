In this note we study, for a random lattice L of large dimension n, the
supremum of the real parts of the zeros of the Epstein zeta function E_n(L,s)
and prove that this random variable has a limit distribution, which we give
explicitly. This limit distribution is studied in some detail; in particular we
give an explicit formula for its distribution function.
