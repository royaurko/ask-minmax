We report on the successful commissioning of the Francium Trapping Facility
at TRIUMF. Large laser-cooled samples of francium are produced from a francium
ion beam delivered by the ISAC radioactive ion beam facility. The ion beam is
neutralized on an yttrium foil, which is subsequently heated to transfer the
atoms into the magneto-optical trapping region. We have successfully trapped
$^{207}$Fr, $^{209}$Fr and $^{221}$Fr, with a maximum of $2.5 \times 10^5$
$^{209}$Fr atoms. The neutral cold atoms will be used in studies of the weak
interaction through measurements of atomic parity non-conservation.
