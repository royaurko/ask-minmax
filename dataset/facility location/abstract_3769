The bound states of 12Be have been studied through a 11Be(d,p)12Be transfer
reaction experiment in inverse kinematics. A 2.8 MeV/u beam of 11Be was
produced using the REX-ISOLDE facility at CERN. The outgoing protons were
detected with the T-REX silicon detector array. The MINIBALL germanium array
was used to detect gamma rays from the excited states in 12Be. The gamma-ray
detection enabled a clear identification of the four known bound states in
12Be, and each of the states has been studied individually. Differential cross
sections over a large angular range have been extracted. Spectroscopic factors
for each of the states have been determined from DWBA calculations and have
been compared to previous experimental and theoretical results.
