We revisit the problem of one-dimensional Anderson localization, by providing
perturbative expression for Lyapunov exponent of Anderson model with
next-nearest-neighbor (nnn) hopping. By comparison with exact numerical
results, we discuss the range of validity of the naive perturbation theory. The
stability of band center anomaly is examined against the introduction of nnn
hopping. New anomalies of Kappus-Wegner type emerge at nonuniversal values of
wavelength when hopping to second neighbor is allowed. It is shown that
covariances in the first order of perturbation theory, develop singularities at
these resonant energies which enable us to locate them.
