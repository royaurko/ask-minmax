We present deep HI observations of the compact high-velocity cloud
HVC125+41-207 using the 100-m Effelsberg telescope. Our goal was in particular
to study the warm neutral medium (WNM) in detail. The Effelsberg data reveal a
two phase core/halo structure - one component with a velocity width of FWHM
approx 5 km/s (Westerbork data show FWHM approx 2 km/s, Braun & Burton 2000)
and one with FWHM approx 18 km/s. The column density distribution of the warmer
component is highly asymmetric and shows a head-tail structure. We performed a
Gaussian decomposition of the cloud and found that 52% of the HI mass of the
cloud is in the WNM. 24% of the WNM is located in the tail. The overall
structure and the systematic variation of the observational parameters radial
velocity, velocity dispersion and column density indicate that this cloud is
currently interacting with the ambient medium.
  The Westerbork HI data of this HVC (Braun & Burton 2000) reveal an
interesting dense condensation. Assuming that this condensation is virialized
and in pressure equilibrium with the ambient medium, we derive a distance of
130 kpc for HVC125+41-207. Following these considerations, it is possible to
constrain the parameters n_IGM < 7.8 10^-6 cm^-3 and T_IGM > 1.1 10^5 K of the
intergalactic medium of the Local Group.
