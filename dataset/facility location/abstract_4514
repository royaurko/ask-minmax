We constrain the parameters of the variable Chaplygin gas model, using the
location of peaks of the CMBR spectrum and SNe Ia ``gold '' data set. Equation
of state of the model is $P=-A(a)/\rho$, where $A(a)=A_0 a^{-n}$ is a positive
function of the cosmological scale factor $a$, $A_0$ and $n$ being constants.
The variable Chaplygin gas interpolates from dust-dominated era to quintessence
dominated era. The model is found to be compatible with current type Ia
Supernovae data and location of first peak if the values of $\Omega_m$ and $n$
lie in the interval $[0.017,~0.117]$ and $[-1.3,~2.6]$ respectively.
