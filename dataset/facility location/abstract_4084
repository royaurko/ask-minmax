This paper addresses the problem of recovering the spatial market potential
of a retail product from spatially distributed sales data. In order to tackle
the problem in a general way, the concept of spatial potential is introduced.
The potential is concurrently measured at different spatial locations and the
measurements are analyzed in order to recover the spatial potential. The
measuring instruments used to collect the data interact with each other, that
is, the measurement at a given spatial location is affected by the concurrent
measurements at other locations. An approach based on a novel geostatistical
model is developed. In particular, the model is able to handle both the
measuring instrument interaction and the missing data. A model estimation
procedure based on the expectation-maximization algorithm is provided as well
as standard inferential tools. The model is applied to the estimation of the
spatial market potential of a newspaper for the city of Bergamo, Italy. The
estimated spatial market potential is eventually analyzed in order to identify
the areas with the highest potential, to identify the areas where it is
profitable to open additional newsstands and to evaluate the newspaper total
market volume of the city.
