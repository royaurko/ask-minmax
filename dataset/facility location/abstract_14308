People in developing world derive a significant part of their livelihoods
from various forest products, particularly non-timber forest products. This
article attempts to explore the contribution of NTFPs in sustaining
forest-based rural livelihood in and around a protected area of Bangladesh, and
their potential role in enhancing households resilience capacity. Based on
empirical investigation our study revealed that, local communities gather a
substantial amount of NTFPs from national park despite the official
restrictions. 27 percent households of the area received at least some cash
benefit from the collection, processing and selling of NTFPs, and NTFPs
contribute as HHs primary, supplementary and emergency sources of income. NTFPs
also constituted an estimated 19 percent of HHs net annual income, and were the
primary occupation for about 18 percent of the HHs. HHs dependency on nearby
forests for various NTFPs varied vis-a-vis their socio-economic condition as
well as with their location from the park. Based on our case study the article
also offers some clues for improving the situation in PA.
