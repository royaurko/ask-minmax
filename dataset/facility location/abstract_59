The adoption of Grid technology has the potential to greatly aid the BaBar
experiment. BdbServer was originally designed to extract copies of data from
the Objectivity/DB database at SLAC and IN2P3. With data now stored in multiple
locations in a variety of data formats, we are enhancing this tool. This will
enable users to extract selected deep copies of event collections and ship them
to the requested site using the facilities offered by the existing Grid
infrastructure. By building on the work done by various groups in BaBar, and
the European DataGrid, we have successfully expanded the capabilities of the
BdbServer software. This should provide a framework for future work in data
distribution.
