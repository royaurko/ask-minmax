The mid-infrared emission at the center of IRAS 21026+4104 is not that of a
simple compact source, as one would expect from an isolated high mass
protostellar object. Furthermore the central thermal infrared emission does not
appear to be coming directly from a circumstellar disk as has been recently
hypothesized from near-infrared observations. The mid-infrared structure is
complex, but with the help of multiple wavelength information two plausible
scenarios to explain the emission in the region are advanced. The first is that
there is a tight cluster of young stellar objects here. The second is that the
mid-infrared emission and masers are delineating the walls of the outflow
cavities of a massive stellar source located in the center of the near- and
mid-infrared dark lane.
