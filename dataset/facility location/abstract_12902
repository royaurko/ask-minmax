The existence of planets born in environments highly perturbed by a stellar
companion represents a major challenge to the paradigm of planet formation. In
numerical simulations, the presence of a close binary companion stirs up the
relative velocity between planetesimals, which is fundamental in determining
the balance between accretion and erosion. However, the recent discovery of
circumbinary planets by Kepler establishes that planet formation in binary
systems is clearly viable. We perform N-body simulations of planetesimals
embedded in a protoplanetary disk, where planetesimal phasing is frustrated by
the presence of stochastic torques, modeling the expected perturbations of
turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI). We examine
perturbation amplitudes relevant to dead zones in the midplane (conducive to
planet formation in single stars), and find that planetesimal accretion can be
inhibited even in the outer disk (4-10 AU) far from the central binary, a
location previously thought to be a plausible starting point for the formation
of circumbinary planets.
