This paper reports on the development of a wearable system using wireless
biomedical sensors for ubiquitous healthcare service provisioning. The
prototype system is developed to address current healthcare challenges such as
increasing cost of services, inability to access diverse services, low quality
services and increasing population of elderly as experienced globally. The
biomedical sensors proactively collect physiological data of remote patients to
recommend diagnostic services. The prototype system is designed to monitor
oxygen saturation level (SpO2), Heart Rate (HR), activity and location of the
elderly. Physiological data collected are uploaded to a Health Server (HS) via
GPRS/Internet for analysis.
