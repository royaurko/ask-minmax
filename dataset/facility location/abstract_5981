The nonequilibrium phase transition in the triplet-creation model is
investigated using critical spreading and the conservative diffusive contact
process. The results support the claim that at high enough diffusion the phase
transition becomes discontinuous. As the diffusion probability increases the
critical exponents change continuously from the ordinary directed percolation
(DP) class to the compact directed percolation (CDP). The fractal dimension of
the critical cluster, however, switches abruptly between those two universality
classes. Strong crossover effects in both methods make it difficult, if not
impossible, to establish the exact location of the tricritical point.
