Each successive generation of x-ray machines has opened up new frontiers in
science, such as the first radiographs and the determination of the structure
of DNA. State-of-the-art x-ray sources can now produce coherent high brightness
keV x-rays and promise a new revolution in imaging complex systems on nanometre
and femtosecond scales. Despite the demand, only a few dedicated synchrotron
facilities exist worldwide, partially due the size and cost of conventional
(accelerator) technology. Here we demonstrate the use of a recently developed
compact laser-plasma accelerator to produce a well-collimated,
spatially-coherent, intrinsically ultrafast source of hard x-rays. This method
reduces the size of the synchrotron source from the tens of metres to
centimetre scale, accelerating and wiggling a high electron charge
simultaneously. This leads to a narrow-energy spread electron beam and x-ray
source that is >1000 times brighter than previously reported plasma wiggler and
thus has the potential to facilitate a myriad of uses across the whole spectrum
of light-source applications.
