The H.E.S.S. experiment is an array of four imaging Cherenkov telescopes
located in the Khomas Highlands of Namibia. It has been operating in its full
configuration since December 2003 and detects very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays
ranging from 100 GeV to 50 TeV. Since 2004, the continuous observation of the
Galactic Plane by the H.E.S.S. array of telescopes has yielded the discovery of
more than 50 sources, belonging to the classes of pulsar wind nebulae (PWN),
supernova remnants (SNR), gamma ray binaries and, more recently, a stellar
cluster and molecular clouds in the vicinity of shell-type SNRs. Galactic
emission seen by H.E.S.S. and its implications for particle acceleration in our
Galaxy are discussed.
