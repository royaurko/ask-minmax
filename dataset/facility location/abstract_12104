We investigate the trapping problem in Erdos-Renyi (ER) and Scale-Free (SF)
networks. We calculate the evolution of the particle density $\rho(t)$ of
random walkers in the presence of one or multiple traps with concentration $c$.
We show using theory and simulations that in ER networks, while for short times
$\rho(t) \propto \exp(-Act)$, for longer times $\rho(t)$ exhibits a more
complex behavior, with explicit dependence on both the number of traps and the
size of the network. In SF networks we reveal the significant impact of the
trap's location: $\rho(t)$ is drastically different when a trap is placed on a
random node compared to the case of the trap being on the node with the maximum
connectivity. For the latter case we find
$\rho(t)\propto\exp\left[-At/N^\frac{\gamma-2}{\gamma-1}\av{k}\right]$ for all
$\gamma>2$, where $\gamma$ is the exponent of the degree distribution
$P(k)\propto k^{-\gamma}$.
