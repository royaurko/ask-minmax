We consider a Super-NOvA-like experimental configuration based on the use of
two detectors in a long-baseline experiment as NOvA. We take the far detector
as in the present NOvA proposal and add a second detector at a shorter
baseline. The location of the second off-axis detector is chosen such that the
ratio L/E is the same for both detectors, being L the baseline and E the
neutrino energy. We consider liquid argon and water-Cherenkov techniques for
the second off-axis detector and study, for different experimental setups, the
detector mass required for the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy,
for different values of theta13. We also study the capabilities of such an
experimental setup for determining CP violation in the neutrino sector. Our
results show that by adding a second off-axis detector a remarkable enhancement
on the capabilities of the current NOvA experiment could be achieved.
