The Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and the Mopra facility have been
used to search for new southern class I methanol masers at 9.9, 25 (J=5) and
104 GHz, which are thought to trace more energetic conditions in the interface
regions of molecular outflows, than the widespread class I masers at 44 and 95
GHz. One source shows a clear outflow association.
