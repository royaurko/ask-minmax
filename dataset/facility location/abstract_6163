We work out boundary states for Type IIA string theory on a plane wave
background. By directly utilizing the channel duality, the induced conditions
from the open string boundary conditions are imposed on the boundary states.
The resulting boundary states correctly reproduce the partition functions of
the open string theory for $DpDp$ and $DpD\bar{p}$ cases where $Dp$ branes are
half BPS brane if located at the origin of the plane wave background.
