Project-X is the proposed high intensity proton facility to be built at
Fermilab, US. First stage of the Project-X consists of superconducting linac
which will be operated in continuous wave (CW) mode to accelerate the beam from
2.5 MeV to 3 GeV. The operation at CW mode puts high tolerances on the beam
line components, particularly on radiofrequency (RF) cavity. The failure of
beam line elements at low energy is very critical as it results in mis-match of
the beam with the following sections due to different beam parameters than
designed parameter. It makes the beam unstable which causes emittance dilution,
and ultimately results in beam losses. In worst case, it could affect the
reliability of the machine and may lead to the shutdown of the Linac to replace
the failed elements. Thus, it is important to study these effects and their
compensation to get smooth beam propagation in linac. This paper describes the
results of study performed for the failure of RF cavity & solenoid in SSR0
section.
