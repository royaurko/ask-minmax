The complexity of the atmosphere endows it with the property of turbulence by
virtue of which, wind speed variations in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL)
exhibit highly irregular fluctuations that persist over a wide range of
temporal and spatial scales. Despite the large and significant body of work on
microscale turbulence, understanding the statistics of atmospheric wind speed
variations has proved to be elusive and challenging. Knowledge about the nature
of wind speed at ABL has far reaching impact on several fields of research such
as meteorology, hydrology, agriculture, pollutant dispersion, and more
importantly wind energy generation. In the present study, temporal wind speed
records from twenty eight stations distributed through out the state of North
Dakota (ND, USA), ($\sim$ 70,000 square-miles) and spanning a period of nearly
eight years are analyzed. We show that these records exhibit a characteristic
broad multifractal spectrum irrespective of the geographical location and
topography. The rapid progression of air masses with distinct qualitative
characteristics originating from Polar regions, Gulf of Mexico and Northern
Pacific account for irregular changes in the local weather system in ND. We
hypothesize that one of the primary reasons for the observed multifractal
structure could be the irregular recurrence and confluence of these three air
masses.
