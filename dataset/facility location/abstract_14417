We present South Pole Telescope (SPT) observations of the five galaxy cluster
candidates in the southern hemisphere which were reported as unconfirmed in the
Planck Early Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (ESZ) sample. One cluster candidate, PLCKESZ
G255.62-46.16, is located in the 2500-square-degree SPT SZ survey region and
was reported previously as SPT-CL J0411-4819. For the remaining four
candidates, which are located outside of the SPT SZ survey region, we performed
short, dedicated SPT observations. Each of these four candidates was strongly
detected in maps made from these observations, with signal-to-noise ratios
ranging from 6.3 to 13.8. We have observed these four candidates on the
Magellan-Baade telescope and used these data to estimate cluster redshifts from
the red sequence. Resulting redshifts range from 0.24 to 0.46. We report
measurements of Y_0.75', the integrated Comptonization within a 0.75' radius,
for all five candidates. We also report X-ray luminosities calculated from
ROSAT All-Sky Survey catalog counts, as well as optical and improved SZ
coordinates for each candidate. The combination of SPT SZ measurements, optical
red-sequence measurements, and X-ray luminosity estimates demonstrates that
these five Planck ESZ cluster candidates do indeed correspond to real galaxy
clusters with redshifts and observable properties consistent with the rest of
the ESZ sample.
