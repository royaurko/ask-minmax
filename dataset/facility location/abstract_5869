We have performed Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) calculations to determine
the effect of quenched disorder on the superfluid density of a dilute 3D hard
sphere gas. The disorder was introduced by locating set of hard cylinders
randomly inside the simulation cell. Our results indicate that the disorder
leaves the superfluid critical temperature basically unchanged. Comparison to
experiments of helium in Vycor is made.
