The simplest high gain free electron laser (FEL) amplifier concept is
proposed. A klystron amplifier has the useful property that the various
electronic processes take place in separate portions of the amplifier, rather
than overlapping as in FEL amplifier with an uniform undulator. The klystron
consists of two fundamental parts: succession of 2-3 cascades (modulator), and
an output undulator (radiator) in which the modulated electron beam coherently
radiates. Each cascade consists of uniform undulator and dispersion section.
Unlike distributed optical klystrons, we have a high gain per cascade pass.
This has a few consequences. First, klystron gain does not depend on the bunch
compression in the injector linac, i.e. maximum gain per cascade pass at high
peak beam current is the same as at low peak beam current, without compression.
Conventional, short-wavelength FEL amplifier and distributed optical klystron
require electron beam peak current of a few kA. Second, there are no
requirements on the alignment of the cascade undulators and dispersion
sections, because, in our (high gain) case, there is no need for radiation
phase matching. There are applications, like XFELs, where the unique properties
of high gain klystron FEL amplifier are very desirable. Such a scheme allows
one to decrease the total length of the magnetic system. In this paper we
discuss also implementation of the proposed SASE FEL scheme for the frequency
multiplier, for femtosecond experiments, and multi-user soft X-ray facility.
