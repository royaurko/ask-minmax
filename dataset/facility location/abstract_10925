The SLIM experiment was a large array of nuclear track detectors located at
the Chacaltaya high altitude Laboratory (5230 m a.s.l.). The detector was in
particular sensitive to Intermediate Mass Magnetic Monopoles, with masses 10^5
< M <10^{12} GeV. From the analysis of the full detector exposed for more than
4 years a flux upper limit of 1.3 x 10^{-15} cm^{-2} s^{-1} sr^{-1} for
downgoing fast Intermediate Mass Monopoles was established at the 90% C.L.
