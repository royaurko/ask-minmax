The transition probability for the emission of a Bessel photon by an atomic
system is calculated within first order perturbation theory. We derive a closed
expression for the electromagnetic potentials beyond the paraxial approximation
that permits a systematic multipole approximation . The matrix elements between
center of mass and internal states are evaluated for some specially relevant
cases. This permits to clarify the feasibility of observing the rotational
effects of twisted light on atoms predicted by the calculations. It is shown
that the probability that the internal state of an atom acquires orbital
angular momentum from light is, in general, maximum for an atom located at the
axis of a Bessel mode. For a Gaussian packet, the relevant parameter is the
ratio of the spread of the atomic center of mass wave packet to the transversal
wavelength of the photon.
