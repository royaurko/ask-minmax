Within the macroscopic Landau-de Gennes approach, we examine the Gaussian
normal mode fluctuations of semi-infinite nematic liquid crystals in a regime
of critical wetting. It is argued that surface free-energy potentials that
strongly suppress the long-range nematic order favor the appearance of bound
biaxial nematic-director fluctuation modes, located in the domain occupied by
the thermodynamic phase wetting the wall. Instead, substrates enhancing the
orientational order promote the existence of uniaxial nematic-director local
excitations. Close to the phase coexistence temperature both types of local
exciations are strongly softened as compared to their bulk counterparts and
acquire characteristic cusplike low-energy spectra. These spectrum
peculiarities are directly connected to the critical behavior of the mean-field
interface position and can provide a valuable insight on the nature of surface
interactions and critical wetting phenomena in nematic liquid crystals.
Possible changes in the local director mode properties resulting from the
critical interface position fluctuations and order electricity effects are also
discussed.
