The main goal of the Andyrchy-BUST experiment is to study the primary cosmic
rays spectrum and composition around the knee. The experimental data on the
knee, as observed in the electromagnetic and high energy muon components, are
presented. The electromagnetic component in our experiment is measured using
the "Andyrchy" EAS array. High energy muon component (with 230 GeV threshold
energy of muons) is measured using the Baksan Underground Scintillation
Telescope (BUST). The location of the "Andyrchy" right above the BUST gives us
a possibility for simultaneous measurements of both EAS components.
