The current conceptual design of proposed Large EMCal of ALICE at LHC is
based largely on the scintillating mega-tile/fiber technology implemented in
CDF Endplug upgrade project and in both barrel and endcap electromagnetic
calorimeters of the STAR. The cost of scintillating material leads us to the
choice of extruded polystyrene based scintillator, which is available in new
FNAL-NICADD facility. Result of optical measurements, such as light yield and
light yield variation, show that it is possible to use this material as active
media of Large EMCal of ALICE at LHC.
