With the discovery of the Higgs boson, the spectrum of particles in the
Standard Model (SM) is complete. It is more important than ever to perform
precision measurements and to test for deviations from SM predictions in the
electroweak sector. In this report, we investigate two themes in the arena of
precision electroweak measurements: the electroweak precision observables
(EWPOs) that test the particle content and couplings in the SM and the minimal
supersymmetric SM, and the measurements involving multiple gauge bosons in the
final state which provide unique probes of the basic tenets of electroweak
symmetry breaking. Among the important EWPOs we focus our discussion on M_W and
sin^2 theta_eff^l, and on anomalous quartic gauge couplings probed by triboson
production and vector boson scattering. We investigate the thresholds of
precision that need to be achieved in order to be sensitive to new physics. We
study the precision that can be achieved at various facilities on these
observables. We discuss the calculational tools needed to predict SM rates and
distributions in order to perform these measurements at the required precision.
