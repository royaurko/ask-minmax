Micro-location is the process of locating any entity with high accuracy
(possibly in centimeters), while geofencing is the process of creating a
virtual fence around a so-called Point of Interest (PoI). In this paper, we
present an insight into various micro-location enabling technologies and
services. We also discuss how these can accelerate the incorporation of
Internet of Things (IoT) in smart buildings. We argue that micro-location based
location-aware solutions can play a significant role in facilitating the
tenants of an IoT equipped smart building. Also, such advanced technologies
will enable the smart building control system through minimal actions performed
by the tenants. We also highlight the existing and envisioned services to be
provided by using micro-location enabling technologies. We describe the
challenges and propose some potential solutions such that micro-location
enabling technologies and services are thoroughly integrated with IoT equipped
smart building.
