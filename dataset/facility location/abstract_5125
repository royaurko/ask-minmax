We present new proper motion and parallax measurements obtained with the
European VLBI Network (EVN) at 5$\,$GHz for the three isolated pulsars
B1929+10, B2020+28, and B2021+51. For B1929+10 we combined our data with
earlier VLBI measurements and confirm the robustness of the astrometric
parameters of this pulsar. For pulsars B2020+28 and B2021+51 our observations
indicate that both stars are almost a factor of two closer to the solar system
than previously thought, placing them at a distance of $1.39_{-0.06}^{+0.05}$
and $1.25_{-0.17}^{+0.14}\,$kpc. Using our new astrometry, we simulated the
orbits of all three pulsars in the Galactic potential with the aim to confirm
or reject previously proposed birth locations. Our observations ultimately rule
out a claimed binary origin of B1929+10 and the runaway star $\zeta$ Ophiuchi
in Upper Scorpius. A putative common binary origin of B2020+28 and B2021+51 in
the Cygnus Superbubble is also very unlikely.
