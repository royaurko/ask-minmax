The Pierre Auger Observatory is the largest observatory of high-energy cosmic
rays. It is located in Argentina and has been taking data since January 2004.
Extensive air showers initiated by cosmic rays are measured by the hybrid
detector, which combines the sampling of particle density at ground by
water-Cherenkov tanks and the measurement of atmospheric fluorescence light by
telescopes. New detection techniques, like radio and microwave measurement, are
also being tested. Results regarding the energy spectrum, mass composition and
arrival directions of cosmic rays are presented here.
