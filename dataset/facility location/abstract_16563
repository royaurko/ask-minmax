The hard X-ray (HXR) emission in solar flares comes almost exclusively from a
very small part of the flaring region, the footpoints of magnetic loops. Using
RHESSI observations of solar flare footpoints, we determine the radial
positions and sizes of footpoints as a function of energy in six near-limb
events to investigate the transport of flare accelerated electrons and the
properties of the chromosphere. HXR visibility forward fitting allows to find
the positions/heights and the sizes of HXR footpoints along and perpendicular
to the magnetic field of the flaring loop at different energies in the HXR
range. We show that in half of the analyzed events, a clear trend of decreasing
height of the sources with energy is found. Assuming collisional thick-target
transport, HXR sources are located between 600 and 1200 km above the
photosphere for photon energies between 120 and 25 keV respectively. In the
other events, the position as a function of energy is constant within the
uncertainties. The vertical sizes (along the path of electron propagation)
range from 1.3 to 8 arcseconds which is up to a factor 4 larger than predicted
by the thick-target model even in events where the positions/heights of HXR
sources are consistent with the collisional thick-target model. Magnetic
mirroring, collisional pitch angle scattering and X-ray albedo are discussed as
potential explanations of the findings.
