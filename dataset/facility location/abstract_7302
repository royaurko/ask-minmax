We present polaron effective masses and selected polaron band structures of
the Holstein molecular crystal model in 1-D as computed by the Global-Local
variational method over a wide range of parameters. These results are augmented
and supported by leading orders of both weak- and strong-coupling perturbation
theory. The description of the polaron effective mass and polaron band
distortion that emerges from this work is comprehensive, spanning weak,
intermediate, and strong electron-phonon coupling, and non-adiabatic, weakly
adiabatic, and strongly adiabatic regimes. Using the effective mass as the
primary criterion, the self-trapping transition is precisely defined and
located. Using related band-shape criteria at the Brillouin zone edge, the
onset of band narrowing is also precisely defined and located. These two lines
divide the polaron parameter space into three regimes of distinct polaron
structure, essentially constituting a polaron phase diagram. Though the
self-trapping transition is thusly shown to be a broad and smooth phenomenon at
finite parameter values, consistency with notion of self-trapping as a critical
phenomenon in the adiabatic limit is demonstrated. Generalizations to higher
dimensions are considered, and resolutions of apparent conflicts with
well-known expectations of adiabatic theory are suggested.
