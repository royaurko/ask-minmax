We study the Yang-Lee zeros of a random matrix partition function with the
global symmetries of the QCD partition function. We consider both zeros in the
complex chemical potential plane and in the complex mass plane. In both cases
we find that the zeros are located on a curve. In the thermodynamic limit, the
zeros appear to merge to form a cut. The shape of this limiting curve can be
obtained from a saddle-point analysis of the partition function. An explicit
solution for the line of zeros in the complex chemical potential plane at zero
mass is given in the form of a transcendental equation.
