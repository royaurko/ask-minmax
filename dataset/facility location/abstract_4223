We discuss the conditions under which 4D gravity is localized on domain walls
in 5D anti-de Sitter spaces. Our approach is based on considering the limits in
which the localized gravity decouples. We find that gravity is localized if the
wall is located a finite distance from the boundary of the anti-de Sitter space
and has a finite tension. In addition, it has to be a $\delta$-function source
of gravity.
