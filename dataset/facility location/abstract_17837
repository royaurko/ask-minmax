We present first results of a long term study: Searching for OB--type runaway
stars inside supernova remnants (SNRs). We identified spectral types and
measured radial velocities (RV) by optical spectroscopic observations and we
found an early type runaway star inside SNR S147. HD 37424 is a B0.5V type star
with a peculiar velocity of 74$\pm$8 km s$^{-1}$. Tracing back the past
trajectories via Monte Carlo simulations, we found that HD 37424 was located at
the same position as the central compact object, PSR J0538+2817, $30\!\pm\!4$
kyr ago. This position is only $\sim$4 arcmin away from the geometrical center
of the SNR. So, we suggest that HD 37424 was the pre--supernova binary
companion to the progenitor of the pulsar and the SNR. We found a distance of
1333$^{+103}_{-112}$ pc to the SNR. The zero age main sequence progenitor mass
should be greater than 13 $M_\odot$. The age is $30\pm4$ kyr and the total
visual absorption towards the center is 1.28$\pm$0.06 mag. For different
progenitor masses, we calculated the pre--supernova binary parameters. The
Roche Lobe radii suggest that it was an interacting binary in the late stages
of the progenitor.
