We study the ratio of bulk to shear viscosity in gluodynamics within a
phenomenological quasiparticle model. We show that at large temperatures this
ratio exhibits a quadratic dependence on the conformality measure as known from
weak coupling perturbative QCD. In the region of the deconfinement transition,
however, this dependence becomes linear as known from specific strongly coupled
theories. The onset of the strong coupling behavior is located near the maximum
of the scaled interaction measure. This qualitative behavior of the viscosity
ratio is rather insensitive to details of the equation of state.
