We study the coexisting smectic modulations and intra-unit-cell nematicity in
the pseudogap states of underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta}. By visualizing their
spatial components separately, we identified 2\pi topological defects
throughout the phase-fluctuating smectic states. Imaging the locations of large
numbers of these topological defects simultaneously with the fluctuations in
the intra-unit-cell nematicity revealed strong empirical evidence for a
coupling between them. From these observations, we propose a Ginzburg-Landau
functional describing this coupling and demonstrate how it can explain the
coexistence of the smectic and intra-unit-cell broken symmetries and also
correctly predict their interplay at the atomic scale. This theoretical
perspective can lead to unraveling the complexities of the phase diagram of
cuprate high-critical-temperature superconductors.
