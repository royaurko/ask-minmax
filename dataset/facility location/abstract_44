We present the results of the first exposure of a Liquid Argon TPC to a
multi-GeV neutrino beam. The data have been collected with a 50 liters
ICARUS-like chamber located between the CHORUS and NOMAD experiments at the
CERN West Area Neutrino Facility (WANF). We discuss both the instrumental
performance of the detector and its capability to identify and reconstruct low
multiplicity neutrino interactions.
