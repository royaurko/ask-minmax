This paper considers statistical estimation problems where the probability
distribution of the observed random variable is invariant with respect to
actions of a finite topological group. It is shown that any such distribution
must satisfy a restricted finite mixture representation. When specialized to
the case of distributions over the sphere that are invariant to the actions of
a finite spherical symmetry group $\mathcal G$, a group-invariant extension of
the Von Mises Fisher (VMF) distribution is obtained. The $\mathcal G$-invariant
VMF is parameterized by location and scale parameters that specify the
distribution's mean orientation and its concentration about the mean,
respectively. Using the restricted finite mixture representation these
parameters can be estimated using an Expectation Maximization (EM) maximum
likelihood (ML) estimation algorithm. This is illustrated for the problem of
mean crystal orientation estimation under the spherically symmetric group
associated with the crystal form, e.g., cubic or octahedral or hexahedral.
Simulations and experiments establish the advantages of the extended VMF EM-ML
estimator for data acquired by Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD)
microscopy of a polycrystalline Nickel alloy sample.
