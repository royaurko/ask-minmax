We present high spatial resolution mid-IR images of the ring of UCHII regions
in W49A obtained at Gemini North, allowing us to identify the driving source of
its powerful H2O maser outflow. These data also confirm our previous report
that several radio sources in the ring are undetected in the mid-IR because
they are embedded deep inside the cloud core. We locate the source of the water
maser outflow at the position of the compact mid-IR peak of source G (source
G:IRS1). This IR source is not coincident with any identified compact radio
continuum source, but is coincident with a hot molecular core, so we propose
that G:IRS1 is a hot core driving an outflow analogous to the wide-angle
bipolar outflow in OMC-1. G:IRS1 is at the origin of a larger bipolar cavity
and CO outflow. The water maser outflow is orthogonal to the bipolar CO cavity,
so the masers probably reside near its waist in the cavity walls. Models of the
IR emission require a massive protostar of 45Msun, 3e5Lsun, and an effective
envelope accretion rate of 1e-3Msun/yr. Feedback from the central star could
potentially drive the H2O maser outflow, but it has insufficient radiative
momentum to have driven the large-scale CO outflow, requiring that this massive
star had an active accretion disk over the past 10^4 yr. Combined with the
spatialy resolved morphology in IR images, G:IRS1 in W49 provides compelling
evidence for a massive protostar that formed by accreting from a disk,
accompanied by a bipolar outflow.
