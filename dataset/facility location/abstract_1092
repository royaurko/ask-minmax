Nonlinear N-body integrable Hamiltonian systems, where N is an arbitrary
number, attract the attention of mathematical physicists for the last several
decades, following the discovery of some number of these systems. This paper
presents a new integrable system, which can be realized in facilities such as
particle accelerators. This feature makes it more attractive than many of the
previous such systems with singular or unphysical forces.
