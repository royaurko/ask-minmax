We report on a total of 106 nights of optical interferometric observations of
the $\epsilon$ Aurigae system taken during the last 14 years by four beam
combiners at three different interferometric facilities. This long sequence of
data provides an ideal assessment of the system prior to, during, and after the
recent 2009-2011 eclipse. We have reconstructed model-independent images from
the 10 in-eclipse epochs which show that a disk-like object is indeed
responsible for the eclipse. Using new 3D, time-dependent modeling software, we
derive the properties of the F-star (diameter, limb darkening), determine
previously unknown orbital elements ($\Omega$, $i$), and access the global
structures of the optically thick portion of the eclipsing disk using both
geometric models and approximations of astrophysically relevant density
distributions. These models may be useful in future hydrodynamical modeling of
the system. Lastly, we address several outstanding research questions including
mid-eclipse brightening, possible shrinking of the F-type primary, and any
warps or sub-features within the disk.
