High-magnification gravitational microlensing events provide an important
channel of detecting planetary systems with multiple giants located at their
birth places. In order to investigate the potential existence of additional
planets, we reanalyze the light curves of the eight high-magnification
microlensing events for each of which a single planet was previously detected.
The analyzed events include OGLE-2005-BLG-071, OGLE-2005-BLG-169,
MOA-2007-BLG-400, MOA-2008-BLG-310, MOA-2009-BLG-319, MOA-2009-BLG-387,
MOA-2010-BLG-477, and MOA-2011-BLG-293. We find that including an additional
planet improves fits with $\Delta\chi^2 < 80$ for seven out of eight analyzed
events. For MOA-2009-BLG-319, the improvement is relatively big with
$\Delta\chi^2 \sim 143$. From inspection of the fits, we find that the
improvement of the fits is attributed to systematics in data. Although no clear
evidence of additional planets is found, it is still possible to constrain the
existence of additional planets in the parameter space. For this purpose, we
construct exclusion diagrams showing the confidence levels excluding the
existence of an additional planet as a function of its separation and mass
ratio. We also present the exclusion ranges of additional planets with 90\%
confidence level for Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus-mass planets.
