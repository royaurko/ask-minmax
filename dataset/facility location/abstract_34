The operations software group at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator
Facility faces a number of challenges common to facilities managing a large
body of software developed in-house. Developers include members of the software
group, operators, hardware engineers and accelerator physicists. One management
problem has been ensuring that all software has an identified maintainer who is
still working at the lab. In some cases, locating source code for 'orphaned'
software has also proven to be difficult. Other challenges include enforcing
minimal standards for versioning and documentation, segregating test software
from operational software, encouraging better code reuse, consolidating
input/output file storage and management, and tracking software dependencies.
This paper will describe a relational database model for tracking the
information necessary to solve the problems above. The instantiation of that
database model provides the foundation for various productivity- and
consistency- enhancing tools for automated (or at least assisted) building,
versioning, documenting and installation of software.
