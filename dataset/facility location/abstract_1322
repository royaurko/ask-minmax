Many basic key distribution schemes specifically tuned to wireless sensor
networks have been proposed in the literature. Recently, several researchers
have proposed schemes in which they have used group-based deployment models and
assumed predeployment knowledge of the expected locations of nodes. They have
shown that these schemes achieve better performance than the basic schemes, in
terms of connectivity, resilience against node capture and storage
requirements. But in many situations expected locations of nodes are not
available. In this paper we propose a solution which uses the basic scheme, but
does not use group-based deployment model and predeployment knowledge of the
locations of nodes, and yet performs better than schemes which make the
aforementioned assumptions.
  In our scheme, groups are formed after deployment of sensor nodes, on the
basis of their physical locations, and the nodes sample keys from disjoint key
pools. Compromise of a node affects secure links with other nodes that are part
of its group only. Because of this reason, our scheme performs better than the
basic schemes and the schemes using predeployment knowledge, in terms of
connectivity, storage requirement, and security. Moreover, the post-deployment
key generation process completes sooner than in schemes like LEAP+.
