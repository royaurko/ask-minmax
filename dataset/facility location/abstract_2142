Since their discovery, spicules have attracted increased attention as
energy/mass bridges between the dense and dynamic photosphere and the tenuous
hot solar corona. Mechanical energy of photospheric random and coherent motions
can be guided by magnetic field lines, spanning from the interior to the upper
parts of the solar atmosphere, in the form of waves and oscillations. Since
spicules are one of the most pronounced features of the chromosphere, the
energy transport they participate in can be traced by the observations of their
oscillatory motions. Oscillations in spicules have been observed for a long
time. However the recent high-resolutions and high-cadence space and ground
based facilities with superb spatial, temporal and spectral capacities brought
new aspects in the research of spicule dynamics. Here we review the progress
made in imaging and spectroscopic observations of waves and oscillations in
spicules. The observations are accompanied by a discussion on theoretical
modelling and interpretations of these oscillations. Finally, we embark on the
recent developments made on the presence and role of Alfven and kink waves in
spicules. We also address the extensive debate made on the Alfven versus kink
waves in the context of the explanation of the observed transverse oscillations
of spicule axes.
