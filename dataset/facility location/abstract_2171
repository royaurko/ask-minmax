The design and tests of Timing Counter elements for the upgrade of the MEG
experiment, MEG II,is presented. The detector is based on several small plates
of scintillator with a Silicon PhotoMultipliers dual-side readout. The
optimisation of the single counter elements (SiPMs, scintillators, geometry) is
described. Moreover, the results obtained with a first prototype tested at the
Beam Test Facility (BTF) of the INFN Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati (LNF) are
presented.
