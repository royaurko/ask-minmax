The goal of this paper is to develop a systematic method of locating the
Mueller matrices within the class of the matrices of the real group SL(4, R).
The main idea is to construct the general transformation of the group SL(4, R)
(whose real matrices have unit determinant) is straightforward, but to analyze
the adequacy of such a transformation for describing Mueller matrices is highly
nontrivial. However, using the technique of Dirac matrices, we can quite easy
and explicitly describe all the 16 one-parametric subgroups, from which, using
the all possible products, emerges the whole group SL(4, R). As a matter of
fact, for these separate 1-parametric subgroups the question of their adequacy
of describing Mueller matrices becomes sufficiently simple and thus we obtain
in each case a definite answer.
