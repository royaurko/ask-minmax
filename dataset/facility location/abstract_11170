Rotating spiral waves are a form of self-organization observed in spatially
extended systems of physical, chemical, and biological nature. A small
perturbation causes gradual change in spatial location of spiral's rotation
center and frequency, i.e. drift. The response functions (RFs) of a spiral wave
are the eigenfunctions of the adjoint linearized operator corresponding to the
critical eigenvalues $\lambda = 0, \pm i\omega$. The RFs describe the spiral's
sensitivity to small perturbations in the way that a spiral is insensitive to
small perturbations where its RFs are close to zero. The velocity of a spiral's
drift is proportional to the convolution of RFs with the perturbation. Here we
develop a regular and generic method of computing the RFs of stationary
rotating spirals in reaction-diffusion equations. We demonstrate the method on
the FitzHugh-Nagumo system and also show convergence of the method with respect
to the computational parameters, i.e. discretization steps and size of the
medium. The obtained RFs are localized at the spiral's core.
