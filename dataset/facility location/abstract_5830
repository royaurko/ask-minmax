We study the intensity distribution function, P(I), for monochromatic waves
propagating in quasi one-dimensional disordered medium, assuming that a point
source and a point detector are embedded in the bulk of the medium. We find
deviations from the Rayleigh statistics at moderately large I and a
logarithmically-normal asymptotic behavior of P(I). When the radiation source
and the detector are located close to the opposite edges of the sample (on a
distance much less then the sample length), an intermediate regime with a
stretched-exponential behavior of P(I) emerges.
