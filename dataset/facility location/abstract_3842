This paper presents a version of simple type theory called ${\cal Q}^{\rm
uqe}_{0}$ that is based on ${\cal Q}_0$, the elegant formulation of Church's
type theory created and extensively studied by Peter B. Andrews. ${\cal Q}^{\rm
uqe}_{0}$ directly formalizes the traditional approach to undefinedness in
which undefined expressions are treated as legitimate, nondenoting expressions
that can be components of meaningful statements. ${\cal Q}^{\rm uqe}_{0}$ is
also equipped with a facility for reasoning about the syntax of expressions
based on quotation and evaluation. Quotation is used to refer to a syntactic
value that represents the syntactic structure of an expression, and evaluation
is used to refer to the value of the expression that a syntactic value
represents. With quotation and evaluation it is possible to reason in ${\cal
Q}^{\rm uqe}_{0}$ about the interplay of the syntax and semantics of
expressions and, as a result, to formalize in ${\cal Q}^{\rm uqe}_{0}$
syntax-based mathematical algorithms. The paper gives the syntax and semantics
of ${\cal Q}^{\rm uqe}_{0}$ as well as a proof system for ${\cal Q}^{\rm
uqe}_{0}$. The proof system is shown to be sound for all formulas and complete
for formulas that do not contain evaluations. The paper also illustrates some
applications of ${\cal Q}^{\rm uqe}_{0}$.
