We present the results of a VLA search for HI emission in the circumstellar
envelopes of five nearby AGB stars: RS Cnc, IRC+10216, EP Aqr, R Cas, and R
Aqr. We have detected emission coincident in both position and velocity with RS
Cnc, implying that the emission arises from its extended envelope. For R Cas,
we detected weak emission that peaks at the stellar systemic velocity and
overlaps with the location of its circumstellar dust shell and thus is probably
related to the star. Toward IRC+10216 and EP Aqr, we detected multiple,
arcminute-scale HI emission features at velocities consistent with the
circumstellar envelopes, but spatially offset from the stellar positions; in
these cases we cannot determine unambiguously if the emission is associated
with the stars. In the case of IRC+10216, we were unable to confirm the
detection of HI in absorption against the cosmic background previously reported
by Le Bertre & Gerard. We detected our fifth target, R Aqr (a symbiotic
binary), in the 1.4 GHz continuum.
