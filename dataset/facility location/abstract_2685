Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently attracted attention due
to their interesting electronic and optical properties. Fabrication of these
materials in a reliable and facile method is important for future applications,
as are methods to characterize material quality. Here we present the chemical
vapor deposition of MoSe2 monolayer and few layer crystals. These results show
the practicality of using chemical vapor deposition to reliably fabricate these
materials. Low frequency Raman spectra and mapping of shear and layer breathing
modes of MoSe2 are presented for the first time. We correlate the behavior of
these modes with layer number in the materials. The usefulness of low frequency
Raman mapping to probe the symmetry, quality, and monolayer presence in CVD
grown 2D materials is emphasized.
