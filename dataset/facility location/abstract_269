Taking the established nonzero value of $\theta_{13}$, we study the
possibility of extracting the Dirac CP-violating phase by a beta beam facility
with a boost factor $100<\gamma<450$. We compare the performance of different
setups with different baselines, boost factors and detector technologies. We
find that an antineutrino beam from $^6$He decay with a baseline of $L=1300$ km
has a very promising CP discovery potential using a 500 kton Water Cherenkov
(WC) detector. Fortunately this baseline corresponds to the distance between
FermiLAB to Sanford underground research facility in South Dakota.
