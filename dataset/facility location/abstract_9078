The status and capabilities of the KASCADE-Grande extensive air shower
experiment are presented. The installation is located at Forschungszentrum
Karlsruhe and comprises a large collecting area (0.5 km^2) electromagnetic
array (Grande) operated jointly with the existing KASCADE detectors.
KASCADE-Grande will cover the primary energy range 10^16 eV < E_0 < 10^18 eV
overlapping with KASCADE around 10^16 eV, thus providing continuous information
on the primary energy and mass of cosmic rays from 3x10^14 eV up to 10^18 eV.
The major goal of the measurements is the unambiguous observation of the``iron
knee'' expected in the cosmic ray spectrum at E_k^{Fe} ~ 10^17 eV.
