We present the spectra, positions, and finding charts for 31 bright (R<19.3)
colour-selected quasars covering the redshift range z=3.85-4.78, with 4 having
redshifts z>4.5. The majority are in the southern sky (dec<-25 deg). The quasar
candidates were selected for their red (B-R > 2.5) colours from UK or POSSII
Schmidt Plates scanned at the Automated Plate Measuring facility in Cambridge.
Low resolution (~> 10A) spectra were obtained to identify the quasars,
primarily at the Las Campanas Observatory. The highest redshift quasar in our
survey is at z ~ 4.8 (R = 18.7) and its spectrum shows a damped Lyman-alpha
absorption system at z = 4.46. This is currently the highest redshift damped
Lyman-alpha absorber detected. Five of these quasars exhibit intrinsic broad
absorption line features. Combined with the previously published results from
the first part of the APM UKST survey we have now surveyed a total of ~8000 squ
deg of sky i.e. 40% of the high galactic latitude (|b|>30 deg) sky, resulting
in 59 optically selected quasars in the redshift range 3.85 to 4.78; 49 of
which have z>=4.00.
