We investigate drop impact dynamics near both closed pits and open- ended
pores experimentally. The resulting impact phenomena differ greatly for a pit
or a pore. For the first, we observe three phenomena: a splash, a jet and an
air bubble, whose appearance depends on the distance between impact location
and pit. Furthermore, we found that splash velocities can reach up to seven
times the impact velocity. Drop impact near a pore, however, results solely in
splashing. Surprisingly, two distinct and disconnected splashing regimes occur,
with a region of plain spreading in-between. For pores, splashes are less
pronounced than in the pit case. We state that, for the pit case, the presence
of air inside the pit plays a crucial role: it promotes splashing and allows
for air bubbles to appear.
