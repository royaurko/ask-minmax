We present an initial test of a new type of a pre-bunched beam pumped free
electron maser based on Stimulated Coherent Diffraction Radiation (SCDR)
generated in an open resonator. An ultra-fast Schottky Barrier Diode (time
response $<1\,$ns) has enabled to investigate the properties of the radiation
stored in the cavity as well as the intrinsic properties of the cavity itself.
We observed a turn-by-turn SCDR generated by a multibunch beam. When the cavity
length was exactly a half of the bunch spacing a clear resonance was observed.
Moreover, turn-by-turn measurements revealed the cavity quality factor of
$72.88$, which was rather high for an open resonator in the wavelength range of
$3-5\,$mm. An exponential growth of the photon intensity as a function of the
number of bunches was also demonstrated.
