We present ATCA radio observations of the giant radio galaxy J0116-473 at 12
and 22 cm wavelengths in total intensity and polarization. The images clearly
reveal a bright inner-double structure within more extended edge-brightened
lobe emission. The lack of hotspots at the ends of the outer lobes, the strong
core and the inner-double structure with its edge-brightened morphology lead us
to suggest that this giant radio galaxy is undergoing a renewed nuclear
activity: J0116-473 appears to be a striking example of a radio galaxy where a
young double source is evolving within older lobe material. We also report the
detection of a Mpc-long linear feature which is oriented perpendicular to the
radio axis and has a high fractional polarization.
