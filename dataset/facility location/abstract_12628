Mobile Advertisement is a location-aware dissemination solution built on top
of a vehicular ad-hoc network. We envision a network of WiFi access points that
dynamically disseminate data to clients running on the car's smart device. The
approach can be considered an alternative to the static advertisement
billboards and can be useful to business companies wanting to dynamically
advertise their products and offers to people driving their car. The clients
can subscribe to information based on specific topics. We present design
solutions that use access points as emitters for transmitting messages to
wireless-enabled devices equipped on vehicles. We also present implementation
details for the evaluation of the proposed solution using a simulator designed
for VANET application. The results show that the application can be used for
transferring a significant amount of data even under difficult conditions, such
as when cars are moving at increased speeds, or the congested Wi-Fi network
causes significant packet loss.
