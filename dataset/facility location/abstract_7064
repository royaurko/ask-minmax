Scenarios for controllable creation, trapping and holding of single and
multiple solitons in a specially designed nonlinear Bragg grating (BG) are
proposed. The setting includes a chirped BG segment, which is linked via a
local defect to a uniform BG with a built-in array of defects. A parabolic
relation between the trapping position of the incident soliton and its power is
obtained. Simultaneous trapping of two and three solitons at different
locations is demonstrated too.
