In order to nullify the property of randomness perceived in the dispersion of
gamma-ray bursts (GRB's) we introduce two new procedures. 1. Create a segmented
group of sequentially linked GRB's and quantify the resultant angles. 2. Create
segmented groups of sequentially linked GRB's in order to identify the location
of GRB's that are positioned at equidistance, by using the selected GRB as the
origin for a paired point circle, where the circumference of said circle
intercepts the location of other GRB's in the same group.
