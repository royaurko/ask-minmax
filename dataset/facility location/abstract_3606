A muon collider would be a powerful tool for exploring the energy-frontier
with leptons, and would complement the studies now under way at the LHC. Such a
device would offer several important benefits. Muons, like electrons, are point
particles so the full center-of-mass energy is available for particle
production. Moreover, on account of their higher mass, muons give rise to very
little synchrotron radiation and produce very little beamstrahlung. The first
feature permits the use of a circular collider that can make efficient use of
the expensive rf system and whose footprint is compatible with an existing
laboratory site. The second feature leads to a relatively narrow energy spread
at the collision point. Designing an accelerator complex for a muon collider is
a challenging task. Firstly, the muons are produced as a tertiary beam, so a
high-power proton beam and a target that can withstand it are needed to provide
the required luminosity of ~1 \times 10^34 cm^-2s^-1. Secondly, the beam is
initially produced with a large 6D phase space, which necessitates a scheme for
reducing the muon beam emittance ("cooling"). Finally, the muon has a short
lifetime so all beam manipulations must be done very rapidly. The Muon
Accelerator Program, led by Fermilab and including a number of U.S. national
laboratories and universities, has undertaken design and R&D activities aimed
toward the eventual construction of a muon collider. Design features of such a
facility and the supporting R&D program are described.
