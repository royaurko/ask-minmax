Black hole lensing and gravitational waves are, respectively, closely
dependent of the property of the lens and radiation source. In this letter, a
universal relation between them is established for a rotating black hole acting
simultaneously as a lens and a gravitational wave source, in an asymptotically
flat spacetime. The relation only relies on the lens geometry and observable,
while is independent of the specific nature of the black hole. Therefore, the
possible gravitational wave sources could be located with modern astronomical
instrument from the side of the lensing without knowing the specific nature of
the black hole lens. Moreover, the low bound of the frequency of the
gravitational waves can also be well determined.
