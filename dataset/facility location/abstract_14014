Recent theoretical and experimental studies suggest that SmB$_6$ is the first
topological Kondo insulator: A material in which the interaction between
localized and itinerant electrons renders the bulk insulating at low
temperature, while topological surface states leave the surface metallic. While
this would elegantly explain the material's puzzling conductivity, we find the
experimentally observed candidates for both predicted topological surface
states to be of trivial character instead: The surface state at $\bar{\Gamma}$
is very heavy and shallow with a mere $\sim 2$ meV binding energy. It exhibits
large Rashba splitting which excludes a topological nature. We further
demonstrate that the other metallic surface state, located at $\bar{X}$, is not
an independent in-gap state as supposed previously, but part of a massive band
with much higher binding energy (1.7 eV). We show that it remains metallic down
to 1 K due to reduced hybridization with the energy-shifted surface 4$f$ level.
