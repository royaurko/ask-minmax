Several nearby individual low column density interstellar cloudlets have been
identified based on kinematical features evident in high-resolution CaII
observations near the Sun. One of these cloudlets, the ``Aquila-Ophiuchus''
cloud, is within 5 pc of the Sun and located in the solar apex direction. The
velocity vector of this Apex Cloud is reevaluated and components at this
velocity are found towards 17 stars with distances 1--60 pc, and located
primarily in the galactic center hemisphere. The Apex Cloud is the most likely
candidate for the ``next'' interstellar cloud to be encountered by the Sun.
