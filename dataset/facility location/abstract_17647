Supernova fallback disks around neutron stars have been discussed to
influence the evolution of the diverse neutron star populations. Slowly
rotating neutron stars are most promising to find such disks. Searching for the
cold and warm debris of old fallback disks, we carried out Herschel PACS (70
$\mu$m, 160 $\mu$m) and Spitzer IRAC (3.6 $\mu$m, 4.5 $\mu$m) observations of
eight slowly rotating ($P\approx 3 - 11$ s) nearby ($<1$ kpc) isolated neutron
stars. Herschel detected 160 $\mu$m emission ($>5\sigma$) at locations
consistent with the positions of the neutron stars RX J0806.4-4123 and RX
J2143.0+0654. No other significant infrared emission was detected from the
eight neutron stars. We estimate probabilities of 63%, 33% and 3% that,
respectively, none, one, or both Herschel PACS 160 $\mu$m detections are
unrelated excess sources due to background source confusion or an interstellar
cirrus. If the 160 $\mu$m emission is indeed related to cold (10 K to 22 K)
dust around the neutron stars, this dust is absorbing and re-emitting $\sim
10$% to $\sim 20$% of the neutron stars' X-rays. Such high efficiencies would
be at least three orders of magnitude larger than the efficiencies of debris
disks around nondegenerate stars. While thin dusty disks around the neutron
stars can be excluded as counterparts of the 160 $\mu$m emission, dusty
asteroid belts constitute a viable option.
