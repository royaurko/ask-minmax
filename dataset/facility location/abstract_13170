In this paper we introduce the real valued real analytic function kappa(t)
implicitly defined by exp(2 pi i kappa(t)) = -exp(-2 i theta(t)) *
(zeta'(1/2-it)/zeta'(1/2+it)) and kappa(0)=-1/2. (where theta(t) is the
function appearing in the known formula zeta(1/2+it)= Z(t) * e^{-i theta(t)}).
By studying the equation kappa(t) = n (without making any unproved hypotheses),
we will show that (and how) this function is closely related to the (exact)
position of the zeros of Riemann's zeta(s) and zeta'(s). Assuming the Riemann
hypothesis and the simplicity of the zeros of zeta(s), it will follow that the
ordinate of the zero 1/2 + i gamma_n of zeta(s) will be the unique solution to
the equation kappa(t) = n.
