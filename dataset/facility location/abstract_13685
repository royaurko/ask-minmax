The propagation of linear Alfv\'en wave pulses in an inhomogeneous plasma
near a 2D coronal null point is investigated. When a uniform plasma density is
considered, it is seen that an initially planar Alfv\'en wavefront remains
planar, despite the varying equilibrium Alfv\'en speed, and that all the wave
collects at the separatrices. Thus, in the non-ideal case, these Alfv\'enic
disturbances preferentially dissipate their energy at these locations. For a
non-uniform equilibrium density, it is found that the Alfv\'en wavefront is
significantly distorted away from the initially planar geometry, inviting the
possibility of dissipation due to phase mixing. Despite this however, we
conclude that for the Alfv\'en wave, current density accumulation and
preferential heating still primarily occur at the separatrices, even when an
extremely non-uniform density profile is considered.
