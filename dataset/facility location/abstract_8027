We use extensive 350 um polarimetry and continuum maps obtained with Hertz
and SHARC II along with HCN and HCO+ spectroscopic data to trace the
orientation of the magnetic field in the Orion A star-forming region. Using the
polarimetry data, we find that the direction of the projection of the magnetic
field in the plane of the sky relative to the orientation of the
integral-shaped filament varies considerably as one moves from north to south.
While in IRAS 05327-0457 and OMC-3 MMS 1-6 the projection of the field is
primarily perpendicular to the filament it becomes better aligned with it at
OMC-3 MMS 8-9 and well aligned with it at OMC-2 FIR 6. The OMC-2 FIR 4 cloud,
located between the last two, is a peculiar object where we find almost no
polarization. The projected angle of the field is more complicated in OMC-1
where it exhibits smooth variations in its orientation across the face of this
massive complex. By combining the polarimetry and spectroscopic data we were
able to measure a set of average values for the inclination angle of the
magnetic field relative to the line of sight. We find that the field is
oriented quite close to the plane of the sky in most places. More precisely,
the inclination of the magnetic field is ~73 deg. around OMC-3 MMS 6, ~74 deg.
at OMC-3 MMS 8-9, ~80 deg. at OMC-2 FIR 4, ~65 deg. in the northeastern part of
OMC-1, and ~49 deg. in the Bar. We also present polarimetry data for the OMC-4
region located some 13 arcminutes south of OMC-1.
