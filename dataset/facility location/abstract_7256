We present multi--frequency radio observational results of the quasar 3C~48.
The observations were carried out with the Very Large Array (VLA) at five
frequencies of 0.33, 1.5, 4.8, 8.4, and 22.5 GHz, and with the Multi--Element
Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) at the two frequencies of 1.6 and
5 GHz. The source shows a one--sided jet to the north within 1\arcsec, which
then extends to the northeast and becomes diffuse. Two bright components (N2
and N3), containing most of the flux density are present in the northern jet.
The spectral index of the two components is $\alpha_{N2}\sim-0.99\pm0.12$ and
$\alpha_{N3}\sim-0.84\pm0.23$ ($S\propto\nu^{\alpha}$). Our images show the
presence of an extended structure surrounding component N2, suggestive of
strong interaction between the jet and the interstellar medium (ISM) of the
host galaxy. A steep--spectrum component, labelled as S, located 0.25 ardsec
southwest to the flat--spectrum component which could be the core of 3C 48, is
detected at a significance of $>15\sigma$. Both the location and the steepness
of the spectrum of component S suggest the presence of a counter--jet in 3C 48.
