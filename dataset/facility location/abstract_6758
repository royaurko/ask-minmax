The ANTARES underwater neutrino telescope is located in the Mediterranean Sea
about 40 km from Toulon at a depth of 2475 m. In its 12 line configuration it
has almost 900 photomultipliers in 275 "floors". The performance of the
detector is discussed and several results are presented, including the
measurements of downgoing muons, search for a diffuse flux of high energy muon
neutrinos, search for cosmic point sources of neutrinos, search for fast
magnetic monopoles, etc. A short discussion is also made on Earth and Sea
Science studies with a neutrino telescope.
