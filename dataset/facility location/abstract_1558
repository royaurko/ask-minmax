Results of reflectivity measurements of mosaic crystal samples of Cu (111)
are reported. These tests were performed in the context of a feasibility study
of a hard X-ray focusing telescope for space astronomy with energy passband
from 60 to 600 keV. The technique envisaged is that of using mosaic crystals in
transmission configuration that diffract X-rays for Bragg diffraction (Laue
lens). The Laue lens assumed has a spherical shape with focal length $f$. It is
made of flat mosaic crystal tiles suitably positioned in the lens. The samples
were grown and worked for this project at the Institute Laue-Langevin (ILL) in
Grenoble (France), while the reflectivity tests were performed at the X-ray
facility of the Physics Department of the University of Ferrara.
