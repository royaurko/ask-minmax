We discuss the possibility to launch outflows from the close vicinity of a
protoplanetary core considering a scenario where the protoplanet surrounded by
a circum-planetary accretion disk is located in a circum-stellar disk. For the
circum-planetary disk accretion rate we assume 6x10^{-5} M_jup/yr, implying
peak disk temperatures of about 2000K. The estimated disk ionization degree and
Reynolds number allow for a sufficient coupling between the disk matter and the
magnetic field. We find that the surface magnetic field strength of the
protoplanet is probably not more than 10 G, indicating that the global
planetary magnetosphere is dominated by the circum-planetary disk magnetic
field below 50 G. The estimated field strength and mass flow rates allow for
asymptotic outflow velocities of 60 km/s. The overall outflow geometry will
resemble a hollow tube or cone perpendicular the disk. Outflows from
circum-planetary disks may be visible in shock excited emission lines along a
tube of diameter of the orbital radius and thickness of about 100
protoplanetary radii. Energetically, protoplanetary outflows cannot survive the
interaction with a protostellar outflow. Due to the efficient angular momentum
removal by the outflow, we expect the protoplanetary outflow to influence the
early planet angular momentum evolution.
