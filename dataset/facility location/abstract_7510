At T$_0$ = 17.5 K an exotic phase emerges from a heavy fermion state in
{\ur}. The nature of this hidden order (HO) phase has so far evaded
explanation. Formation of an unknown quasiparticle (QP) structure is believed
to be responsible for the massive removal of entropy at HO transition, however,
experiments and ab-initio calculations have been unable to reveal the essential
character of the QP. Here we use femtosecond pump-probe time- and
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) to elucidate the ultrafast
dynamics of the QP. We show how the Fermi surface is renormalized by shifting
states away from the Fermi level at specific locations, characterized by vector
$q_{<110>} = 0.56 \pm 0.08$ {\an}. Measurements of the temperature-time
response reveal that upon entering the HO the QP lifetime in those locations
increases from 42 fs to few hundred fs. The formation of the long-lived QPs is
identified here as a principal actor of the HO.
