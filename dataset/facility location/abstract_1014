We describe characteristics and performance of the low-noise front-end
preamplifier used in the ICARUS 50-litre liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber
installed in the CERN West Area Neutrino Facility during the 1997-98 neutrino
runs. The preamplifiers were designed to work immersed in ultra-pure liquid
Argon at a temperature of 87K.
