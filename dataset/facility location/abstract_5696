A new generation of low threshold Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes
(IACTs) may reach gamma-ray energies about 10 GeV with high sensitivities and
very large collection areas. At these low energies cosmic electrons
significantly contribute to the telescope background and are in principle
indistinguishable from gamma-rays. In this paper we estimate the electron
background expected for two configurations of the low energy IACT MAGIC. We
discuss in particular the reduction of the background caused by the geomagnetic
field at different locations on the Earth's surface.
