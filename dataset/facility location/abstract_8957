We present results of Hubble Space Telescope observations of the radio galaxy
3C 244.1. The broadband F702W (R) and F555W (V) images (WFPC2/PC) show an
elliptical galaxy and gaseous filaments and blobs surrounding it. In the
narrow-band ramp filter, dominated by [OIII]lambda5007, these filaments are
bright and have the same morphology as the broad band images. To the south, the
filaments have a cone-shaped structure and the radio jet is located at the
center of this cone. To the north of the galaxy, the structure is found near
the nucleus of the galaxy within its elliptical profile. From the photometry,
the two brighter structures seem to be extended narrow line emission regions
(ENLRs). The comparison with diagnostic line ratios shows that the observed
emission is consistent with interactions between the expanding radio-jet and
the local denser medium.
