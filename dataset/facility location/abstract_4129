We investigate a spectrum oligopoly market where each primary seeks to sell
secondary access to its channel at multiple locations. Transmission qualities
of a channel evolve randomly. Each primary needs to select a price and a set of
non-interfering locations (which is the independent set in the conflict graph
of the region) at which to offer its channel without knowing the transmission
qualities of the channels of its competitors. At each location each secondary
selects a channel depending on the price and the quality of the channels. We
formulate the above problem as a non-cooperative game. We focus on a class of
conflict graphs, known as mean valid graphs which commonly arise in practice.
We explicitly compute a symmetric Nash equilibrium (NE) that selects only a
small number of independent sets with positive probability. The NE is threshold
type in that primaries only choose independent set whose cardinality is greater
than a certain threshold. The threshold on the cardinality increases with
increase in quality of the channel on sale. We show that the NE strategy
profile is unique in a special class of conflict graph (linear graph) which
commonly arises in practice.
