When giant planets form, they grow by accreting gas and dust. HD 142527 is a
young star that offers a scaled-up view of this process. It has a broad,
asymmetric ring of gas and dust beyond \about 100 AU and a wide inner gap.
Within the gap, a low-mass stellar companion orbits the primary star at just
\about 12 AU, and both the primary and secondary are accreting gas. In an
attempt to directly detect the dusty counterpart to this accreted gas, we have
observed HD 142527 with the Gemini Planet Imager in polarized light at $Y$ band
(0.95-1.14 \microns). We clearly detect the companion in total intensity and
show that its position and photometry are generally consistent with the
expected values. We also detect a point-source in polarized light that may be
spatially separated by \about a few AU from the location of the companion in
total intensity. This suggests that dust is likely falling onto or orbiting the
companion. Given the possible contribution of scattered light from this dust to
previously reported photometry of the companion, the current mass limits should
be viewed as upper limits only. If the dust near the companion is eventually
confirmed to be spatially separated, this system would resemble a scaled-up
version of the young planetary system inside the gap of the transition disk
around LkCa 15.
