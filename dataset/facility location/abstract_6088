We study the neutrino interaction rates through charged as well as neutral
current weak interactions in hot, dense magnetized matter. At densities near
the neutrino sphere, matter in the presence of intense magnetic field is
polarized and electrons and protons typically occupy the lowest Landau level.
The weak interaction rates in such a situation are severally modified leading
to a sizable change in neutrino opacity and consequently on the location of the
neutrino sphere which also gets distorted. This has implications for pulsar
velocity explanations.
