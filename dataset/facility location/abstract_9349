The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect N ~ 22
[x10^(+/- 1)] close white dwarf binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)
through their gravitational radiation with signal-to-noise ratios greater than
10 in observational durations of 3 years or more. In addition to chirp mass,
location on the sky, and other binary parameters, the distance to each binary
is an independent parameter that can be extracted from an analysis of
gravitational waves from these binaries. Using a sample of binaries, one can
establish the mean distance to the LMC as well as the variance of this
distance. Assuming no confusion noise at frequencies above 2 mHz, LISA might
determine the LMC distance to ~ 4.5 (N/22)^(1/2)% and the line of sight extent
of LMC to ~ 15 (N/22)^(1/4)$%, relative to its distance, at the one-sigma
confidence. These estimates are competitive to some of the proposed direct
geometric techniques to measure LMC distance in future with missions such as
SIM and GAIA.
