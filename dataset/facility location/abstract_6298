Inspired by a result in the same contributor's previous work q-alg/9604009, we
locate two $ k[q,q^{-1}] $--integer forms of $ F_q[SL(n+1)] $, along with a
presentation by generators and relations, and prove that for $ q=1 $ they
specialize to $ U({\frak h}) $, where $ {\frak h} $ is the Lie bialgebra of the
Poisson Lie group $ H $ dual of $ SL(n+1) $; moreover, we explain the relation
with [loc.cit.]. In sight of this, we prove two PBW-like theorems for $
F_q[SL(n+1)] $, both related to the classical PBW theorem for $ U({\frak h}) $.
