The Earth's preseismic oscillating (T = 24h) electric field recorded for a
short-time period of some days is analyzed in terms of its intensity vector
azimuthal direction calculated at one monitoring site. The calculated azimuthal
directions are compared to the concurrent seismicity observed for the same
period of time. Examples are presented for proving the agreement between the
electric field intensity vectors calculated azimuths and the corresponding ones
referring to the EQs - monitoring site location. Finally, an example is
presented on account of the use of this methodology upon three different
monitoring sites for the utilization of the estimation of the epicentral area
of a large future EQ at the Methoni, Greece seismogenic area.
