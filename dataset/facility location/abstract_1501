We describe an extensive FUSE survey of highly ionized oxygen in the vicinity
of the Milky Way that serves as an example of the type of study that would be
desirable for other galactic systems. Understanding the origin of hot gas in
the vicinity of galaxies and its relationship to the intergalactic medium
presents a major observational challenge. Ultraviolet absorption-line
spectroscopy is currently the most direct means for comprehensive
investigations of the gas in galactic environments, but even with present (and
near-term) facilities the number of background objects available to probe
nearby galaxy halos and low-redshift cosmological structures is limited.
Studying these structures over a range of impact parameters and angular
separations would provide fundamental information about the baryonic content of
the hot gas, its physical conditions, and its origins. A large space telescope
optimized for high resolution spectroscopy in the 900-3200 Angstrom wavelength
region at a sensitivity sufficient to observe faint AGNs/QSOs at angular
separations of <1 degree would be ideal for such studies.
