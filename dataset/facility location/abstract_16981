Atmospheric flows exhibit scale-free fractal fluctuations. A general systems
theory based on classical statistical physical concepts visualizes the fractal
fluctuations to result from the coexistence of eddy fluctuations in an eddy
continuum, the larger scale eddies being the integrated mean of enclosed
smaller scale eddies. The model predicts (i) the eddy energy (variance)
spectrum and corresponding eddy amplitude probability distribution are
quantified by the same universal inverse power law distribution incorporating
the golden mean. (ii) The steady state ordered hierarchical growth of
atmospheric eddy continuum is associated with maximum entropy production. (iii)
atmospheric particulate size spectrum is derived in terms of the model
predicted universal inverse power law for atmospheric eddy energy spectrum.
Model predictions are in agreement with observations. Universal inverse power
law for power spectra of fractal fluctuations rules out linear secular trends
in meteorological parameters. Global warming related climate change, if any,
will be manifested as intensification of fluctuations of all scales manifested
immediately in high frequency fluctuations. The universal aerosol size spectrum
presented in this paper may be computed for any location with two measured
parameters, namely, the mean volume radius and the total number concentration
and may be incorporated in climate models for computation of radiation budget
of earth-atmosphere system.
