We report simultaneous H110alpha and H2CO line observations with the NRAO
Green Bank Telescope toward 72 H II regions in the SPITZER/GLIMPSE survey area
(|l| = 10 deg - 65 deg and |b| </= 1 deg). We used the H110alpha line to
establish the velocity of the H II regions and H2CO absorption lines to
distinguish between near and far distances. We examined the projected location
of H II regions whose distance ambiguities have been resolved (in this work and
other similar studies) in the Galactic plane and in a longitude-velocity
diagram for a recognizable spiral arm pattern. Although the highest density of
points in the position-position plot approximately follows the spiral arms
proposed by Taylor and Cordes (1993), the dispersion is still about as large as
the separation between their proposed arms. The longitude-velocity plot shows
an increase in the density of sources at the points where the spiral arm loci
proposed by Taylor and Cordes (1993) are approaching the locus of tangent point
velocities and a lower density between the arm loci. However, it is not
possible to trace spiral arms over significant segments of Galactic longitude
in the longitude-velocity plot. We conclude that a very large number of H II
regions in combination with more sophisticated Galactic rotation models will be
required to obtain a more continuous spiral pattern from kinematic studies of H
II regions than from fully sampled surveys of H I or CO.
