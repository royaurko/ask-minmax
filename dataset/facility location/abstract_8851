We present a sample of 76 double-mode Cepheids detected in the 4.5 square
degree area in the central part of the LMC. 19 stars from the sample pulsate in
the fundamental mode and the first overtone while 57 objects are the first and
second overtone pulsators.
  We analyze the period ratio of double-mode Cepheids and Fourier parameters of
decomposition of the light curves of these objects. We also present location of
different type Cepheids from the LMC in the color-magnitude diagram and show
the distribution of their ${V-I}$ color indices.
