Background: Identifying all possible mapping locations of next-generation
sequencing (NGS) reads is highly essential in several applications such as
prediction of genomic variants or protein binding motifs located in repeat
regions, isoform expression quantification, metagenomics analysis, etc.
However, this task is very time-consuming and majority of mapping tools only
focus on one or a few best mapping locations. Results: We propose AMAS, an
alignment tool specialized in identifying all possible mapping locations of NGS
reads in a reference sequence. AMAS features an effective use of adaptive seeds
to speed up read mapping while preserving sensitivity. Specifically, an index
is designed to pre-store the locations of adaptive seeds in the reference
sequence, efficiently reducing the time for seed matching and partitioning. An
accurate filtration of adaptive seeds is further applied to substantially
tighten the candidate alignment space. As a result, AMAS runs several times
faster than other state-of-the-art read mappers while achieving similar
accuracy. Conclusions: AMAS provides a valuable resource to speed up the
important yet time-consuming task of identifying all mapping locations of NGS
reads. AMAS is implemented in C++ based on the SeqAn library and is freely
available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngsamas/. Keywords:
