To further study neutrino oscillation properties a Beta Beam facility has
been proposed. Beta decaying ions with high kinetic energy are stored in a
storage ring ("Decay Ring") with straight sections to create pure focused
(anti) electron neutrino beams. However to reach high sensitivity to neutrino
oscillation parameters in the experiment the bunched beam intensity and duty
cycle in the DR have to be optimized. The first CERN-based scenario, using 6He
and 18Ne as neutrino sources, has been studied using a bunch merging RF scheme.
Two RF cavities at different frequencies are used to capture newly injected
bunches and then merge them into the stored bunches. It was shown that this
scheme could satisfy the requirements on intensity and duty cycle set by the
experiment. This merging scheme has now been revised with new simulation
software providing new results for 6He and 18Ne. Furthermore bunch merging has
been studied for the second CERN-based scenario using 8Li and 8B.
