We propose a method to study lattice QCD at finite temperature (T) and
chemical potential (\mu). We compare the method with direct results and with
the Glasgow method by using n_f=4 QCD at Im(\mu)\neq0. We locate the critical
endpoint (E) of QCD on the Re(\mu)-T plane. We use n_f=2+1 dynamical staggered
quarks with semi-realistic masses on L_t=4 lattices. Our results are based on
{\cal{O}}(10^3-10^4) configurations.
