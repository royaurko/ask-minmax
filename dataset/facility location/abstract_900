The Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) facility at Fermilab began
operations in late 2004. NuMI will deliver an intense muon neutrino beam of
variable energy (2-20 GeV). Several aspects of the design and results from runs
of the MINOS experiment are reviewed. I also discuss technique to measure
directly the neutrino flux using a muon flux system at the end of the NuMI
line.
