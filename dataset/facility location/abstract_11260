We present the Suzaku results on a new candidate of a supernova remnant (SNR)
in the Sagittarius C region. We detected diffuse X-rays of an elliptical shape
(G359.41-0.12) and a chimney-like structure (the Chimney), both of which were
fitted with a thin thermal the model of kBT ~1 keV temperature. The absorption
columns are same between these two structures, indicating that both are located
at the same distance in the same line of sight. The narrow band image and
one-dimensional profile of S XV Kalpha at 2.45 keV show that the Chimney is
emanating from G359.41-0.12. Therefore, these two sources are physically
connected with each other. The sum of the thermal energies of the Chimney and
G359.41-0.12 is estimated to be 1.4x10^50 erg, typical for a galactic SNR.
G359.41-0.12 is likely to be a new SNR candidate and the Chimney is an
associated outflow.
