We compare the soft diffuse X-ray emission from Chandra images of 12 nearby
intermediate inclination spiral galaxies to the morphology seen in Halpha,
molecular gas, and mid-infrared emission. We find that diffuse X-ray emission
is often located along spiral arms in the outer parts of spiral galaxies but
tends to be distributed in a rounder morphology in the center. The X-ray
morphology in the spiral arms matches that seen in the mid-infrared or Halpha
and so implies that the X-ray emission is associated with recent active star
formation. We see no strong evidence for X-ray emission trailing the location
of high mass star formation in spiral arms. However, population synthesis
models predict a high mechanical energy output rate from supernovae for a time
period that is about 10 times longer than the lifetime of massive ionizing
stars, conflicting with the narrow appearance of the arms in X-rays. The
fraction of supernova energy that goes into heating the ISM must depend on
environment and is probably higher near sites of active star formation. The
X-ray estimated emission measures suggest that the volume filling factors and
scale heights are high in the galaxy centers but low in the outer parts of
these galaxies. The differences between the X-ray properties and morphology in
the centers and outer parts of these galaxies suggest that galactic fountains
operate in outer galaxy disks but that winds are primarily driven from galaxy
centers.
