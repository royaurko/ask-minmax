This paper summarizes a search for radio wavelength counterparts to candidate
gravitational wave events. The identification of an electromagnetic counterpart
could provide a more complete understanding of a gravitational wave event,
including such characteristics as the location and the nature of the
progenitor. We used the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) to search six galaxies
which were identified as potential hosts for two candidate gravitational wave
events. We summarize our procedures and discuss preliminary results.
