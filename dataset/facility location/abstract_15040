We report the discovery of a Narrow Line QSO located at about 1.3' from the
Broad Line Radio Galaxy 3C445. The source,1WGA J2223.7-0206, although already
revealed by ROSAT has never been optically identified previously. An XMM-Newton
observation of 3C445 has allowed, for the first time, an accurate X-ray
spectral study of 1WGA J2223.7-0206, revealing an ultra-soft spectrum and fast
flux variations typical of Narrow Line AGN. The 0.2-10 keV spectrum is well
represented by a power law (Gamma=2.5) plus a black body component (kT = 117
eV) absorbed by Galactic NH. About 80% of the X-ray flux is emitted below 2
keV. The 0.2-2 keV flux is observed to decrease by about a factor 1.6 in about
5000 s. The optical observations, triggered by the X-ray study, confirm the
Narrow Line AGN nature of this source. The continuum is blue with typical AGN
emission lines, pointing to a redshift z=0.46. The full width half maximum of
H_beta is 2000 km/secand the flux rat io [OIII}]/H_beta=0.21. The optical
luminosity (M_R=-23.2) and the point-like appearance in the optical images
identify 1WGA J2223.7-0206 as a Narrow Line QSO. From the optical-UV-X-ray
Spectral Energy Distribution we obtain a lower limit of the bolometric
luminosity of 1WGA J2223.7-0206 (L_bol > 3 10^{45} erg/sec) implying, for
accretion rates close to the Eddington limit, a black hole mass M_BH > 2.4 x
10^{7} M_{\odot}
