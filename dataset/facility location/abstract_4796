The secrecy graph is a random geometric graph which is intended to model the
connectivity of wireless networks under secrecy constraints. Directed edges in
the graph are present whenever a node can talk to another node securely in the
presence of eavesdroppers, which, in the model, is determined solely by the
locations of the nodes and eavesdroppers. In the case of infinite networks, a
critical parameter is the maximum density of eavesdroppers that can be
accommodated while still guaranteeing an infinite component in the network,
i.e., the percolation threshold. We focus on the case where the locations of
the nodes and eavesdroppers are given by Poisson point processes, and present
bounds for different types of percolation, including in-, out- and undirected
percolation.
