Simulation studies are performed to assess the sensitivity of a
model-independent analysis of the flavour-tagged decays $D^0 \to K^0_{\rm
S}\pi^+\pi^-$ and $D^0 \to K^0_{\rm S}K^+K^-$ to mixing and CP violation. The
analysis takes as input measurements of the $D$ decay strong-phase parameters
that are accessible in quantum-correlated $D-\bar{D}$ pairs produced at the
$\psi(3770)$ resonance. It is shown that the model-independent approach is well
suited to the very large data sets expected at an upgraded LHCb experiment, or
future high luminosity $e^+e^-$ facility, and that with 100M $K^0_{\rm
S}\pi^+\pi^-$ decays a statistical precision of around 0.01 and $0.7^\circ$ is
achievable on the CP violation parameters $r_{CP}$ and $a_{CP}$, respectively.
Even with this very large sample the systematic uncertainties associated with
the strong-phase parameters will not be limiting, assuming that full use is
made of the available $\psi(3770)$ data sets of CLEO-c and BES-III.
Furthermore, it is demonstrated that large flavour-tagged samples can
themselves be exploited to provide information on the strong-phase parameters,
a feature that will be beneficial in the measurement of the CKM angle
$\gamma/\phi_3$ with $B^- \to DK^-$ decays.
