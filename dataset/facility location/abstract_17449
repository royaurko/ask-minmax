The internal interactions of fluids occur at all scales therefore the
resulting force fields have no reason to be smooth and differentiable. The
release of the differentiability hypothesis has important mathematical
consequences, like scale dependence and the use of a higher algebra. The law of
mechanics transfers directly these properties to the velocity of fluid
particles whose trajectories in velocity space become fractal and
non-deterministic. The principle of relativity is used to find the form of the
equation governing velocity in scale space. The solution of this equation
contains a fractal and a non-fractal term. The fractal part is shown to be
equivalent to the Lagrangian version of the Kolmogorov law of fully-developed
and isotropic turbulence. It is therefore associated with turbulence, whereas
the non-fractal deterministic term is associated with a laminar behavior. These
terms are found to be balanced when the typical velocity reaches a level at
which the Reynolds number is equal to one, in agreement with the empirical
observations. The rate of energy dissipated by turbulence in a flow passing an
obstacle that was only known from experiments can be derived theoretically from
the equation's solution. Finally, a quantum-like equation in velocity space is
proposed in order to find the probability of having a given velocity at a given
location. It may eventually explain the presence of large scale coherent
structures in geophysical turbulent flows, like jet-streams.
