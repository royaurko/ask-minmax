We present a multiwavelength study of the 2005 September 13 eruption from
NOAA 10808 that produced total four flares and two fast coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) within 1.5 hours. Our primary attention is paid to the fact that these
eruptions occurred in close succession in time, and that all of them were
located along an S-shaped magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL) of the active
region. In our analysis, (1) the disturbance created by the first flare
propagated southward along the PIL to cause a major filament eruption that led
to the first CME and the associated second flare underneath. (2) The first CME
partially removed the overlying magnetic fields over the northern Delta spot to
allow the third flare and the second CME. (3) The ribbon separation during the
fourth flare would indicate reclosing of the overlying field lines opened by
the second CME. It is thus concluded that this series of flares and CMEs are
interrelated to each other via magnetic reconnections between the expanding
magnetic structure and the nearby magnetic fields. These results complement
previous works made on this event with the suggested causal relationship among
the successive eruptions.
