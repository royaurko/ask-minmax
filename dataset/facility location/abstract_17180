ROSAT all-sky survey (RASS) data have provided another window to search for
supernova remnants (SNRs). In reexamining this data archive, a list of
unidentified extended X-ray objects have been suggested as promising SNR
candidate. However, most of these targets have not yet been fully explored by
the state-of-art X-ray observatories. For selecting a pilot target for a
long-term identification campaign, we have observed the brightest candidate,
G308.3-1.4, with Chandra X-ray observatory. An incomplete shell-like X-ray
structure which well-correlated with the radio shell emission at 843 MHz has
been revealed. The X-ray spectrum suggests the presence of a shock-heated
plasma. All these evidences confirm G308.3-1.4 as a SNR. The brightest X-ray
point source detected in this field-of-view is also the one locates closest to
the geometrical center of G308.3-1.4, which has a soft spectrum. The intriguing
temporal variability and the identification of optical/infrared counterpart
rule out the possibility of an isolated neutron star. On the other hand, the
spectral energy distribution from Ks band to R band suggests a late-type star.
Together with a putative periodicity of \sim1.4 hrs, the interesting excesses
in V, B bands and H-alpha suggest this source as a promising candidate of a
compact binary survived in a supernova explosion (SN).
