We report the optical identifications of two X-ray luminous point sources in
the spiral galaxy NGC4565 based on archive data of Chandra and the Hubble Space
Telescope. The central X-ray point source, RXJ1236.3+2559, is found to be the
nucleus of NGC4565 with an X-ray luminosity of Lx= 4.3 10^{39} erg. We show
that its multi-waveband properties are consistent with it being a
low-luminosity active galactic nucleus. A faint optical counterpart with B=25.1
and I=24.0 was identified for the off-nucleus X-ray point source,
RXJ1236.2+2558. Its extinction corrected B magnitude is estimated to be 24.5.
The X-ray to optical flux ratio (fx/fB) is about 540. From the optical and
X-ray properties we argue that RXJ1236.2+2558 is an ultra-luminous X-ray
compact source with Lx=6.5 10^{39} erg. The source is probably located in a
faint globular cluster at the outer edge of NGC4565's bulge.
