Bibliometric studies have become increasingly important in evaluating
individual scientists, specific facilities, and entire observatories. In this
context, the ESO Library has developed and maintains two tools: FUSE, a
full-text search tool, and the Telescope Bibliography (telbib), a content
management system that is used to classify and annotate ESO-related scientific
papers.
  The new public telbib interface provides faceted searches and filtering,
autosuggest support for contributor, bibcode and program ID searches, hit
highlighting as well as recommendations for other papers of possible interest.
It is available at http://telbib.eso.org
