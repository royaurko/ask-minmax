This paper presents observations of an extended Lyman-alpha emission nebula
surrounding the galaxy responsible for the Damped Lyman-alpha Absorption (DLA)
line in the spectrum of the quasar Q2233+131. With the Potsdam Multi Aperture
Spectrophotometer (PMAS) we measure the properties of the extended Ly-alpha
emission in an area of 3"* 5" having a total line flux of (2.8+/-0.3)*10^{-16}
erg cm-2 s-1, which at redshift z=3.15 corresponds to a luminosity of (2.4
-0.2/+0.3)*10^{43} erg s-1 and a size of 23 times 38 kpc. The location of the
emission is spatially coincident with the previously detected DLA galaxy, but
extends significantly beyond its limb. We argue that the Ly-alpha emission is
likely to be caused by an outflow from the DLA galaxy, presumably powered by
star formation. In the case of negligible dust extinction, the Ly-alpha
luminosity indicates a star-formation rate of 19+/-10 solar masses per year
consistent with that derived from the UV continuum flux from the parent galaxy.
The wind velocity indicated by the integral field spectra is of the order of
several hundred km s-1. We find no indication of emission originating in a
rotating disk.
