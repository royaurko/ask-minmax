UCHII G25.4NW is a bright IR source in the inner Galaxy region.
  New HI images from the VLA Galactic Plane Survey (VGPS) show clear absorption
features associated with the UCHII region up to 95 km s$^{-1}$, and there is
not any other absorptions up to the tangential velocity.
  It reveals that G25.4NW is at a near-side distance of 5.7 kpc, and it is
located in the inner Galactic molecular ring region.
  Using the new distance, the bolometric luminosity of G25.4NW is estimated as
$10^{5.6} L_{\odot}$, which corresponds to an O6 star.
  It contains 460 $M_{\odot}$ of ionized gas. High-resolution $^{13}$CO image
from the Galactic Ring Survey (GRS) reveals that G25.4NW is part of a more
extended star-formation complex with about $10^{4} M_{\odot}$ molecular gas.
