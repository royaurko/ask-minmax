We study four citrate synthase homodimeric proteins within a structure-based
coarse-grained model. Two of these proteins come from thermophilic bacteria,
one from a cryophilic bacterium and one from a mesophilic organism; three are
in the closed and two in the open conformations. Even though the proteins
belong to the same fold, the model distinguishes the properties of these
proteins in a way which is consistent with experiments. For instance, the
thermophilic proteins are more stable thermodynamically than their mesophilic
and cryophilic homologues, which we observe both in the magnitude of thermal
fluctuations near the native state and in the kinetics of thermal unfolding.
The level of stability correlates with the average coordination number for
amino acids contacts and with the degree of structural compactness. The pattern
of positional fluctuations along the sequence in the closed conformation is
different than in the open conformation, including within the active site. The
modes of correlated and anticorrelated movements of pairs of amino acids
forming the active site are very different in the open and closed
conformations. Taken together, our results show that the precise location of
amino acid contacts in the native structure appears to be a critical element in
explaining the similarities and differences in the thermodynamic properties,
local flexibility and collective motions of the different forms of the enzyme.
