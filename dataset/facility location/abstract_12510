We explore a detailed model in which the active galactic nucleus (AGN)
obscuration results from the extinction of AGN radiation in a global flow
driven by the pressure of infrared radiation on dust grains. We assume that
external illumination by UV and soft X-rays of the dusty gas located at
approximately 1pc away from the supermassive black hole is followed by a
conversion of such radiation into IR. Using 2.5D, time-dependent radiation
hydrodynamics simulations in a flux-limited diffusion approximation we find
that the external illumination can support a geometrically thick obscuration
via outflows driven by infrared radiation pressure in AGN with luminosities
greater than $0.05\, L_{\rm edd}$ and Compton optical depth, $\tau_{\rm
T}\gtrsim 1$.
