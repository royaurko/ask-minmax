We present optical observations of the fields of two X-ray sources located
near the center of the shell-like supernova remnant G266.1-1.2. No objects
brighter than R~22.5 and B~23 are present within the small Chandra error region
of AX J0851.9-4617.4, besides a R~17 star that has already been excluded as a
possible counterpart. A bright diffuse H_alpha nebula is present close to the
position of the candidate neutron star.
