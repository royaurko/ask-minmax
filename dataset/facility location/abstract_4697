This paper presents the science potential of a deep ocean antineutrino
observatory being developed at Hawaii and elsewhere. The observatory design
allows for relocation from one site to another. Positioning the observaory some
60 km distant from a nuclear reactor complex enables preecision measurement of
neutrino mixing parameters, leading to a determination of neutrino mass
hierarchy and theta_13. At a mid-Pacific location, the observatory measures the
flux of uranium and thorium decay series antineutrinos from earth's mantle and
performs a sensitive search for a hypothetical natural fission reactor in
earth's core. A subequent deployment at another mid-ocean location would test
lateral homogeneity of uranium and thorium in earth's mantle. These
measurements have significance for earth energy studies.
