The development of high gradient acceleration and tight phase-space control
of high power beams is a key element for future lepton and hadron colliders
since the increasing demands for higher energy and luminosity significantly
raise costs of modern HEP facilities. Atomic channels in crystals are known to
consist of 10 -- 100 V/{\AA} potential barriers capable of guiding and
collimating a high energy beam providing continuously focused acceleration with
exceptionally high gradients (TeV/m). However, channels in natural crystals are
only angstrom-size and physically vulnerable to high energy interactions, which
has prevented crystals from being applied to high power accelerators.
Carbon-based nano-crystals such as carbon-nanotubes (CNTs) and graphenes have a
large degree of dimensional flexibility and thermo-mechanical strength, which
could be suitable for channeling acceleration of MW beams. Nano-channels of the
synthetic crystals can accept a few orders of magnitude larger phase-space
volume of channeled particles with much higher thermal tolerance than natural
crystals. This paper presents the current status of CNT-channeling acceleration
research at the Advanced Superconducting Test Accelerator (ASTA) in Fermilab.
