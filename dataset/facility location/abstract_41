The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is the next generation Cherenkov
telescope facility. It will consist of a large number of segmented-mirror
telescopes of three different diameters, placed in two locations, one in the
northern and one in the southern hemisphere, thus covering the whole sky. The
total number of mirror tiles will be on the order of 10,000, corresponding to a
reflective area of ~10^4 m^2. The Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics in
T\"ubingen (IAAT) is currently developing mirror control alignment mechanics,
electronics, and software optimized for the medium sized telescopes. In
addition, IAAT is participating in the CTA mirror prototype testing. In this
paper we present the status of the current developments, the main results of
recent tests, and plans for the production phase of the mirror control system.
We also briefly present the T\"ubingen facility for mirror testing.
