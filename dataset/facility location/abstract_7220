We have obtained new optical imaging and spectroscopic observations of 78
galaxies in the fields of the rich clusters Abell 1413 (z = 0.14), Abell 2218
(z = 0.18) and Abell 2670 (z = 0.08). We have detected line emission from 25
cluster galaxies plus an additional six galaxies in the foreground and
background, a much lower success rate than what was found (65%) for a sample of
52 lower-richness Abell clusters in the range 0.02 < z < 0.08. We have combined
these data with our previous observations of Abell 2029 and Abell 2295 (both at
z = 0.08), which yields a sample of 156 galaxies. We evaluate several
parameters as a function of cluster environment: Tully-Fisher residuals,
H-alpha equivalent width, and rotation curve asymmetry, shape and extent.
Although H-alpha is more easily detectable in galaxies that are located further
from the cluster cores, we fail to detect a correlation between H-alpha extent
and galaxy location in those where it is detected, again in contrast with what
is found in the clusters of lesser richness. We fail to detect any
statistically significant trends for the other parameters in this study. The
zero-point in the z~0.1 Tully-Fisher relation is marginally fainter (by 1.5
sigma) than that found in nearby clusters, but the scatter is essentially
unchanged.
