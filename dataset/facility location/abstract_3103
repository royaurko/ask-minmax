In the advent of a pervasive presence of location sharing services
researchers gained an unprecedented access to the direct records of human
activity in space and time. This paper analyses geo-located Twitter messages in
order to uncover global patterns of human mobility. Based on a dataset of
almost a billion tweets recorded in 2012 we estimate volumes of international
travelers in respect to their country of residence. We examine mobility
profiles of different nations looking at the characteristics such as mobility
rate, radius of gyration, diversity of destinations and a balance of the
inflows and outflows. The temporal patterns disclose the universal seasons of
increased international mobility and the peculiar national nature of overseen
travels. Our analysis of the community structure of the Twitter mobility
network, obtained with the iterative network partitioning, reveals spatially
cohesive regions that follow the regional division of the world. Finally, we
validate our result with the global tourism statistics and mobility models
provided by other contributors, and argue that Twitter is a viable source to
understand and quantify global mobility patterns.
