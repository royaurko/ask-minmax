The five millisecond pulsars that inhabit NGC 6752 display locations or
accelerations remarkably different with respect to all other pulsars known in
globular clusters. This may reflect the occurrence of an uncommon dynamics in
the cluster core that could be attributed to the presence of a massive
perturber. We here investigate whether a single intermediate-mass black hole,
lying on the extrapolation of the mass versus sigma relation observed in galaxy
spheroids, or, a less massive black hole binary could play the requested role.
