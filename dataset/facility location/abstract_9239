We present the preliminary results of the INTEGRAL survey of the Large
Magellanic Cloud. The observations have been carried out in January 2003 (about
10^6 s) and January 2004 (about 4x10^5 s). Here we concentrate on the bright
sources LMC X-1, LMC X-2, LMC X-3 located in our satellite galaxy, and on the
serendipitous detections of the Galactic Low Mass X-ray Binary EXO 0748-676 and
of the Seyfert 2 galaxy IRAS 04575-7537.
