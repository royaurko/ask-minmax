We observed the intermediate polar RX J0558+53 with the 4.2m WHT and find in
the pulsed emission lines, a ``corkscrew'' pattern, which indicates a two-pole
white dwarf accretion. The ``corkscrew'' pattern consists of two emission-line
pulses, separated by half the white dwarf spin period, and moving from red to
blue velocities. The detected emission-line pulsations have an amplitude of
1.1--2.7 per cent in the He II and Balmer emission lines on the 545-s spin
period of the white dwarf which compare to 3.5-4.8 per cent for the continuum
double-peak pulsations. We image the emission-line pulse pattern and is shown
to lag the continuum pulse by 0.12 spin cycles. We interpret the pattern by
invoking an accretion curtain from the disrupted, inner disc to the two poles
of the magnetic white dwarf. The semi-amplitude of the He II pulse of 408+-35
km/s can be used to constrain the size of the magnetosphere, R ~ 4.1 x 10^4 km,
and the magnetic moment of the white dwarf (~2.4 10^32 G cm^3). Power spectra
show dominant frequencies at 2 \omega and 2 (\omega-\Omega) which suggest
reprocessing of the white dwarf's illuminating beams in the accretion disc.
Finally, the steady He II emission line shows a strong sinusoidal component
moving from red to blue on the orbital period, with a width similar to that
expected from irradiation of the secondary star. Imaging of the emission lines
indicate illuminated locations at the inner side of the red star and the back
side of the accretion disc.
