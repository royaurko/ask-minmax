Prompt, in-beam $\gamma$ rays following the reaction $^{170}$Yb + 142 MeV
$^{28}$Si were measured at the ATLAS facility using 10 Compton-suppressed Ge
detectors and the Fragment Mass Analyzer. Transitions in $^{194}$Po were
identified and placed using $\gamma$-ray singles and coincidence data gated on
the mass of the evaporation residues. A level spectrum up to
J$\approx$10$\hbar$ was established. The structure of $^{194}$Po is more
collective than that observed in the heavier polonium isotopes and indicates
that the structure has started to evolve towards the more collective nature
expected for deformed nuclei.
