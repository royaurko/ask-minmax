The third catalog of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detected by the Fermi
Large Area Telescope (3LAC) is presented. It is based on the third catalog
(3FGL,\cite{3FGL}) of sources detected with a test statistic greater than 25,
using the first 4 years of data. The 3LAC includes 1591 AGNs located at high
($|b|>10^\circ$) Galactic latitudes (with 28 duplicate associations, thus
corresponding to 1563 gamma-ray sources among 2192 sources in the 3FGL
catalog), providing $71\%$ more sources with respect to the 2FGL. Various
properties, such as gamma-ray fluxes and photon power law spectral indices,
redshifts, gamma-ray luminosities, variability, and their correlations are
presented and discussed for the different blazar and non-blazar classes.
