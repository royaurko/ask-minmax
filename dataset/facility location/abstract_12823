Many models of ultra-high energy cosmic-ray production involve acceleration
in linear accelerators located in Gamma-Ray Bursts magnetars, or other sources.
These source models require very high accelerating gradients, $10^{13}$ keV/cm,
with the minimum gradient set by the length of the source. At gradients above
1.6 keV/cm, muons produced by hadronic interactions undergo significant
acceleration before they decay. This acceleration hardens the neutrino energy
spectrum and greatly increases the high-energy neutrino flux. We rule out many
models of linear acceleration, setting strong constraints on plasma wakefield
accelerators and on models for sources like Gamma Ray Bursts and magnetars.
