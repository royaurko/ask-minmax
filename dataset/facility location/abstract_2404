We study charmed and strange baryon resonances that are generated dynamically
by a unitary baryon-meson coupled-channels model which incorporates heavy-quark
spin symmetry. This is accomplished by extending the SU(3) Weinberg-Tomozawa
chiral Lagrangian to SU(8) spin-flavor symmetry plus a suitable symmetry
breaking. The model generates resonances with negative parity from the s-wave
interaction of pseudoscalar and vector mesons with 1/2+ and 3/2+ baryons in all
the isospin, spin, and strange sectors with one, two, and three charm units.
Some of our results can be identified with experimental data from several
facilities, such as the CLEO, Belle, or BaBar Collaborations, as well as with
other theoretical models, whereas others do not have a straightforward
identification and require the compilation of more data and also a refinement
of the model.
