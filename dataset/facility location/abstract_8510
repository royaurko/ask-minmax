The contribution of the pair annihilation process in relativistic
electron-positron jets to the gamma-ray emission of blazars is calculated.
Under the same assumptions as for the calculation of the yield of inverse
Compton scattered accretion disk radiation (Dermer and Schlickeiser 1993) we
calculate the emerging pair annihilation radiation taking into account all
spectral broadening effects due to the energy spectra of the annihilating
particles and the bulk motion of the jet. It is shown that the time-integrated
pair annihilation spectrum appears almost like the well-known gamma-ray
spectrum from decaying $\pi^o$-mesons at rest, yielding a broad bumpy feature
located between 50 and 100 MeV. We also demonstrate that for pair densities $>
10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ in the jet the annihilation radiation will dominate the inverse
Compton radiation, and indeed may explain reported spectral bumps at MeV
energies. The refined treatment of the inverse Compton radiation leads to
spectral breaks of the inverse Compton emission in the MeV energy range with a
change in spectral index $\Delta \alpha $ larger than 0.5 as detected in PKS
0528+134 and 3C273.
