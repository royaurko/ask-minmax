The Integrated Computer Control System (ICCS) is based on a scalable software
framework that is distributed over some 325 computers throughout the NIF
facility. The framework provides templates and services at multiple levels of
abstraction for the construction of software applications that communicate via
CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture). Various forms of
object-oriented software design patterns are implemented as templates to be
extended by application software. Developers extend the framework base classes
to model the numerous physical control points, thereby sharing the
functionality defined by the base classes. About 56,000 software objects each
individually addressed through CORBA are to be created in the complete ICCS.
Most objects have a persistent state that is initialized at system start-up and
stored in a database. Additional framework services are provided by centralized
server programs that implement events, alerts, reservations, message logging,
database/file persistence, name services, and process management. The ICCS
software framework approach allows for efficient construction of a software
system that supports a large number of distributed control points representing
a complex control application.
