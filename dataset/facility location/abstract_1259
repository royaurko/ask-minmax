A system and method for enabling human beings to communicate by way of their
monitored brain activity. The brain activity of an individual is monitored and
transmitted to a remote location (e.g. by satellite). At the remote location,
the monitored brain activity is compared with pre-recorded normalized brain
activity curves, waveforms, or patterns to determine if a match or substantial
match is found. If such a match is found, then the computer at the remote
location determines that the individual was attempting to communicate the word,
phrase, or thought corresponding to the matched stored normalized signal.
