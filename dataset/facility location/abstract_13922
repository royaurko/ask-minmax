The various decay mechanisms of excitons in cuprous oxide (Cu2O) are highly
sensitive to defects which can relax selection rules. Here we report cryogenic
hyperspectral imaging of exciton luminescence from cuprous oxide crystals grown
via the floating zone method showing the samples have few defects. Some
locations, however, show strain splitting of the 1s orthoexciton triplet
polariton luminescence. Strain is reduced by annealing. In addition, annealing
causes annihilation of oxygen and copper vacancies, which leads to a negative
correlation between luminescence of unlike vacancies.
