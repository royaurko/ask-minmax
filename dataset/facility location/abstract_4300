We give a new proof of the formula expressing the area of the triangle whose
vertices are the projections of an arbitrary point in the plane onto the sides
of a given triangle, in terms of the geometry of the given triangle and the
location of the projection point. Other related geometrical constructions and
formulas are also presented.
