In this paper, we analyze the performance of cooperative transmissions in
wireless ad hoc networks with random node locations. According to a contention
probability for message transmission, each source node can either transmits its
own message signal or acts as a potential relay for others. Hence, each
destination node can potentially receive two copies of the message signal, one
from the direct link and the other from the relay link. Taking the random node
locations and interference into account, we derive closed-form expressions for
the outage probability with different combining schemes at the destination
nodes. In particular, the outage performance of optimal combining, maximum
ratio combining, and selection combining strategies are studied and quantified.
