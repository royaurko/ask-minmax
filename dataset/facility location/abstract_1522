We present the results from a shallow (2-10 ksec) XMM/2dF survey. Our survey
covers 18 XMM fields ($\sim 5 {\rm deg}^2$) previously spectroscopically
followed up with the Anglo-Australian telescope 2-degree field facility. About
half of the fields are also covered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We
are searching for extended sources using the XMM SAS maximum likelihood
algorithm in the 0.3-2 keV band and we have detected 14 candidate clusters down
to a flux of $\sim2\times10^{-14} cgs$. Our preliminary results show that: i)
the redshift distribution peaks at relatively high redshifts ($\sim0.4$) as
expected from the Rosati et al. $\Phi(L)$, ii) some of our X-ray clusters
appear to have optical counterparts.
