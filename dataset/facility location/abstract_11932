Recent research in ubiquitous computing uses technologies of Body Area
Networks (BANs) to monitor the person's kinematics and physiological
parameters. In this paper we propose a real time mobile health system for
monitoring elderly patients from indoor or outdoor environments. The system
uses a bio- signal sensor worn by the patient and a Smartphone as a central
node. The sensor data is collected and transmitted to the intelligent server
through GPRS/UMTS to be analyzed. The prototype (UMHMSE) monitors the elderly
mobility, location and vital signs such as Sp02 and Heart Rate. Remote users
(family and medical personnel) might have a real time access to the collected
information through a web application.
