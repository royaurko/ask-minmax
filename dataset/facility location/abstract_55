Early earthquake warning is a rapidly developing capability that has
significant ramifications for many fields, including astronomical
observatories. In this work, we describe the susceptibility of astronomical
facilities to seismic events, including large telescopes as well as
second-generation ground-based gravitational-wave interferometers. We describe
the potential warning times for observatories from current seismic networks and
propose locations for future seismometers to maximize warning times.
