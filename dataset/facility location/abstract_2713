Any performance analysis based on stochastic simulation is subject to the
errors inherent in misspecifying the modeling assumptions, particularly the
input distributions. One way to quantify such errors, especially in situations
with little support from data, is to carry out a worst-case analysis, with the
partial, nonparametric knowledge of the input model represented via
optimization constraints. We design and analyze a numerical scheme for both a
general class of simulation objectives and of uncertainty specifications, based
on a Frank-Wolfe (FW) variant of the stochastic approximation (SA) method
(which we call FWSA). A key step involves the construction of simulable
unbiased gradient estimators using a suitable nonparametric analog of the
classical likelihood ratio method. A convergence analysis for FWSA on
non-convex problems is provided. We illustrate our approach numerically with
robustness analyses for a canonical M/GI/1 queue under uncertain service time
distribution specification, and for an energy storage facility acting as a
hedge against uncertainty in local renewable generation.
