The question of the origin of hadron masses is one major issue in the
understanding of the strong interaction. The challenge is addressed by
searching for indications of in-medium modifications of hadron properties and
studying hadrons in nuclei. The quest driving in-medium studies is to
understand the origin of hadron masses in the context of spontaneous chiral
symmetry breaking.
  The experimental status of the modification of hadron properties in the
nuclear medium is discussed including experiments using hadron, heavy-ion, and
photon beams. Particular emphasis is put on the production of light mesons from
nuclei.
  A number of experimental programs is underway to provide a detailed
comparison of properties of free hadrons and hadrons embedded in nuclei. The
existing experimental efforts are discussed and possibilities are introduced
for the new WASA-at-COSY facility, initially focussed on investigations of
symmetries and symmetry breaking, to contribute to the field.
