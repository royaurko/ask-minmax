We present a direct calculation of the cross section for the reaction
3He(e,e'p) including the radiation tail originating from bremsstrahlung
processes. This calculation is compared to measured cross sections. The
calculation is carried out from within a Monte Carlo simulation program so that
acceptance-averaging effects, along with a subset of possible energy losses,
are taken into account. Excellent agreement is obtained between our calculation
and measured data, after a correction factor for higher-order bremsstrahlung is
devised and applied to the tail. Industry-standard radiative corrections fail
miserably for these data, and we use the results of our calculation to dissect
the failure. Implications for design and analysis of experiments in the
Jefferson-Lab energy domain are discussed.
