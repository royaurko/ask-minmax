We report first inelastic neutron scattering measurements in the normal state
of Sr_2RuO_4 that reveal the existence of incommensurate magnetic spin
fluctuations located at ${\bf q}_0=(\pm 0.6\pi/a, \pm 0.6\pi/a, 0)$. This
finding confirms recent band structure calculations that have predicted
incommensurate magnetic responses related to dynamical nesting properties of
its Fermi surface.
