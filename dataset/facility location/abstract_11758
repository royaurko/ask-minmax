We theoretically investigate the spontaneous emission of a point--like
dipolar emitter located near a two--dimensional (2D) plasmonic waveguide of
arbitrary form. We invoke an explicite link with the density of modes of the
waveguide describing the electromagnetic channels into which the emitter can
couple. We obtain a closed form expression for the coupling to propagative
plasmon, extending thus the Purcell factor to plasmonic configurations.
Radiative and non-radiative contributions to the spontaneous emission are also
discussed in details.
