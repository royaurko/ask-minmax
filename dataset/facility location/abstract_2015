The subsystems of the CMS silicon strip tracker were integrated and
commissioned at the Tracker Integration Facility (TIF) in the period from
November 2006 to July 2007. As part of the commissioning, large samples of
cosmic ray data were recorded under various running conditions in the absence
of a magnetic field. Cosmic rays detected by scintillation counters were used
to trigger the readout of up to 15% of the final silicon strip detector, and
over 4.7 million events were recorded. This document describes the cosmic track
reconstruction and presents results on the performance of track and hit
reconstruction as from dedicated analyses.
