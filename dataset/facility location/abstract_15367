We propose bigradient phase referencing (BPR), a new radio-observation
technique, and report its performance using the Japanese
very-long-baseline-interferometry network (JVN). In this method, a weak source
is detected by phase-referencing using a primary calibrator, in order to play a
role as a secondary calibrator for phase-referencing to a weak target. We will
be given the opportunity to select a calibrator from lots of milli-Jansky
sources, one of which may be located at the position closer to the target. With
such a smaller separation, high-quality phase-referencing can be achieved.
Furthermore, a subsequent more-sophisticated calibration can relocate array's
focus to a hypothetical point much closer to the target; a higher quality of
phase referencing is available. Our demonstrative observations with strong
radio sources have proved the capabilities of BPR in terms of image dynamic
ranges and astrometric reproducibility. The image dynamic range on a target has
been improved with a factor of about six compared to that of normal
phase-referencing; the resultant position difference of target's emission
between two epochs was only 62+-50 micro-arcsecond, even with less than 2300-km
baselines at 8.4 GHz and fast-switching of a target-calibrator pair of a
2.1-degree separation.
