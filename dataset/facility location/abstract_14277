In all kinds of engineering problems, and in particular in methods for
computational fluid dynamics based on regular grids, local grid refinement is
of crucial importance. To save on computational expense, many applications
require to resolve a wide range of scales present in a numerical simulation by
locally adding more mesh points. In general, the need for a higher (or a lower)
resolution is not known a priori, and it is therefore difficult to locate areas
for which local grid refinement is required. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm for the lattice Boltzmann method, based on physical concepts, to
automatically construct a pattern of local refinement. We apply the idea to the
two-dimensional lid-driven cavity and show that the automatically refined grid
can lead to results of equal quality with less grid points, thus sparing
computational resources and time. The proposed automatic grid refinement
strategy has been implemented in the parallel open-source library Palabos.
