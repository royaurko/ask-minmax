We study the universality class of the Nishimori point in the 2D +/- J
random-bond Ising model by means of the numerical transfer-matrix method. Using
the domain-wall free-energy, we locate the position of the fixed point along
the Nishimori line at the critical concentration value p_c = 0.1094 +/- 0.0002
and estimate nu = 1.33 +/- 0.03. Then, we obtain the exponents for the moments
of the spin-spin correlation functions as well as the value for the central
charge c = 0.464 +/- 0.004. The main qualitative result is the fact that
percolation is now excluded as a candidate for describing the universality
class of this fixed point.
