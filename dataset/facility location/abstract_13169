The close similarity between the shell structures in the 132Sn and 208Pb
regions is a well known phenomenon. Thus, using the correspondence between the
high-j orbits located above the Z=50 and Z=82 shell gaps, we discuss the
evolutions of the fully aligned states with one broken proton pair in the N=82
and N=126 isotones. A long-lived isomeric state was discovered in 217Pa more
than thirty years ago and despite two other experiments giving new experimental
results, the discussions on its main properties (spin, parity, configuration)
remained inconclusive. Then, using the comparison with the I^\pi=17/2^+
isomeric state recently measured in 139La, the isomeric state of 217Pa is
assigned as the fully aligned state of the (\pi h_{9/2})^2(\pi f_{7/2})^1
configuration.
