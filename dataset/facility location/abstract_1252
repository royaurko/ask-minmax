Hadrons are located at the orthogonal intersections of 4-branes that wrap
1-cycles of a rectangular compact space. The 4-branes are arranged in a regular
network. We reveal the conspicuous locations on the rectangle of the lightest
mesons, unflavoured and of each flavour, of the lightest meson singlet states
with hidden flavour of each kind, and of the lightest baryons of each flavour.
The Higgs field vacuum expectation value is also associated with a conspicuous
position on the rectangle, at the orthogonal intersection of 4-branes.
