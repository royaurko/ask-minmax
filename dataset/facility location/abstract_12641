Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 0. Every
Artin-Schreier k-curve X has an equation of the form y^p - y = f(x) for some
f(x) in k(x) such that p does not divide the least common multiple L of the
orders of the poles of f(x). Under the condition that p is congruent to 1 mod
L, Zhu proved that the Newton polygon of the L-function of X is determined by
the Hodge polygon of f(x). In particular, the Newton polygon depends only on
the orders of the poles of f(x) and not on the location of the poles or
otherwise on the coefficients of f(x). In this paper, we prove an analogous
result about the a-number of the p-torsion group scheme of the Jacobian of X,
providing the first non-trivial examples of families of Jacobians with constant
a-number. Equivalently, we consider the semi-linear Cartier operator on the
sheaf of regular 1-forms of X and provide the first non-trivial examples of
families of curves whose Cartier-Manin matrix has constant rank.
