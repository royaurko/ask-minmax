We have used the VLBA at 15 GHz to image the structure of 132 strong compact
AGN and quasars with a resolution better than one milliarcsecond and a dynamic
range typically exceeding 1000 to 1. These observations were made as part of a
program to investigate the sub-parsec structure of quasars and AGN and to study
the changes in their structure with time. Many of the sources included in our
study, particularly those located south of +35 degrees, have not been
previously imaged with milliarcsecond resolution. Each of the sources has been
observed at multiple epochs. In this paper we show images of each of the 132
sources which we have observed. For each source we present data at the epoch
which had the best quality data. The milliarcsecond jets generally appear
one-sided but two-sided structure is often found in lower luminosity radio
galaxies and in high luminosity quasars with gigahertz peaked spectra. Usually
the structure is unresolved along the direction perpendicular to the jet, but a
few sources have broad plumes. In some low luminosity radio galaxies, the
structure appears more symmetric at 2 cm than at long wavelengths. The apparent
long wavelength symmetry in these sources is probably due to absorption by
intervening material. A few sources contain only a single component with any
secondary feature at least a thousand times weaker. We find no obvious
correlation of radio morphology and the detection of gamma-ray emission by
EGRET.
