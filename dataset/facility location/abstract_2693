We have performed for the first time a comprehensive study of the sensitivity
of $r$-process nucleosynthesis to individual nuclear masses across the chart of
nuclides. Using the latest version (2012) of the Finite-Range Droplet Model, we
consider mass variations of $\pm0.5$ MeV and propagate each mass change to all
affected quantities, including $Q$-values, reaction rates, and branching
ratios. We find such mass variations can result in up to an order of magnitude
local change in the final abundance pattern produced in an $r$-process
simulation. We identify key nuclei whose masses have a substantial impact on
abundance predictions for hot, cold, and neutron star merger $r$-process
scenarios and could be measured at future radioactive beam facilities.
