The UA9 experimental equipment was installed in the CERN-SPS in March '09
with the aim of investigating crystal assisted collimation in coasting mode.
  Its basic layout comprises silicon bent crystals acting as primary
collimators mounted inside two vacuum vessels. A movable 60 cm long block of
tungsten located downstream at about 90 degrees phase advance intercepts the
deflected beam.
  Scintillators, Gas Electron Multiplier chambers and other beam loss monitors
measure nuclear loss rates induced by the interaction of the beam halo in the
crystal. Roman pots are installed in the path of the deflected particles and
are equipped with a Medipix detector to reconstruct the transverse distribution
of the impinging beam. Finally UA9 takes advantage of an LHC-collimator
prototype installed close to the Roman pot to help in setting the beam
conditions and to analyze the efficiency to deflect the beam. This paper
describes in details the hardware installed to study the crystal collimation
during 2010.
