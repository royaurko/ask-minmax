We consider inverse obstacle and transmission scattering problems where the
source of the incident waves is located on a smooth closed surface that is a
boundary of a domain located outside of the obstacle/homogeneity of the media.
The domain can be arbitrarily small but fixed.The scattered waves are measured
on the same surface. An effective procedure is suggested for recovery of
interior eigenvalues by these data.
