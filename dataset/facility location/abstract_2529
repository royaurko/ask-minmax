Measurements of absolute cross sections for the {\it K}-shell photoionization
of B-like atomic nitrogen ions were carried out utilizing the ion-photon
merged-beam technique at the SOLEIL synchrotron radiation facility in
Saint-Aubin, France. High-resolution spectroscopy with E/$\Delta$E $\approx$
13,500 was the maximum resolution achieved. We have investigated two photon
energy regions: 404 eV -- 409 eV and 439 eV -- 442 eV. Resonance peaks found in
the experimental measured cross sections are compared with theoretical
estimates from the multi-configuration Dirac - Fock, R-matrix and empirical
methods, allowing identification of the strong 1s $\rightarrow$ 2p and the
weaker 1s $\rightarrow$ 3p resonances in the observed {\it K}-shell spectra of
this B-like nitrogen ion.
