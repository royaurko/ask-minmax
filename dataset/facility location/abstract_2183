The medium modifications of the energies of kaons and antikaons in isospin
asymmetric hyperonic matter are investigated using a chiral SU(3) model. The
isospin dependent medium effects, are important for asymmetric heavy ion
collision experiments, as well as relevant for the neutron star phenomenology
as the bulk matter in the interior of the neutron star is highly isospin
asymmetric. The effects of hyperons on the medium modifications of the kaons
and antikaons in the strange hadronic matter are investigated in the present
work and are seen to be appreciable for hadronic matter with large strangeness
fractions. The study of the K-mesons in the asymmetric strange hadronic matter
can be especially relevant for the compressed strange baryonic matter which can
result from asymmetric heavy ion collision experiments in the future
accelerator facility FAIR at GSI.
