Lifemapper (http://www.lifemapper.org) is a predictive electronic atlas of
the Earth's biological biodiversity. Using a screensaver version of the GARP
genetic algorithm for modeling species distributions, Lifemapper harnesses vast
computing resources through 'volunteers' PCs similar to SETI@home, to develop
models of the distribution of the worlds fauna and flora. The Lifemapper
project's primary goal is to provide an up to date and comprehensive database
of species maps and prediction models (i.e. a fauna and flora of the world)
using available data on species' locations. The models are developed using
specimen data from distributed museum collections and an archive of geospatial
environmental correlates. A central server maintains a dynamic archive of
species maps and models for research, outreach to the general community, and
feedback to museum data providers. This paper is a case study in the role, use
and justification of a genetic algorithm in development of large-scale
environmental informatics infrastructure.
