With the World Wide Web's ubiquity increase and the rapid development of
various online businesses, the complexity of web sites grow. The analysis of
web user's navigational pattern within a web site can provide useful
information for server performance enhancements, restructuring a website and
direct marketing in e-commerce etc. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed for
mining such navigation patterns. The key insight is that users access
information of interest and follow a certain path while navigating a web site.
If they don't find it, they would backtrack and choose among the alternate
paths till they reach the destination. The point they backtrack is the
Intermediate Reference Location. Identifying such Intermediate locations and
destinations out of the pattern will be the main endeavor in the rest of this
report.
