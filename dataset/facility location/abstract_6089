We study the properties of the electroweak theory in the vicinity of the
critical point --- the endpoint of the first order phase transition line that
exists in a wide class of theories, including the Standard Model and a part of
the parameter space of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We find that
the critical point belongs to the 3d Ising universality class. The endpoint in
the Standard Model is located at the Higgs mass below the existing experimental
lower bound, implying that there is no electroweak phase transition in this
theory.
