The Tolman-Bondi solution of the Einstein equations is used in order to model
the time evolution of the void observed in Bo\"otes. The present density
contrast of the central region ($\sim -0.75$) and its radius ($\sim 30h^{-1} \
Mpc$) are fixed, while the density parameter of the Universe, the amplitude of
the density contrast inside the void wall, the width of this wall and the
distance from the void centre to the Local Group are appropriately varied. The
microwave background anisotropy produced by Bo\"otes-like voids is estimated
for a significant set of locations. All the voids are placed far from the last
scattering surface. It is shown that the anisotropy generated by these voids
strongly depends on the density parameter, the wall structure and the void
location. The Doppler dipole and quadrupole are subtracted and the residual
anisotropy is calculated. In the case of some isolated Bo\"otes-like voids
placed at redshifts between 1 and 10 in an open universe with density parameter
$\Omega_{0}=0.2$, the residual anisotropy appears to be a few times $10^{-6}$
on scales of a few degrees. This anisotropy is about one order of magnitude
greater than previous estimates corresponding to other cases. The anisotropy
produced by a distribution of voids is qualitatively studied in the light of
this result. Comparisons with previous estimates are discussed.
