Context. The orbit of the giant planet discovered around beta Pic is slightly
inclined with respect to the outer parts of the debris disc, which creates a
warp in the inner debris disc. This inclination might be explained by
gravitational interactions with other planets. Aims. We aim to search for
additional giant planets located at smaller angular separations from the star.
Methods. We used the new L'-band AGPM coronagraph on VLT/NACO, which provides
an exquisite inner working angle. A long observing sequence was obtained on
beta Pic in pupil-tracking mode. To derive sensitivity limits, the collected
images were processed using a principal-component analysis technique
specifically tailored to angular differential imaging. Results. No additional
planet is detected down to an angular separation of 0.2" with a sensitivity
better than 5 MJup. Meaningful upper limits (< 10 MJup) are derived down to an
angular separation of 0.1", which corresponds to 2 AU at the distance of beta
Pic.
