Territorial subdivisions and geographic borders are essential for
understanding phenomena in sociology, political science, history, and
economics. They influence the interregional flow of information and
cross-border trade and affect the diffusion of innovation and technology.
However, most existing administrative borders were determined by a variety of
historic and political circumstances along with some degree of arbitrariness.
Societies have changed drastically, and it is doubtful that currently existing
borders reflect the most logical divisions. Fortunately, at this point in
history we are in a position to actually measure some aspects of the geographic
structure of society through human mobility. Large-scale transportation systems
such as trains and airlines provide data about the number of people traveling
between geographic locations, and many promising human mobility proxies are
being discovered, such as cell phones, bank notes, and various online social
networks. In this chapter we apply two optimization techniques to a human
mobility proxy (bank note circulation) to investigate the effective geographic
borders that emerge from a direct analysis of human mobility.
