The zenital dependence of muon flux which reaches the earth's surface is well
known as proportional to cos^n(\theta). Generally, for practical purposes and
simplicity in calculations, n is taken as 2. However, compilations of
measurements show dependence on the geographical location of the experiments as
well as the muons energy range. Since analytical solutions appear to be
increasingly less necessary because of the higher accessibility to low cost
computational power, accurate and precise determination of the value of the
exponent n, under different conditions, can be useful in the necessary
calculations to estimate signals and backgrounds, either for terrestrial and
underground experiments. In this work we discuss a method for measuring n using
a simple muon telescope and the results obtained for measurements taken at
Campinas (SP), Brazil. After validation of the method, we intend to extend the
measurements for different geographic locations due to the simplicity of the
method, and thus collect more values of n that currently exist in compilations
of general data on cosmic rays.
