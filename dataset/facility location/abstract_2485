In Europe the work on the specification and design of a Demonstration Power
Plant (DEMO) is being carried out by EFDA in the Power Plant Physics and
Technology (PPP&T) programme. DEMO will take fusion from experimental research
into showing the potential for commercial power generation. This paper
describes the first steps being taken towards the design of the DEMO Hot Cell.
It will show a comparison of the current DEMO in-vessel maintenance concepts
from a Hot Cell perspective, describe a proposed ex-vessel transport system,
and summarize the facilities that have been identified as required within the
Hot Cell, examine current RH technology and discuss the identified critical
development issues.
