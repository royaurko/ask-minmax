We have observed the Vela pulsar region at TeV energies using the 3.8 m
imaging Cherenkov telescope near Woomera, South Australia every year since
1992. This is the first concerted search for pulsed and unpulsed emission from
the Vela region, and the imaging technique also allows the location of the
emission within the field of view to be examined. A significant excess of
gamma-ray-like events is found offset from the Vela pulsar to the southeast by
about 0.13deg. The excess shows the behavior expected of gamma-ray images when
the asymmetry cut is applied to the data. There is no evidence for the emission
being modulated with the pulsar period -- in contrast to earlier claims of
signals from the Vela pulsar direction.
