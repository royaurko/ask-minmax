Here we continue to discuss the principle of the local measurement of dark
energy using the normalized Hubble diagram describing the environment of a
system of galaxies. We calculate the present locus of test particles injected a
fixed time ago (\sim the age of the universe), in the standard \Lambda
-cosmology and for different values of the system parameters (the model
includes a central point mass M and a local dark energy density \rho_{loc}) and
discuss the position of the zero-gravity distance R_v in the Hubble diagram.
Our main conclusions are: 1) When the local DE density \rho_{loc} is equal to
the global DE density \rho_v, the outflow reaches the global Hubble rate at the
distance R_2 = (1+z_v)R_v, where z_v is the global zero-acceleration redshift
(\approx 0.7 for the standard model). This is also the radius of the ideal
Einstein-Straus vacuole. 2) For a wide range of the local-to-global dark energy
ratio \rho_{loc}/\rho_v, the local flow reaches the known global rate (the
Hubble constant) at a distance R_2 \ga 1.5 \times R_v. Hence, R_v will be
between R_2/2 and R_2, giving upper and lower limits to \rho_{loc}/M. For the
Local Group, this supports the view that the local density is near the global
one.
