Ultra-sensitive in-beam gamma-ray spectroscopy studies for nuclear
astrophysics are performed at the LUNA (Laboratory for Underground Nuclear
Astrophysics) 400 kV accelerator, deep underground in Italy's Gran Sasso
laboratory. By virtue of a specially constructed passive shield, the laboratory
gamma-ray background for E_\gamma < 3 MeV at LUNA has been reduced to levels
comparable to those experienced in dedicated offline underground gamma-counting
setups. The gamma-ray background induced by an incident alpha-beam has been
studied. The data are used to evaluate the feasibility of sensitive in-beam
experiments at LUNA and, by extension, at similar proposed facilities.
