The combination of dynamical and photometric properties of galaxies offers a
largely un-tapped source of information on how galaxies assembled and where
stars formed. Bi-dimensional kinematic measurements have been the stumbling
block. The light-gathering power of SALT coupled with the high-throughput
performance of the Prime Focus Imaging Spectrograph (PFIS) yield a superb
facility for measuring velocity-ellipsoids of stars and gas in galaxies out to
gigaparsec distances. From these data dynamical asymmetries arising from
lopsided or elliptical halos may be probed; disk-mass and mass-decompositions
may be uniquely determined; mechanisms for disk heating constrained; and a
zeropoint for the mass-to-light ratios of stellar populations set. A number of
groups within the SALT consortium are interested in making these measurements
using a variety of different, but complementary approaches. The scientific
potential from their synthesis is very promising. We describe some unusual
observational modes in which PFIS may be used to probe the shape of dark-matter
halos and the content of galaxy disks.
