Twenty years ago Poole et al. (Nature 360, 324, 1992) suggested that the
anomalous properties of supercooled water may be caused by a critical point
that terminates a line of liquid-liquid separation of lower-density and
higher-density water. Here we present an explicit thermodynamic model based on
this hypothesis, which describes all available experimental data for
supercooled water with better quality and with fewer adjustable parameters than
any other model suggested so far. Liquid water at low temperatures is viewed as
an 'athermal solution' of two molecular structures with different entropies and
densities. Alternatively to popular models for water, in which the
liquid-liquid separation is driven by energy, the phase separation in the
athermal two-state water is driven by entropy upon increasing the pressure,
while the critical temperature is defined by the 'reaction' equilibrium
constant. In particular, the model predicts the location of density maxima at
the locus of a near-constant fraction (about 0.12) of the lower-density
structure.
