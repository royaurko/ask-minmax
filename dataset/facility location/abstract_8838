We investigate matter density perturbations in models of structure formation
with or without causal/acausal source. Under the fluid approximation in the
linear theory, we first derive full perturbation equations in flat space with a
cosmological constant $\Lambda$. We then use Green-function technique to obtain
analytic solutions for matter perturbations in a flat $\Lambda=0$ model. Some
incorrect solutions in the literature are corrected here. A simple yet accurate
extrapolation scheme is then proposed to obtain solutions in curved or
$\Lambda\neq 0$ cosmologies. Some general features of these solutions are
revealed. In particular, we analytically prove that the resulting matter
density perturbations are independent of the way the causal source was
compensated into the background contents of the universe when it was first
formed. We also use our Green-function solutions to investigate the
compensation mechanism for perturbations with causal seeds, and yield a
mathematically and physically explicit formin interpreting it. We found that
the compensation scale depends not only on the dynamics of the universe, but
also on the properties of the seeds near the horizon scale. It can be
accurately located by employing our Green functions.
