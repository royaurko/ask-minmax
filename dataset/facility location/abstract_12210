We consider CPT violation in neutrino sector, which is induced by ghost
condensation. A model with extra dimension is suggested where ghost
condensation occurs at a distant location separated from the SM brane. Right
handed neutrinos in the bulk, which are originally introduced to explain small
Yukawa couplings, play the role of messenger fields communicating ghost
condensation and the standard model sector and lead to a sizable CPT violation
in neutrino sector at the leading order. The model provides a resolution to the
recent MINOS anomaly without spoiling any experimental constraints and may be
able to be tested by observing an interesting phenomenon, twinkling cosmic
microwave background radiation, with timescale about O(10-100) minutes at
future CMB observations e.g. Planck.
