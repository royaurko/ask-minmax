A new compilation of data on Local Group members shows that low-luminosity
early-type galaxies are, at the 99% confidence level, more strongly
concentrated in the M 31, and Galactic sub-clumps, than are dwarf irregular
galaxies. It is not yet clear if star formation continued longer in dSph
galaxies that are located far from M 31 and the Galaxy, than it did in those
that are not associated with the Andromeda and Milky Way sub-clumps of the
Local Group.
