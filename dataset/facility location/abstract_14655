We present medium-resolution (R~700) near-infrared (lambda = 1 - 2.5 micron)
spectra of a sample of planetary nebulae (PNe). A narrow slit was used which
sampled discrete locations within the nebulae; observations were obtained at
one or more positions in the 41 objects included in the survey. The PN spectra
fall into one of four general categories: H I emission line-dominated PNe, H I
and H_2 emission line PNe, H_2-dominated PNe, and continuum-dominated PNe.
These categories correlate with morphological type, with the elliptical PNe
falling into the first group, and the bipolar PNe primarily in the H_2 and
continuum emission groups. Other spectral features were observed in all
categories, such as continuum emission from the central star, C_2, CN, and CO
emission, and warm dust continuum emission.
  Molecular hydrogen was detected for the first time in four PNe. An excitation
analysis was performed using the H_2 line ratios for all of the PN spectra in
the survey where a sufficient number of lines were observed. One unexpected
result from this analysis is that the H_2 is excited by absorption of
ultraviolet photons in most of the PNe surveyed, although for several PNe in
our survey collisional excitation in moderate velocity shocks plays an
important role. The correlation between bipolar morphology and H_2 emission has
been strengthened with the new detections of H_2 in this survey.
