We study noise induced switching in systems far from equilibrium by using an
underdamped micromechanical torsional oscillator driven into the nonlinear
regime. Within a certain range of driving frequencies, the oscillator possesses
two stable dynamical states with different oscillation amplitudes. We induce
the oscillator to escape from one dynamical state into the other by introducing
noise in the excitation. By measuring the rate of random transitions as a
function of noise intensity, we deduce the activation energy as a function of
frequency detuning. Close to the critical point, the activation energy is
expected to display system-independent scaling. The measured critical exponent
is in good agreement with variational calculations and asymptotic scaling
theory.
