We find that NGC6789 is the most nearby example of a Blue Compact Dwarf
galaxy known to date. With the help of WFPC2 aboard the Hubble Space Telescope,
we resolve NGC6789 into over 15,000 point sources in the V and I bands. The
young stars of NGC6789 are found exclusively near the center of the galaxy. The
red giant population identified at large galacticentric radii yields a distance
of about 3.6 Mpc, a stellar metallicity [Fe/H] of about -2, and a minimum age
of about 1 Gyr. Despite its isolated location in the Local Void,its low
metallicity, and its active star formation, the properties of NGC6789 are
clearly not those of a galaxy in formation.
