We report on a numerical study of viscous fluid accretion onto a black hole.
The flow is axisymmetric and uses a pseudo-Newtonian potential to model
relativistic effects near the event horizon. The numerical method is a variant
of the ZEUS code. As a test of our numerical scheme, we are able to reproduce
results from earlier, similar work by Igumenshchev and Abramowicz and Stone et
al. We consider models in which mass is injected onto the grid as well as
models in which an initial equilibrium torus is accreted. In each model we
measure three ``eigenvalues'' of the flow: the accretion rate of mass, angular
momentum, and energy. We find that the eigenvalues are sensitive to r_{in}, the
location of the inner radial boundary. Only when the flow is always supersonic
on the inner boundary are the eigenvalues insensitive to small changes in
r_{in}. We also report on the sensitivity of the results to other numerical
parameters.
