It is proposed that a study of the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy
density $\frac{\eta}{s}$ as a function of the baryon chemical potential
$\mu_B$, and temperature T, provides a dynamic probe for the critical end point
(CEP) in hot and dense QCD matter. An initial estimate from an elliptic flow
excitation function gives $\mu^{\text{cep}}_B \sim 150-180$ MeV and
$T_{\text{cep}} \sim 165 - 170$ MeV for the location of the the CEP. These
values place the CEP in the range for "immediate" validation at RHIC.
