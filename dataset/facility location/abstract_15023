We present a new set of dissipationless N-body simulations to examine the
feasibility of creating bright ellipticals (following the Kormendy relation) by
hierarchically merging present-day early-type dwarf galaxies, and to study how
the encounter parameters affect the location of the end-product in the
$<\mu_{e} > - R_{e}$ plane. We investigate the merging of one-component
galaxies of both equal and different masses, the merging of two-component
galaxy models to explore the effect of dark halos on the final galaxy
characteristics, and the merging of ultracompact dwarf galaxies. We find that
the increase of $<\mu_{e}>$ with $R_e$ is attributable to an increase in the
initial orbital energy. The merger remnants shift down in the $<\mu_{e} > -
R_{e}$ plane and fail to reach the KR. Thus, the KR is not reproducable by
mergers of dwarf early-type systems, rendering untenable the theory that
present-day dwarfs are responsible for even a small fraction of the present-day
ellipticals, unless a considerable amount of dissipation is invoked. However,
we do find that present-day dwarfs can be formed by the merger of ultra-compact
dwarfs.
