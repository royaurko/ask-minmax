Scarcity of frequencies and the demand for more bandwidth is likely to
increase the need for devices that utilize the available frequencies more
efficiently. Radios must be able to dynamically find other users of the
frequency bands and adapt so that they are not interfered, even if they use
different radio protocols. As transmitters far away may cause as much
interference as a transmitter located nearby, this mechanism can not be based
on location alone. Central databases can be used for this purpose, but require
expensive infrastructure and planning to scale. In this paper, we propose a
decentralized protocol and architecture for discovering radio devices over the
Internet. The protocol has low resource requirements, making it suitable for
implementation on limited platforms. We evaluate the protocol through
simulation in network topologies with up to 2.3 million nodes, including
topologies generated from population patterns in Norway. The protocol has also
been implemented as proof-of-concept in real Wi-Fi routers.
