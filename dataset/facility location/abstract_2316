We study charmed and strange baryon resonances that are generated dynamically
by a unitary baryon-meson coupled-channel model which incorporates heavy-quark
spin symmetry. This is accomplished by extending the SU(3) Weinberg-Tomozawa
chiral Lagrangian to SU(8) spin-flavor symmetry plus a suitable symmetry
breaking. The model produces resonances with negative parity from s-wave
interaction of pseudoscalar and vector mesons with $1/2^+$ and $3/2^+$ baryons.
Resonances in all the isospin, spin, and strange sectors with one, two, and
three charm units are studied. Our results are compared with experimental data
from several facilities, such as the CLEO, Belle or BaBar Collaborations, as
well as with other theoretical models. Some of our dynamically generated states
can be readily assigned to resonances found experimentally, while others do not
have a straightforward identification and require the compilation of more data
and also a refinement of the model. In particular, we identify the
$\Xi_c(2790)$ and $\Xi_c(2815)$ resonances as possible candidates for a
heavy-quark spin symmetry doublet.
