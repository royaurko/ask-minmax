The electronic transport properties and band structures for the
graphene-based one-dimensional (1D) superlattices with periodic squared
potentials are investigated. It is found that a new Dirac point is formed,
which is exactly located at the energy which corresponds to the zero (volume)
averaged wavenumber inside the 1D periodic potentials. The location of such a
new Dirac point is robust against variations in the lattice constants, and it
is only dependent on the ratio of potential widths. The zero-averaged
wavenumber gap associated with the new Dirac point is insensitive to both the
lattice constant and the structural disorder, and the defect mode in the
zero-averaged wavenumber gap is weakly dependent on the insident angles of
carriers.
