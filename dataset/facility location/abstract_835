The feasibility of an investigation of the pn --> pn eta-prime reaction by
means of the COSY-11 internal target facility is discussed. Appraisals are
based on the assumption of the quasi-free reactions of beam protons,
circulating in the cooler synchrotron COSY, with neutrons from a windowless
deuteron cluster target.
