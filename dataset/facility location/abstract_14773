We propose that the pulsar nebula associated with the pulsar J2229+6114 and
the supernova remnant (SNR) G106.3+2.7 are the result of the same supernova
explosion. The whole structure is located at the edge of an HI bubble with
extended regions of molecular gas inside. The radial velocities of both the
atomic hydrogen and the molecular material suggest a distance of 800 pc. At
this distance the SNR is 14 pc long and 6 pc wide. Apparently the bubble was
created by the stellar wind and supernova explosions of a group of stars in its
center which also triggered the formation of the progenitor star of G106.3+2.7.
The progenitor star exploded at or close to the current position of the pulsar,
which is at one end of the SNR rather than at its center. The expanding shock
wave of the supernova explosion created a comet shaped supernova remnant by
running into dense material and then breaking out into the inner part of the HI
bubble. A synchrotron nebula with a shell-like structure (the ``Boomerang'') of
length 0.8 pc was created by the pulsar wind interacting with the dense ambient
medium. The expanding shock wave created an HI shell of mass 0.4 Msun around
this nebula by ionizing the atomic hydrogen in its vicinity.
