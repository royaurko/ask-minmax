Numerous administration tools and techniques require near real time vision of
the activity occurring on a distributed filesystem. The changelog facility
provided by Lustre to address this need suffers limitations in terms of
scalability and flexibility. We have been working on reducing those limitations
by enhancing Lustre itself and developing external tools such as Lustre
ChangeLog Aggregate and Publish (LCAP) proxy. Beyond the ability to distribute
changelog processing, this effort aims at opening new prospectives by making
the changelog stream simpler to leverage for various purposes.
