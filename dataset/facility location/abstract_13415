We report on the results of a long time photometric monitoring of the two
metal poor Galactic globular clusters M22 and IC4499 searching for long period
variables (LPVs) on the upper giant branch. We detected 22 new LPVs in the
field of M22 and confirmed the variability of six known variables. Periods
could be determined for 16 of them. In the field of IC4499 we detected and
characterized 2 new LPVs. Cluster membership is evaluated for all the variables
based on photometry and literature data, and the location of the stars in
logP-K-diagram is discussed. Our findings give further support to the presence
of LPVs at metallicities as low as [Fe/H]=-1.7. The luminosity range where LPVs
are found in metal poor clusters is lower than in more metal rich clusters.
