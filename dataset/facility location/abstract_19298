We provide ingredients and recipes for computing signals of TeV-scale Dark
Matter annihilations and decays in the Galaxy and beyond. For each DM channel,
we present the energy spectra of electrons and positrons, antiprotons,
antideuterons, gamma rays, neutrinos and antineutrinos e, mu, tau at
production, computed by high-statistics simulations. We estimate the Monte
Carlo uncertainty by comparing the results yielded by the Pythia and Herwig
event generators. We then provide the propagation functions for charged
particles in the Galaxy, for several DM distribution profiles and sets of
propagation parameters. Propagation of electrons and positrons is performed
with an improved semi-analytic method that takes into account
position-dependent energy losses in the Milky Way. Using such propagation
functions, we compute the energy spectra of electrons and positrons,
antiprotons and antideuterons at the location of the Earth. We then present the
gamma ray fluxes, both from prompt emission and from Inverse Compton scattering
in the galactic halo. Finally, we provide the spectra of extragalactic gamma
rays. All results are available in numerical form and ready to be consumed.
