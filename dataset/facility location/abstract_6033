We report on the first results of self-consistent second order metric
perturbations produced by a point particle moving in the Schwarzschild
spacetime. The second order waveforms satisfy a wave equation with an effective
source term build up from products of first order metric perturbations and its
derivatives. We have explicitly regularized this source term at the particle
location as well as at the horizon and at spatial infinity.
