The TITAN facility at TRIUMF has recently initiated a program of performing
decay spectroscopy measurements in an electron-beam ion-trap (EBIT). The unique
environment of the EBIT provides backing-free storage of the radioactive ions,
while guiding charged decay particles from the trap centre via the strong
magnetic field. This measurement technique is able to provide a significant
increase in detection sensitivity for photons which result from radioactive
decay. A brief overview of this device is presented, along with methods of
improving the signal-to-background ratio for photon detection by reducing
Compton scattered events, and eliminating vibrational noise.
