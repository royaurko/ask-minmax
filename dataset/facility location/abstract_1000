The interactions of $\bar{D}\Sigma_{c}$-$\bar D\Lambda_c$,
$\bar{D}^{*}\Sigma_{c}$-$\bar D^*\Lambda_c$, and related strangeness channels,
are studied within the framework of the coupled channel unitary approach with
the local hidden gauge formalism. A series of meson-baryon dynamically
generated relatively narrow $N^*$ and $\Lambda^*$ resonances are predicted
around 4.3 GeV in the hidden charm sector. We make estimates of production
cross sections of these predicted resonances in $\bar{p} p $ collisions for
PANDA at the forthcoming FAIR facility.
