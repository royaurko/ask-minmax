In this note, we report a Raman spectroscopy study of annealing-induced
effects on graphene samples prepared by the microexfoliation method. It was
shown that randomly located adhesive residues often contaminate nearby graphene
sheets during thermal annealing. The contamination on graphene can be as thin
as ~1 nm, but gives several new Raman bands of unusually strong intensity. We
also find that their intensity is strongly dependent on the excitation
wavelength implying that graphene-induced Raman enhancement may be operative.
The current study also suggests that graphene can be selectively sensitive
towards certain molecular species in binding, which can be exploited for
interesting application.
