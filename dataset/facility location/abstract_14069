In our project we have designed an Android application to obtain mobility
data of the citizens in the metropolitan area of Barcelona. Our implementation
synchronously obtains in background on the one hand, periodic location updates
and, on the other hand, the type of activity citizens are doing. At the end of
the day, all this data is processed and sent to a server where are stored to
obtain mobility patterns from citizens that could help to improve the current
transportation infrastructure. MobilitApp is fully functional and stable
although the results can be improved in some situations. In future releases we
will implement machine learning technics to obtain significant improvements,
especially in the activity recognition modules.
