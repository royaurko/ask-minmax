We report on the detection of [OI] emission lines in the high-resolution
optical spectra of several Magellanic Cloud (MC) B[e] supergiants, which we
took with FEROS at the ESO 1.52m telescope in La Silla (Chile). In addition, we
model the [OI] line luminosities and show that the best location for the
neutral oxygen material is the outflowing disk. In order to reproduce the
observed line luminosities, we conclude that the disks must be neutral already
very close to the stellar surface.
