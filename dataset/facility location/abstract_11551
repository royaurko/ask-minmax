A new multivariate concept of quantile, based on a directional version of
Koenker and Bassett's traditional regression quantiles, is introduced for
multivariate location and multiple-output regression problems. In their
empirical version, those quantiles can be computed efficiently via linear
programming techniques. Consistency, Bahadur representation and asymptotic
normality results are established. Most importantly, the contours generated by
those quantiles are shown to coincide with the classical halfspace depth
contours associated with the name of Tukey. This relation does not only allow
for efficient depth contour computations by means of parametric linear
programming, but also for transferring from the quantile to the depth universe
such asymptotic results as Bahadur representations. Finally, linear programming
duality opens the way to promising developments in depth-related multivariate
rank-based inference.
