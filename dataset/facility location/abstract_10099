The equations of motion of compact binary systems and their associated
Lagrangian formulation have been derived in previous works at the third
post-Newtonian (3PN) approximation of general relativity in harmonic
coordinates. In the present work we investigate the binary's relative dynamics
in the center-of-mass frame (center of mass located at the origin of the
coordinates). We obtain the 3PN-accurate expressions of the center-of-mass
positions and equations of the relative binary motion. We show that the
equations derive from a Lagrangian (neglecting the radiation reaction), from
which we deduce the conserved center-of-mass energy and angular momentum at the
3PN order. The harmonic-coordinates center-of-mass Lagrangian is equivalent,
{\it via} a contact transformation of the particles' variables, to the
center-of-mass Hamiltonian in ADM coordinates that is known from the
post-Newtonian ADM-Hamiltonian formalism. As an application we investigate the
dynamical stability of circular binary orbits at the 3PN order.
