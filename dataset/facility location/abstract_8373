In this paper we analyze the X-ray, UV and optical data of the Seyfert 1.5
galaxy 1H0419-577, with the aim of detecting and studying an ionized-gas
outflow. The source was observed simultaneously in the X-rays with XMM and in
the UV with HST-COS. Optical data were also acquired with the XMM Optical
Monitor. We detected a thin, lowly ionized warm absorber (log xi ~ 0.03, log NH
~19.9 cm^-2) in the X-ray spectrum, consistent to be produced by the same
outflow already detected in the UV. Provided the gas density estimated in the
UV, the outflow is consistent to be located in the host galaxy, at ~ kpc scale.
Narrow emission lines were detected in the X-rays, in the UV and also in the
optical spectrum. A single photoionized-gas model cannot account for all the
narrow lines emission, indicating that the narrow line region is probably a
stratified environment, differing in density and ionization. X-ray lines are
unambiguously produced in a more highly ionized gas phase than the one emitting
the UV lines. The analysis suggests also that the X-ray emitter may be just a
deeper portion of the same gas layer producing the UV lines. Optical lines are
probably produced in another, disconnected gas system. The different ionization
condition, and the ~ pc scale location suggested by the line width for the
narrow lines emitters, argue against a connection between the warm absorber and
the narrow line region in this source.
