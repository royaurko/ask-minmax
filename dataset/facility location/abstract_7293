We conducted wide-field JHKs imaging polarimetry toward NGC 2024. We found a
prominent and extended polarized nebula over NGC 2024, and constrained the
location of illuminating source of the nebula through the analysis of
polarization vectors. A massive star, IRS 2b, is located in the center of the
symmetric vector pattern. Five small polarized nebulae associated with YSOs are
discovered on our polarization images. These nebulae are responsible for the
structures of circumstellar matter that produce strongly polarized light
through dust scattering. For the point-like sources, we performed software
aperture polarimetry in order to measure integrated polarizations, and found
five young brown dwarfs with highly polarized integrated emission. These
sources serve as direct evidence for the existence of disk/envelope system
around brown dwarfs. We investigated the magnetic field structure of NGC 2024
through the measurements of dichroic polarization. The average position angle
of projected magnetic fields across the region is found to be 110 degrees. We
found a good consistency in magnetic field structures obtained using
near-infrared dichroic polarization and sub-mm/far-infrared dust emission
polarization, indicating that the dichroic polarizations at near-infrared
wavelengths trace magnetic field structures inside dense molecular clouds.
