A microscopic theory is presented for the observed electronic disorder in
superconducting Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. The essential phenomenology
is shown to be consistent with the existence of two types of interstitial
oxygen dopants: those serving primarily as charge reserviors and those close to
the apical plane contributing both carriers and electrostatic potential to the
CuO$_2$ plane. The nonlinear screening of the latter produces nanoscale
variations in the doped hole concentration, leading to electronic
inhomogeneity. Based on an unrestricted Gutzwiller approximation of the
extended t-$J$ model, we provide a consistent explanation of the correlation
between the observed dopant location and the pairing gap and its spatial
evolutions. We show that the oxygen dopants are the primary cause of both the
pairing gap disorder and the quasiparticle interference pattern.
