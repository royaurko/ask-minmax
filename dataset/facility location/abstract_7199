We present results of non-simultaneous time-resolved photometric and
spectroscopic observations of the little-studied dwarf nova FS Aur in
quiescence. The spectrum of FS Aur shows strong and broad emission lines of
hydrogen and HeI, and of weaker HeII 4686 and CIII/NIII blend, similar to other
quiescent dwarf novae. All emission lines are single-peaked, however their form
varies with orbital phase. Absorption lines from a late-type secondary are not
detected. From the radial velocity measurements of the hydrogen lines H$_\beta$
and H$_\gamma$ we determined a most probable orbital period P=0.059+-0.002.
This period agrees well with the 0.0595+-0.0001 estimate by Thorstensen et al.
(1996). On the other hand, the period of photometric modulations is longer than
the spectroscopic period and can be estimated as 3 hours. Longer time coverage
during a single night is needed to resolve this problem. Using the
semi-amplitude of the radial velocities, obtained from measurements of hydrogen
and helium lines, and some empirical and theoretical relations we limited the
basic parameters of the system: a mass ratio q>=0.22, a primary mass M_1=0.34 -
0.46 M_sun, a secondary mass M_2<= 0.1M_sun, and an inclination angle
i=51^{\circ} - 65^{\circ}. Doppler tomography has shown at least two bright
regions in the accretion disk of FS Aur. The first, brighter spot is located at
phase about 0.6. The second spot is located opposite the first one and occupies
an extensive area at phases about 0.85 - 1.15.
