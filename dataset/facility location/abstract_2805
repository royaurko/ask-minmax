We present a statistical-mechanical analysis of the positioning of
nucleosomes along one of the chromosomes of yeast DNA as a function of the
strength of the binding potential and of the chemical potential of the
nucleosomes. We find a significant density of two-level nucleosome switching
regions where, as a function of the chemical potential, the nucleosome
distribution undergoes a "micro" first-order transition. The location of these
nucleosome switches shows a strong correlation with the location of
transcription-factor binding sites.
