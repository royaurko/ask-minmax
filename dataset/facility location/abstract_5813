We study the interplay between a novel vortex-loop unbinding in finite
magnetic field at T=T_V and flux-line lattice (FLL) melting at T=T_M in type-II
superconductors. The FLL melts due to nucleation of vortex loops parallel to
c-axis, connected to flux lines. For moderate anisotropy, phase coherence along
c-axis is lost at T_V > T_M due to an ab-plane vortex-loop unbinding with loops
located close to thermal FLL fluctuations. For large anisotropy, phase
coherence along c-axis is lost at T_V < T_M due to nucleation of ab-plane
vortex-loops uncorrelated to flux lines.
