Covariance tapering is a popular approach for reducing the computational cost
of spatial prediction and parameter estimation for Gaussian process models.
However, previous work has shown that tapering can have poor performance for
example when the data is sampled at spatially irregular locations. In this work
we introduce a computationally convenient non-stationary taper method in order
to improve the performance of tapering in the case of spatially irregular
observation locations or when non-stationary covariance models are used.
Numerical experiments are used to show that the performance of both kriging
prediction and parameter estimation can be improved by allowing for spatially
varying taper ranges.
