We present an analysis of a wide-angle tail (WAT) radio galaxy located in a
galaxy group in the COSMOS field at a redshift of z=0.53 (hereafter CWAT-02).
We find that the host galaxy of CWAT-02 is the brightest galaxy in the group,
although it does not coincide with the center of mass of the system. Estimating
a) the velocity of CWAT-02, relative to the intra-cluster medium (ICM), and b)
the line-of-sight peculiar velocity of CWAT-02's host galaxy, relative to the
average velocity of the group, we find that both values are higher than those
expected for a dominant galaxy in a relaxed system. This suggests that
CWAT-02's host group is dynamically young and likely in the process of an
ongoing group merger. Our results are consistent with previous findings showing
that the presence of a wide-angle tail galaxy in a galaxy group or cluster can
be used as an indicator of dynamically young non-relaxed systems. Taking the
unrelaxed state of CWAT-02's host group into account, we discuss the impact of
radio-AGN heating from CWAT-02 onto its environment, in the context of the
missing baryon problem in galaxy groups. Our analysis strengthens recent
results suggesting that radio-AGN heating may be powerful enough to expel
baryons from galaxy groups.
