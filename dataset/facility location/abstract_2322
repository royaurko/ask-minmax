Project-X is the proposed high intensity proton facility to be built at
Fermilab, US. Its Superconducting Linac, to be used at first stage of
acceleration, will be operated in continuous wave (CW) mode. The Linac is
divided into three sections on the basis of operating frequencies & six
sections on the basis of family of RF cavities to be used for the acceleration
of beam from 2.5 MeV to 3 GeV. The transition from one section to another can
limit the acceptance of the Linac if these are not matched properly. We
performed a study to calculate the acceptance of the Linac in both longitudinal
and transverse plane. Investigation of most sensitive area which limits
longitudinal acceptance and study of influence of failure of beam line elements
at critical position, on acceptance are also performed.
