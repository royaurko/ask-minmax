Currently the heavy flavour factory KEKB located at the KEK accelerator
centre in Tsukuba, Japan, is being upgraded to the Super KEKB factory, aiming
for a substantially higher luminosity of 8x10^35 cm^-2 s^-1. This by a factor
of 40 increased luminosity requires significant modifications of the Belle
detector. The vertex detector needs to be redesigned and, besides a four-layer
silicon strip detector, a pixel detector based on the DEPFET technology will be
installed closest to the interaction point. The requirements for this pixel
detector, the DEPFET technology and the current status of the pixel detector
will be presented in this paper.
