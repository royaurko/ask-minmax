Examination of the human transcriptome reveals higher levels of RNA editing
than in any other organism tested to date. This is indicative of extensive
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) formation within the human transcriptome. Most of
the editing sites are located in the primate-specific retrotransposed element
called Alu. A large fraction of Alus are found in intronic sequences, implying
extensive Alu-Alu dsRNA formation in mRNA precursors. Yet, the effect of these
intronic Alus on splicing of the flanking exons is largely unknown. Here, we
show that more Alus flank alternatively spliced exons than constitutively
spliced ones; this is especially notable for those exons that have changed
their mode of splicing from constitutive to alternative during human evolution.
This implies that Alu insertions may change the mode of splicing of the
flanking exons. Indeed, we demonstrate experimentally that two Alu elements
that were inserted into an intron in opposite orientation undergo base-pairing,
as evident by RNA editing, and affect the splicing patterns of a downstream
exon, shifting it from constitutive to alternative. Our results indicate the
importance of intronic Alus in influencing the splicing of flanking exons,
further emphasizing the role of Alus in shaping of the human transcriptome
