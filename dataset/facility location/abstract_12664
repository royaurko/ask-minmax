A unique triangular shaped monolith located within the Peak District National
Park at Gardom's Edge could be intentionally astronomically aligned. It is set
within a landscape rich in late Neolithic and Bronze Age remains. We show that
the stone is most likely in its original orientation owing to its clear signs
of erosion and associated to the time period of the late Neolithic. It is
tilted towards South and its North side slopes at an angle equal to the maximum
altitude of the Sun at mid-summer. This alignment emphasizes the changing
declinations of the Sun during the seasons as well as giving an indication of
mid-summers day. This functionality is achieved by an impressive display of
light and shadow on the North-facing side of the Monolith. Together with other
monuments in the close vicinity the monolith would have represented an ideal
marker or social arena for seasonal gatherings for the else dispersed small
communities.
