An early analysis of Chandra observations of the planetary nebula NGC 6543
suggested that the location and the derived temperature for the X-ray emitting
region is inconsistent with the abundances measured for this object (Chu et al.
2001). We revisit observations of this source (following significant updates to
both the reprocessing and extraction software) in order to propose a resolution
to this apparent anomaly. Our re-analysis using abundances found from
observations in the infrared, optical, and ultraviolet suggests that the
location and temperature of the X-ray emission from NGC 6543 is consistent with
nebular abundances expected for the source.
