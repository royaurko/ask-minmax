Multi-instrument observations of NOAA AR10938 on Jan. 14-18, 2007, are
utilized to study the evolution of a magnetic thread system with multiple
crossings suggestive of a twisted coronal flux rope. A C-class flare recorded
by GOES on Jan. 16, at approximately 2:35 UT led to the brightening of the
structure, that is seen in Hinode/EIS data at 2:46 UT, Hinode/XRT after 2:50
UT, and {\emph{STEREO}}/SECCHI/EUVI images at 3:30 UT. 304 {\AA} images
revealed the presence of rapidly evolving, dark fibrils along the bright
structure before and after the flare. A denser structure formed a few hours
later and lasted for several days forming a segment of an inverse S-shaped
filament. The present set of data is highly suggestive of the presence of a
twisted flux rope prior to the formation of the filament segment at the same
location.
