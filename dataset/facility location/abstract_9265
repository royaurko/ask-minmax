We present Antarctic Submillimeter Telescope and Remote Observatory (AST/RO)
observations of 12CO J=4-3 and C I emission in the N44 H II complex in the
Large Magellanic Cloud. We detected strong 12CO J=4-3 emission toward the H II
region called as N44BC, which is located on the rim of an expanding giant shell
in the N44 region. Analysis with a photodissociation region (PDR) model showed
that the 12CO J=4-3 emitting cloud is very dense, with n ~ 10^5 cm^-3. We also
note that there is a high-velocity component associated with the 12CO J=4-3
emission. This probably originates from molecular material accelerated as a
result of the motion induced by the expanding giant shell surrounding LH47 in
the N44 complex. We found that the kinetic energy of this high-velocity gas
observed in the CO J=4-3 emission toward the rim of the expanding H II shell is
at least an order of magnitude higher than the kinetic energy derived for the H
I and H II gas in this region.
