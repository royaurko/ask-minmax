Some massive binaries should contain energetic pulsars which inject
relativistic leptons from their inner magnetospheres and/or pulsar wind
regions. If the binary system is compact enough, then these leptons can
initiate inverse Compton (IC) $e^\pm$ pair cascades in the anisotropic
radiation field of a massive star. $\gamma$-rays can be produced in the IC
cascade during its development in a pulsar wind region and above a shock in a
massive star wind region where the propagation of leptons is determined by the
structure of a magnetic field around the massive star. For a binary system with
specific parametres, we calculate phase dependent spectra and fluxes of
$\gamma$-rays escaping as a function of the inclination angle of the system and
for different assumptions on injection conditions of the primary leptons (their
initial spectra and location of the shock inside the binary). We conclude that
the features of $\gamma$-ray emission from such massive binaries containing
energetic pulsars should allow to obtain important information on the
acceleration of particles by the pulsars, and on interactions of a compact
object with the massive star wind. Predicted $\gamma$-ray light curves and
spectra in the GeV and TeV energy ranges from such binary systems within our
Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds should be observed by future AGILE and GLAST
satellites and low threshold Cherenkov telescopes such as MAGIC, HESS, VERITAS
or CANGAROO III.
