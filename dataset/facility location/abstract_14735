We present the results of near-infrared observations of extragalactic
Cepheids made with the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer on
board the Hubble Space Telescope. The variables are located in the galaxies IC
1613, IC 4182, M 31, M 81, M 101, NGC 925, NGC 1365, NGC 2090, NGC 3198, NGC
3621, NGC 4496A and NGC 4536. All fields were observed in the F160W bandpass;
additional images were obtained in the F110W and F205W filters. Photometry was
performed using the DAOPHOT II/ALLSTAR package.
  Self-consistent distance moduli and color excesses were obtained by fitting
Period-Luminosity relations in the H, I and V bands. Our results support the
assumption of a standard reddening law adopted by the HST Key Project on the
Extragalactic Distance Scale. A companion paper will determine true distance
moduli and explore the effects of metallicity on the Cepheid distance scale.
