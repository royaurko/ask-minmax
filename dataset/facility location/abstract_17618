The Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) is a new optical/near-infrared multi-fiber
spectrograph designed for the prime focus of the 8.2m Subaru telescope. The
metrology camera system of PFS serves as the optical encoder of the COBRA fiber
motors for the configuring of fibers. The 380mm diameter aperture metrology
camera will locate at the Cassegrain focus of Subaru telescope to cover the
whole focal plane with one 50M pixel Canon CMOS sensor. The metrology camera is
designed to provide the fiber position information within 5{\mu}m error over
the 45cm focal plane. The positions of all fibers can be obtained within 1s
after the exposure is finished. This enables the overall fiber configuration to
be less than 2 minutes.
