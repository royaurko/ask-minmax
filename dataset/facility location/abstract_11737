In this work we analyze the effect of smoothing maps containing arrival
directions of cosmic rays with a gaussian kernel and kernels of the mexican hat
wavelets of orders 1, 2 and 3. The analysis is performed by calculating the
amplification of the signal-to-noise ratio for several anisotropy patterns
(noise) and different number of events coming from a simulated source (signal)
for an ideal detector capable of observing the full sky with equal probability.
We extend this analysis for a virtual detector located within the array of
detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory, considering an acceptance law.
