In this paper we suggest and theoretically study a tapered plasmonic
nanostructure which connects the incident wave beam with a subwavelength
spatial region where the field is locally enhanced in a broad frequency range
or for different operation frequencies. This spatial region has a frequency
stable location near the contour of the tapered structure. This results from a
special waveguide mode which can also exist in the tapered structure. We
foresee many possible applications for our structure from prospective
near-field scanning optical microscopes to interconnects between conventional
optical waveguides and prospective optical nanocircuits.
