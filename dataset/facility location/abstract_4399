A new approach to precise determination of atomic matrix elements is
described whereby measurement of spectral locations of zeros in the Rayleigh
scattering cross-section allows frequency-domain extraction of matrix elements
in terms of a fiducial quantity. Illustrations are made for scattering off the
ground state in Li and Cs.
