We test the chronology protection conjecture in classical general relativity
by investigating finitely vicious space-times. First we present singularity
theorems in finitely vicious space-times by imposing some restrictions on the
chronology violating sets. In the theorems we can refer to the location of an
occurring singularity and do not assume any asymptotic conditions such as the
existence of null infinities. Further introducing the concept of a non-naked
singularity, we show that a restricted class of chronology violations cannot
arise if all occurring singularities are the non-naked singularities. Our
results suggest that the causal feature of the occurring singularities is the
key to prevent the appearance of causality violation.
