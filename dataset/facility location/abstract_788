We study elelctroweak penguin contributions in pure hadronic $B$ decays in
the Standard and two-Higgs-doublet models. We find that in $B_s\rightarrow
\pi^0 (\eta\;, \phi)$ and $B_s\rightarrow \rho^0 (\eta\;, \phi)$ decays, the
electroweak penguin contributions dominate over all other contribuitons. These
processes provide unique signatures of electroweak penguin in pure hadronic
processes. These modes could be in measureable range of future $B$ facilities.
