We present results of an analysis of high-resolution spectra obtained with
the Subaru Telescope High Dispersion Spectrograph, of two Carbon-Enhanced
Metal-Poor stars, HE 1305+0007 and HE 1152-0355, and of the classical CH star
HD 5223. All of these stars have relatively low effective temperatures
(4000-4750 K) and high carbon abundances. The stellar atmospheric parameters
indicate that they all have surface gravities consistent with a present
location on the red-giant branch, and metallicities of [Fe/H] = -2.0 (HE
1305+0007, HD 5223) and [Fe/H]= -1.3 (HE 1152-0355). In addition to their large
enhancements of carbon all three stars exhibit strong enhancements of the
s-process elements relative to iron. HE 1305+0007 exhibits a large enhancement
of the 3rd-peak s-process element lead, with [Pb/Fe] = +2.37, as well as a high
abundance of the r-process element europium, [Eu/Fe] = +1.97. Thus, HE
1305+0007 joins the growing class of the so-called ``Lead Stars'', and also the
class of objects that exhibit the presence of both r-process and s-process
elements, the CEMP-r/s stars. The large enhancement of n-capture elements
exhibited by HE 1152-0355 and HD 5223 are more consistent with the abundance
patterns generally noticed in CH stars. The elemental abundance distributions
observed in these stars are discussed in the light of existing theories of CH
star formation, as well as the suggested formation scenarios of the CEMP-r/s
group.
