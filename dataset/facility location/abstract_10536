Electroexcitations of the dominantly T=1 particle-hole states of C-12 are
studied in the framework of the harmonic oscillator shell model. All possible
T=1 single-particle-hole states of all allowed angular momenta are considered
in a basis including single-particle states up to the 1f-2p shell. The
Hamiltonian is diagnoalized in this space in the presence of the modified
surface delta interaction. Correlation in the ground state wave functions by
mixing more than one configuration is considered and shows a major contribution
that leads to enhance the calculations of the form factors. A comparison with
the experiment shows that this model is able to fit the location of states and
a simple scaling of the results give a good fit to the experimental form
factors.
