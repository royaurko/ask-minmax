The LHCb Vertex Locator contains 42 silicon sensor modules. Each module has
two silicon sensors. A method for determining the relative alignment of the
silicon sensors within each module from data is presented. The software
implementation details are discussed. Monte-Carlo simulation studies are
described that demonstrate an alignment precision of 1.3 micron is obtained in
the sensor plane.
