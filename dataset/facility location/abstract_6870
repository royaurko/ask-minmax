We give explicit formulas of the Bethe approximation with multipoint
correlations for systems with magnetic field. The obtained formulas include the
closed form of the magnetization and the correlations between adjacent degrees
of freedom. On the basis of our results, we propose a new iterative algorithm
of the improved Bethe approximation. We confirm that the proposed technique is
available for the random spin systems and indeed gives more accurate locations
of the critical points. We discuss the possibility of the application of our
method to the Inverse Ising model by use of these equations.
