The transmission coefficient for a one dimensional system is given in terms
of Chebyshev polynomials using the tight-binding model. This result is applied
to a system composed of two impurities located between $N$ sites of a host
lattice. It is found that the system has extended states for several values of
the energy. Analytical expressions are given for the impurity site energy in
terms of the electron's energy. The number of resonant states grows like the
number of host sites between the impurities. This property makes the system
interesting since it is a simple task to design a configuration with resonant
energy very close to the Fermi level $E_F$.
