Intermediate velocity products in Ar+Ni collisions from 52 to 95 A.MeV are
studied in an experiment performed at the GANIL facility with the 4$\pi$
multidetector INDRA. It is shown that these emissions cannot be explained by
statistical decays of the quasi-projectile and the quasi-target in complete
equilibrium. Three methods are used to isolate and characterize intermediate
velocity products. The total mass of these products increases with the violence
of the collision and reaches a large fraction of the system mass in mid-central
collisions. This mass is found independent of the incident energy, but strongly
dependent on the geometry of the collision. Finally it is shown that the
kinematical characteristics of intermediate velocity products are weakly
dependent on the experimental impact parameter, but strongly dependent on the
incident energy. The observed trends are consistent with a
participant-spectator like scenario or with neck emissions and/or break-up.
