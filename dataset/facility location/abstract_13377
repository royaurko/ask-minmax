This paper presents an efficient approach for the evaluation of
multi-parametric mixed integer quadratic programming (mp-MIQP) solutions,
occurring for instance in control problems involving discrete time hybrid
systems with quadratic cost. Traditionally, the online evaluation requires a
sequential comparison of piecewise quadratic value functions. As the main
contribution, we introduce a lifted parameter space in which the piecewise
quadratic value functions become piecewise affine and can be merged to a single
value function defined over a single polyhedral partition without any overlaps.
This enables efficient point location approaches using a single binary search
tree. Numerical experiments include a power electronics application and
demonstrate an online speedup up to an order of magnitude. We also show how the
achievable online evaluation time can be traded off against the offline
computational time.
