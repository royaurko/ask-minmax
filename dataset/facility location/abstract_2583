The Advanced Superconducting Test Accelerator (ASTA) facility is currently
under construction at Fermilab. With a 1-ms macropulse composed of up to 3000
micropulses and with beam energies projected from 45 to 800 MeV, the need for
non-intercepting diagnostics for beam size, position, energy, and bunch length
is clear. In addition to the rf BPMs, optical synchrotron radiation (OSR), and
optical diffraction radiation (ODR) techniques already planned, we propose the
use of undulator radiation from a dedicated device for diagnostics. with a
nominal period of 4-5 cm, a tunable field parameter K, and a length of several
meters. The feasibility of extending such techniques in the visible regime at a
beam energy of 125 MeV into the UV and VUV regimes with beam energies of 250
and 500 MeV will be presented.
