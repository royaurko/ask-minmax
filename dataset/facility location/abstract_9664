We present electron-tunneling spectroscopy of slightly overdoped Bi2212
single crystals at low temperature using a break-junction technique. Below Tc,
we observe, at least, two different superconducting gaps. We show that (i) the
largest superconducting gap occurs due to pairing of spinons; (ii) the second
superconducting gap has the d-wave symmetry; (iii) the d-wave gap is smaller
than the spinon gap, however, predominant and occurs due to pairing of
fermionic excitations carrying charge; (iv) the spinon gap has either a s-wave
or (s+d) mixed symmetry with the maximum located in (p, p) direction on the
Fermi surface. It is possible that there exists the third superconducting gap
having a g-wave symmetry, which is approximately twice smaller in magnitude
than the d-wave gap. Thus, there are two different types of superconductivity
and two different types of carriers in Bi2212.
