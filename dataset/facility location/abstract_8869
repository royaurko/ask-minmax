The parameters of the GRB 000301c afterglow are determined within the usual
framework of synchrotron emission from relativistic ejecta, through fits to the
available radio-to-optical data. It is found that 1) the jet energy after the
GRB phase is ~3x10^{50} erg, 2) the initial opening angle of the jet is ~13
deg, 3) the medium that decelerates the afterglow has a density ~25/cm^3, 4)
the power-law distribution of the shock-energized electrons is hard, with an
index around 1.5, and 5) the cooling frequency was located below the optical
domain. Furthermore we find that the collimation of ejecta alone cannot explain
the sharp, large magnitude break observed in the R-band emission of this
afterglow at few days, and that a high energy break in the electron
distribution, corresponding to an electron energy close to equipartition,
together with the lateral spreading of the jet accommodate better this break.
Microlensing by a star in an intervening galaxy produces only a flattening of
the afterglow emission and cannot explain the mild brightening exhibited by the
optical emission of 000301c at ~4 days.
