We discuss a possible scenario for radiation mechanism of pulsed GeV
gamma-rays from magnetars. The magnetars have shown frequent X-ray bursts,
which would be triggered by crust fractures and could release the energy of
order of ~10^{41-42}erg. If the location of the crust cracking of the magnetic
field is close to the magnetic pole, part of the released energy may excite the
Alfevn wave that can propagate into outer magnetosphere. The oscillation of the
magnetic field induces the available potential drop ~10^{15}Volts, which can
accelerate the electrons and/or positrons to the Lorentz factor ~10^{7} in the
outer magnetosphere. The curvature radiation process at outer magnetosphere can
produce GeV gamma-rays. If the radiation process is occurred above r~5x 10^7cm
from the stellar surface, the emitted GeV gamma-rays can escape from the
pair-creation process with the X-rays and/or the magnetic field. The expected
luminosity of the GeV emissions is order of L_{\gamma}< 10^{35} erg/s, and the
radiation process will last for a temporal scale of years. The expected pulse
profiles have a broad shape with sometimes sharp peaks. We apply the model to
AXP 1E~2259+586.
