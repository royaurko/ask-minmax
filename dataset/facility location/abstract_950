We formally specified the type system and operational semantics of LOOPw with
Ott and Isabelle/HOL proof assistant. Moreover, both the type system and the
semantics of LOOPw have been tested using Isabelle/HOL program extraction
facility for inductively defined relations. In particular, the program that
computes the Ackermann function type checks and behaves as expected. The main
difference (apart from the choice of an Ada-like concrete syntax) with LOOPw
comes from the treatment of parameter passing. Indeed, since Ott does not
currently fully support alpha-conversion, we rephrased the operational
semantics with explicit aliasing in order to implement the out parameter
passing mode.
