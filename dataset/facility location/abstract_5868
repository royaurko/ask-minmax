We study a one-dimensional model which undergoes a transition between an
active and an absorbing phase. Monte Carlo simulations supported by some
additional arguments prompted as to predict the exact location of the critical
point and critical exponents in this model. The exponents $\delta=0.5$ and
$z=2$ follows from random-walk-type arguments. The exponents $\beta =
\nu_{\perp}$ are found to be non-universal and encoded in the singular part of
reactivation probability, as recently discussed by H. Hinrichsen
(cond-mat/0008179). A related model with quenched randomness is also studied.
