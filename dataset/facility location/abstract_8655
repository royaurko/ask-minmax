We present new, multiwavelength Very Large Array observations of the 3 radio
galaxies in the cluster Abell 119: 0053-015, 0053-016 and 3C 29. The first two
radio galaxies, which lie close to the cluster center, show a
narrow-angle-tailed structure, with many twists in the tails. The third radio
source is located at the cluster periphery, and shows an undistorted FR I
morphology. All three radio sources are strongly polarized at the highest
frequencies, and all three show both more depolarization and higher Faraday
Rotation Measures with increasing proximity to the cluster center. We interpret
this polarization behaviour as induced by the magneto-ionized intracluster
medium, whose magnetic field is estimated to be in the range 5-10 microG.
