The muons of cosmic rays air showers in the Extreme Energy Events (EEE)
project are detected with three Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPC) with
good tracking capability. These muon telescopes are located in high schools
spread all over Italy. The detection of extensive air showers is made by means
of time coincidences between two distant telescopes. The vectorial components
of the incoming directions of the muons are known, as well as the UTC time of
their arrival on the detectors. The method to calculate the celestial
(equatorial and galactic) coordinates of the incoming direction of the muons is
presented. This procedure allows recovering galactic or extragalactic sources
of the extreme energetic cosmic rays which produce such extensive air showers.
A worksheet file (muoni.xls or EEEtest.xls) contains a simulator, to produce
data in the same format. This introductory method to positional astronomy for
muons, useful also for neutrinos, is presented through explained formulae and
an interactive worksheet, tailored for the data format of EEE
(http://www.centrofermi.it/eee/).
