New version of MSSM scales is discussed. In this version mu << M_{SUSY} ~ M_0
\~ M_{1/2}, where mu is the Higgsino mass, M_0 is the mass scale of sleptons
and squarks, M_{1/2} is the mass scale of gaugino. Renormalization group
motivation of this MSSM version is proposed. Analysis of Split Supersymmetry
ideas in this case together with the Dark Matter arguments results in the
statement that the formation of residual neutralino concentration occurs in the
high symmetric phase of cosmological plasma. The value of Higgsino mass is
estimated. The recharging process for high energy neutralinos in the
neutralino-nucleus scattering is considered. There has been reported the
possibility to check-up of the model predictions at modern experimental
facilities NUSEL and GLAST.
