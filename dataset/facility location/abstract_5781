We characterize the stellar populations in the nuclear region of the barred
spiral galaxy NGC 4900 using the integral field spectrometer OASIS and the
synthesis code LavalSB and the code from Moll\'{a} & Garc\'{\i}a-Vargas (2000)
for the young ($< 10$ Myr) and the old stellar populations, respectively. The
high spatial resolution of the instrument allows us to find an old population
uniformely distributed and younger regions located at the end of the galaxy bar
and on each side of a nuclear bar.
