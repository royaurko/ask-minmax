The Seyfert 1 nucleus of NGC 4395 is energized by a black hole of 360,000
Solar masses (Peterson et al.), making it one of only two nuclear black holes
of intermediate mass, one thousand to one million Solar masses, detected in the
radio regime. Building upon UV and X-ray evidence for outflows from this
Seyfert nucleus, the VLBI High Sensitivity Array was used at 1.4 GHz to search
for extended structure on scales greater than 5 mas (0.1 pc). Elongated
emission was discovered, extending over 15 mas (0.3 pc) and suggesting an
outflow on sub-parsec scales from this intermediate-mass black hole. The
Seyfert nucleus is located at the center of an elliptical star cluster, and the
elongation position angle of the sub-parsec radio structure is only 19 degrees
from the star cluster's minor axis.
