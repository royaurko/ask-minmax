The low energy neutrino factory has been proposed as a very sensitive setup
for future searches for CP violation and matter effects. Here we study how its
performance is affected when the experimental specifications of the setup are
varied. Most notably, we have considered the addition of the 'platinum' nu_{mu}
-> nu_{e} channel. We find that, whilst theoretically the extra channel
provides very useful complementary information and helps to lift degeneracies,
its practical usefulness is lost when considering realistic background levels.
Conversely, an increase in statistics in the 'golden' nu_{e} -> nu_{mu} channel
and, to some extent, an improvement in the energy resolution, lead to an
important increase in the performance of the facility, given the rich energy
dependence of the 'golden' channel at these energies. We show that a low energy
neutrino factory with a baseline of 1300 km, muon energy of 4.5 GeV, and either
a 20 kton totally active scintillating detector or 100 kton liquid argon
detector, can have outstanding sensitivity to the neutrino oscillation
parameters theta13, delta and the mass hierarchy. For our estimated exposure of
2.8 x 10^{23} kton x decays per muon polarity, the low energy neutrino factory
has sensitivity to theta13 and delta for sin^{2}(2theta13) > 10^{-4} and to the
mass hierarchy for sin^{2}(2theta13) > 10^{-3}.
