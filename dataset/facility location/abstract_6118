We consider 5d SU(5) GUT models based on the orbifold $S^1/(Z_2 \times
Z_2')$, and study the different possibilities of placing the SU(5) matter
multiplets in three possible locations, namely, the two branes at the two
orbifold fixed points and SU(5) bulk. We demonstrate that if flavour
hierarchies originate solely from geometrical suppressions due to wavefunction
normalisation of fields propagating in the bulk, then it is not possible to
satisfy even the gross qualitative behaviour of the CKM and MNS matrices
regardless of where we place the matter multiplets.
