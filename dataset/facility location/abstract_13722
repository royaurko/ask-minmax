The Cosmicflows-2 catalogue is a compendium of peculiar velocity
measurements. While it has many objects in common with the COMPOSITE catalogue,
a previously analysed collection of peculiar velocity data found to give an
unexpectedly large bulk flow on large scales, the data in Cosmicflows-2 have
been reanalysed to ensure consistency between distances measured using
different methods. In particular, a focus on accurate distances led the contributors
of the Cosmicflows-2 to not correct for homogeneous or inhomogeneous Malmquist
bias, both or which are corrected for in the COMPOSITE compilation. We find
remarkable agreement between the COMPOSITE and the Cosmicflows-2 if the small
EFAR sample of clusters located in two dense superclusters is removed from both
surveys, giving results that are inconsistent with the $\Lambda$ cold dark
matter standard model with Planck central parameters at the 98\% level. On
smaller scales we find overall agreement between data sets and consistency with
the standard model.
