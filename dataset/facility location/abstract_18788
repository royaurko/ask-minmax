The experiment on the direct detection of antineutrino-electron scattering
with an artificial tritium source allows to lower the present-day laboratory
limit for the neutrino magnetic moment by two orders of magnitude. The
experiment brings together novel unique technologies in studies of rare
processes of neutrino-electron scattering: an artificial source of
antineutrinos from tritium decay of 40 MCi activity with the antineutrino flux
density ~6 10^{14}cm^{-2} s^{-1}; new types of detectors capable of detecting
electrons with energy down to ~10 eV, namely, a silicon cryogenic detector
based on the ionization-into-heat conversion effect, a high purity germanium
detector with the internal amplification of a signal in the electric field. A
compact installation located in a specially equipped laboratory underground
<100 m w.e.) will provide favorable background conditions for running the
experiment. With the background level about 0.1 events/kg keV day and detector
assembly masses 3kg and 5kg for the silicon and germanium ones, respectively,
the limit for the electron antineutrino magnetic moment mu_nu < 3 10^{-12}mu_B
will be obtained during 1-2 years of data acquisition. Status of the experiment
and state-of-the-art are presented.
