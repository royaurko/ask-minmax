PAT is the best-known example of a hybrid imaging method. In this article, we
define a Radon-type transform arising in a version of PAT that uses integrating
circle detectors and describe how the Radon transform integrating over all
circles with a fixed radius is determined from this Radon-type transform. Also,
the inversion of the Radon transform integrating over all circles is provided.
Various configuration of detectors have their own geometry problems. Here we
consider three situations: when the centers of the detectors are located on a
cylinder, on a plan, and on a sphere.
  This transform is similar to a toroidal transform, which maps a given
function to its integrals over a set of tori. We also study this mathematically
similar object.
