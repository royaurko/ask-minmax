Determinations of the fundamental properties (e.g., masses and ages) of
late-type, pre-main sequence (pre-MS) stars are complicated by the potential
for significant discrepancies between the spectral types of such stars as
ascertained via optical vs. near-infrared observations. To address this
problem, we have obtained near-IR spectroscopy of the nearby, close binary T
Tauri system V4046 Sgr AB with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) SPEX
spectrometer. The V4046 Sgr close binary (and circumbinary disk) system
provides an important test case for spectral type determination thanks to the
stringent observational constraints on its component stellar masses (i.e., ~0.9
Msun each) as well as on its age (12-21 Myr) and distance (73 pc). Analysis of
the IRTF data indicates that the composite near-IR spectral type for V4046 Sgr
AB lies in the range M0-M1, i.e., significantly later than the K5+K7 composite
type previously determined from optical spectroscopy. However, the K5+K7
composite type is in better agreement with theoretical pre-MS evolutionary
tracks, given the well-determined properties of V4046 Sgr AB. These results
serve as a cautionary tale for studies that rely on near-infrared spectroscopy
as a primary means to infer the ages and masses of pre-MS stars.
