Motivated by the observation of spiral patterns in a wide range of physical,
chemical, and biological systems we present an approach that aims at
characterizing quantitatively spiral-like elements in complex stripe-like
patterns. The approach provides the location of the spiral tip and the size of
the spiral arms in terms of their arclength and their winding number. In
addition, it yields the number of pattern components (Betti number), as well as
their size and certain aspects of their shape. We apply the method to spiral
defect chaos in thermally driven Rayleigh-B\'enard convection and find that the
arclength of spirals decreases monotonically with decreasing Prandtl number of
the fluid and increasing heating. By contrast, the winding number of the
spirals is non-monotonic in the heating. The distribution function for the
number of spirals is significantly narrower than a Poisson distribution. The
distribution function for the winding number shows approximately an exponential
decay. It depends only weakly on the heating, but strongly on the Prandtl
number. Large spirals arise only for larger Prandtl numbers ($Pr \gtrsim 1$).
In this regime the joint distribution for the spiral length and the winding
number exhibits a three-peak structure indicating the dominance of Archimedean
spirals of opposite sign and relatively straight sections. For small Prandtl
numbers the distribution function reveals a large number of small compact
pattern components.
