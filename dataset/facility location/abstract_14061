The geodesic equations for the general case of diagonal metrics of static,
spherically symmetric fields are calculated. The elimination of the proper time
variable gives the motion equations for test particles with respect to
coordinate time and an account of gravitational acceleration from the
coordinate perspective. The results are applied to the Schwarzschild metric and
to the so-called exponential metric. In an attempt to add an account of
gravitational force from the coordinate perspective, the special relativistic
mass-energy relation is generalized to diagonal metrics involving location
dependent and possibly anisotropic light speeds. This move requires a
distinction between two aspects of the mass of a test particle (parallel and
perpendicular to the field). The obtained force expressions do not reveal
gravitational repulsion for the Schwarzschild metric and for the exponential
metric.
