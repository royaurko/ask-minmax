We have used the Monte Carlo based computer models to show that selection
pressure could affect the distribution of recombination hotspots along the
chromosome. Close to critical crossover rate, where genomes may switch between
the Darwinian purifying selection or complementation of haplotypes, the
distribution of recombination events and the force of selection exerted on
genes affect the structure of chromosomes. The order of expression of gene s
and their location on chromosome may decide about the extinction or survival of
competing populations.
