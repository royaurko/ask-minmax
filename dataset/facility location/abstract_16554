We consider a game played between a hider, who hides a static object in one
of several possible positions in a bounded planar region, and a searcher, who
wishes to reach the object by querying sensors placed in the plane. The
searcher is a mobile agent, and whenever it physically visits a sensor, the
sensor returns a random direction, corresponding to a half-plane in which the
hidden object is located. We first present a novel search heuristic and
characterize bounds on the expected distance covered before reaching the
object. Next, we model this game as a large-dimensional zero-sum dynamic game
and we apply a recently introduced randomized sampling technique that provides
a probabilistic level of security to the hider. We observe that, when the
randomized sampling approach is only allowed to select a very small number of
samples, the cost of the heuristic is comparable to the security level provided
by the randomized procedure. However, as we allow the number of samples to
increase, the randomized procedure provides a higher probabilistic security
level.
