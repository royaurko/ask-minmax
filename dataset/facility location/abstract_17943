We are concerned with the acoustic scattering problem, at a frequency
$\kappa$, by many small obstacles of arbitrary shapes with impedance boundary
condition. These scatterers are assumed to be included in a bounded domain
$\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ which is embedded in an acoustic background
characterized by an eventually locally varying index of refraction. The
collection of the scatterers $D_m, \; m=1,...,M$ is modeled by four parameters:
their number $M$, their maximum radius $a$, their minimum distance $d$ and the
surface impedances $\lambda_m, \; m=1,...,M$. We consider the parameters $M, d$
and $\lambda_m$'s having the following scaling properties: $M:=M(a)=O(a^{-s})$,
$d:=d(a)\approx a^t$ and $\lambda_m:=\lambda_m(a)=\lambda_{m,0}a^{-\beta}$, as
$a \rightarrow 0$, with non negative constants $s, t$ and $\beta$ and complex
numbers $\lambda_{m, 0}$'s with eventually negative imaginary parts.
  We derive the asymptotic expansion of the farfields with explicit error
estimate in terms of $a$, as $a\rightarrow 0$. The dominant term is the
Foldy-Lax field corresponding to the scattering by the point-like scatterers
located at the centers $z_m$'s of the scatterers $D_m$'s with $\lambda_m \vert
\partial D_m\vert$ as the related scattering coefficients.
