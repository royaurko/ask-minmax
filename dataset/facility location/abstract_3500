A new measurement of proton resonance scattering on 7Be was performed up to
the center-of-mass energy of 6.7 MeV using the low-energy RI beam facility CRIB
(CNS Radioactive Ion Beam separator) at the Center for Nuclear Study of the
University of Tokyo. The excitation function of 7Be+p elastic scattering above
3.5 MeV was measured successfully for the first time, providing important
information about the resonance structure of the 8B nucleus. The resonances are
related to the reaction rate of 7Be(p, gamma)8B, which is the key reaction in
solar 8B neutrino production. Evidence for the presence of two negative parity
states is presented. One of them is a 2- state observed as a broad s-wave
resonance, the existence of which had been questionable. Its possible effects
on the determination of the astrophysical S-factor of 7Be(p, gamma)8B at solar
energy are discussed. The other state had not been observed in previous
measurements, and its spin and parity were determined as 1-.
