We investigate random lattices where the connectivities are determined by the
Voronoi construction, while the location of the points are the dynamic degrees
of freedom. The Voronoi random lattices with an associated energy are immersed
in a heat bath and investigated using a Monte Carlo simulation algorithm. In
thermodynamic equilibrium we measure coordination number distributions and test
the Aboav-Weaire and Lewis laws.
