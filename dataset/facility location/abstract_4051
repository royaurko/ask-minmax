We present BVI CCD photometry of 10 northern open clusters, Berkeley 43,
Berkeley 45, Berkeley 47, NGC 6846, Berkeley 49, Berkeley 51, Berkeley 89,
Berkeley 91, Tombaugh 4 and Berkeley 9, and estimate their fundamental
parameters. Eight of the clusters are located in the first galactic quadrant
and 2 are in the second. This is the first optical photometry for 8 clusters.
All of them are embedded in rich galactic fields and have large reddening
towards them (E(B-V) = 1.0 - 2.3 mag). There is a possibility that some of
these difficult-to-study clusters may be asterisms rather than physical
systems, but assuming they are physical clusters, we find that 8 of them are
located beyond 2 kpc, and 6 clusters (60% of the sample) are located well above
or below the Galactic plane. Seven clusters have ages 500 Myr or less and the
other 3 are 1 Gyr or more in age. This sample of clusters has increased the
optical photometry of clusters in the second half of the first galactic
quadrant, beyond 2 kpc, from 10 to 15. NGC 6846 is found to be one of the most
distant clusters in this region of the Galaxy.
