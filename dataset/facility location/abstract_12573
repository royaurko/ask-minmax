We investigate spin and optical properties of individual nitrogen-vacancy
centers located within 1-10 nm from the diamond surface. We observe stable
defects with a characteristic optically detected magnetic resonance spectrum
down to lowest depth. We also find a small, but systematic spectral broadening
for defects shallower than about 2 nm. This broadening is consistent with the
presence of a surface paramagnetic impurity layer [Tisler et al., ACS Nano 3,
1959 (2009)] largely decoupled by motional averaging. The observation of stable
and well-behaved defects very close to the surface is critical for single-spin
sensors and devices requiring nanometer proximity to the target.
