We present a 200 ksec Chandra observation of seven spectroscopically
selected, high redshift (0.75 < z < 1.03) galaxy groups and clusters discovered
by the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS). X-ray
emission at the locations of these systems is consistent with background. The
3-sigma upper limits on the bolometric X-ray luminosities (L_X) of these
systems put a strong constraint on the relation between L_X and the velocity
dispersion of member galaxies sigma_gal at z~1; the DEEP2 systems have lower
luminosity than would be predicted by the local relation. Our result is
consistent with recent findings that at high redshift, optically selected
clusters tend to be X-ray underluminous. A comparison with mock catalogs
indicates that it is unlikely that this effect is entirely caused by a
measurement bias between sigma_gal and the dark matter velocity dispersion.
Physically, the DEEP2 systems may still be in the process of forming and hence
not fully virialized, or they may be deficient in hot gas compared to local
systems. We find only one possibly extended source in this Chandra field, which
happens to lie outside the DEEP2 coverage.
