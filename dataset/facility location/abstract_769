The Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) facility at Fermilab is under
construction and due to begin operations in late 2004. NuMI will deliver an
intense $\nu_{\mu}$ beam of variable energy 2-20 GeV directed into the Earth at
58 mrad. Several aspects of the design are reviewed, and potential limitations
to the ultimate neutrino flux are described. In addition, potential
measurements of neutrino mixing properties are described.
