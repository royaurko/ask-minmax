We have revisited the stellar content of OMC 2 and OMC 3 by means of MIR
imaging and NIR photometry; in addition, we have extended the existing (sub)mm
maps by a huge 1200 micron map obtained with SIMBA showing new sources and
filamentary features for the first time at that wavelength. The MIR data reveal
43 new sources at N and Q which are partly associated with dense condensations
at millimetre wavelengths. Six close binary sources could be resolved at
locations where existing (sub)mm maps only show single emission peaks; three of
them are classified as early (B-type) systems, one of them is compatible with
type K while the remaining two seem to be T Tauri stars. Furthermore, the MIR
images indicate the existence of separate circumstellar discs in the K-binary
system. NIR colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams obtained from 2MASS
data are examined to explore the physical properties of the sources and to
derive the distribution of J luminosities. There is a clear decrease in
luminosity and thus in stellar mass when going from South to North. Likewise,
there is an anti-correlation between Class I and II objects in both regions:
while OMC 2 contains twice as much Class II objects compared to Class I, the
situation is reversed in OMC 3.
