A correlation between accelerated motion and a noncompact 5th dimension is
proposed. The curvature invariants and the stress energy tensor in the bulk
depend only on the 5th dimension $w$ and vanish asymptotically while the proper
acceleration of a static observer is proportional to $1/w$. The brane (located
at $w = w_{0}$) metric is conformally flat (of AdS type) with $\Lambda =
-3/w_{0}^{2}$ and the invariant acceleration $a = \sqrt{a^{b}a_{b}} = 1/w_{0}$.
Therefore, we assume that a hyperbolic observer with the rest-system
acceleration $a$ is embedded in the 5th dimension at $w_{0} = 1/a$.
