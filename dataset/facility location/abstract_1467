Because of the scheduled GLAST mission by NASA, there is strong scientific
justification for preparation for very extensive blazar monitoring in the
optical bands to exploit the opportunity to learn about blazars through the
correlation of variability of the gamma-ray flux with flux at lower
frequencies. Current optical facilities do not provide the required
capability.Developments in technology have enabled astronomers to readily
deploy automatic telescopes. The effort to create an Automatic Telescope
Network (ATN) for blazar monitoring in the GLAST era is described. Other
scientific applications of the networks of automatic telescopes are discussed.
The potential of the ATN for science education is also discussed.
