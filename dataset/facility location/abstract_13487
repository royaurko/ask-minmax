Face recognition presents a challenging problem in the field of image
analysis and computer vision. The security of information is becoming very
significant and difficult. Security cameras are presently common in airports,
Offices, University, ATM, Bank and in any locations with a security system.
Face recognition is a biometric system used to identify or verify a person from
a digital image. Face Recognition system is used in security. Face recognition
system should be able to automatically detect a face in an image. This involves
extracts its features and then recognize it, regardless of lighting,
expression, illumination, ageing, transformations (translate, rotate and scale
image) and pose, which is a difficult task. This paper contains three sections.
The first section describes the common methods like holistic matching method,
feature extraction method and hybrid methods. The second section describes
applications with examples and finally third section describes the future
research directions of face recognition.
