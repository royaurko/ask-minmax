The EGRET telescope has repeatedly observed 3EG J1835+5918 as a bright and
steady source of high-energy gamma-ray radiation which has not yet been
indentified. EGRET data from CGRO observation cycle 1 to 7 have been reanalysed
above 100 MeV and above 1 GeV. The gamma-ray source location represents the
latest and probably final positional assessment based on EGRET data. We
especially adress the question of flux variability and spectral variability.
The results of a X-ray/optical identification campaign towards 3EG J1835+5918
are given. The one object which might be associated with the gamma-ray source
3EG J1835+5918 has the characteristics of an isolated neutron star and possible
of a radio-quiet pulsar.
