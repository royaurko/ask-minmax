We present a theoretical model describing the current transient behavior
observed during electrodeposition in an opal modified electrode. As a basic
unit we consider a cylindrical vessel with a porous and corrugated surface,
whose radius changes periodically with z, the vertical axis of the corrugated
vessel. According to the model, the porous network is formed by the replication
of those units, put side by side in close contact, and impregnated by an
electrolytic solution. Through the lateral surface of those cylinders we allow
for a selective flux of species. The inward or outward flux obeys a complex
dynamics regulated by the competition between the diffusion kinetics and the
chemical kinetics that answer for the reduction of species at a reactive
surface located at the bottom of the cylindrical cavities. The analytical
expression for the current transient is complemented by a random prescription
for the influx or outfluxes of matter through the lateral surface plus a
modulation in its intensity that follows the surface corrugation. The
theoretical data are compared with the current transients obtained in
nanosphere lithography experiments.
