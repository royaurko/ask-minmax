Three-dimensional $Z(N)$ lattice gauge theories are studied numerically at
finite temperature for $N$ = 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 20 and for $N_t$=2,4,8. For each
model the location of phase transitions and its critical indices are
determined. The scaling of critical points with $N$ is proposed. The data
obtained enable us to verify the scaling near the continuum limit for the
$Z(N)$ models at finite temperatures.
