In the framework of research on IVth generation reactors and high intensity
neutron sources a low-power prototype neutron amplifier was recently proposed
by INFN. It is based on a low-energy, high current proton cyclotron, whose
beam, impinging on a thick Beryllium converter, produces a fast neutron
spectrum. The world database on the neutron yield from thick Beryllium target
in the 70 MeV proton energy domain is rather scarce. The new measurement was
performed at LNS, covering a wide angular range from 0 to 150 degrees and an
almost complete neutron energy interval. In this contribution the preliminary
data are discussed together with the proposed ADS facility.
