The version 1.51 of the Monte Carlo (MC) program KoralW for all $e^+e^-\to
f_1\bar f_2 f_3\bar f_4$ processes is presented. The most important change
since the previous version 1.42 is the facility for writing MC events on the
mass storage device and re-processing them later on. In the re-processing one
may modify parameters of the Standard Model in order to fit them to
experimental data. Another important new feature is a possibility of including
complete ${\cal O}(\alpha)$ corrections to double-resonant W-pair
component-processes in addition to all background (non-WW) graphs. The
inclusion is done with the help of the YFSWW3 MC event generator for fully
exclusive differential distributions (event-per-event). Technically, it is done
in such a way that YFSWW3 runs concurrently with KoralW as a separate slave
process, reading momenta of the MC event generated by KoralW and returning the
correction weight to KoralW. KoralW introduces the ${\cal O}(\alpha)$
correction using this weight, and finishes processing the event (rejection due
to total MC weight, hadronization, etc.). The communication between KoralW and
YFSWW3 is done with the help of the FIFO facility of the UNIX/Linux operating
system. This does not require any modifications of the FORTRAN source codes.
The resulting Concurrent MC event generator KoralW&YFSWW3 looks from the user's
point of view as a regular single MC event generator with all the standard
features.
