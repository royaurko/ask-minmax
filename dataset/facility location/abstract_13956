NGC 55 ULX1 is a bright Ultraluminous X-ray source located 1.78 Mpc away. We
analysed a sample of 20 Swift observations, taken between 2013 April and
August, and two Chandra observations taken in 2001 September and 2004 June. We
found only marginal hints of a limited number of dips in the light curve,
previously reported to occur in this source, although the uncertainties due to
the low counting statistics of the data are large. The Chandra and Swift
spectra showed clearly spectral variability which resembles those observed in
other ULXs. We can account for this spectral variability in terms of changes in
both the normalization and intrinsic column density of a two-components model
consisting of a blackbody (for the soft component) and a multicolour accretion
disc (for the hard component). We discuss the possibility that strong outflows
ejected by the disc are in part responsible for such spectral changes.
