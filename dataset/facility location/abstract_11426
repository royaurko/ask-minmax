We demonstrate a macroscopic magnetic guide for cold atoms with suppressed
longitudinal field curvature which is highly desired for atom interferometry.
The guide is based on macroscopic copper tape coils in a copropagating currents
geometry, where the atoms are located between the coils few cm away from each
surface. The symmetric geometry provides a much lower magnetic field curvature
per fixed length that promises longer coherence time for atom interferometers.
A double-tape design of each coil allows a smooth translation of guided atoms
without addition of an external bias field. The guide is also immune from the
current and thermal noise by virtue of the turns averaging and a large working
distance, respectively. We present the experimental results of guide
application to atom interferometry.
