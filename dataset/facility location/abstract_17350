Recently, the number of requests for multicast services through the wireless
networks has been increased. However, for successful deployment, security and
efficiency of content delivery must be provided at first. This paper presents a
new approach for secure multicast in wireless networks. This approach, CRAW
(Combination of Re-keying and Authentication in Wireless networks) combines
member authentication procedure with group key management protocol to provide
an efficient group re-keying process. One-time password is proposed for member
authentication and CKC (Code for Key Calculation) is suggested for group key
management in wireless networks. In fact, the combination of authentication
with group key management in wireless networks results in a simple and secure
mechanism both for authentication and group key management while mobile members
join/leave a group or move inter-area. Simulation results show that CRAW
reduces re-keying overhead at join from O(log2 n+1) to O(1) while security
requirements are saved. Also, CRAW introduces storing a main list to manage
mobile members' location while they move intra-group inter-area.
