While the shape of the extinction curve on the infrared is considered to be
set and the extinction ratios between infrared bands are usually taken to be
approximately constant, a recent number of studies point either to a spatially
variable behavior on the exponent of the power law or to a different extinction
law altogether. In this paper, we propose a method to analyze the overall
behavior of the interstellar extinction by means of the red-clump population,
and we apply it to those areas of the Milky Way where the presence of
interstellar matter is heavily felt: areas located in 5 deg<l<30 deg and b=0
deg. We show that the extinction ratios traditionally used for the near
infrared could be inappropriate for the inner Galaxy and we analyze the
behavior of the extinction law from 1 to 8 microns.
