We present Chandra X-ray observations of the supernova remnant (SNR) N63A in
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). N63A, one of the brightest LMC remnants, is
embedded in an H II region and probably associated with an OB association. The
optical remnant consists of three lobes of emission contained within the
approximately three times larger X-ray remnant. Our Chandra data reveal a
number of new physical structures in N63A. The most striking of these are the
several ``crescent''-shaped structures located beyond the main shell that
resemble similar features seen in the Vela SNR. In Vela, these have been
interpreted as arising from high speed clumps of supernova ejecta interacting
with the ambient medium. Another distinct feature of the remnant is a roughly
triangular ``hole'' in the X-ray emission near the location of the optical
lobes and the brightest radio emission. X-ray spectral analysis shows that this
deficit of emission is a result of absorption by an intervening dense cloud
with a mass of ~450 M_sun that is currently being engulfed by the remnant's
blast wave. We also find that the rim of the remnant, as well as the
crescent-shaped features, have considerably softer X-ray spectra than the
interior. Limits on hard X-ray emission rule out a young, energetic pulsar in
N63A, but the presence of an older or less active one, powering a wind nebula
with a luminosity less than ~4e10^34 erg/s, is allowed.
