We study steady-state evaporation in an atom guide via Monte Carlo
simulations. The evaporation surface follows a specific profile as a function
of longitudinal guide location. We demonstrate that the choice of evaporation
profile significantly impacts the performance of the evaporation. Our
simulations also demonstrate a significant performance boost in the evaporation
when using a longitudinally compressed guide. We show that for a purely
pressure-driven atom beam, it should be possible to reach degeneracy within a
$0.5~\m$ guide for experimentally feasible, albeit challenging, loading
conditions.
