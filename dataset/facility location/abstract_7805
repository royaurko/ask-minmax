Neutral theories have played a crucial and revolutionary role in fields such
as population genetics and biogeography. These theories are critical by
definition, in the sense that the overall growth rate of each single
allele/species/type vanishes. Thus each species in a neutral model sits at the
edge between invasion and extinction, allowing for the coexistence of
symmetric/neutral types. However, in finite systems, mono-dominated states are
ineludibly reached in relatively short times owing to demographic fluctuations,
thus leaving us with an unsatisfactory framework to rationalize
empirically-observed long-term coexistence. Here, we scrutinize the effect of
heterogeneity in quasi-neutral theories, in which there can be a local mild
preference for some of the competing species at some sites, even if the overall
species symmetry is maintained. As we show here, mild biases at a small
fraction of locations suffice to induce overall robust and durable species
coexistence, even in regions arbitrarily far apart from the biased locations.
This result stems from the long-range nature of the underlying critical bulk
dynamics and has a number of implications, for example, in conservation ecology
as it suggests that constructing local specific "sanctuaries" for different
competing species can result in global enhancement of biodiversity, even in
regions arbitrarily distant from the protected refuges.
