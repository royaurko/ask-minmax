We use electrostatic force microscopy and scanned gate microscopy to probe
the conducting properties of carbon nanotubes at room temperature. Multi-walled
carbon nanotubes are shown to be diffusive conductors, while metallic
single-walled carbon nanotubes are ballistic conductors over micron lengths.
Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes are shown to have a series of
large barriers to conduction along their length. These measurements are also
used to probe the contact resistance and locate breaks in carbon nanotube
circuits.
