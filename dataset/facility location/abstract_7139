Recent {\it ASCA} observations confirm the presence of X-ray absorption due
to partially ionized gas in many Seyfert 1 galaxies; the so-called warm
absorber. Constraints on the location of the warm material are presented with
the conclusion that this material lies at radii coincident with, or just
outside, the broad-line region. The stability of this warm material to isobaric
perturbations under the assumptions of thermal and photoionization equilibrium
is also studied. It is shown that there is a remarkably small range of
ionization parameter, $\xi$, for which the warm absorber state is stable. The
robustness of this result to changes in the shape of the primary continuum, the
assumed density and optical depth is investigated. Given the constraints on the
location and the stability properties of the material, several models for the
environments of Seyfert nuclei are discussed. These attempt to explain the
presence of significant amounts of partially ionized material. In particular,
various models of the broad-line region are discussed. The simple two-phase
model of the broad-line region proves to be unsatisfactory. A model of the
broad-line region is presented in which a turbulent, hot intercloud medium is
mechanically heated. Turbulent mixing layers could then give rise to warm
absorption features. Finally, a model is discussed in which the warm absorber
is due to a steady state, radiatively driven outflow.
