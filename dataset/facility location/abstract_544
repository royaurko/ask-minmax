We discuss a scenario to extract up to 150 MeV neutrinos at a standard
beta-beam facility using one and two detectors off-axis. In particular we show
that the high-energy component of the neutrino fluxes can be subtracted through
a specific combination of the response of two off-axis detectors. A systematic
analysis of the neutrino fluxes using different detector geometries is
presented, as well as a comparison with the expected fluxes at a low-energy
beta-beam facility. The presented option could offer an alternative way to
perform low-energy neutrino experiments.
