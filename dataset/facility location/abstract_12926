Aims. The main purpose is to map the radial variation of the stellar space
density for the young stellar population in the Galactic anticenter direction
in order to understand the structure and location of the Perseus spiral arm.
Methods. A uvbyHbeta Stromgren photometric survey covering 16sqrdeg in the
anticenter direction was carried out using the Wide Field Camera at the Isaac
Newton Telescope. This is the natural photometric system for identifying young
stars and obtaining accurate estimates of individual distances and ages. The
calibration to the standard system was undertaken using open clusters. Results.
We present a main catalog of 35974 stars with all Stromgren indexes and a more
extended one with 96980 stars with partial data. The central 8sqrdeg have a
limiting magnitude of V<17m, while the outer region reaches V<15.5m. These
large samples will permit us to analyze the stellar surface density variation
associated to the Perseus arm also to study the properties of the stellar
component and the interstellar extinction in the anticenter direction.
