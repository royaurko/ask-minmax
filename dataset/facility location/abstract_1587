The high frequency dynamics of low- (LDA) and high-density amorphous-ice
(HDA) and of cubic ice (I_c) has been measured by inelastic X-ray Scattering
(IXS) in the 1-15 nm^{-1} momentum transfer (Q) range. Sharp phonon-like
excitations are observed, and the longitudinal acoustic branch is identified up
to Q = 8nm^{-1} in LDA and I_c and up to 5nm^{-1} in HDA. The narrow width of
these excitations is in sharp contrast with the broad features observed in all
amorphous systems studied so far. The "crystal-like" behavior of amorphous
ices, therefore, implies a considerable reduction in the number of decay
channels available to sound-like excitations which is assimilated to low local
disorder.
