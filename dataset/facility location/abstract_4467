A thorough analysis of the OGLE-II time-series photometry of the Large
Magellanic Cloud bar supplemented by similar data from the MACHO database led
us to the discovery of three Beta Cephei-type stars. These are the first known
extragalactic Beta Cephei-type stars. Two of the three stars are multiperiodic.
Two stars have inferred masses of about 10 Mo while the third is about 2 mag
brighter and at least twice as massive. All three variables are located in or
very close to the massive and young LMC associations (LH 41, 59 and 81). It is
therefore very probable that the variables have higher than average
metallicities. This would reconcile our finding with theoretical predictions of
the shape and location of the Beta Cephei instability strip in the H-R diagram.
The low number of Beta Cephei stars found in the LMC is another observational
confirmation of strong dependence of the mechanism driving pulsations in these
variables on metallicity. Follow-up spectroscopic determination of the
metallicities in the discovered variables will provide a good test for the
theory of pulsational stability in massive main-sequence stars.
