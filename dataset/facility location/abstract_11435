We study optically-induced collective excitations of graphene in the presence
of a strong perpendicular magnetic field and a single impurity. We determine
the energies and absorption strengths of these excitations, which become
localised on the impurity. Two different types of impurity are considered i.
the long-range Coulomb impurity, ii. a delta-function impurity located at
either an A or B graphene sublattice site. Both impurity types result in some
bound states appearing both above and below the magnetoplasmon continuum,
although the effect of the short-range impurity is less pronounced. The
dependence of the energies and oscillator strengths of the bound states on the
filling factor is investigated.
