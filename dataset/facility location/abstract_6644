Liquid Argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) is a promising detector
technology for future neutrino experiments. MicroBooNE is an upcoming LArTPC
neutrino experiment which will be located on-axis of Booster Neutrino Beam
(BNB) at Fermilab, USA. The R&D efforts on this detection method and related
neutrino interaction measurements are discussed.
