A pointlike electric charge at rest is considered in the spacetime which is a
wormhole connecting two otherwise Minkowskian spaces. The potential (i. e. a
solution of the Maxwell equations) is split into two parts: one of them depends
only on the value and location of the charge, while the other, on the contrary,
does not change when the charge is quasistatically moved. Correspondingly, the
former is interpreted as being generated by the charge, and the latter as being
source-free. It is shown that all source-free potentials differ in the flux
through the throat (no "multipoles without multipoles"), which enables one to
interpret the flux as the "charge" of the wormhole in agreement with Wheeler's
concept of "charge without charge". The potential generated by the charge
differs from Coulomb's and thus a force (called "self-force") acts on the
charge even in the absence of the source-free field. This force is found
explicitly in the limit of vanishing throat length. The result differs from
that obtained recently by Khusnutdinov and Bakhmatov.
