Several popular cosmological models predict that most of the baryonic mass in
the local universe is located in filamentary and sheet-like structures
associated with galaxy overdensities. This gas is expected to be
gravitationally heated to ~10^6 K and therefore emitting in the soft X-rays. We
have detected diffuse soft X-ray structures in a high Galactic latitude ROSAT
field after point source subtraction and correction for Galactic absorption.
These diffuse structures have an X-ray energy distribution that is much softer
than expected from clusters, groups or unresolved emission from AGNs, but are
consistent with that expected from a diffuse warm intergalactic medium. To
discriminate between a Galactic or extragalactic nature of the diffuse gas we
have correlated the soft X--map with multiband optical images in this field. We
have found a significant overdensity of galaxies in correspondence with the
strongest diffuse X-ray structure. The photometric redshift distribution of the
galaxies over the X-ray peak has an excess over field galaxies at z~0.45. This
result strongly suggests that the diffuse X-ray flux is due to extragalactic
emission by warm gas associated with an overdense galaxy region at z~0.45.
