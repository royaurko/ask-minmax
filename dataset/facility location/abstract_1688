The new project GENIUS will cover a wide range of the parameter space of
predictions of SUSY for neutralinos as cold dark matter. Together with DAMA it
will be the only experiment which can probe the seasonal modulation signal.
Concerning hot dark matter GENIUS will be able to fix the (effective) neutrino
mass with high accuracy. A GENIUS Test Facility has just been funded and will
come into operation by end of 2002.
