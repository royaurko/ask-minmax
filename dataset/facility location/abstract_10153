The DELPHI detector at LEP, located 100 $m$ underground, has been used to
detect the multi-muon bundles by cathode readout of its hadron calorimeter and
its tracking detectors (TPC, muon chambers). The experimental apparatus allows
us to study muon bundles originating from primary cosmic particles with
energies in the interval $10^{14}$ - $10^{17} eV$.
  The cosmic events registered during the years 1999 and 2000 correspond
roughly to $1.6 10^6 s$ of effective run time.
  The aim of the work is to compare the measured muon multiplicity
distributions and predictions of high energy interaction models for different
types of primary particles and also to determine the absolute flux of events in
certain muon multiplicity range. The presentation describes the current status
of the analysis.
