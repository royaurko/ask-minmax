The ground state of the Holstein molecular crystal model in one dimension is
studied using the Global-Local variational method, analyzing in particular the
total energy, kinetic energy, phonon energy, and interaction energy over a
broad region of the polaron parameter space. Through the application of
objective criteria, a unique curve is identified that simply, accurately, and
robustly locates the self-trapping transition separating small polaron and
large polaron behavior.
