We report on the energetics of the 2012 March 12 polar coronal mass ejection
(CME) originating from a southern latitude of ~60o. The polar CME is similar to
low-latitude CMEs in almost all respects: three-part morphology, post eruption
arcade (PEA), CME and filament kinematics, CME mass and kinetic energy, and the
relative thermal energy content of the PEA. From polarized brightness images,
we estimate the CME mass, which is close to the average mass of low-latitude
CMEs. The CME kinetic energy (3.3x1030 erg) is also typical of the general
population of CMEs. From photospheric magnetograms, we estimate the free energy
(1.8x1031 erg) in the polar crown source region, which we find is sufficient to
power the CME and the PEA. About 19% of the free energy went into the CME
kinetic energy. We compute the thermal energy content of the PEA (2.3x1029 erg)
and find it to be a small fraction (6.8%) of the CME kinetic energy. This
fraction is remarkably similar to that in active region CMEs associated with
major flares. We also show that the 2012 March 12 is one among scores of polar
CMEs observed during the maximum phase of cycle 24. The cycle 24 polar crown
prominence eruptions have the same rate of association with CMEs as those from
low-latitudes. This investigation supports the view that all CMEs are
magnetically propelled from closed field regions, irrespective of their
location on the Sun (polar crown filament regions, quiescent filament regions
or active regions).
