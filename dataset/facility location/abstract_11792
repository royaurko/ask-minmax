We perform simulations to investigate how the energy carried by a molecule
transfers to others in an equilibrium gas model. For this purpose we consider a
microcanonical ensemble of equilibrium gas systems, each of them contains a
tagged molecule located at the same position initially. The ensuing transfer
process of the energy initially carried by the tagged molecule is then exposed
in terms of the ensemble-averaged energy density distribution. In both a 2D and
a 3D gas model with Lennard-Jones interactions at room temperature, it is found
that the energy carried by a molecule propagates in the gas ballistically, in
clear contrast with the Gaussian diffusion widely assumed in previous studies.
A possible scheme of experimental study of this issue is also proposed
