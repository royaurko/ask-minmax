Analysis of Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 images of
Stephan's Quintet, Hickson Compact Group 92, yielded 115 candidate star
clusters (with V-I < 1.5). Unlike in merger remants, the cluster candidates in
Stephan's Quintet are not clustered in the inner regions of the galaxies; they
are spread over the debris and surrounding area. Specifically, these sources
are located in the long sweeping tail and spiral arms of NGC 7319, in the tidal
debris of NGC 7318B/A, and in the intragroup starburst region north of these
galaxies. Analysis of the colors of the clusters indicates several distinct
epochs of star formation that appear to trace the complex history of dynamical
interactions in this compact group.
