This paper presents a new greedy sensor placement algorithm, named maximal
projection on minimum eigenspace (MPME), for linear inverse problem. For each
sensing location, the projection of its observation vector onto the eigenspace
associated with the minimum eigenvalue of the dual observation matrix is shown
to be negative correlated with the worst case error variance (WCEV) of the
estimated parameters. We individually select the sensing location whose
observation vector has a maximum projection onto the eigenspace of the minimum
eigenvalue of the current dual observation matrix. The proposed MPME is shown
computationally more efficient than the state-of-the-art. The Monte-Carlo
simulation shows that the MPME outperforms the convex relaxation method [1],
the SparSenSe [2], and the FrameSense [3] in terms of the WCEV and the mean
square error (MSE) of the estimated parameters, especially when the number of
sensor nodes is slightly more than the dimension of the estimated vector.
