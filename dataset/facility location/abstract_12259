We present a systematic search for radio counterparts to Ultra Luminous X-ray
(ULX) source candidates based on a cross-correlation of the Swartz et al.
(2004) ULX catalogue based on Chandra data and the FIRST radio survey. We find
seven cases of conspiscuous peaks of radio emission that could be associated to
ULX sources. Among these seven ULX radio candidates, three X-ray sources are
located within 5" of the FIRST radio peaks. These three cases are shown and
discussed individually.
