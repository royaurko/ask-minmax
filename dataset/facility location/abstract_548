The $\Lambda(1520)$ resonance has been recently studied in a unitarized
coupled channel formalism with $\pi\Sigma(1385)$, $K\Xi(1530)$, $\bar{K}N$ and
$\pi\Sigma$ as constituents blocks. We provide a theoretical study of the
predictions of this model in physical observables of the $pp\to pK^+K^-p$ and
$pp\to pK^+\pi^0\pi^0\Lambda$ reactions. In particular, we show that the ratio
between the $\pi^0\pi^0\Lambda$ and $K^-p$ mass distributions can provide
valuable information on the ratio of the couplings of the $\Lambda(1520)$
resonance to $\pi\Sigma(1385)$ and $\bar{K}N$ that the theory predicts.
Calculations are done for energies which are accessible in an experimental
facility like COSY at J\"ulich or the developing CSR facility at Lanzhou.
