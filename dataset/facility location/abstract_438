The Medley setup is planned to be moved to and used at the new neutron
facility NFS where measurements of light-ion production and fission
cross-sections are planned at 1-40 MeV. Medley has eight detector telescopes
providing Delta E-Delta E-E data, each consisting of two silicon detectors and
a CsI(Tl) detector at the back. The telescope setup is rotatable and can be
made to cover any angle. Medley has previously been used in many measurements
at The Svedberg Laboratory (TSL) in Uppsala mainly with a quasi-mono-energetic
neutron beam at 96 and 175 MeV.
  To be able to do measurements at NFS, which will have a white neutron beam,
Medley needs to detect the reaction products with a high temporal resolution
providing the ToF of the primary neutron. In this paper we discuss the design
of the Medley upgrade along with simulations of the setup. We explore the use
of Parallel Plate Avalanche Counters (PPACs) which work very well for detecting
fission fragments but require more consideration for detecting deeply
penetrating particles.
