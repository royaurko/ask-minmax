Measurements of the width of the radio bridge at several locations along the
bridge for each of four powerful extended radio sources are presented. Adopting
a few simple assumptions, these measurements may be used to predict the radio
surface brightness as a function of position across the radio bridge. The
predicted and observed surface brightnesses across the bridges are compared and
found to agree fairly well. The results are consistent with a simple picture in
which the radio power and size of the radio lobe at the forward edge of the
radio bridge are roughly time-independent for a given source, and the expansion
of the bridge in the lateral direction is adiabatic. There is no indication
that reacceleration or energy transport is important in the bridges of these
sources. The rate of lateral expansion of the bridge just behind the radio lobe
and hotspot in terms of the rate of forward propagation is compared with that
predicted, and found to be in good agreement with the predicted value.
