Recent preliminary evidence for a $D \bar{D}$ state $\chi(3.86)$ raises
extremely interesting implications for theoretical models, particularly those
currently in vogue, e.g. the flux tube model and a molecular charmonium
picture. We examine the experimental consequences as well as the possible
unveiling of a strata of C-exotic states in heavy quarkonia systems by future
facilities like BES Upgrade/Tau-Charm Factory and CLEO III/B-Factories.
