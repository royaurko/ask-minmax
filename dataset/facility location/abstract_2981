The current contributors have previously shown that inhomogeneous, but spherically
symmetric universe models containing only matter can yield a very good fit to
the SNIa data and the position of the first CMB peak. In this work we examine
how far away from the center of inhomogeneity the observer can be located in
these models and still fit the data well. Furthermore, we investigate whether
such an off-center location can explain the observed alignment of the lowest
multipoles of the CMB map. We find that the observer has to be located within a
radius of 15 Mpc from the center for the induced dipole to be less than that
observed by the COBE satellite. But for such small displacements from the
center, the induced quadru- and octopoles turn out to be insufficiently large
to explain the alignment.
