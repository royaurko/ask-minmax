GCRT J1745-3009 is a transient bursting radio source located in the direction
of the Galactic center, discovered in 330 MHz VLA observations from 2002
September 30--October 1 by Hyman et al. We have searched for bursting activity
from GCRT J1745-3009 in nearly all of the available 330 MHz VLA observations of
the Galactic center since 1989 as well as in 2003 GMRT observations. We report
a new radio detection of the source in 330 MHz GMRT data taken on 2003
September 28. A single ~0.5 Jy burst was detected, approximately 3x weaker than
the five bursts detected in 2002. Due to the sparse sampling of the 2003
observation, only the decay portion of a single burst was detected. We present
additional evidence indicating that this burst is an isolated one, but we
cannot completely rule out additional undetected bursts that may have occured
with the same ~77 min. periodicity observed in 2002 or with a different
periodicity. Assuming the peak emission was detected, the decay time of the
burst, ~2 min, is consistent with that determined for the 2002 bursts. Based on
the total time for which we have observations, we estimate that the source has
a duty cycle of roughly 10%.
