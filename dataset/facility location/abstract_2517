This is a review on beam tomography research at Daresbury. The research has
focussed on development of normalised phase space techniques. It starts with
the idea of sampling tomographic projections at equal phase advances and shows
that this would give the optimal reconstruction results. This idea has
influenced the design, construction and operation of the tomography sections at
the Photo Injector Test Facility at Zeuthen (PITZ) and at the Accelerator and
Laser in Combined Experiments (ALICE) at Daresbury. The theoretical
justification of this idea is later developed through simulations and analysis
of the measurements results at ALICE. The mathematical formalism is constructed
around the normalised phase space and the idea of equal phase advances become
the basis of this. This formalism is applied to a variety of experimental and
simulated situations and shown to be useful in improving resolution, increasing
reliability and providing diagnostic information. In this review, we also
present the simplifying concepts, formalisms and simulation tools that we have
developed.
