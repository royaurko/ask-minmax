Given the impressive investment by the nation in observational Astronomy and
Astrophysics facilities coming on line now and in the near future, we advocate
for an increased investment in applied and fundamental research on
Astrophysical and Celestial Dynamics (ACD). Specifically we call for a)
continued and expanded support for applied research in ACD, b) creation of
support for fundamental research in ACD and its subfields, and c) the creation
of a unified program to help scientists coordinate and collaborate in their
research in these fields. The benefits of this proposal are threefold. First,
it will enable researchers to interpret and understand the implications of
newly observed phenomena that will invariably arise from new facilities and
surveys. Second, research on fundamentals will foster connections between
specialists, leveraging advances found in one sub-field and making them
available to others. Third, a coordinated approach for applied and fundamental
research in ACD will help academic institutions in the United States to produce
future researchers trained and knowledgeable in essential subfields such as
Mathematical Celestial Mechanics and able to continue its advancement in
conjunction with the increase in observations.
