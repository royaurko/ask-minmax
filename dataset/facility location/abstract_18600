New GALEX observations have detected significant FUV (1530 Angstroms) and NUV
(2310 Angstroms) emission from stellar substructures within the tidal tails of
four ongoing galaxy mergers. The UV-bright regions are optically faint and are
coincident with HI density enhancements. FUV emission is detected at any
location where the HI surface density exceeds ~2 M_sun pc^{-2}, and is often
detected in the absence of visible wavelength emission. UV luminosities of the
brighter regions of the tidal tails imply masses of 10^6 M_sun to ~10^9 M_sun
in young stars in the tails, and HI luminosities imply similar HI masses.
UV-optical colors of the tidal tails indicate stellar populations as young as a
few Myr, and in all cases ages < 400Myr. Most of the young stars in the tails
formed in single bursts rather than resulting from continuous star formation,
and they formed *in situ* as the tails evolved. Star formation appears to be
older near the parent galaxies and younger at increasing distances from the
parent galaxy. This could be because the star formation occurs progressively
along the tails, or because the star formation has been inhibited near the
galaxy/tail interface. The youngest stellar concentrations, usually near the
ends of long tidal tails, have masses comparable to confirmed tidal dwarf
galaxies and may be newly forming galaxies undergoing their first burst of star
formation.
