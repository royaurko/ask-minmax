A dominating set $S$ of a graph $G$ is called locating-dominating, LD-set for
short, if every vertex $v$ not in $S$ is uniquely determined by the set of
neighbors of $v$ belonging to $S$. Locating-dominating sets of minimum
cardinality are called $LD$-codes and the cardinality of an LD-code is the
location-domination number $\lambda(G)$. An LD-set $S$ of a graph $G$ is global
if it is an LD-set of both $G$ and its complement $\overline{G}$. The global
location-domination number $\lambda_g(G)$ is the minimum cardinality of a
global LD-set of $G$. In this work, we give some relations between
locating-dominating sets and the location-domination number in a graph and its
complement.
