We report a novel experimental technique that measures simultaneously in
three dimensions the trajectories, the translation, and the rotation of finite
size inertial particles together with the turbulent flow. The flow field is
analyzed by tracking the temporal evolution of small fluorescent tracer
particles. The inertial particles consist of a super-absorbent polymer that
renders them index and density matched with water and thus invisible. The
particles are marked by inserting at various locations tracer particles into
the polymer. Translation and rotation, as well as the flow field around the
particle are recovered dynamically from the analysis of the marker and tracer
particle trajectories. We apply this technique to study the dynamics of
inertial particles much larger in size (Rp/{\eta} \approx 100) than the
Kolmogorov length scale {\eta} in a von K\'arm\'an swirling water flow
(R{\lambda} \approx 400). We show, using the mixed (particle/fluid) Eulerian
second order velocity structure function, that the interaction zone between the
particle and the flow develops in a spherical shell of width 2Rp around the
particle of radius Rp. This we interpret as an indication of a wake induced by
the particle. This measurement technique has many additional advantages that
will make it useful to address other problems such as particle collisions,
dynamics of non-spherical solid objects, or even of wet granular matter.
