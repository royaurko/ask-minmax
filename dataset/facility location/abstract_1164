Interstellar scintillation has been conclusively demonstrated to be the
principal cause of the intraday variability (IDV) observed in the
centimetre-wavelength emission of many AGN. A few sources show large amplitude
modulation in their flux density on a timescale of hours. However, the majority
of IDV sources exhibit variability on timescales of a day or more. On
timescales of a year some sources have been found to show an annual cycle in
the pattern of their variability. Such an annual cycle occurs because the
relative speeds of the Earth and the interstellar medium change as the Earth
orbits the Sun. To search for these annual variations as well as to follow the
source evolution, requires a dedicated instrument; the necessary amounts of
observing time are beyond the capability of the national facility instruments.
Here we describe the scientific motivation for, and present an outline of the
COSMIC (Continuous Single dish Monitoring of Intraday variability at Ceduna)
project which uses the University of Tasmania's 30 m diameter radio telescope
at Ceduna, which has been monitoring the flux density of a number of the
stronger southern scintillators at 6.65 GHz since March 2003.
