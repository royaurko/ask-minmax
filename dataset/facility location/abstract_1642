We describe a study of high-energy Compton beam polarimeters for the future
e+e- linear collider machine TESLA. A segment of the beam delivery system has
been identified, which is aligned with the e+e- collision axis and which has a
suitable configuration for high-quality beam polarization measurements. The
laser envisaged for the polarimeter is similar to an existing facility at DESY.
It delivers very short pulses in the 10 ps, 10-100uJ regime and operates with a
pattern that matches the pulse and bunch structure of TESLA. This will permit
very fast and accurate measurements and an expeditious tune-up of the spin
manipulators at the low-energy end of the linac. Electron detection in the
multi-event regime will be the principle operating mode of the polarimeter.
Other possible operating modes include photon detection and single-event
detection for calibration purposes. We expect an overall precision of dP/P=0.5%
for the measurement of the beam polarization.
