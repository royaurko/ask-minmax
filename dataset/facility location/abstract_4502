We report the discovery of a bright X-ray transient object, XMMU
J174554.4-285456, observed in outburst with XMM-Newton on October 3, 2002,and
located at 6.3' from SgrA*, the supermassive black hole at the Galactic
center.This object exhibits a very large X-ray luminosity variability of a
factor of about 1300 between two X-ray observations separated by four months.
The X-ray spectrum is best fitted by a power-law with a photon index of
1.6+/-0.2 and absorption column density of 14.1 (+1.6,-1.4) x 10^22 cm^-2. This
large absorption suggests this source is located at the distance of the
Galactic center, i.e., 8 kpc. The 2-10 keV luminosity is about 1.0 x
10^35(d/8kpc)^2 erg/s. A pulsation period of about 172 s is hinted by the
timing analysis. The X-ray properties strongly suggest a binary system with
either a black hole or a neutron star for the compact object.
