Aims. We study the spot activity of II Peg during the years 2004-2010 to
determine long- and short-term changes in the magnetic activity. In a previous
study, we detected a persistent active longitude, as well as major changes in
the spot configuration occurring on a timescale of shorter than a year. The
main objective of this study is to determine whether the same phenomena persist
in the star during these six years of spectroscopic monitoring.
  Methods. The observations were collected with the high-resolution SOFIN
spectrograph at the Nordic Optical Telescope. The temperature maps were
calculated using a Doppler imaging code based on Tikhonov regularization.
  Results. We present 12 new temperature maps that show spots distributed
mainly over high and intermediate latitudes. In each image, 1-3 main active
regions can be identified. The activity level of the star is clearly lower than
during our previous study for the years 1994-2002. In contrast to the previous
observations, we detect no clear drift of the active regions with respect to
the rotation of the star.
  Conclusions. Having shown a systematic longitudinal drift of the
spot-generating mechanism during 1994-2002, the star has clearly switched to a
low-activity state for 2004-2010, during which the spot locations appear more
random over phase space. It could be that the star is near to a minimum of its
activity cycle.
