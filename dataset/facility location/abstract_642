One of the future multi-MW accelerators is the LBNE Experiment where Fermilab
aims to produce a beam of neutrinos with a 2.3 MW proton beam as part of a
suite of experiments associated with Project X. Specifically, the LBNE Neutrino
Beam Facility aims for a 2+ MW, 60 -120 GeV pulsed, high intensity proton beam
produced in the Project X accelerator intercepted by a low Z solid target to
facilitate the production of low energy neutrinos. The multi-MW level LBNE
proton beam will be characterized by intensities of the order of 1.6 e+14
p/pulse, {\sigma} radius of 1.5 -3.5 mm and a 9.8 microsecond pulse length.
These parameters are expected to push many target materials to their limit thus
making the target design very challenging. To address a host of critical design
issues revealed by recent high intensity beam on target experience a series of
experimental studies on radiation damage and thermal shock response conducted
at BNL focusing on low-Z materials have been undertaken with the latest one
focusing on LBNE.
