Quasars have reigned as the most luminous and distant objects in the
Universe. These concepts were based on the hypothesis that the redshifts of
quasars are obeying the Hubble low. This hypothesis has little serious
competition today, but has met some difficulties when using it to determine the
distances of quasars. However, the majority of the redshifts of quasars can be
explained by the soft photon process proposed by Zheng (2013), then quasars are
not located at the distances as that calculated from observed redshifts
according to the Hubble low. Therefore distances of quasars can be reduced to a
reasonable range, and the difficulties have met by quasars disappeared.
