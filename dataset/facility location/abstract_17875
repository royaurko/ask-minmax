Results from UBVRI photometric observations of the pre-main sequence star GM
Cep obtained in the period April 2011 - August 2014 are reported in the paper.
Presented data are a continuation of our photometric monitoring of the star
started in 2008. GM Cep is located in the field of the young open cluster
Trumpler 37 and over the past years it has been an object of intense
photometric and spectral studies. The star shows a strong photometric
variability interpreted as a possible outburst from EXor type in previous
studies. Our photometric data for a period of over six years show a large
amplitude variability (Delta V ~ 2.3 mag.) and several deep minimums in
brightness are observed. The analysis of the collected multicolor photometric
data shows the typical of UX Ori variables a color reversal during the minimums
in brightness. The observed decreases in brightness have a different shape, and
evidences of periodicity are not detected. At the same time, high amplitude
rapid variations in brightness typical for the classical T Tauri stars also
present on the light curve of GM Cep. The spectrum of GM Cep shows the typical
of classical T Tauri stars wide H/alpha emission line and absorption lines of
some metals. We calculate the outer radius of the H/alpha emitting region as
10.4 +/-0.5 Rsun and the accretion rate as 1.8 x 10 E-7 Msun/yr.
