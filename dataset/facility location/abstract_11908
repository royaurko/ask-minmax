We consider a time-slotted two-hop wireless system in which the sources
transmit to the relays in the even time slots (first hop) and the relays
forward the packets to the destinations in the odd time slots (second hop).
Each source may connect to multiple relays in the first hop. In the presence of
interference and without tight coordination of the relays, it is not clear
which relays should transmit the packet. We propose four decentralized methods
of relay selection, some based on location information and others based on the
received signal strength (RSS). We provide a complete analytical
characterization of these methods using tools from stochastic geometry. We use
simulation results to compare these methods in terms of end-to-end success
probability.
