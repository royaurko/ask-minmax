The limit of neutron-rich nuclei, the neutron drip-line, evolves regularly
from light to medium-mass nuclei except for a striking anomaly in the oxygen
isotopes. This anomaly is not reproduced in shell-model calculations derived
from microscopic two-nucleon forces. Here, we present the first microscopic
explanation of the oxygen anomaly based on three-nucleon forces that have been
established in few-body systems. This leads to repulsive contributions to the
interactions among excess neutrons that change the location of the neutron
drip-line from $^{28}$O to the experimentally observed $^{24}$O. Since the
mechanism is robust and general, our findings impact the prediction of the most
neutron-rich nuclei and the synthesis of heavy elements in neutron-rich
environments.
