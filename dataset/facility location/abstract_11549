We have analyzed three XMM-Newton observations of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk
509, with the goal to detect small variations in the ionized outflow
properties. Such measurements are limited by the quality of the
cross-calibration between RGS, the best instrument to characterize the
spectrum, and EPIC-pn, the best instrument to characterize the variability. For
all three observations we are able to improve the relative calibration of RGS
and pn consistently to 4 %. In all observations we detect three different
outflow components and, thanks to our accurate cross-calibration we are able to
detect small differences in the ionization parameter and column density in the
highest ionized component of the outflow. This constrains the location of this
component of the outflow to within 0.5 pc of the central source. Our method for
modeling the relative effective area is not restricted to just this source and
can in principle be extended to other types of sources as well.
