To circumvent the spatial effects of resolution on galaxy classification, the
images of 233 objects of known redshift in the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) and its
Flanking Fields (FF) that have redshifts in the range 0.20 < z < 1.10 were
degraded to the resolution that they would have had if they were all located at
a redshift z= 1.00. As in paper XIV of the present series, the effects of
shifts in rest wavelength were mitigated by using R-band images for the
classification of galaxies with 0.2 < z < 0.6 and I-band images for objects
with redshifts 0.6 < z < 1.1. A special effort was made to search for bars in
distant galaxies. The present data strongly confirm the previous conclusion
that the Hubble tuning fork diagram only provides a satisfactory framework for
the classification of galaxies with z ~< 0.3. More distant disk galaxies are
often difficult to shoehorn into the Hubble classification scheme. The paucity
of barred spirals and of grand-design spirals at large redshifts is confirmed.
It is concluded that the morphology of disk galaxies observed at look-back
times smaller than 3--4 Gyr differs systematically from that of more distant
galaxies viewed at look-back times of 4--8 Gyr. The disks of late-type spirals
at z >0.5 are seen to be more chaotic than those of their nearer counterparts.
Furthermore the spiral structure in distant early-type spirals appears to be
less well-developed than it is in nearby early-galaxies.
