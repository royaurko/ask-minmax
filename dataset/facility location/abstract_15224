We report on HST/STIS spectra of the Lyman-alpha emission in the central
dominant galaxies in three rich clusters of galaxies. We find evidence for a
population of clouds in the intracluster medium.We detect 10 Ly-alpha
absorption systems towards the nucleus of NGC1275 with columns of N(HI)
1E12-1E14 cm-2. The detected absorption features are most consistent with
associated nuclear absorption systems. There is very little nuclear absorption
at the systemic velocity in NGC1275. This implies that the large columns
detected in the 21 cm line towards the parsec scale radio source avoid the line
of sight to the nucleus. This gas may be located in a circumnuclear disk or
torus. We detect at least one and possibly two absorption features towards the
extended Ly-alpha in A426. We do not detect absorption towards the extended
Ly-alpha emission in A1795, and A2597 with upper limits N(HI) 1E13 cm-2 for
optically thin absorbers. Our data constrain the covering factor of any high
column density gas in the ICM to be less than 25%. Our results suggest that the
lack of observed intermediate temperature gas is not explained by obscuration.
In addition, the low columns of gas on the 100 kpc scales in the ICM suggests
that (1) the rate at which cold gas accumulates in the ICM on these scales is
very low, and (2) the dense nebulae in the central 10 kpc must have cooled or
been deposited in situ.
