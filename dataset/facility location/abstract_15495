We report the results of simultaneous multiwavelength observations of the
X-ray transient source SWIFT J1753.5-0127 performed with INTEGRAL, RXTE, NTT,
REM and VLA on 2005 August 10-12. The source, which underwent an X-ray outburst
since 2005 May 30, was observed during the INTEGRAL Target of Opportunity
program dedicated to new X-ray novae located in the Galactic Halo. Broad-band
spectra and fast timing variability properties of SWIFT J1753.5-0127 are
analyzed together with the optical, near infra-red and radio data. We show that
the source was significantly detected up to 600 keV with Comptonization
parameters and timing properties typical of the so-called Low/Hard State of
black hole candidates. We build a spectral energy distribution and we show that
SWIFT J1753.5-0127 does not follow the usual radio/X-ray correlation of X-ray
binaries in the Low/Hard State. We give estimates of distance and mass. We
conclude that SWIFT J1753.5-0127 belongs to the X-ray nova class and that it is
likely a black hole candidate transient source of the Galactic Halo which
remained in the Low/Hard State during its main outburst. We discuss our results
within the context of Comptonization and jet models.
