Rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles are presented for both the
stellar and gaseous components along five different position angles (P.A.=5,
50, 95, 125 and 155 degrees) of the nearby barred spiral NGC 6221. The observed
kinematics extends out to about 80" from the nucleus. Narrow and broad-band
imaging is also presented. The radial profiles of the fluxes ratio [NII]/Halpha
reveal the presence of a ring-like structure of ionized gas, with a radius of
about 9" and a deprojected circular velocity of about 280 km/s. The analysis of
the dynamics of the bar indicates this ring is related to the presence of an
inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) at 1.3 kpc. NGC6221 is found to exhibit
intermediate properties between those of the early-type barred galaxies: the
presence of a gaseous ring at an ILR, the bar edge located between the ILR's
and the corotation radius beyond the steep rising portion of the rotation
curve, the dust-lane pattern, and those of the late-type galaxies: an almost
exponential surface brightness profile, the presence of Halpha regions along
all the bar, the spiral-arm pattern. It is consistent with scenarios of
bar-induced evolution from later to earlier-type galaxies.
