Using a model of force balance in Saturn's disk-like magnetosphere, we show
that variations in hot plasma pressure can change the magnetic field
configuration. This effect changes (i) the location of the magnetopause, even
at fixed solar wind dynamic pressure, and (ii) the magnetic mapping between
ionosphere and disk. The model uses equatorial observations as a boundary
condition-we test its predictions over a wide latitude range by comparison with
a Cassini high-inclination orbit of magnetic field and hot plasma pressure
data. We find reasonable agreement over time scales larger than the period of
Saturn kilometric radiation (also known as the camshaft period).
