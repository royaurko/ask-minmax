We present visible and near IR images of the compact HII region Sh 152. Some
of these images reveal the presence of Extended Red Emission (ERE) around 698
nm and emission from Unidentified Infra Red Bands (UIRBs) at 3.3 and 6.2
micron. Other images show the near infrared (7-12 micron) continuous emission
of the nebula. The ERE emission is found to coincide with the ionized region
and significantly differ from the UIRBs location. Also some evidence is found
in favor of grains as carriers for ERE.
