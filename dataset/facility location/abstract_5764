A new cosmological multidimensional hydrodynamic and N-body code based on an
Adaptive Mesh Refinement scheme is described and tested. The hydro part is
based on modern high-resolution shock-capturing techniques, whereas N-body
approach is based on the Particle Mesh method. The code has been specifically
designed for cosmological applications. Tests including shocks, strong
gradients, and gravity have been considered. A cosmological test based on Santa
Barbara cluster is also presented. The usefulness of the code is discussed. In
particular, this powerful tool is expected to be appropriate to describe the
evolution of the hot gas component located inside asymmetric cosmological
structures.
