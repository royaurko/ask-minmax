The most general situation of the reinforcement of a plate with multiple
holes by several patches is considered. There is no restriction on the number
and the location of the patches. Two types of the patch attachment are
considered: only along the boundary of the patch or both along the boundary of
the patch and the boundaries of the holes which this patch covers. The
unattached boundaries of the holes may be loaded with given in-plane stresses.
The mechanical problem is reduced to the system of singular integral equations
which can be further reduced to the system of Fredholm equations. A new
numerical procedure for the solution of the system of singular integral
equations is proposed in this paper. It can be observed that this procedure
provides a noticeable improvement from the one presented in Zemlyanova
\cite{Zem2007}, Zemlyanova and Silvestrov \cite{ZemSil2007}, \cite{ZemSil2009}
and allows to achieve a significantly better numerical convergence with less
computational effort.
