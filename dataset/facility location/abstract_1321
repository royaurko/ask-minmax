Location based services (LBS) are one of the most promising and innovative
directions of convergence technologies resulting of emergence of several fields
including database systems, mobile communication, Internet technology, and
positioning systems. Although being initiated as early as middle of 1990's, it
is only recently that the LBS received a systematic profound research interest
due to its commercial and technological impact. As the LBS is related to the
user's location which can be used to trace the user's activities, a strong
privacy concern has been raised. To preserve the user's location, several
intelligent works have been introduced though many challenges are still
awaiting solutions. This paper introduces a survey on LBS systems considering
both localization technologies, model and architectures guaranteeing privacy.
We also overview cryptographic primitive to possibly use in preserving LBS's
privacy followed by fruitful research directions basically concerned with the
privacy issue.
