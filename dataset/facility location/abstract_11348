A network as a substrate for dynamic processes may have its own dynamics. We
propose a model for networks which evolve together with diffusing particles
through a coupled dynamics, and investigate emerging structural property. The
model consists of an undirected weighted network of fixed mean degree and
randomly diffusing particles of fixed density. The weight $w$ of an edge
increases by the amount of traffics through its connecting nodes or decreases
by a constant factor. Edges are removed with the probability $P_{rew.}=1/(1+w)$
and replaced by new ones having $w=0$ at random locations. We find that the
model exhibits a structural phase transition between the homogeneous phase
characterized by an exponentially decaying degree distribution and the
heterogeneous phase characterized by the presence of hubs. The hubs emerge as a
consequence of a positive feedback between the particle and the edge dynamics.
