The electroproduction of $K^+ \Lambda$ (1405) was studied by analyzing the
E1F data set collected in Hall B at Jefferson Lab. The analysis utilized the
decay channel $\Sigma^+ \pi^-$ of the $\Lambda$ (1405) and $p \pi^0$ of the
$\Sigma^+$. Simulations of background, $\Lambda$ (1405) and $\Lambda$ (1520)
production according to PDG values were performed by using standard CLAS
analysis tools adapted for the E1F run. Fits of the acceptance-corrected
simulations were made to the acceptance-corrected data to determine
contributions from signal and background processes. The line shape of $\Lambda$
(1405) varies with the four momentum transfer, $Q^2$, and does not match the
line shape based on PDG resonance parameters. It corresponds approximately to
predictions of a recent two-pole meson-baryon picture of this state.
