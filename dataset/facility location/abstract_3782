We present the overview of the MOSE project (MOdeling ESO Sites) aiming at
proving the feasibility of the forecast of the classical atmospherical
parameters (wind speed intensity and direction, temperature, relative humidity)
and the optical turbulence OT (CN2 profiles and the most relevant integrated
astro-climatic parameters derived from the CN2: the seeing, the isoplanatic
angle, the wavefront coherence time) above the two ESO ground-based sites of
Cerro Paranal and Cerro Armazones. The final outcome of the study is to
investigate the opportunity to implement an automatic system for the forecast
of these parameters at these sites. In this paper we present results related to
the Meso-Nh model ability in reconstructing the vertical stratification of the
atmospherical parameters along the 20 km above the ground. The very
satisfactory performances shown by the model in reconstructing most of these
parameters (and in particular the wind speed) put this tool of investigation as
the most suitable to be used in astronomical observatories to support AO
facilities and to calculate the temporal evolution of the wind speed and the
wavefront coherence time at whatever temporal sampling. The further great
advantage of this solution is that such estimates can be available in advance
(order of some hours) with respect to the time of interest
