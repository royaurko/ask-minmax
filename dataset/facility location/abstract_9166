Influences of the mass, moment of inertia, rotation, absence of stability in
the atmosphere and some other parameters of neutron stars on the evolution of
pulsars are examined. It is shown that the locations and evolutions of soft
gamma repeaters, anomalous X-ray pulsars and other types of pulsar on the
period versus period derivative diagram can be explained adopting values of
B$<10^{14}$ G for these objects. This approach gives the possibility to explain
many properties of different types of pulsar.
