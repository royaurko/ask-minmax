We have performed numerical simulations of the unpolarized e+e- --> p pbar
process in kinematic conditions under discussion for a possible upgrade of the
existing DAFNE facility. By fitting the cross section angular distribution with
a typical Born expression, we can extract information on the ratio |G_E/G_M| of
the proton electromagnetic form factors in the timelike region within a 5-10%
uncertainty. We have explored also non-Born contributions to the cross section
by introducing a further component in the angular fit, which is related to
two-photon exchange diagrams. We show that these corrections can be identified
if larger than 5% of the Born contribution, and if relative phases of the
complex form factors do not produce severe cancellations.
