The double--mode pulsation of GSC 00144-03031 has been detected when
searching for COROT targets. A very large dataset composed of 4722 photometric
measurements was collected at six observatories in Europe and America. There is
no hint of the excitation of additional modes (down to 0.6 mmag) and therefore
GSC 00144-03031 seems to be a pure double--mode pulsator, with a very short
fundamental radial mode (P=84 min). From Stromgren photometry and evolutionary
tracks it appears to be a Pop. I star with M=1.75 solar masses, located in the
middle of the instability strip, close to the Zero--Age Main Sequence. We also
discovered other new double--mode pulsators in the databases of large--scale
projects: OGLE BW2_V142, OGLE BW1_V207, ASAS3 094303-1707.3, ASAS3
000116-6037.0, NSVS 3234596 and NSVS 3324715. An observational Petersen diagram
is presented and explained by means of new models. A common sequence connecting
Pop. I stars from the shortest to the longest periods is proposed and the
spreads in the period ratios are ascribed to different metallicities (at the
shortest periods) and to different masses (at the longest ones). The paper is
based on data collected at S. Pedro Martir and Sierra Nevada Observatories and
on the contributions from several amateur astronomers.
