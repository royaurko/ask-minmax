In this letter, we report a new mass for $^{11}$Li using the trapping
experiment TITAN at TRIUMF's ISAC facility. This is by far the shortest-lived
nuclide, $t_{1/2} = 8.8 \rm{ms}$, for which a mass measurement has ever been
performed with a Penning trap. Combined with our mass measurements of
$^{8,9}$Li we derive a new two-neutron separation energy of 369.15(65) keV: a
factor of seven more precise than the best previous value. This new value is a
critical ingredient for the determination of the halo charge radius from
isotope-shift measurements. We also report results from state-of-the-art
atomic-physics calculations using the new mass and extract a new charge radius
for $^{11}$Li. This result is a remarkable confluence of nuclear and atomic
physics.
