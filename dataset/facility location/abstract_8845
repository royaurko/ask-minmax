The bright BL Lac object PKS 2005-489 was observed by BeppoSAX on November
1-2, 1998, following an active X-ray state detected by RossiXTE. The source,
detected between 0.1 and 200 keV, was in a very high state with a continuum
well fitted by a steepening spectrum due to synchrotron emission only. Our
X-ray spectrum is the flattest ever observed for this source. The different
X-ray spectral slopes and fluxes, as measured by various satellites, are
consistent with relatively little changes of the peak frequency of the
synchrotron emission, always located below 10^{17} Hz. We discuss these results
in the framework of synchrotron self-Compton models. We found that for the
BeppoSAX observation, the synchrotron peak frequency is between 10^{15} and
2.5x10^{16} Hz, depending on the model assumptions.
