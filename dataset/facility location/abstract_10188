In the presented study we investigated the second order endpoints of the
lines of first order phase transitions which emerge for the QCD in the heavy
and light quark mass regime and for the three-dimensional three state Potts
model with an external field. We located the endpoints with Binder cumulants
and constructed the energy-like and ordering field like observables. The joint
probability distributions of these scaling fields and the values of the Binder
cumulant confirm that all three endpoints belong to the universality class of
the 3-dimensional Ising model.
