The combination of dispersion measures of pulsars, distances from the model
of Cordes and Lazio (2002) and emission measures from the WHAM survey enabled a
statistical study of electron densities and filling factors of the diffuse
ionized gas (DIG) in the Milky Way. The emission measures were corrected for
absorption and contributions from beyond the pulsar distance. For a sample of
157 pulsars at |b| > 5 degrees, mainly located in interarm regions within about
3 kpc from the Sun, we find that: (1) The average volume filling factor along
the line of sight is inversely proportional to the mean electron density in
clouds. (2) The average volume filling factor increases towards larger
distances from the Galactic plane. (3) The local volume filling factor may
reach a maximum near |z| = 0.9 kpc, whereas the local electron density
continues to decrease at higher |z|, thus causing the observed flattening in
the distribution of dispersion measures perpendicular to the plane above this
height. (4) The scale heights of the electron density, the volume filling
factor and the emission measure are the same and in the range 250-500 pc.
