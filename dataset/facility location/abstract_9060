Mid-infrared (10-25 \micron) imaging of the protostellar binary system
L1448N-IRS3(A,B) is presented. Only one source, IRS3(A), was detected at
mid-infrared wavelengths -- all of the mid-infrared emission from IRS3(A,B)
emanates from IRS3(A). The mid-infrared luminosity of IRS3(A) is $L_{midir} =
1.3(\frac{d}{300\rm{pc}})^2 L_\sun$, which yields a central source mass,
depending on the mass infall rate, of $M_* = 0.2 M_\sun \frac{10^{-6}M_\sun
yr^{-1}}{\dot M}$. The envelope mass surrounding IRS3(A) is $\sim 0.15 M_\sun$,
suggesting that the central source and the envelope are of comparable mass. The
locations of IRS3(A) and IRS3(B) on an $M_{env} - L_{bol}$ diagram indicate
that IRS3(A) and IRS3(B) appear to be class I and class 0 protostars,
respectively.
