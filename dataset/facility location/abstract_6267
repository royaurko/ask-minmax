In the context of the recently developed "equation-free" approach to the
computer-assisted analysis of complex systems, we illustrate the computation of
coarsely self-similar solutions. Dynamic renormalization and fixed point
algorithms for the macroscopic density dynamics are applied to the results of
short bursts of appropriately initialized molecular dynamics in a simple
diffusion simulation. The approach holds promise for locating coarse
self-similar solutions and the corresponding exponents in a variety of
multiscale computational contexts.
