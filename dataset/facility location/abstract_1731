A high-resolution study of fragment-fragment-$\gamma$ triple coincident
measurements of the symmetric-mass fission exit-channel from the
^{28}Si+^{28}Si reaction has been performed at the VIVITRON Tandem facility by
using the EUROGAM Phase II $\gamma$-ray spectrometer. The bombarding energy
E_{lab}(^{28}Si) = 111.6 MeV has been chosen to populate a well known
quasi-molecular resonance in ^{56}Ni. Evidence is presented for a selective
population of states in ^{28}Si fragments arising from the symmetric-fission of
the ^{56}Ni compound nucleus. In the resonant region the enhanced population of
the K^{\pi} = 3_{1}^{-} band of the ^{28}Si nucleus, indicative of an oblate
deformed shape, appears to play a significant role in the collision processes.
The resonant behavior in the elastic and inelatic ^{28}Si+^{28}Si exit-channels
is found to be correlated to strong disalignment features of the di-nuclear
oblate-oblate system with an equator-equator stable configuration.
