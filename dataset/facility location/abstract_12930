A geometric form of Euler-Lagrange equations is developed for a chain
pendulum, a serial connection of $n$ rigid links connected by spherical joints,
that is attached to a rigid cart. The cart can translate in a horizontal plane
acted on by a horizontal control force while the chain pendulum can undergo
complex motion in 3D due to gravity. The configuration of the system is in
$(\Sph^2)^n \times \Re^2$. We examine the rich structure of the uncontrolled
system dynamics: the equilibria of the system correspond to any one of $2^n$
different chain pendulum configurations and any cart location. A linearization
about each equilibrium, and the corresponding controllability criterion is
provided. We also show that any equilibrium can be asymptotically stabilized by
using a proportional-derivative type controller, and we provide a few numerical
examples.
