We use STEREO imagery to study the morphology of a shock driven by a fast
coronal mass ejection (CME) launched from the Sun on 2011 March 7. The source
region of the CME is located just to the east of a coronal hole. The CME ejecta
is deflected away from the hole, in contrast with the shock, which readily
expands into the fast outflow from the coronal hole. The result is a CME with
ejecta not well centered within the shock surrounding it. The shock shape
inferred from the imaging is compared with in situ data at 1 AU, where the
shock is observed near Earth by the Wind spacecraft, and at STEREO-A. Shock
normals computed from the in situ data are consistent with the shock morphology
inferred from imaging.
