Many of the most luminous extragalactic radio sources are located at the
centers of X-ray clusters, and so their radiation must be scattered by the
surrounding hot gas. We show that radio observations of the highly-polarized
scattered radiation (which depends on the electron density distribution) in
combination with the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (which measures the
electron pressure distribution), can be used to determine the radial profile of
the electron temperature within the host cluster. The sensitivity levels
expected from current instruments will allow radio measurements of
mass-weighted cluster temperature profiles to better than roughly 1 keV
accuracy, as long as the central radio source is steady over several million
years. Variable or beamed sources will leave observable signatures in the
scattered emission. For clusters with a central point source brighter than
about 1 mJy, the scattered polarization signal is stronger than competing
effects due to the cosmic microwave background.
