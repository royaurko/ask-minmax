The electron energy spectra, not connected to b-decay, of 235U- and
239Pu-films, irradiated by thermal neutrons, obtained by a Monte Carlo method
is presented in the given work. The modelling was performed with the help of a
computer code MCNP4C (Monte Carlo Neutron Photon transport code system),
allowing to carry out the computer experiments on joint transport of neutrons,
photons and electrons. The experiment geometry and the parameters of an
irradiation were the same, as in [11] (the thickness of a foil varied only). As
a result of computer experiments, the electron spectra was obtained for the
samples of 235U, 239Pu and uranium dioxide of 93 % enrichment representing a
set of films of 22 mm in diameter and different thickness: 0,001 mm, 0,005 mm,
0,02 mm, 0,01 mm, 0,1 mm, 1,0 mm; and also for the uranium dioxide film of 93 %
enrichment (diameter 22 mm and thickness 0,01mm), located between two
protective 0,025 mm aluminium disks (the conditions of experiment in [11]) and
the electron spectrum was fixed at the output surface of a protective disk. The
comparative analysis of the experimental [11] and calculated b--spectra is
carried out.
