We define new diagram algebras providing a sequence of multiparameter
generalisations of the Temperley-Lieb algebra, suitable for the modelling of
dilute lattice systems of two-dimensional Statistical Mechanics. These algebras
give a rigorous foundation to the various "multi-colour algebras" of Grimm,
Pearce and others. We determine the generic representation theory of the
simplest of these algebras, and locate the nongeneric cases (at roots of unity
of the corresponding parameters). We show by this example how the method used
(Martin's general procedure for diagram algebras) may be applied to a wide
variety of such algebras occurring in Statistical Mechanics. We demonstrate how
these algebras may be used to solve the Yang-Baxter equations.
