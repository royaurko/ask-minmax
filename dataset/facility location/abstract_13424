We study the interaction of graphene with ultrashort few femtosecond long
optical pulse. For such a short pulse, the electron dynamics is coherent and is
described within the tight-binding model of graphene. The interaction of
optical pulse with graphene is determined by strong wave vector dependence of
the interband dipole matrix elements, which are singular at the Dirac points of
graphene. The electron dynamics in optical pulse is highly irreversible with
large residual population of the conduction band. The residual conduction band
population as a function of the wave vector is nonuniform with a few localized
spots of high conduction band population. The spots are located near the Dirac
points and the number of spots depends on the pulse intensity. The optical
pulse propagating through graphene layer generates finite transferred charge,
which, as a function of pulse intensity, changes its sign. At small pulse
intensity, the charge is transferred in the direction of the pulse maximum,
while at large pulse intensity, the direction of the charge transfer is
opposite to the direction of pulse maximum. This property opens unique
possibility of controlling the direction of the charge transfer by variation of
the pulse intensity.
