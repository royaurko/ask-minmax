We present the results of a study aimed at assessing the differences in the
dis- tribution of rotation speeds, N (v sin i) among young (1-15 Myr) B stars
spanning a range of masses 6 < M/M < 12 and located in different environments:
7 low density (rho < 1 M /pc^3) ensembles that are destined to become unbound
stellar associations, and 8 high density (rho >> 1 M /pc^3) ensembles that will
survive as rich, bound stellar clusters for ages well in excess of 10^8 years.
Our results demonstrate (1) that independent of environment, the rotation rates
for stars in this mass range do not change by more than 0.1 dex over ages t ~ 1
to t ~ 15 Myr; and (2) that stars formed in high density regions lack the
cohort of slow rotators that dominate the low density regions and young field
stars. We suggest that the differences in N(v sin i) between low and high
density regions may reflect a combination of initial conditions and
environmental effects: (1) the higher turbulent speeds that characterize
molecular gas in high density, cluster- forming regions; and (2) the stronger
UV radiation fields and high stellar densities that characterize such regions.
