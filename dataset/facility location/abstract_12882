Using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and ab-initio GW
calculations, we unambiguously show that the widely investigated
three-dimensional topological insulator Bi2Se3 has a direct band gap at the
Gamma point. Experimentally, this is shown by a three-dimensional band mapping
in large fractions of the Brillouin zone. Theoretically, we demonstrate that
the valence band maximum is located at the Brillouin center only if many-body
effects are included in the calculation. Otherwise, it is found in a
high-symmetry mirror plane away from the zone center.
