We derive the outage capacity of a bursty version of the amplify-and-forward
(BAF) protocol for small signal-to-noise ratios when incremental relaying is
used. We show that the ratio between the outage capacities of BAF and the
cut-set bound is independent of the relay position and that BAF is outage
optimal for certain conditions on the target rate R. This is in contrast to
decode-and-forward with incremental relaying, where the relay location strongly
determines the performance of the cooperative protocol. We further derive the
outage capacity for a network consisting of an arbitrary number of relay nodes.
In this case the relays transmit in subsequent partitions of the overall
transmission block and the destination accumulates signal-to-noise ratio until
it is able to decode.
