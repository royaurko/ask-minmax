We summarize the results of investigating the asymptotic behavior of the
weighted quantile correlation tests for the location-scale family associated to
the logistic distribution. Explicit representations of the limiting
distribution are given in terms of integrals of weighted Brownian bridges or
alternatively as infinite series of independent Gaussian random variables. The
power of this test and the test for the location logistic family against some
alternatives are demonstrated by numerical simulations.
