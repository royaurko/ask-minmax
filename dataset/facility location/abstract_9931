A model for Metal-Ferroelectric-Metal structures with Schottky contacts is
proposed. The model adapts the general theories of metal-semiconductor
rectifying contacts for the particular case of metal-ferroelectric contact by
introducing: the ferroelectric polarization as a sheet of surface charge
located at a finite distance from the electrode interface; a deep trapping
level of high concentration; the static and dynamic values of the dielectric
constant. Consequences of the proposed model on relevant quantities of the
Schottky contact such as built-in voltage, charge density and depletion width,
as well as on the interpretation of the current-voltage and capacitance-voltage
characteristics are discussed in detail.
