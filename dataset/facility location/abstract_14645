We present a multiwavelength analysis of the prominent active galaxy NGC1365,
in particular looking at the radio and X-ray properties of the central regions
of the galaxy.
  We analyse ROSAT observations of NGC1365, and discuss recent ASCA results. In
addition to a number of point sources in the vicinity of NGC1365, we find a
region of X-ray emission extending along the central bar of the galaxy,
combined with an emission peak near the centre of the galaxy. This X-ray
emission is centred on the optical/radio nucleus, but is spatially extended.
The X-ray spectrum can be well fitted by a thermal plasma model, with
kT=0.6-0.8keV and a low local absorbing column. The thermal spectrum is
suggestive of starburst emission rather than emission from a central
black-hole.
  The ATCA radio observations show a number of hotspots, located in a ring
around a weak radio nucleus. Synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated by
supernovae and supernova remnants (SNRs) is the likely origin of these
hotspots. The radio nucleus has a steep spectrum, indicative perhaps of an AGN
or SNRs. The evidence for a jet emanating from the nucleus is at best marginal.
The extent of the radio ring is comparable to the extended central X-ray
source.
