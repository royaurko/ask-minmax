At the beginning of 2010, we presented at the J-PARC PAC an R$&$D program
towards large (100 kton scale) liquid argon TPCs, suitable to investigate, in
conjunction with the J-PARC neutrino beam, the possibility of CP violation in
the neutrino sector and to search for nucleon decay. As a first step we
proposed a test experiment to identify and measure charged kaons, including
their decays, in liquid argon. The detector, a 250L LAr TPC, is exposed to
charged kaons, in a momentum range of 540-800 MeV/c, in the K1.1BR beamline of
the J-PARC slow extraction facility. This is especially important to estimate
efficiency and background for nucleon decay searches in the charged kaon mode
($p \rightarrow \bar{\nu} K^+$, etc.), where the kaon momentum is expected to
be in the few hundred MeV/c range. A prototype setup has been exposed in the
K1.1BR beamline in the fall of 2010. This paper describes the capabilities of
the beamline, the construction and setting up of the detector prototype, along
with some preliminary results.
