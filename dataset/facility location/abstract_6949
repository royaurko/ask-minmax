Ma and Wang derived an equation linking the separation location and times for
the boundary layer separation of incompressible fluid flows. The equation gave
a necessary condition for the separation (bifurcation) point. The purpose of
this paper is to generalize the equation to other geometries, and to phrase it
as a simple ODE. Moreover we consider the Navier-Stokes equation with the
Coriolis effect, which is related to the presence of trade winds on Earth.
