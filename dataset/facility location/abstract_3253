A first analysis of a deep blind HI survey covering the southern Zone of
Avoidance plus an extension towards the north (196 < l < 52 deg) obtained with
the Multibeam receiver at the 64m Parkes telescope reveals slightly over a
thousand galaxies within the latitude completeness limit of |b| < 5deg. The
characteristics and the uncovered large-scale structures of this survey are
described, in particular the prominence of the Norma Supercluster, the possible
cluster around PKS 1343-601 (both in the Great Attractor region), as well as
the Local Void and the clustering in the Puppis region. In this blind HI
survey, HIZOA J0836-43, one of the most massive spiral galaxies known to date
was discovered (M(HI) = 7.3 10^10 Msun M(tot) = 1.1 10^12 Msun; Ho = 75
km/s/Mpc). Although of similar mass as Malin 1-like objects, this galaxy does
not share their typical low-surface brightness properties but seems an
exceptionally massive but normal, high-surface brightness, star-forming galaxy.
