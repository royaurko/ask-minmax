We report Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) radio-continuum and ROSAT
PSPC X-ray observations of the region surrounding the peculiar galaxy pair ESO
295-IG022, lying at the centre of the poor cluster Abell S0102. We identify a
radio galaxy coincident with the galaxy pair, with bipolar, bent radio jets
appearing centred on the southern galaxy, and extending both to the south, for
about 95 arcseconds (approximately 100 kpc at the distance of ESO 295-IG022),
and to the north, for approximately 80 arcseconds, encompassing the northern
galaxy. We discuss also the idea of an additional single jet structure from the
northern galaxy contributing to the emission. We estimate lower limit jet
velocities of at least 1000 km/s, and a relative proper velocity for the
southern galaxy through the cluster of around 200 km/s. Diffuse (kT=2.2 keV)
X-ray emission consistent with group or poor cluster emission is seen centred
on the southern galaxy surrounding the galaxy pair and the associated radio
jets. Structure within the radio jets and the X-ray emission is very suggestive
of there being some channeling of the radio emission with the surrounding
intragroup medium. Another bipolar jet radio galaxy, discovered close by, is
likely to be a background object, the optical counterpart having a magnitude
greater than m=22.
