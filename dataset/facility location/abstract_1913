We report infrared photometry of the extrasolar planet HD 209458b during the
time of secondary eclipse (planet passing behind the star). Observations were
acquired during two secondary eclipses at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility
(IRTF) in September 2003. We used a circular variable filter (1.5-percent
bandpass) centered at 3.8 microns to isolate the predicted flux peak of the
planet at this wavelength. Residual telluric absorption and instrument
variations were removed by offsetting the telescope to nearby bright comparison
stars at a high temporal cadence. Our results give a secondary eclipse depth of
0.0013 +/- 0.0011, not yet sufficient precision to detect the eclipse, whose
expected depth is approximately 0.002 - 0.003. We here elucidate the current
observational limitations to this technique, and discuss the approach needed to
achieve detections of hot Jupiter secondary eclipses at 3.8 microns from the
ground.
