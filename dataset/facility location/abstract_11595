We obtain a general five dimensional (5D) quasispherical solutions of
irrotational dust in Einstein gravity with the Gauss-Bonnet combination of
quadratic curvature terms. These solutions are generalization, to
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, of the 5D quasispherical Szkeres like solutions
in general relativity. It is found that the collapse proceed in the same way as
in the analogous spherical collapse, i.e., there exists a regular initial data
such that the collapse proceed to form naked singularities violating cosmic
censorship conjecture. The effect of Gauss-Bonnet quadratic curvature terms on
the formation and locations of the apparent horizon is deduced.
