The reactions of $K \Sigma(1385)$ photoproduction, i.e., $\gamma p \to K^+
\Sigma^0(1385)$ and $\gamma n \to K^+ \Sigma^-(1385)$, are investigated in the
resonance energy region for studying the role of the nucleon and $\Delta$
resonances of masses around 2 GeV. The Lagrangians for describing the decays of
these resonances into the $K \Sigma(1385)$ channel are constructed and the
decay amplitudes are obtained, which allows us to determine the coupling
constants using the predictions of quark models or the data listed by the
Particle Data Group. The resulting cross sections are compared to the data from
the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility and the SPring-8, which
indicates nontrivial contributions from the two-star-rated resonances in the
Particle Data Group as well as from some missing resonances predicted by a
quark model.
