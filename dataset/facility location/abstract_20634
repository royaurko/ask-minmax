We report high-resolution (0.07 arcsec) near-infrared polarized intensity
images of the circumstellar disk around the star 2MASS J16042165-2130284
obtained with HiCIAO mounted on the Subaru 8.2 m telescope. We present our
$H$-band data, which clearly exhibits a resolved, face-on disk with a large
inner hole for the first time at infrared wavelengths. We detect the
centrosymmetric polarization pattern in the circumstellar material as has been
observed in other disks. Elliptical fitting gives the semimajor axis, semiminor
axis, and position angle (P.A.) of the disk as 63 AU, 62 AU, and -14
$^{\circ}$, respectively. The disk is asymmetric, with one dip located at P.A.s
of $\sim85^{\circ}$. Our observed disk size agrees well with a previous study
of dust and CO emission at submillimeter wavelength with Submillimeter Array.
Hence, the near-infrared light is interpreted as scattered light reflected from
the inner edge of the disk. Our observations also detect an elongated arc (50
AU) extending over the disk inner hole. It emanates at the inner edge of the
western side of the disk, extending inward first, then curving to the
northeast. We discuss the possibility that the inner hole, the dip, and the arc
that we have observed may be related to the existence of unseen bodies within
the disk.
