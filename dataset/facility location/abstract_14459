We have used HRCam on the CFHT to obtain subarcsecond images of 26 galaxies
with z=0.1--0.7. The primary sample of 17 galaxies have enhanced star formation
indicated by [OII] equivalent widths greater than 20\AA, while the comparison
sample of 9 galaxies have equivalent widths less than 10\AA. By fitting disks
or bulges to BVI images we derive scalelengths for the blue and red stellar
populations and locate the star-formation in each galaxy. These
moderate-redshift galaxies generally have straightforward low-redshift
analogues, in that their colours, sizes and luminosities are consistent with
those of various types of z$\approx$0 galaxies. The star-forming objects have
structures consistent with the full range of present-day disk galaxies, and
absolute magnitudes M$^\ast$$-$1 to M$^\ast$+5. Some have star-formation
concentrated in their nuclei but in most it occurs across the entire disk. We
find companions at projected distances closer than 10 kpc for 30% of the
star-forming galaxies, whereas none of the comparison sample have such close
companions. This provides the first direct evidence linking interactions or
mergers to the increased fraction of star-forming field galaxies at moderate
redshifts.
