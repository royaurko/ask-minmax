Neutron rich matter is at the heart of many fundamental questions in Nuclear
Physics and Astrophysics. What are the high density phases of QCD? Where did
the chemical elements come from? What is the structure of many compact and
energetic objects in the heavens, and what determines their electromagnetic,
neutrino, and gravitational-wave radiations? Moreover, neutron rich matter is
being studied with an extraordinary variety of new tools such as Facility for
Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) and the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave
Observatory (LIGO). We describe the Lead Radius Experiment (PREX) that is using
parity violation to measure the neutron radius in 208Pb. This has important
implications for neutron stars and their crusts. Using large scale molecular
dynamics, we model the formation of solids in both white dwarfs and neutron
stars. We find neutron star crust to be the strongest material known, some 10
billion times stronger than steel. It can support mountains on rotating neutron
stars large enough to generate detectable gravitational waves. Finally, we
describe a new equation of state for supernova and neutron star merger
simulations based on the Virial expansion at low densities, and large scale
relativistic mean field calculations.
