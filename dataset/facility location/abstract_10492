Presented in this work are some results relative to sequences found in the
logistic equation bifurcation diagram, which is the unimodal quadratic map
prototype. All of the different saddle-node bifurcation cascades, associated to
every last appearance p-periodic orbit (p=3,4,5,...), can also be generated
from the very Feigenbaum cascade. In this way it is evidenced the relationship
between both cascades. The orbits of every saddle-node bifurcation cascade,
mentioned above, are located in different chaotic bands, and this determines a
sequence of orbits converging to every band-merging Misiurewicz point. In turn,
these accumulation points form a sequence whose accumulation point is the
Myrberg-Feigenbaum point. It is also proven that the first appearance orbits in
the n-chaotic band converge to the same point as the last appearance orbits of
the (n+1)-chaotic band. The symbolic sequences of band-merging Misiurewicz
points are computed for any window.
