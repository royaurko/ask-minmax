We present the first abundances analysis based on high-resolution infrared
(IR) echelle spectra of NGC 6569 and NGC 6624, two moderately reddened globular
clusters located in the outer bulge of the Galaxy. We find
[Fe/H]=-0.79$\pm$0.02 dex and [Fe/H]=-0.69$\pm$0.02 dex for NGC 6569 and NGC
6624, respectively and an average $\alpha$-elements enhancement of
$\approx$+0.43$\pm$0.02 dex and +0.39$\pm$0.02 dex, consistent with previous
measurements on other metal-rich Bulge clusters. We measure accurate radial
velocities of $\rm <v_r>=-47\pm 4 km s^{-1}$ and $\rm <v_r>=+51\pm 3 km s^{-1}$
and velocity dispersions of $\rm \approx 8 km s^{-1}$ and $\rm \approx6 km
s^{-1}$ for NGC 6569 and NGC 6624, respectively. Finally, we find very low
$^{12}C/^{13}C$ isotopics ratio ($\leq$7 in NGC 6624 and $\approx$5 in NGC
6569), confirming the presence extra-mixing mechanisms during the red giant
branch evolution phase.
