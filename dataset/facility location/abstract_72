The first observations of the recently completed Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper
(WHAM) facility include a study of emission lines from high velocity clouds in
the M, A, and C complexes, with most of the observations on the M I cloud. We
present results including clear detections of H-alpha emission from all three
complexes with intensities ranging from 0.06 R to 0.20 R. In every observed
direction where there is significant high velocity H I gas seen in the 21 cm
line we have found associated ionized hydrogen emitting the H-alpha line. The
velocities of the H-alpha and 21 cm emission are well correlated in every case
except one, but the intensities are not correlated. There is some evidence that
the ionized gas producing the H-alpha emission envelopes the 21 cm emitting
neutral gas but the H-alpha "halo", if present, is not large. If the H-alpha
emission arises from the photoionization of the H I clouds, then the implied
Lyman continuum flux F_{LC} at the location of the clouds ranges from 1.3 to
4.2 x 10^5 photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}. If, on the other hand, the ionization is due
to a shock arising from the collision of the high-velocity gas with an ambient
medium in the halo, then the density of the pre-shocked gas can be constrained.
We have also detected the [S II] 6716 angstrom line from the M I cloud and have
evidence that the [S II] to H-alpha ratio varies with location on the cloud.
