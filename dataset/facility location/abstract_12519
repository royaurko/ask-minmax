Cloud computing is an Internet-based computing, where shared resources,
software and information, are provided to computers and devices on-demand. It
provides people the way to share distributed resources and services that belong
to different organization. Since cloud computing uses distributed resources in
open environment, thus it is important to provide the security and trust to
share the data for developing cloud computing applications. In this paper we
assess how can cloud providers earn their customers' trust and provide the
security, privacy and reliability, when a third party is processing sensitive
data in a remote machine located in various countries? A concept of utility
cloud has been represented to provide the various services to the users.
Emerging technologies can help address the challenges of Security, Privacy and
Trust in cloud computing.
