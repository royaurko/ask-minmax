The general relativistic modifications to the resistive state in
superconductors of second type in the presence of a stationary gravitational
field are studied. Some superconducting devices that can measure the
gravitational field by its red-shift effect on the frequency of radiation are
suggested. It has been shown that by varying the orientation of a
superconductor with respect to the earth gravitational field, a corresponding
varying contribution to AC Josephson frequency would be added by gravity. A
magnetic flux (being proportional to angular velocity of rotation $\Omega$)
through a rotating hollow superconducting cylinder with the radial gradient of
temperature $\nabla_r T$ is theoretically predicted. The magnetic flux is
assumed to be produced by the azimuthal current arising from Coriolis force
effect on radial thermoelectric current. Finally the magnetic flux through the
superconducting ring with radial heat flow located at the equatorial plane
interior the rotating neutron star is calculated. In particular it has been
shown that nonvanishing magnetic flux will be generated due to the general
relativistic effect of dragging of inertial frames on the thermoelectric
current.
