To be habitable, a world (planet or moon) does not need to be located in the
stellar habitable zone (HZ), and worlds in the HZ are not necessarily
habitable. Here, we illustrate how tidal heating can render terrestrial or icy
worlds habitable beyond the stellar HZ. Scientists have developed a language
that neglects the possible existence of worlds that offer more benign
environments to life than Earth does. We call these objects "superhabitable"
and discuss in which contexts this term could be used, that is to say, which
worlds tend to be more habitable than Earth. In an appendix, we show why the
principle of mediocracy cannot be used to logically explain why Earth should be
a particularly habitable planet or why other inhabited worlds should be
Earth-like. Superhabitable worlds must be considered for future follow-up
observations of signs of extraterrestrial life. Considering a range of physical
effects, we conclude that they will tend to be slightly older and more massive
than Earth and that their host stars will likely be K dwarfs. This makes Alpha
Centauri B, member of the closest stellar system to the Sun that is supposed to
host an Earth-mass planet, an ideal target for searches of a superhabitable
world.
