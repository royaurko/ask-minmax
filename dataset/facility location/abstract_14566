LOTIS (Livermore Optical Transient Imaging System) is a gamma-ray burst
optical counterpart search experiment located near Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in California. The system is linked to the GCN (GRB Coordinates
Network) real-time coordinate distribution network and can respond to a burst
trigger in 6-15 seconds. LOTIS has a total field-of-view of 17.4 deg x 17.4 deg
with a completeness sensitivity of m_V ~ 11 for a 10 second integration time.
Since operations began in October 1996, LOTIS has responded to over 30
GCN/BATSE GRB triggers. Seven of these triggers are considered good events
subject to the criteria of clear weather conditions, < 60 s response time, and
> 50% coverage of the final BATSE 3sigma error circle. We discuss results from
the first year of LOTIS operations with an emphasis on the observations and
analysis of GRB 971006 (BATSE trigger 6414).
