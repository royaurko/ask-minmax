SPIRou is a near-infrared (nIR) spectropolarimeter / velocimeter proposed as
a new-generation instrument for CFHT. SPIRou aims in particular at becoming
world-leader on two forefront science topics, (i) the quest for habitable
Earth-like planets around very- low-mass stars, and (ii) the study of low-mass
star and planet formation in the presence of magnetic fields. In addition to
these two main goals, SPIRou will be able to tackle many key programs, from
weather patterns on brown dwarf to solar-system planet atmospheres, to dynamo
processes in fully-convective bodies and planet habitability. The science
programs that SPIRou proposes to tackle are forefront (identified as first
priorities by most research agencies worldwide), ambitious (competitive and
complementary with science programs carried out on much larger facilities, such
as ALMA and JWST) and timely (ideally phased with complementary space missions
like TESS and CHEOPS).
  SPIRou is designed to carry out its science mission with maximum efficiency
and optimum precision. More specifically, SPIRou will be able to cover a very
wide single-shot nIR spectral domain (0.98-2.35 \mu m) at a resolving power of
73.5K, providing unpolarized and polarized spectra of low-mass stars with a
~15% average throughput and a radial velocity (RV) precision of 1 m/s.
