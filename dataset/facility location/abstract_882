A scintillating-fiber beam profile detector has been designed, built and
tested, for the monitoring of the position and size of the electron beam of the
DAFNE, the recently commissioned electron beam-test facility at the Frascati
LNF. A description of the detector construction and assembly, together with the
results achieved during the 2003-2004 run, are here reported.
