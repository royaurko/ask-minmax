The gamma background flux below 3000 keV in the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran
Sasso (LNGS), Italy, has been measured using a 3" diameter NaI(Tl) detector at
different underground positions: In hall A, hall B, the interferometer tunnel,
and inside the Large Volume Detector (LVD). The integrated flux is 0.3--0.4
s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ at the first three locations, and is lower by two orders of
magnitude inside LVD. With the help of Monte Carlo simulations for every
location, the contribution of the individual primordial isotopes to the
background has been determined. Using an 11" diameter NaI(Tl) detector, the
background neutron flux in the LNGS interferometer tunnel has been estimated.
Within the uncertainties, the result agrees with those from other neutron
measurements in the main halls.
