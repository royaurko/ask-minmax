The Catalog and Atlas of Cataclysmic Variables (Edition 1 - 1993) and Edition
2 - 1997) has been a valuable source of information for the cataclysmic
variable (CV) community. However, the goal of having a central location for all
objects is slowly being lost as each new edition is generated. There can also
be a long time delay between new information becoming available on an object
and its publication in the catalog. To eliminate these concerns, as well as to
make the catalog more accessible, we have created a web site which will contain
a ``living'' edition of the catalog. We have also added orbital period
information, as well as finding charts for novae, to the catalog.
