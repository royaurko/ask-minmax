An optimization of the CERN SPL beam line has been performed guided by the
sensitivities to the \theta_{13} mixing angle and to the \delta_{CP} Dirac CP
violating phase. A UNO-like 440 ktons water Cerenkov detector located at 130 km
from the target in a new foreseen Frejus laboratory has been used as a generic
detector. Concerning the \delta_{CP} independent \theta_{13} sensitivity, a
gain of about 20% may be reached using a 3.5 GeV proton beam with a 40 m long,
2 m radius decay tunnel compared to the up to now considered 2.2 GeV beam
energy and 20 m long, 1 m radius decay tunnel. This may motivate new machine
developments to upgrade the nominal SPL proton beam energy.
