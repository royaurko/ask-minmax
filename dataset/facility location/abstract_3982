We focus on two Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
(HST/STIS) spectra of the Weigelt Blobs B&D, extending from 1640 to 10400A; one
recorded during the 1998 minimum (March 1998) and the other recorded in
February 1999, early in the following broad maximum. The spatially-resolved
spectra suggest two distinct ionization regions. One structure is the
permanently low ionization cores of the Weigelt Blobs, B&D, located several
hundred AU from the ionizing source. Their spectra are dominated by emission
from H I, [N II], Fe II, [Fe II], Ni II, [Ni II], Cr II and Ti II. The second
region, relatively diffuse in character and located between the ionizing source
and the Weigelt Blobs, is more highly ionized with emission from [FeIII], [Fe
IV], N III], [Ne III], [Ar III], [Si III], [S III] and He I. Through
photoionization modeling, we find that the radiation field from the more
massive B-star companion supports the low ionization structure throughout the
5.54 year period. The radiation field of an evolved O-star is required to
produce the higher ionization emission seen across the broad maximum. This
emission region is identified with slow-moving condensations photoionized by
the O star and located in the extended mass flow emanating from the B star
primary. Comparison between the models and observations reveals that the high
ionization region is physically distinct (n_H ~ 10^7 cm^(-3) and T_e ~ 10^4K)
from the BD Blobs (n_H ~ 10^6 cm^(-3), T_e ~ 7000K).
