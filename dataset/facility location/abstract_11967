The left-hand side of the auroral hiss emission observed by Galileo has a
frequency time shaped very similar to the funnel shape observed in the earth's
auroral region. This close similarity indicates that we can use the
whistler-mode propagation near resonance cone to locate the emission source. In
this paper the general characteristic of the whistler mode are discussed. Then
the position of the emission source has been investigated using a geometry
method that takes into account the Galileo's trajectory. Initially it is
assumed the source is a point. Then the possibility of sheet source aligned
along the magnetic field lines which are tangent to the surface of Io is
investigated. Both of two types of sources show that the whistler mode
radiation originates very close to the surface of the Io.
