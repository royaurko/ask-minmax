A summary of experimental results from the Pentaquark 2004 Workshop held at
the SPring-8 facility in Japan is given. New results from the LEPS
collaboration are highlighted, and older results are reviewed. Non-observations
are also discussed in light of theoretical estimates of possible $\Theta^+$
production mechanisms. The problem of the narrow width and the parity of the
$\Theta^+$ are explored and point to future experimental work that is needed.
