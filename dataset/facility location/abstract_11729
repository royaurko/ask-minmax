We present observations at 1.3 millimeters wavelength of the beta Pictoris
debris disk with beam size 4.3 x 2.6 arcsec (83 x 50 AU) from the Submillimeter
Array. The emission shows two peaks separated by ~7 arsec along the disk plane,
which we interpret as a highly inclined dust ring or belt. A simple model
constrains the belt center to 94+/-8 AU, close to the prominent break in slope
of the optical scattered light. We identify this region as the location as the
main reservoir of dust producing planetesimals in the disk.
