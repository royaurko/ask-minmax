Context: The Sun's polar fields and open flux around the time of activity
minima have been considered to be strongly correlated with the strength of the
subsequent maximum of solar activity. Aims: We aim to investigate the behavior
of a Babcock-Leighton dynamo with a source poloidal term that is based on the
observed sunspot areas and tilts. In particular, we investigate whether the
toroidal fields at the base of convection zone from the model are correlated
with the observed solar cycle activity maxima. Methods: We used a flux
transport dynamo model that includes convective pumping and a poloidal source
term based on the historical record of sunspot group areas, locations, and tilt
angles to simulate solar cycles 15 to 21. Results: We find that the polar
fields near minima and the toroidal flux at the base of the convection zone are
both highly correlated with the subsequent maxima of solar activity levels (r =
0.85 and r = 0.93, respectively). Conclusions: The Babcock-Leighton dynamo is
consistent with the observationally inferred correlations.
