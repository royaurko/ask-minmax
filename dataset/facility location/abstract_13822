Gesturing is one of the natural modes of human communication. Signs produced
by gestures can have a basic meaning coupled with additional information that
is layered over the basic meaning of the sign. Sign language is an important
example of communicative gestures that are highly structured and well accepted
across the world as a communication medium for deaf and dumb. In this paper, an
online recognition scheme is proposed to interpret the standard numeric sign
language comprising of 10 basic hand symbols. A web camera is used to capture
the real time hand movements as input to the system. The basic meaning of the
hand gesture is extracted from the input data frame by analysing the shape of
the hand, considering its orientation, movement and location to be fixed. The
input hand shape is processed to identify the palm structure, fingertips and
their relative positions and the presence of the extended thumb. A
2-dimensional skeletal model is generated from the acquired shape information
to represent and subsequently interpret the basic meaning of the hand gesture.
