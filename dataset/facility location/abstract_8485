The emission of $\MeV$-mass tau neutrinos from newly formed neutron stars is
considered in a simple, but accurate, model based upon the diffusion
approximation. The tau-neutrinosphere temperature is found to increase with
mass so that emission of massive tau neutrinos is not suppressed by the
Boltzmann factor previously used, $(\mnu /T_\nu )^{1.5}\exp(-\mnu/T_{\nu})$,
where $T_{\nu}\sim 4\MeV -8\MeV$. If the tau neutrino decays to electron
neutrinos, then for short lifetimes ($\taunu\la10^{-3}\sec$) the location of
both the tau and electron neutrinospheres can be affected, and, for very short
lifetimes ($\tau_\nu \la 10^{-6}\sec$) its temperature falls below $1\MeV$, in
conflict with neutrino observations of Supernova 1987A (SN 87A). Using our
results, we revise limits to the mass/lifetime of an $\MeV$-mass tau neutrino
based upon SN 87A. Our constraints, together with bounds based upon primordial
nucleosynthesis and the laboratory mass limit of around $30\MeV$, exclude the
possibility of a tau neutrino more massive than $0.4\MeV$ if the dominant decay
mode is radiative. Finally, we speculate on the possible role a $15\MeV
-25\MeV$ tau neutrino might play in the supernova explosion itself.
