We review the experimental and theoretical status of elastic electron
scattering and elastic low-energy photon scattering (with both real and virtual
photons) from the nucleon. As a consequence of new experimental facilities and
new theoretical insights, these subjects are advancing with unprecedented
precision. These reactions provide many important insights into the spatial
distributions and correlations of quarks in the nucleon.
