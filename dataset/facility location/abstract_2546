We present a conceptual design for a novel continuous wave electron-linac
based high-intensity high-brightness slow-positron production source with a
projected intensity on the order of 10$^{10}$ e$^+$/s. Reaching this intensity
in our design relies on the transport of positrons (T$_+$ below 600 keV) from
the electron-positron pair production converter target to a low-radiation and
low-temperature area for moderation in a high-efficiency cryogenic rare gas
moderator, solid Ne. This design progressed through Monte Carlo optimizations
of: electron/positron beam energies and converter target thickness, transport
of the e$^+$ beam from the converter to the moderator, extraction of the e$^+$
beam from the magnetic channel, a synchronized raster system, and moderator
efficiency calculations. For the extraction of e$^+$ from the magnetic channel,
a magnetic field terminator plug prototype has been built and experimental
results on the effectiveness of the prototype are presented. The dissipation of
the heat away from the converter target and radiation protection measures are
also discussed.
