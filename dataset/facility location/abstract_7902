The results of treatment of data obtained in the SERP-E-184experiment
"Investigation of mechanisms of the production of charmed particles in
proton-nucleus interactions at 70 GeV and their decays" by irradiating the
active target of the SVD-2 facility consisting of carbon, silicon, and lead
plates, are presented. After separating a signal from the two-particle decay of
neutral charmed mesons and estimating the cross section for charm production at
a threshold energy {\sigma}(c\v{c})=7.1 \pm 2.4(stat.) \pm 1.4(syst.)
\mub/nucleon, some properties of D mesons are investigated. These include the
dependence of the cross section on the target mass number (its A dependence);
the behavior of the differential cross sections d{\sigma}/dpt2 and
d{\sigma}/dxF; and the dependence of the parameter {\alpha} on the kinematical
variables xF, pt2, and plab. The experimental results in question are compared
with predictions obtained on the basis of the FRITIOF7.02 code.
