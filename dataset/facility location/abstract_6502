The functional equation for Riemann's Zeta function is studied, from which it
is shown why all of the non-trivial, full-zeros of the Zeta function $\zeta
(s)$ will only occur on the critical line {$\sigma=1/2$} where {$s=\sigma+I
\rho$}, thereby establishing the truth of Riemann's hypothesis. Further, two
relatively simple transcendental equations are obtained; the numerical solution
of these equations locates all of the zeros of {$\zeta (s)$} on the critical
line.
