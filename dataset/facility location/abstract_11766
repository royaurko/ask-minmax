We present result of processing of data of ground-space VLBI experiment
titled W068. Particularly, one part of data of that observational session is
successfully processed. These data were obtained on 2000 March 17 between 9:00
UT and 10:30 UT. 10 antennas of American interferometer VLBA (Very Long
Baseline Array) and Japan satellite VSOP (VLBI Space Observatory Programme)
were involved into this experiment. Moreover, 27 antennae of VLA (Very Large
Array)} were used as an additional ground antenna. Data were transferred from
archive of the NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, USA)and processed
with the software titled 'Astro Space Locator' (ASL for Windows). The main
result of this processing is the image of the quasar titled 3C273 with high
resolution and high accuracy. Using this image, we make some conclusions about
the radio structure of jet of this object. Our result is not in conflict with
other results of processing of the Space VLBI data for 3C273 published earlier
with many contributors. We could add some new aspects into that results. The
reconstructed images of 3C273 for 6 centimeter wavelength range and values of
some parameters of this source are presented.
