Since giant planets scatter planetesimals within a few tidal radii of their
orbits, the locations of existing planetesimal belts indicate regions where
giant planet formation failed in bygone protostellar disks. Infrared
observations of circumstellar dust produced by colliding planetesimals are
therefore powerful probes of the formation histories of known planets. Here we
present new Spitzer IRS spectrophotometry of 111 Solar-type stars, including
105 planet hosts. Our observations reveal 11 debris disks, including two
previously undetected debris disks orbiting HD 108874 and HD 130322. Combining
our 32 micron spectrophotometry with previously published MIPS photometry, we
find that the majority of debris disks around planet hosts have temperatures in
the range 60 < T < 100 K. Assuming a dust temperature T = 70 K, which is
representative of the nine debris disks detected by both IRS and MIPS, we find
that debris rings surrounding Sunlike stars orbit between 15 and 240 AU,
depending on the mean particle size. Our observations imply that the planets
detected by radial-velocity searches formed within 240 AU of their parent
stars. If any of the debris disks studied here have mostly large, blackbody
emitting grains, their companion giant planets must have formed in a narrow
region between the ice line and 15 AU.
