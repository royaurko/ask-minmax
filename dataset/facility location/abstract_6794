Using synchrotron based photoemission, we have investigated the Mn-induced
changes in Ga 3d core level spectra from as-grown ${\rm Ga}_{1-x}{\rm
Mn}_{x}{\rm As}$. Although Mn is located in Ga substitutional sites, and does
therefore not have any Ga nearest neighbours, the impact of Mn on the Ga core
level spectra is pronounced even at Mn concentrations in the range of 0.5%. The
analysis shows that each Mn atom affects a volume corresponding to a sphere
with around 1.4 nm diameter.
