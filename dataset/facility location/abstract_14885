GAIA is the ``super-Hipparcos'' satellite scheduled for launch in 2010 by the
European Space Agency. It is a scanning satellite that carries out
multi-colour, multi-epoch photometry on all objects brighter than 20th
magnitude. We conduct detailed simulations of supernovae (SNe) detection by
GAIA. Supernovae of each type are chosen according to the observed
distributions of absolute magnitudes, and located in nearby galaxies according
to the local large-scale structure. Using an extinction model of the Galaxy and
the scanning law of the GAIA satellite, we calculate how many SNe are
detectable as a function of the phase of the lightcurve. Our study shows that
GAIA will report data on 21400 SNe during the five-year mission lifetime, of
which 14300 are SNe Ia, 1400 are SNe Ib/c and 5700 are SNe II. Using the
simulations, we estimate that the numbers caught before maximum are 6300 SNe
Ia, 500 SNe Ib/c and 1700 SNe II. GAIA will issue about 5 SNe alerts a day. The
most distant SNe accessible to GAIA are at a redshift of 0.14 and so GAIA will
provide a huge sample of local SNe. There will be many examples of the rarer
subluminous events, over-luminous events, SNe Ib/c and SNe II-L. SNe rates will
be found as a function of galaxy type, as well as extinction and position in
the host galaxy. Amongst other applications, there may be about 26 SNe each
year for which detection of gravitational waves is possible and about 180 SNe
each year for which detection of gamma-rays is possible.
