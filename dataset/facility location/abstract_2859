We calculate the spectra and spin susceptibilities of a Hubbard model with
two bands having different bandwidths but the same on-site interaction, with
parameters close to the orbital-selective Mott transition, using dynamical
mean-field theory. If the Hund's rule coupling is sufficiently strong, one
common energy scale emerges which characterizes both the location of kinks in
the self-energy and extrema of the diagonal spin susceptibilities. A physical
explanation of this energy scale is derived from a Kondo-type model. We infer
that for multi-band systems local spin dynamics rather than spectral functions
determine the location of kinks in the effective band structure.
