Three peaks and two dips have been detected in the power spectrum of the
cosmic microwave background from the BOOMERANG experiment, at $\ell \sim 210,
540, 840$ and $\ell \sim 420, 750$, respectively. Using model-independent
analyses, we find that all five features are statistically significant and we
measure their location and amplitude. These are consistent with the adiabatic
inflationary model. We also calculate the mean and variance of the peak and dip
locations and amplitudes in a large 7-dimensional parameter space of such
models, which gives good agreement with the model-independent estimates, and
forecast where the next few peaks and dips should be found if the basic
paradigm is correct. We test the robustness of our results by comparing
Bayesian marginalization techniques on this space with likelihood maximization
techniques applied to a second 7-dimensional cosmological parameter space,
using an independent computational pipeline, and find excellent agreement:
$\Omega_{\rm tot} = 1.02^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ {\it vs.} $1.04 \pm 0.05$, $\Omega_b
h^2 = 0.022^{+0.004}_{-0.003}$ {\it vs.} $0.019^{+0.005}_{-0.004}$, and $n_s =
0.96^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ {\it vs.} $0.90 \pm 0.08$. The deviation in primordial
spectral index $n_s$ is a consequence of the strong correlation with the
optical depth.
