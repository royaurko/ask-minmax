We present a novel, cost-effective and facile technique, wherein multi-walled
carbon nano-tubes (CNTs) were used to transform a photoluminescent material to
exhibit stable and efficient electroluminescence (EL) at low-voltages. As a
case study, a commercially available ZnS:Cu phosphor (P-22G) was combined with
a very low concentration of CNTs dispersed in ethanol and its alternating
current driven electroluminescence (AC-EL) is demonstrated. The role of CNTs
has been understood as a local electric field enhancer and facilitator in the
hot carrier injection inside the ZnS crystal to produce EL in the hybrid
material. The mechanism of EL is discussed using an internal field emission
model, intra-CNT impact excitation and the recombination of electrons and holes
through the impurity states.
