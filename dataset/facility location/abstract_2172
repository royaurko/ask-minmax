We investigate the possibility of clarifying internal structure of exotic
hadrons by high-energy exclusive reactions. In particular, the
constituent-counting rule could be used for determining the internal
configuration in large-angle exclusive scattering. As an example, we show the
cross section pi^- + p -> K^0 + Lambda(1405) in comparison with the one for the
ground-state Lambda production pi^- + p -> K^0 + Lambda. The counting rule
indicates that the cross section scales as s^8 dsigma /dt=constant if
Lambda(1405) is an ordinary three-quark baryon, whereas it is s^{10} dsigma
/dt=constant if Lambda(1405) is a five-quark baryon. Here, s and t are
Mandelstam variables. Such experiments could be possible at J-PARC, LEP, JLab,
CERN-COMPASS, and other high-energy facilities.
