Using pulse timing observations we have obtained precise parameters,
including positions with about 20 mas accuracy, of five millisecond pulsars in
NGC 6752. Three of them, located relatively close to the cluster center, have
line-of-sight accelerations larger than the maximum value predicted by the
central mass density derived from optical observation, providing dynamical
evidence for a central mass-to-light ratio >~ 10, much higher than for any
other globular cluster. It is likely that the other two millisecond pulsars
have been ejected out of the core to their present locations at 1.4 and 3.3
half-mass radii, respectively, suggesting unusual non-thermal dynamics in the
cluster core.
