NASA's Dawn mission observed a great variety of colored terrains on asteroid
(4) Vesta during its survey with the Framing Camera (FC). Here we present a
detailed study of the orange material on Vesta, which was first observed in
color ratio images obtained by the FC and presents a red spectral slope. The
orange material deposits can be classified into three types, a) diffuse ejecta
deposited by recent medium-size impact craters (such as Oppia), b) lobate
patches with well-defined edges, and c) ejecta rays from fresh-looking impact
craters. The location of the orange diffuse ejecta from Oppia corresponds to
the olivine spot nicknamed "Leslie feature" first identified by Gaffey (1997)
from ground-based spectral observations. The distribution of the orange
material in the FC mosaic is concentrated on the equatorial region and almost
exclusively outside the Rheasilvia basin. Our in-depth analysis of the
composition of this material uses complementary observations from FC, the
visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), and the Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector
(GRaND). Combining the interpretations from the topography, geomorphology,
color and spectral parameters, and elemental abundances, the most probable
analog for the orange material on Vesta is impact melt.
