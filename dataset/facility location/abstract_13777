The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is a large and complex general purpose
experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), built and maintained by
many collaborators from around the world. Efficient operation of the detector
requires widespread and timely access to a broad range of monitoring and status
information. To this end the Web Based Monitoring (WBM) system was developed to
present data to users located anywhere from many underlying heterogeneous
sources, from real time messaging systems to relational databases. This system
provides the power to combine and correlate data in both graphical and tabular
formats of interest to the experimenters, including data such as beam
conditions, luminosity, trigger rates, detector conditions, and many others,
allowing for flexibility on the user side. This paper describes the WBM system
architecture and describes how the system was used during the first major data
taking run of the LHC.
