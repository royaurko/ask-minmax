In this work we perform a global analysis of the radial velocity curve of the
HD 12661 system. Orbital fits that are obtained by the genetic and gradient
algorithms of minimization reveal the proximity of the system to the 6:1 mean
motion resonance. The orbits are locked in the secular resonance with apsidal
axes librating about 180 deg with the full amplitude $\simeq (90,180) deg$. Our
solution incorporates the mutual interaction between the companions. The
stability analysis with the MEGNO fast indicator shows that the system is
located in an extended stable zone of quasi-periodic motions. These results are
different from those obtained on the basis of the orbital fit published by
Fischer et al. (2003)
