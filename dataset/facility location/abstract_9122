Motivated by the recent claim for gravitational lensing by a cosmic string,
we reinvestigate the probability of finding such an event with upcoming
wide-field surveys. If an observed lensing event is suspected to be due to a
string, observations of the vicinity of the event in a circle of diameter L
centered on the observed lens should reveal several additional lensing events.
For a string located nearby (z\lesssim 0.5), we find that observations in a
region of size \approx 1 arcmin^2 will see \sim 100 objects, of which \sim 5
would be lensed by the string, compared to \sim 0.1 lensed by conventional
sources.
