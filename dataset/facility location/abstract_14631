We present the first detection of a large quantity of molecular gas in the
extended tail of an interacting galaxy. Using the NRAO 12m telescope, we have
detected CO (1 - 0) at five locations in the eastern tail of the peculiar
starburst galaxy NGC 2782. The CO velocities and narrow (FWHM = 50 km/s) line
widths in these positions agree with those seen in HI, confirming that the
molecular gas is indeed associated with the tail rather than the main disk. As
noted previously, the gas in this tail has an apparent `counter-rotation'
compared to gas in the core of the galaxy, probably because the tails do not
lie in the same plane as the disk. Assuming the standard Galactic conversion
N(H2)/I(CO) factor, these observations indicate a total molecular gas mass of 6
X 10**8 M(sun) in this tail. This may be an underestimate of the total H2 mass
if the gas is metal-poor. This molecular gas mass, and the implied H2/HI mass
ratio of 0.6, are higher than that found in many dwarf irregular galaxies.
Comparison with an available H-alpha map of this galaxy, however, shows that
the rate of star formation in this feature is extremely low relative to the
available molecular gas, compared to L(H-alpha)/M(H2) values for both spiral
and irregular galaxies. Thus the timescale for depletion of the gas in this
feature is very long.
