Extended topological defects (ETDs) arising in spherical hexagonal crystals
due to their curvature are considered. These prevalent defects carry a unit
total topological charge and are surrounded by scalene pentagonal boundaries.
Topological peculiarities of reactions between ETDs and dislocations are
considered. Similarly to boundaries of the usual planar crystalline order the
ETDs emit and absorb the dislocations without preservation of their
dislocational charge. Dislocations located inside the ETD area lose it and the
enforced ETD decay can proceed in different ways without conservation of the
total Burgers vector of the dislocations emitted.
