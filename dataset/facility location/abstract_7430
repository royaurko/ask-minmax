We consider the behavior of open strings on AdS wormholes in Gauss-Bonnet
theory, which are the Gauss-Bonnet gravity duals of a pair of field theories. A
string with both endpoints on the same side of the wormhole describes two
charges within the same field theory, which exhibit Coulomb interaction for
small separation. On the other hand, a string extending through the wormhole
describes two charges which live in different field theories, and they exhibit
a spring-like confining potential. A transition occurs when there is a pair of
charges present within each field theory: for small separation each pair of
charges exhibits Coulomb interaction, while for large separation the charges in
the different field theories pair up and exhibit confinement. Two
steadily-moving charges in different field theories can occupy the same
location provided that their speed is less than a critical speed, which also
plays the role of a subluminal speed limit. However, for some wormhole
backgrounds, charges moving at the critical speed cannot occupy the same
location and energy is transferred from the leading charge to the lagging one.
We also show that strings on AdS wormholes in supergravity theories without
higher-derivative curvature terms can exhibit these properties as well.
