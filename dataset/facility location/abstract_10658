In the framework of the nonlinear $\Lambda$-model we investigate propagation
of solitons in atomic vapors and Bose-Einstein condensates. We show how the
complicated nonlinear interplay between fast solitons and slow-light solitons
in the $\Lambda$-type media points to the possibility to create optical gates
and, thus, to control the optical transparency of the $\Lambda$-type media. We
provide an exact analytic description of decelerating, stopping and
re-accelerating of slow-light solitons in atomic media in the nonadiabatic
regime. Dynamical control over slow-light solitons is realized via a
controlling field generated by an auxiliary laser. For a rather general time
dependence of the field; we find the dynamics of the slow-light soliton inside
the medium. We provide an analytical description for the nonlinear dependence
of the velocity of the signal on the controlling field. If the background field
is turned off at some moment of time, the signal stops. We find the location
and shape of the spatially localized memory bit imprinted into the medium. We
discuss physically interesting features of our solution, which are in a good
agreement with recent experiments.
