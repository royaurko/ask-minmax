The number ratios Be/(B+Be) of Be to B-type stars in young, well studied
clusters of the Galaxy, the LMC and SMC are examined. In order to disentangle
age and metallicity effects we choose clusters in the same age interval and for
which reliable photometric and spectroscopic data are available. Number counts
are made for various magnitude intervals, and the results are found to be
stable with respect to this choice. In the magnitude interval Mv = -5 to -1.4
(i.e. O9 to B3) we obtained a ratio Be/(B+Be) = 0.11, 0.19, 0.23, 0.39 for 21
clusters located in the interior of the Galaxy, the exterior of the Galaxy, the
LMC and the SMC, respectively.
  Various hypotheses for these differences are examined. An interesting
possibility is that the average rotation is faster at low metallicities as a
result of star formation processes. The much higher relative N-enrichment found
by Venn et al. (1998) in A-type supergiants of the SMC, compared to galactic
supergiants, also strongly supports the presence of more rotational mixing at
low metallicities. We discuss whether high rotational mixing may be the source
of primary nitrogen in the early chemical evolution of galaxies.
