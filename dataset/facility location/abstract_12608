We present a spectroscopic and photometric analysis of the multiple system
and early-type eclipsing binary SZ Cam (O9IV + B0.5V), which consists of an
eclipsing SB2 pair of orbital period P=2.7 days in a long orbit (about 55 yrs)
around a non-eclipsing SB1 pair of orbital period P=2.8 days. We have
reconstructed the spectra of the individual components of SZ Cam from the
observed composite spectra using the technique of spectral disentangling. We
used them together with extensive and accurate BVI CCD photometry to obtain an
orbital solution. Our photometry revealed the presence of a beta Cep variable
in the SZ Cam hierarchical system, probably located within the non-eclipsing
SB1 pair. The pulsation period is 0.33265+/-0.00005 days and the observed total
amplitude in the B band is 0.0105 +/- 0.0005 mag. NLTE analysis of the
disentangled spectra provided atmospheric parameters for all three components,
consistent with those derived from orbital solution.
