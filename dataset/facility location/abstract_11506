We analyze the structure of the cluster of galaxies Abell 1775 (13h42m,
+26d22', cz ~ 21000 km/s), which exhibits a bimodal distribution of radial
velocities of the containing galaxies. The difference of the subcluster radial
velocities is \Delta V\approx 2900 km/s. We use the results of our photometric
observations made with the 1-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical
Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the spectroscopic and
photometric data from the SDSS DR6 catalog to determine independent distances
to the subclusters via three different methods: the Kormendy relation,
photometric plane, and fundamental plane. We find that the A1775 cluster
consists of two independent clusters, A1775A (cz=19664 km/s) and A1775B
(cz=22576 km/s), each located at its own Hubble distance and having small
peculiar velocities. Given the velocity dispersions of 324 km/s and 581 km/s
and the dynamic masses within the R_200 radius equal to 0.6 10^14 and 3.3 10^14
M_sun, the A1775A and A1775B clusters have the K-band luminosity-to-mass ratios
of 29 and 61, respectively. A radio galaxy with an extended tail belongs to the
A1775B cluster.
