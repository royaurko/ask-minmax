HST (V,I) photometry has been obtained for the inner halo globular cluster
NGC 6652. The photometry reaches approximately 4 mag below the turn-off and
includes a well populated horizontal branch. This cluster is located close to
the Galactic center at a galactocentric distance of approximately 2.0 kpc with
a reddening of E(V-I) = 0.15 +/- 0.02 and has a metallicity of [Fe/H]
approximately -0.85. Based upon Delta(V) between the point on the sub-giant
branch which is 0.05 mag redder than the turn-off and the horizontal branch,
NGC 6652 is 11.7 +/- 1.6 Gyr old. Using this same Delta(V), precise
differential ages for 47 Tuc (a thick disk globular), M107 and NGC 1851 (both
halo clusters) were obtained. NGC 6652 appears to be the same age as 47 Tuc and
NGC 1851 (within +/- 1.2 Gyr), while there is a slight suggestion that M107 is
older than NGC 6652 by 2.3 +/- 1.5 Gyr. As this is a less than 2-sigma result,
this issue needs to be investigated further before a definitive statement
regarding the relative age of M107 and NGC 6652 may be made.
