A $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$NN) query determines the $k$ nearest points, using
distance metrics, from a specific location. An all $k$-nearest neighbor
(A$k$NN) query constitutes a variation of a $k$NN query and retrieves the $k$
nearest points for each point inside a database. Their main usage resonates in
spatial databases and they consist the backbone of many location-based
applications and not only (i.e. $k$NN joins in databases, classification in
data mining). So, it is very crucial to develop methods that answer them
efficiently. In this work, we propose a novel method for classifying
multidimensional data using an A$k$NN algorithm in the MapReduce framework. Our
approach exploits space decomposition techniques for processing the
classification procedure in a parallel and distributed manner. To our
knowledge, we are the first to study the classification of multidimensional
objects under this perspective. Through an extensive experimental evaluation we
prove that our solution is efficient and scalable in processing the given
queries. We investigate many different perspectives that can affect the total
computational cost, such as different dataset distributions, number of
dimensions, growth of $k$ value and granularity of space decomposition and
prove that our system is efficient, robust and scalable.
