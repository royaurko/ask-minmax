This paper considers a cooperative network with multiple source-destination
pairs and one energy harvesting relay. The outage probability experienced by
users in this network is characterized by taking the spatial randomness of user
locations into consideration. In addition, the cooperation among users is
modeled as a canonical coalitional game and the grand coalition is shown to be
stable in the addressed scenario. Simulation results are provided to
demonstrate the accuracy of the developed analytical results.
