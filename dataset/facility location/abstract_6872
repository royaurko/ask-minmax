We consider the problem of localizing two sensors using signals of
opportunity from beacons with known positions. Beacons and sensors have
asynchronous local clocks or oscillators with unknown clock skews and offsets.
We model clock skews as random, and analyze the biases introduced by clock
asynchronism in the received signals. By deriving the equivalent Fisher
information matrix for the modified Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of
sensor position and velocity estimation, we quantify the errors caused by clock
asynchronism.
