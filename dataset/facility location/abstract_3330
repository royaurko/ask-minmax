Sheer amount of petabyte scale data foreseen in the LHC experiments require a
careful consideration of the persistency design and the system design in the
world-wide distributed computing. Event parallelism of the HENP data analysis
enables us to take maximum advantage of the high performance cluster computing
and networking when we keep the parallelism both in the data processing phase,
in the data management phase, and in the data transfer phase. A modular
architecture of FADS/ Goofy, a versatile detector simulation framework for
Geant4, enables an easy choice of plug-in facilities for persistency
technologies such as Objectivity/DB and ROOT I/O. The framework is designed to
work naturally with the parallel file system of Grid Datafarm (Gfarm).
FADS/Goofy is proven to generate 10^6 Geant4-simulated Atlas Mockup events
using a 512 CPU PC cluster. The data in ROOT I/O files is replicated using
Gfarm file system. The histogram information is collected from the distributed
ROOT files. During the data replication it has been demonstrated to achieve
more than 2.3 Gbps data transfer rate between the PC clusters over seven
participating PC clusters in the United States and in Japan.
