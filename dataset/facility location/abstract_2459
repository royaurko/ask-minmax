We present the open source Astrophysical Multi-purpose Software Environment
(AMUSE, www.amusecode.org), a component library for performing astrophysical
simulations involving different physical domains and scales. It couples
existing codes within a Python framework based on a communication layer using
MPI. The interfaces are standardized for each domain and their implementation
based on MPI guarantees that the whole framework is well-suited for distributed
computation. It includes facilities for unit handling and data storage.
Currently it includes codes for gravitational dynamics, stellar evolution,
hydrodynamics and radiative transfer. Within each domain the interfaces to the
codes are as similar as possible. We describe the design and implementation of
AMUSE, as well as the main components and community codes currently supported
and we discuss the code interactions facilitated by the framework.
Additionally, we demonstrate how AMUSE can be used to resolve complex
astrophysical problems by presenting example applications.
