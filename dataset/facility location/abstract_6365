The SLIM experiment is a large array of nuclear track detectors located at
the Chacaltaya High Altitude Laboratory (5260 m a.s.l.). The preliminary
results from the analysis of ~383 m^2 exposed for 4.07 y are here reported. The
detector is sensitive to Intermediate Mass Magnetic Monopoles, 10^5 < M_M <
10^12 GeV, and to SQM nuggets and Q-balls, which are possible Dark Matter
candidates.
