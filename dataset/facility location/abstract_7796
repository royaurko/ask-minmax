Massive gas outflows are considered a key component in the process of galaxy
formation and evolution. Because of this, they are the topic of many studies
aimed at learning more about their occurrence, location and physical conditions
as well as the mechanism(s) at their origin. This contribution presents recent
results on two of the best examples of jet-driven outflows traced by cold and
molecular gas. Thanks to high-spatial resolution observations, we have been
able to locate the region where the outflow occurs. This appears to be
coincident with bright radio features and regions where the interaction between
radio plasma jet and ISM is known to occur, thus strongly supporting the idea
of jet-driven outflows. We have also imaged the distribution of the outflowing
gas. The results clearly show the effect that expanding radio jets and lobes
have on the ISM. This appears to be in good agreement with what predicted from
numerical simulations. Furthermore, the results show that cold gas is
associated with these powerful phenomena and can be formed - likely via
efficient cooling - even after a strong interaction and fast shocks. The
discovery of similar fast outflows of cold gas in weak radio sources is further
increasing the relevance that the effect of the radio plasma can have on the
surrounding medium and on the host galaxy.
