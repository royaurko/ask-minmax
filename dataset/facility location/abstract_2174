We present the muon spin relaxation/rotation spectra in the multiferroic
compound (Cu,Zn)$_{3}$Mo$_{2}$O$_{9}$. The parent material
Cu$_{3}$Mo$_{2}$O$_{9}$ has a multiferroic phase below $T_{\rm N}$ = 8.0 K,
where the canted antiferromagnetism and the ferroelectricity coexist. The
asymmetry time spectra taken at RIKEN-RAL pulsed muon facility show a drastic
change at $T_{\rm N}$. At low temperatures the weakly beating oscillation
caused by the static internal magnetic fields in the antiferromagnetic phase
was observed in Cu$_{3}$Mo$_{2}$O$_{9}$ and the lightly ($0.5\%$) Zn-doped
sample. From the fitting of the oscillating term, we obtain the order parameter
in these samples: ferromagnetic moment in two sublattices of antiferromagnet.
In the heavily ($5.0\%$) Zn-doped sample, the muon-spin oscillation is rapidly
damped. The frequency-domain spectrum of this sample suggests a formation of
magnetic superstructure.
