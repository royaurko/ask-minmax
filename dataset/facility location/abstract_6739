The number and the location of the monopoles observed on the lattice in QCD
configurations happens to depend strongly on the choice of the gauge used to
expose them, in contrast to the physical expectation that monopoles be gauge
invariant objects. It is proved by use of the non abelian Bianchi identities
(NABI) that monopoles are indeed gauge invariant, but the method used to detect
them depends, in a controllable way, on the choice of the abelian projection.
Numerical checks are presented.
