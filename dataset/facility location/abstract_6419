We investigate the Taylor expansion of the baryon number susceptibility, and
hence, pressure, in a series in the baryon chemical potential (mu_B) through a
lattice simulation with light dynamical staggered quarks at a finer lattice
cutoff a=1/6T. We determine the QCD cross over coupling at mu_B=0. We find the
radius of convergence of the series at various temeperatures, and bound the
location of the QCD critical point to be T^E/T_c = 0.94 and mu_B^E/T < 1.8. We
also investigate the extrapolation of various susceptibilities and linkages to
finite chemical potential.
