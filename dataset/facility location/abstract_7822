We firstly report the quasi-periodic slipping motion of flare loops during an
eruptive X-class flare on 2014 September 10. The slipping motion was
investigated at a specific location along one of the two ribbons and can be
observed throughout the impulsive phase of the flare. The apparent slipping
velocity was 20-110 km/s and the associated period was 3$-$6 min. The
footpoints of flare loops appeared as small-scale bright knots observed in 1400
{\AA}, corresponding to fine structures of the flare ribbon. These bright knots
were observed to move along the southern part of the longer ribbon and also
exhibited a quasi-periodic pattern. The Si IV 1402.77 {\AA} line was redshifted
by 30-50 km/s at the locations of moving knots with a ~ 40-60 km/s line width,
larger than other sites of the flare ribbon. We suggest that the quasi-periodic
slipping reconnection is involved in this process and the redshift at the
bright knots is probably indicative of reconnection downflow. The emission line
of Si IV at the northern part of the longer ribbon also exhibited obvious
redshifts of about 10-70 km/s in the impulsive phase of the flare, with the
redshifts at the outer edges of the ribbon larger than those in the middle. The
redshift velocities at post-flare loops reached about 80-100 km/s in the
transition region.
