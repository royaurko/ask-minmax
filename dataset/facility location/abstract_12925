Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity has successfully explained the
observed composition of many ecological communities but it relies on strict
demographic equivalence among species and provides no room for evolutionary
processes like selection, adaptation and speciation. Here we show how to embed
the neutral theory within the Darwinian framework. In a fitness landscape with
a quadratic maximum, typical of quantitative traits, selection restricts the
extant species to have traits close to optimal, so that the fitness differences
between surviving species are small. For sufficiently small mutation steps, the
community structure fits perfectly to the Fisher log-series species abundance
distribution. The theory is relatively insensitive to moderate amounts of
environmental noise, wherein the location of the fitness maximum changes by
amounts of order the width of the noise-free distribution. Adding very large
environmental noise to the model qualitatively changes the abundance
distributions, converting the exponential fall-off of large species to a
power-law decay, typical of a neutral model with environmental noise.
