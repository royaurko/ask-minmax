Recently, with the Chandra X-ray Telescope we have detected several local
X-ray absorption lines along lines-of-sight towards distant quasars. These
absorption lines are produced by warm/hot gas located in local intergalactic
space and/or in our Galaxy. I will present our observations and discuss the
origin of the X-ray absorption and its implications in probing the warm/hot
component of local baryons.
