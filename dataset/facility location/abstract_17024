The Fermi-LAT collaboration has recently reported that one of their detected
sources, namely, 1FGL J1018.6-5856, is a new gamma-ray binary similar to LS
5039. This has prompted efforts to study its multi-frequency behavior. In this
report, we present the results from 5.78-Ms INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI observations on
the source 1FGL J1018.6-5856.
  By combining all the available INTEGRAL data, a detection is made at a
significance level of 5.4 sigma in the 18-40 keV band, with an average
intensity of 0.074 counts/s . However, we find that, there is non-statistical
noise in the image that effectively reduces the significance to about 4 sigma
and a significant part of the signal appears to be located in a 0.2-wide phase
region, at phases 0.4-0.6 (where even the corrected significance amounts to 90%
of the total signal found). Given the scarcity of counts, a variability is
hinted at about 3 sigma at the hard X-rays, with an anti-correlation with the
Fermi-LAT periodicity. Should this behavior be true, it would be similar to
that found in LS 5039, and prompt observations with TeV telescopes at phases
anti-correlated with the GeV maximum.
