We present Penning-trap mass measurements of neutron-rich 44,47-50K and
49,50Ca isotopes carried out at the TITAN facility at TRIUMF-ISAC. The 44K mass
measurement was performed with a charge-bred 4+ ion utilizing the TITAN EBIT,
and agrees with the literature. The mass excesses obtained for 47K and 49,50Ca
are more precise and agree with the values published in the 2003 Atomic Mass
Evaluation (AME'03). The 48,49,50K mass excesses are more precise than the
AME'03 values by more than one order of magnitude. For 48,49K, we find
deviations by 7 sigma and 10 sigma, respectively. The new 49K mass excess
lowers significantly the two-neutron separation energy at the neutron number
N=30 compared with the separation energy calculated from the AME'03 mass-excess
values, and thus, increases the N=28 neutron-shell gap energy at Z=19 by
approximately 1 MeV.
