The problem of the existence of a Strong Stochasticity Threshold in the
FPU-beta model is reconsidered, using suitable microcanonical observables of
thermodynamic nature, like the temperature and the specific heat. Explicit
expressions for these observables are obtained by exploiting rigorous methods
of differential geometry. Measurements of the corresponding temporal
autocorrelation functions locate the threshold at a finite value of the energy
density, that results to be indipendent of the number of degrees of freedom.
