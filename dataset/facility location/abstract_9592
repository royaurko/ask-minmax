ANTARES is a neutrino telescope being deployed in the Mediterranean Sea. It
consists of a three dimensional array of photomultiplier tubes that can detect
the Cherenkov light induced by charged particles produced in the interactions
of neutrinos with the surrounding medium. High angular resolution can be
achieved, in particular when a muon is produced, provided that the Cherenkov
photons are detected with sufficient timing precision. Considerations of the
intrinsic time uncertainties stemming from the transit time spread in the
photomultiplier tubes and the mechanism of transmission of light in sea water
lead to the conclusion that a relative time accuracy of the order of 0.5 ns is
desirable. Accordingly, different time calibration systems have been developed
for the ANTARES telescope. In this article, a system based on Optical Beacons,
a set of external and well-controlled pulsed light sources located throughout
the detector, is described. This calibration system takes into account the
optical properties of sea water, which is used as the detection volume of the
ANTARES telescope. The design, tests, construction and first results of the two
types of beacons, LED and laser-based, are presented.
