In this paper we present near infrared (NIR) imaging data of the host galaxy
of the broad absorption line quasar (BALQ) at z=2.169, serendipitously found
close to 3C48. The data were obtained with the ESO-VLT camera ISAAC during
period 67. We find extended, rest-frame optical emission around the BALQ after
subtracting a scaled stellar point spread function from the quasar nucleus in
J, H, and Ks. The extended rest-frame optical emission can be interpreted as an
approximately 2 Gyr old stellar population composing the host galaxy of the
BALQ or a stellar population of similar age associated with an intermediate
(z=1.667) absorption system spectroscopically identified by Canalizo & Stockton
(1998) simultaneously. The rest-frame-UV emission on the other hand is
dominated by a young, 500 Myr old stellar population. The UV/optical colors
resemble a mixture of the two populations, of which the young one accounts for
about 80%. Assuming that the residual emission is located at the BALQ redshift,
we find that the host galaxy has a resolved flux of about 10% of the BALQ flux.
The physical scale is quite compact, typical for radio quiet QSOs or Lyman
break galaxies at these redshifts, indicating that the systems are still in the
process of forming.
