The long-term prospects for fully exploring three-flavor mixing in the
neutrino sector depend upon an ongoing and increased investment in the
appropriate accelerator R&D. Two new concepts have been proposed that would
revolutionize neutrino experiments, namely the Neutrino Factory and the Beta
Beam facility. These new facilities would dramatically improve our ability to
test the three-flavor mixing framework, measure \textsl{CP} violation in the
lepton sector, and perhaps determine the neutrino mass hierarchy, and, if
necessary, probe extremely small values of the mixing angle $\theta_{13}$. The
stunning sensitivity that could be achieved with a Neutrino Factory is
described, together with our present understanding of the corresponding
sensitivity that might be achieved with a Beta Beam facility. In the Beta Beam
case, additional study is required to better understand the optimum Beta Beam
energy, and the achievable sensitivity. Neither a Neutrino Factory nor a Beta
Beam facility could be built without significant R&D. An impressive Neutrino
Factory R&D effort has been ongoing in the U.S. and elsewhere over the last few
years and significant progress has been made towards optimizing the design,
developing and testing the required accelerator components, and significantly
reducing the cost. The recent progress is described here.
