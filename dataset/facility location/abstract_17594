The objective of this paper is to design an efficient vehicle license plate
recognition System and to implement it for automatic parking inventory system.
The system detects the vehicle first and then captures the image of the front
view of the vehicle. Vehicle license plate is localized and characters are
segmented. For finding the place of plate, a novel and real time method is
expressed. A new and robust technique based on directional chain code is used
for character recognition. The resulting vehicle number is then compared with
the available database of all the vehicles so as to come up with information
about the vehicle type and to charge entrance cost accordingly. The system is
then allowed to open parking barrier for the vehicle and generate entrance cost
receipt. The vehicle information (such as entrance time, date, and cost amount)
is also stored in the database to maintain the record. The hardware and
software integrated system is implemented and a working prototype model is
developed. Under the available database, the average accuracy of locating
vehicle license plate obtained 100%. Using 70% samples of character for
training, we tested our scheme on whole samples and obtained 100% correct
recognition rate. Further we tested our character recognition stage on Persian
vehicle data set and we achieved 99% correct recognition.
