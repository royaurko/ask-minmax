The WWR-M reactor of PNPI offers a unique opportunity to prepare a source for
ultracold neutrons (UCN) in an environment of high neutron flux (about 3*10^12
n/cm^2/s) at still acceptable radiation heat release (about 4*10^-3 W/g). It
can be realized within the reactor thermal column situated close to the reactor
core. With its large diameter of 1 m, this channel allows to install a 15 cm
thick bismuth shielding, a graphite premoderator (300 dm^3 at 20 K), and a
superfluid helium converter (35 dm^3). At a temperature of 1.2 K it is possible
to remove the heat release power of about 20 W. Using the 4pi flux of cold
neutrons within the reactor column can bring more than a factor 100 of cold
neutron flux incident on the superfluid helium with respect to the present cold
neutron beam conditions at the ILL reactor. The storage lifetime for UCN in
superfluid He at 1.2 K is about 30 s, which is sufficient when feeding
experiments requiring a similar filling time. The calculated density of UCN
with energy between 50 neV and 250 neV in an experimental volume of 40 liters
is about 10^4 n/cm^3. Technical solutions for realization of the project are
discussed.
