ANTARES is an underwater detector located in the Mediterranean Sea, near the
French city of Toulon, dedicated to the search for cosmic neutrinos. ANTARES is
optimized to detect the Cherenkov signal from up-going relativistic particles,
but could also observe massive exotic objects, such as magnetic monopoles and
nuclearites. In this article we present a search strategy for nuclearites and
determine the sensitivity to nuclearites of ANTARES detector in complete
configuration, using a set of data taken in 2008.
