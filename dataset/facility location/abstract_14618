We present an observational and theoretical study of the ionization fraction
in several massive cores located in regions that are currently forming stellar
clusters. Maps of the emission from the J = 1-> O transitions of C18O, DCO+,
N2H+, and H13CO+, as well as the J = 2 -> 1 and J = 3 -> 2 transitions of CS,
were obtained for each core. Core densities are determined via a large velocity
gradient analysis with values typically 10^5 cm^-3. With the use of
observations to constrain variables in the chemical calculations we derive
electron fractions for our overall sample of 5 cores directly associated with
star formation and 2 apparently starless cores. The electron abundances are
found to lie within a small range, -6.9 < log10(x_e) < -7.3, and are consistent
with previous work. We find no difference in the amount of ionization fraction
between cores with and without associated star formation activity, nor is any
difference found in electron abundances between the edge and center of the
emission region. Thus our models are in agreement with the standard picture of
cosmic rays as the primary source of ionization for molecular ions. With the
addition of previously determined electron abundances for low mass cores, and
even more massive cores associated with O and B clusters, we systematically
examine the ionization fraction as a function of star formation activity. This
analysis demonstrates that the most massive sources stand out as having the
lowest electron abundances (x_e < 10^-8).
