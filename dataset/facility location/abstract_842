The PANDA experiment which is part of the future FAIR facility at Darmstadt
will investigate reactions of antiprotons with hydrogen and nuclear targets.
One of the benchmark channel for the simulation and the design of the detector
is the Lambda AntiLambda channel, which has been extensively investigated by
the PS185 collaboration. This paper will report on first results on GEANT4
simulations including the PANDA detector geometry which have been performed to
study the detector acceptance, resolution and background suppression as well as
the reconstruction polarization observables.
