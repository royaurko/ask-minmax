Quantum thermal effect of Weyl neutrinos in a rectilinearly non-uniformly
accelerating Kinnersley black hole is investigated by using the generalized
tortoise coordinate transformation. The equation that determines the location,
the Hawking temperature of the event horizon and the thermal radiation spectrum
of neutrinos are derived. Our results show that the location and the
temperature of the event horizon depend not only on the time but also on the
angle.
