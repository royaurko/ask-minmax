Phase behavior of large three-dimensional complex plasma systems under
microgravity conditions onboard the International Space Station is
investigated. The neutral gas pressure is used as a control parameter to
trigger phase changes. Detailed analysis of structural properties and
evaluation of three different melting/freezing indicators reveal that complex
plasmas can exhibit melting by increasing the gas pressure. Theoretical
estimates of complex plasma parameters allow us to identify main factors
responsible for the observed behavior. The location of phase states of the
investigated systems on a relevant equilibrium phase diagram is estimated.
Important differences between the melting process of 3D complex plasmas under
microgravity conditions and that of flat 2D complex plasma crystals in ground
based experiments are discussed.
