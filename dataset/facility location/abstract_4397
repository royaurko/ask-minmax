We study nonparametric Bayesian inference with location mixtures of the
Laplace density and a Dirichlet process prior on the mixing distribution. We
derive a contraction rate of the corresponding posterior distribution, both for
the mixing distribution relative to the Wasserstein metric and for the mixed
density relative to the Hellinger and $L_q$ metrics.
