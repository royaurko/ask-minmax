Dipole modes are the main cause of transverse emittance dilution in the
Japanese Linear Collider / Next Linear Collider (JLC/NLC). A diagnostic setup
has been built in order to investigate them. The method is based on using a
coaxial wire to excite and measure electromagnetic modes of accelerating
structures. This method can offer a more efficient and less expensive procedure
than the ASSET facility. Initial measurements have been made and are presented
in this paper.
