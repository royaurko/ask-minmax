Recent observations of sunspot's umbra suggested that it may be finely
structured at a sub-arcsecond scale representing a mix of hot and cool plasma
elements. In this study we report the first detailed observations of the umbral
spikes, which are cool jet-like structures seen in the chromosphere of an
umbra. The spikes are cone-shaped features with a typical height of 0.5-1.0 Mm
and a width of about 0.1 Mm. Their life time ranges from 2 to 3 min and they
tend to re-appear at the same location. The spikes are not associated with
photospheric umbral dots and they rather tend to occur above darkest parts of
the umbra, where magnetic fields are strongest. The spikes exhibit up and down
oscillatory motions and their spectral evolution suggests that they might be
driven by upward propagating shocks generated by photospheric oscillations. It
is worth noting that triggering of the running penumbral waves seems to occur
during the interval when the spikes reach their maximum height.
