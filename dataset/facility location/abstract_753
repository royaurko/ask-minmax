SPARQL is the W3C candidate recommendation query language for RDF. In this
paper we address systematically the formal study of SPARQL, concentrating in
its graph pattern facility. We consider for this study a fragment without
literals and a simple version of filters which encompasses all the main issues
yet is simple to formalize. We provide a compositional semantics, prove there
are normal forms, prove complexity bounds, among others that the evaluation of
SPARQL patterns is PSPACE-complete, compare our semantics to an alternative
operational semantics, give simple and natural conditions when both semantics
coincide and discuss optimizations procedures.
