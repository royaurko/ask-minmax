We theoretically investigate an opportunity to implement a source of highly
spin-polarized ac current on the basis of superconductor/weak
ferromagnet/superconductor (SFS) voltage-biased junction in the regime of
essential proximity effect and calculate the current flowing through the probe
electrode tunnel coupled to the ferromagnetic interlayer region. It is shown
that while the polarization of the dc current component is generally small in
case of weak exchange field of the ferromagnet, there is an ac component of the
current in the system. This ac current is highly spin-polarized and entirely
originated from the non-equilibrium proximity effect in the interlayer. The
frequency of the current is controlled by the voltage applied to SFS junction.
We discuss a possibility to obtain a source of coherent ac currents with a
certain phase shift between them by tunnel coupling two probe electrodes at
different locations of the interlayer region.
