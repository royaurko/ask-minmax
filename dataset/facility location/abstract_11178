The NEMO 3 experiment is located in the Modane Underground Laboratory and has
been taking data since 2003 with seven isotopes. It is searching for the double
beta decay process with two or zero neutrinos emitted in the final state.
Precision measurements of the half-life of the isotopes due to two neutrino
double beta decay have been performed and new results for 96Zr, 48Ca and 150Nd
are presented here. Measurements of this process are important for reducing the
uncertainties on the nuclear matrix elements. No evidence for zero neutrino
double beta decay has been found and a 90% Confidence Level lower limit on the
half-life of this process is derived. From this an upper limit can be set on
the effective Majorana neutrino mass using the most recent nuclear matrix
elements calculations.
