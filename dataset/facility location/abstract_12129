As a part of an ongoing study of a sample of galaxy groups showing evidence
for AGN/hot gas interaction, we report on the preliminary results of an
analysis of new XMM and GMRT data of the X-ray bright compact group HCG 62.
This is one of the few groups known to possess very clear, small X-ray cavities
in the inner region as shown by the existing Chandra image. At higher
frequencies (>1.4 GHz) the cavities show minimal if any radio emission, but the
radio appears clearly at lower frequencies (<610 MHz). We compare and discuss
the morphology and spectral properties of the gas and of the radio source. We
find that the cavities are close to pressure balance, and that the jets have a
"light" hadronic content. By extracting X-ray surface brightness and
temperature profiles, we also identify a shock front located around 35 kpc to
the south-west of the group center.
