We have revised our analysis of the SPIRE observations of 2MASSW
J1207334-393254 (2M1207). Recent PACS observations show a bright source located
~25" east of 2M1207. There are issues in terms of the detection/non-detection
of the bright source when comparing the Spitzer, WISE, and PACS observations.
It is apparently inconsistent, perhaps due to variability or low
signal-to-noise of the data. We have looked into the possible misidentification
of the target, and have revised the measured SPIRE fluxes and the disc
parameters for 2M1207. We have also reviewed which among the various formation
mechanisms of this system would still be valid.
