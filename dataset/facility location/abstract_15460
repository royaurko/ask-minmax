We present first results from a deep (J = 18.7), wide-field (6.5 square
degrees) infrared (ZYJHK) survey in the Upper Sco association conducted within
the science verification phase of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey Galactic
Cluster Survey (GCS). Cluster members define a sequence well separated from
field stars in the (Z-J,Z) colour-magnitude diagram. We have selected a total
of 164 candidates with J = 10.5-18.7 mag from the (Z-J,Z) and (Y-J,Y) diagrams.
We further investigated the location of those candidates in the other
colour-magnitude and colour-colour diagrams to weed out contaminants. The
cross-correlation of the GCS catalogue with the 2MASS database confirms the
membership of 116 photometric candidates down to 20 Jupiter masses as they lie
within a 2 sigma circle centred on the association mean motion. The final list
of cluster members contains 129 sources with masses between 0.3 and 0.007 Msun.
We extracted a dozen new low-mass brown dwarfs below 20 Mjup, the limit of
previous surveys in the region. Finally, we have derived the mass function in
Upper Sco over the 0.3-0.01 Msun mass range, best fit by a single segment with
a slope of index alpha = 0.6+/-0.1, in agreement with previous determination in
open clusters.
