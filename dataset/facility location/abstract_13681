We investigate asymptotic properties of least-absolute-deviation or median
quantile estimates of the location and scale functions in nonparametric
regression models with dependent data from multiple subjects. Under a general
dependence structure that allows for longitudinal data and some spatially
correlated data, we establish uniform Bahadur representations for the proposed
median quantile estimates. The obtained Bahadur representations provide deep
insights into the asymptotic behavior of the estimates. Our main theoretical
development is based on studying the modulus of continuity of kernel weighted
empirical process through a coupling argument. Progesterone data is used for an
illustration.
