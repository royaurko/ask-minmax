Angle-resolved photoemission on underdoped La$_{1.895}$Sr$_{0.105}$CuO$_4$
reveals that in the pseudogap phase, the dispersion has two branches located
above and below the Fermi level with a minimum at the Fermi momentum. This is
characteristic of the Bogoliubov dispersion in the superconducting state. We
also observe that the superconducting and pseudogaps have the same d-wave form
with the same amplitude. Our observations provide direct evidence for preformed
Cooper pairs, implying that the pseudogap phase is a precursor to
superconductivity.
