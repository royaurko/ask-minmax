As location-based applications become ubiquitous in emerging wireless
networks, Location Verification Systems (LVS) are of growing importance. In
this paper we propose, for the first time, a rigorous information-theoretic
framework for an LVS. The theoretical framework we develop illustrates how the
threshold used in the detection of a spoofed location can be optimized in terms
of the mutual information between the input and output data of the LVS. In
order to verify the legitimacy of our analytical framework we have carried out
detailed numerical simulations. Our simulations mimic the practical scenario
where a system deployed using our framework must make a binary Yes/No
"malicious decision" to each snapshot of the signal strength values obtained by
base stations. The comparison between simulation and analysis shows excellent
agreement. Our optimized LVS framework provides a defence against location
spoofing attacks in emerging wireless networks such as those envisioned for
Intelligent Transport Systems, where verification of location information is of
paramount importance.
