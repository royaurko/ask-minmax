Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) in fluid flows appear as co-dimension
one ridges of the finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field. In three-
dimensions this means two-dimensional ridges. A fast algorithm is presented
here to locate and extract such ridge surfaces while avoiding unnecessary
computations away from the LCS. This algorithm reduces the order of the
computational complexity from O(1/dx^3) to about O(1/dx^2) by eliminating
computations over most of the three dimensional domain and computing the FTLE
only near the two-dimensional ridge surfaces. The algorithm is grid based and
proofs of error bounds for ridge locations are included. The algorithm
performance and error bounds are verified in several examples. The algorithm
offers significant advantages in computational cost as well as later data
analysis.
