The Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) facility at Fermilab began
operations in late 2004. NuMI will deliver an intense muon neutrino beam of
variable energy (2-20 GeV) directed into the Earth at 58 mrad for short (~1km)
and long (~700-900 km) baseline experiments. Several aspects of the design and
results from early commissioning runs are reviewed.
