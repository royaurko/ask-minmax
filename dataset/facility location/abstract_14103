We present the local HII region metallicity near the site of the recently
discovered multiply lensed supernova (SN; "SN Refsdal") at redshift 1.49. "SN
Refsdal" is located at the outer spiral arm ($\sim$7 kpc) of the lensed host
galaxy, which we have previously reported to exhibit a steep negative
galactocentric metallicity gradient. Based on our updated near-infrared
integral field spectroscopic data, the gas-phase metallicity averaged in an
intrinsic radius of $\sim$ 550 pc surrounding an HII region $\sim$ 200 pc away
from the SN site is 12 + log(O/H)$_{\rm PP04N2}$ $\le$ 8.67. The metallicity
averaged over nine HII regions at similar galactocentric distances ($\sim$5-7
kpc) as "SN Refsdal" is constrained to be 12 + log(O/H)$_{\rm PP04N2}$ $\le$
8.11. Given the fortuitous discovery of "SN Refsdal" in an advantageously
lensed face-on spiral, this is the first observational constraint on the local
metallicity environment of an SN site at redshift $z>1$.
