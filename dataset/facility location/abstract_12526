The center of the Milky Way galaxy (MW) is an extreme environment which
contains a massive black hole surrounded by a very dense star cluster, two
other adjacent star clusters, and a giant molecular cloud which would serve as
an incubator to a new generation of stars. The gas and dust in its vicinity are
denser by 2-3 orders of magnitude than in other locations in the MW. This is
also the case with the magnetic field. The kinematics of the gas is
characterized by apparently random, supersonic flows. In this paper we provide
observational evidence for the existence of a supersonic turbulence, most
likely generated by the shock waves. Moreover, the mere existence of turbulence
and its characteristics are shown to be instrumental in testing the validity
and consistency of theoretical modeling of the spectra of the gas filaments.
