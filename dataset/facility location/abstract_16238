We solve a non-equilibrium statistical mechanics problem exactly, namely, the
single-file dynamics of N hard-core interacting particles (the particles cannot
pass each other) of size \Delta diffusing in a one dimensional system of finite
length L with reflecting boundaries at the ends. We obtain an exact expression
for the conditional probability density function P_T(y_T,t|y_{T,0}) that a
tagged particle T (T=1,...,N) is at position y_T at time t given that it at
time t=0 was at position y_{T,0}. Going beyond previous studies, we consider
the asymptotic limit of large N, maintaining L finite, using a non-standard
asymptotic technique. We derive an exact expression for P_T(y_T,t|y_{T,0}) for
a a tagged particle located roughly in the middle of the system, from which we
find that there are three time regimes of interest for finite-sized systems:
(A) For times much smaller than the collision time t<< t_coll=1/(\rho^2D),
where \rho=N/L is the particle concentration and D the diffusion constant for
each particle, the tagged particle undergoes normal diffusion; (B) for times
much larger than the collision time t>> t_coll but times smaller than the
equilibrium time t<< t_eq=L^2/D we find a single-file regime where
P_T(y_T,t|y_{T,0}) is a Gaussian with a mean square displacement scaling as
t^{1/2}; (C) For times longer than the equilibrium time $t>> t_eq,
P_T(y_T,t|y_{T,0}) approaches a polynomial-type equilibrium probability density
function.
