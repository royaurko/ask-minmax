In this technical report we present a database schema used to store Wikipedia
so it can be easily used in query-intensive applications. In addition to
storing the information in a way that makes it highly accessible, our schema
enables users to easily formulate complex queries using information such as the
anchor-text of links and their location in the page, the titles and number of
redirect pages for each page and the paragraph structure of entity pages. We
have successfully used the schema in domains such as recommender systems,
information retrieval and sentiment analysis. In order to assist other
researchers, we now make the schema and its content available online.
