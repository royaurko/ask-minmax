We propose a Finsler spacetime scenario of the anisotropic universe. The
Finslerian universe requires both the fine-structure constant and accelerating
cosmic expansion have dipole structure, and the directions of these two dipoles
are the same. Our numerical results show that the dipole direction of SnIa
Hubble diagram locates at
$(l,b)=(314.6^\circ\pm20.3^\circ,-11.5^\circ\pm12.1^\circ)$ with magnitude
$B=(-3.60\pm1.66)\times10^{-2}$. And the dipole direction of the fine-structure
constant locates at $(l,b)=(333.2^\circ\pm8.8^\circ,-12.7^\circ\pm6.3^\circ)$
with magnitude $B=(0.97\pm0.21)\times10^{-5}$. The angular separation between
the two dipole directions is about $18.2^\circ$.
