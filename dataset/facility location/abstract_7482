We propose a finite elements algorithm to solve a fourth order partial
differential equation governing the propagation of time-harmonic bending waves
in thin elastic plates. Specially designed perfectly matched layers are
implemented to deal with the infinite extent of the plates. These are deduced
from a geometric transform in the biharmonic equation. To numerically
illustrate the power of elastodynamic transformations, we analyse the elastic
response of an elliptic invisibility cloak surrounding a clamped obstacle in
the presence of a cylindrical excitation i.e. a concentrated point force.
Elliptic cloaking for flexural waves involves a density and an orthotropic
Young's modulus which depend on the radial and azimuthal positions, as deduced
from a coordinates transformation for circular cloaks in the spirit of Pendry
et al. [Science {\bf 312}, 1780 (2006)], but with a further stretch of a
coordinate axis. We find that a wave radiated by a concentrated point force
located a couple of wavelengths away from the cloak is almost unperturbed in
magnitude and in phase. However, when the point force lies within the coating,
it seems to radiate from a shifted location. Finally, we emphasize the
versatility of transformation elastodynamics with the design of an elliptic
cloak which rotates the polarization of a flexural wave within its core.
