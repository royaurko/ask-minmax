The astrophysical S-factor of 14N(p,gamma)15O has been measured for effective
center-of-mass energies between E_eff = 119 and 367 keV at the LUNA facility
using TiN solid targets and Ge detectors. The data are in good agreement with
previous and recent work at overlapping energies. R-matrix analysis reveals
that due to the complex level structure of 15O the extrapolated S(0) value is
model dependent and calls for additional experimental efforts to reduce the
present uncertainty in S(0) to a level of a few percent as required by
astrophysical calculations.
