Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the positional dependence
of trace elements such as O and Cu on the crystal field parameter $A_2^0$,
proportional to the anisotropy constant $K_u$ of Nd ions placed at the surface
of Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B grains. The results suggest the possibility that the
$A_2^0$ parameter of Nd ions at the (001) surface of Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B grains
exhibits a negative value when the O or Cu atom is located near the surface,
closer than its equilibrium position. At the (110) surface, however, O atoms
located at the equilibrium position provide a negative $A_2^0$, while for Cu
additions $A_2^0$ remains positive regardless of Cu's position. Thus, Cu atoms
are expected to maintain a positive local $K_u$ of surface Nd ions more
frequently than O atoms when they approach the grain surfaces in the Nd-Fe-B
grains.
