The system has come to light through the way of inspiration to develop a
compact system, based on the fundamental ideas of safety, security and control.
Once this system is installed to operation specifying temperature and smoke
threshold, in case of any emergency situation due to increasing temperature
and/or smoke at place surpassing the threshold, the system immediately sends
automatic alert-notifications to the users, concerned with the situations. The
user gets total control over the system through mobile SMS, even from the
distant location, that to change the threshold, turn on/off the feature of
sending 'alert notification' and also to reset the system after the emergency
situation is overcome. Before executing any command (through SMS) from the
user, the system asks for the preset password to verify an contributorized user. The
security issues have been considered with utter attention in this system to
ensure its applicability in industries and business organizations, where
security is an important concern. Hence, the fundamental ideas of safety,
security and control have been entirely ensured through the system, which have
definitely worked as the gear moving factor to look for a new dimension of an
'Intelligent Fire Alert System'.
