The upper limit of the total cross section for quasi-free pn -> pn eta-prime
reaction has been determined in the excess energy range near the kinematic
threshold. The measurement has been carried out at the COSY-11 detection setup
using a proton beam and a deuteron cluster target. The identification of the
eta-prime meson has been performed using the missing mass technique. The energy
dependence of the upper limit of the cross section is extracted with a fixed
proton beam momentum of p_beam}=3.35GeV/c and exploiting the Fermi momenta of
nucleons inside the deuteron. The data cover a range of centre-of-mass excess
energies from 0 to 24 MeV. The experimentally determined upper limit of the
ratio R(eta-prime)=sigma(pn -> pn eta-prime) sigma(pp -> pp eta-prime), which
is smaller than the ratio for the eta meson, excludes the excitation of the
S_11(1535) resonance as a dominant production mechanism of the eta-prime meson
in nucleon-nucleon collisions. At the same time, the determined upper limits of
R(eta-prime) go in the direction of what one would expect in the glue
production and production via mesonic currents. For quantitative tests of these
mechanisms an order of magnitude larger statistics and a larger energy range
would be required. This can be reached with the WASA-at-COSY facility.
