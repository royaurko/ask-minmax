We report the first detailed comparisons of the rates and spectra of
neutral-current neutrino interactions at two widely separated locations. A
depletion in the rate at the far site would indicate mixing between muon
neutirnos and a sterile particle. No anomalous depletion in the reconstructed
energy spectrum is observed. Assuming oscillations occur at a single
mass-squared splitting, a fit to the neutral- and charged-current energy
spectra limits the fraction of muon neutrino oscillating to a sterile neutrino
to be below 0.68 at 90% confidence level. A less stringent limit due to a
possible contribution to the measured neutral-current event rate at the far
site from electron neutrino appearance at the current experimental limit is
also presented.
