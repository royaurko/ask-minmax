In a multi-electrode device, the motion of free charge carriers generated by
ionizing radiation induces currents on all the electrodes surrounding the
active region [1]. The amount of charge induced in each sensitive electrode is
a function of the device geometry, the transport parameters and the generation
profile. Hence this charge sharing effect allows the signal from each sensitive
electrode to provide information about the electrical characteristics of the
device, as well as information on the location and the profile of each
ionization track. The effectiveness of such approach was recently demonstrated
in Ion Beam Induced Charge (IBIC) experiments carried out using a 2 MeV He
microbeam scanning over a sub-100 lm scale silicon device, where the ion strike
location point was evaluated through a comparative analysis of the charge
induced in two independent surface electrodes coupled to independent data
acquisition systems [2]. In this report, we show that the Monte Carlo method
[3] can be efficiently exploited to simulate this IBIC experiment and to model
the experimental data, shedding light on the role played by carrier diffusion,
electronic noise and ion beam spot size on the induction of charge in the
sensitive electrodes. Moreover, the Monte Carlo method shows that information
on the ion strike position can be obtained from the charge signals from the
sensitive electrodes.
