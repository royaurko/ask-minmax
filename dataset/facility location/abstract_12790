Although geometrical frustration transcends scale, it has primarily been
evoked in the micro and mesoscopic realm to characterize such phases as
spin-ice liquids and glasses and to explain the behavior of such materials as
multiferroics, high temperature superconductors, colloids and copolymers. Here
we introduce a system of macroscopic ferromagnetic rotors arranged in a planar
lattice capable of out-of-plane movement that exhibit the characteristic
honeycomb spin ice rules studied and seen so far only in its mesoscopic
manifestation. We find that a polarized initial state of this system settles
into the honeycomb spin ice phase with relaxation on multiple time scales. We
explain this relaxation process using a minimal classical mechanical model
which includes Coulombic interactions between magnetic charges located at the
ends of the magnets and viscous dissipation at the hinges. Our study shows how
macroscopic frustration arises in a purely classical setting that is amenable
to experiment, easy manipulation, theory and computation, and shows phenomena
that are not visible in their microscopic counterparts.
