Region filling is one of the most important and fundamental operations in
computer graphics and image processing. Many filling algorithms and their
implementations are based on the Euclidean geometry, which are then translated
into computational models moving carelessly from the continuous to the finite
discrete space of the computer. The consequences of this approach is that most
implementations fail when tested for challenging degenerate and nearly
degenerate regions. We present a correct integer-only procedure that works for
all connected digital pictures. It finds all possible interior points, which
are then displayed and stored in a locating matrix. Namely, we present a
filling and locating procedure that can be used in computer graphics and image
processing applications.
