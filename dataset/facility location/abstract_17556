Observations of circumbinary planets orbiting very close to the central stars
have shown that planet formation may occur in a very hostile environment, where
the gravitational pull from the binary should be very strong on the primordial
protoplanetary disk. Elevated impact velocities and orbit crossings from
eccentricity oscillations are the primary contributors towards high energy,
potentially destructive collisions that inhibit the growth of aspiring planets.
In this work, we conduct high resolution, inter-particle gravity enabled N-body
simulations to investigate the feasibility of planetesimal growth in the
Kepler-34 system. We improve upon previous work by including planetesimal disk
self-gravity and an extensive collision model to accurately handle
inter-planetesimal interactions. We find that super-catastrophic erosion events
are the dominant mechanism up to and including the orbital radius of
Kepler-34(AB)b, making in-situ growth unlikely. It is more plausible that
Kepler-34(AB)b migrated from a region beyond 1.5 AU. Based on the conclusions
that we have made for Kepler-34 it seems likely that all of the currently known
circumbinary planets have also migrated significantly from their formation
location with the possible exception of Kepler-47(AB)c.
