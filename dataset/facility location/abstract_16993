SN 2010jl was an extremely bright, Type IIn SNe which showed a significant IR
excess no later than 90 days after explosion. We have obtained Spitzer 3.6 and
4.5 \mum and JHK observations of SN 2010jl \sim90 days post explosion. Little
to no reddening in the host galaxy indicated that the circumstellar material
lost from the progenitor must lie in a torus inclined out of the plane of the
sky. The likely cause of the high mid-IR flux is the reprocessing of the
initial flash of the SN by pre-existing circumstellar dust. Using a 3D Monte
Carlo Radiative Transfer code, we have estimated that between 0.03-0.35 Msun of
dust exists in a circumstellar torus around the SN located 6 \times 10 ^17 cm
away from the SN and inclined between 60-80\cdot to the plane of the sky. On
day 90, we are only seeing the illumination of approximately 5% of this torus,
and expect to see an elevated IR flux from this material up until day \sim 450.
It is likely this dust was created in an LBV-like mass loss event of more than
3 Msun, which is large but consistent with other LBV progenitors such as {\eta}
Carinae.
