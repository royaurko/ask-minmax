We present new mid-infrared and submillimetre observations for a sample of
eight high redshift type-2 QSOs located in the Chandra Deep Field South. The
sources are X-ray absorbed with luminosities in excess of 10^44 erg/s. Two of
the targets have robust detections, S/N > 4, while a further three targets are
marginally detected with S/N > =2.5. All sources are detected in multiple
mid-infrared bands with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The multiwavelength
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the type-2 QSOs are compared to those
of two local ultraluminous galaxies (Arp220 and IR22491) in order to assess
contributions from a star-forming component in various parts of the SED. We
suggest that their submillimetre emission is possibly due to a starburst while
a large fraction of the mid-infrared energy is likely to originate in the
obscured central quasar. Using the mid-infrared and submm observations we
derive infrared luminosities which are found to be in excess of L>10^12Lsun.
The submillimetre (850micron) to X-ray (2 keV) spectral indices (alpha_SX) span
a wide range. About half of the type-2 QSOs have values typical for a
Compton-thick AGN with only 1 per cent of the nuclear emission seen through
scattering and, the remaining with values typical of submm-bright galaxies.
Combining the available observational evidence we outline a possible scenario
for the early stages of evolution of these sources.
