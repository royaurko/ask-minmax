Infrared spectroscopy and photometry have revealed the remarkable evolution
of Sakurai's Object from 1996 to the present. A cooling, carbon-rich
photospheric spectrum was observable from 1996 to 1998. Considerable changes
occured in 1998 as the continuum reddened due to absorption and emission by
newly formed dust located outside the photosphere. In addition, a strong and
broad helium 1.083 $\mu$m P Cygni line developed, signifying the acceleration
of an outer envelope of material to speeds as high as 1000 km s$^{-1}$. At the
same time the photosphere of the central star remained quiescent. By 1999 the
photosphere was virtually completely obscured by the dust and the helium
emission line was the only detectable spectral feature remaining in the 1-5
$\mu$m band. In 2000 emission by dust has become even more dominant, as the
envelope continues to expand and cool and the helium line weakens.
