It is generally assumed by most of the small-angle neutron scattering (SANS)
user community that a neutrons energy is unchanged during SANS measurements.
Here, the scattering from water, specifically light water, was measured on the
EQ-SANS instrument, a time-of-flight SANS instrument located at the Spallation
Neutron Source of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. A significant inelastic
process was observed in the TOF spectra of neutrons scattered from water.
Analysis of the TOF spectra from the sample showed that the scattered neutrons
have energies consistent with room-temperature thermal energies (~20 meV)
regardless of the incident neutron energy. With the aid of Monte Carlo particle
transport simulations, we conclude that the thermalization process within the
sample results in faster neutrons that arrive at the detector earlier than
expected based on the incident neutron energies. This thermalization process
impacts the measured SANS intensities in a manner that will ultimately be
sample- and temperature-dependent, necessitating careful processing of the raw
data into the SANS cross-section.
