We present the 1SXPS (Swift-XRT Point Source) catalog of 151,524 X-ray
point-sources detected by the Swift-XRT in 8 years of operation. The catalog
covers 1905 square degrees distributed approximately uniformly on the sky. We
analyze the data in two ways. First we consider all observations individually,
for which we have a typical sensitivity of ~3e-13 erg/cm2/s (0.3--10 keV). Then
we co-add all data covering the same location on the sky: these images have a
typical sensitivity of ~9e-14 erg/cm2/s (0.3--10 keV). Our sky coverage is
nearly 2.5 times that of 3XMM-DR4, although the catalog is a factor of ~1.5
less sensitive. The median position error is 5.5" (90% confidence), including
systematics. Our source detection method improves on that used in previous XRT
catalogs and we report >68,000 new X-ray sources. The goals and observing
strategy of the Swift satellite allow us to probe source variability on
multiple timescales, and we find ~30,000 variable objects in our catalog. For
every source we give positions, fluxes, time series (in four energy bands and
two hardness ratios), estimates of the spectral properties, spectra and
spectral fits for the brightest sources, and variability probabilities in
multiple energy bands and timescales.
