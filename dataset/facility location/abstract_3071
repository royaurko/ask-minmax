We analyze the far field resolution of apertures which are illuminated by a
point dipole located at subwavelength distances. It is well known that
radiation emitted by a localized source can be considered a combination of
travelling and evanescent waves, when represented by the angular spectrum
method. The evanescent wave part of the source can be converted to propagating
waves by diffraction at the aperture thereby it contributes to the far field
detection. Therefore one can expect an increase in the resolution of objects.
We present explicit calculations showing that the resolution at the far zone is
improved by decreasing the source-aperture distance. We also utilize the
resolution enhancement by the near field of a dipole to resolve two closely
located apertures. The results show that without the near field (evanescent
field) the apertures are not resolved whereas with the near field of the dipole
the far zone intensity distribution shows improved resolution. This method
eliminates the requirements of near-field techniques such as controlling and
scanning closely located tip detectors.
