We have compared the metallicity (represented by oxygen abundance), and the
dust-to-gas ratio, in a sample of dwarf galaxies. For dwarf irregulars (dIrrs)
we find a good correlation between the two quantities, with a power-law index
${0.54\pm 0.2}$. Blue Compact Dwarf (BCD) galaxies do not show such a good
correlation; in addition both the dust-to-gas ratio and the metallicity tend to
be higher than for dIrrs. We have then developed a simple but physical
analytical model for the above relation. Comparing the model results with the
data, we conclude that: (i) for low values of the dust-to-gas ratio, the
relation between the dust-to-gas ratio and the metallicity is quasi-linear,
whereas for higher values the curve strongly deviates from the linear behavior,
implying that the commonly used power-law approximation is very poor; (ii) the
deviation from the linear behavior depends critically on the parameter $\chi$,
the ``differential'' mass outflow rate from the galaxy in units of the star
formation rate (SFR); (iii) the shape of the curve representing the relation
between the dust-to-gas ratio and the metallicity does not depend on the SFR,
but only on $\chi$; however, the specific location of a given galaxy on the
curve does depend on $\psi$; (iv) the BCD metallicity segregation is due to a
higher $\psi$, together with a significant differential mass outflow. Thus, the
lack of correlation can be produced by largely different star formation rates
and values of $\chi$ in these objects.
