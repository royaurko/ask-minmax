This work is focused on the understanding of charging and discharging
processes in silicon nanocrystal flash memories during program and erase
operations through time-dependent numerical simulations. Time dependent
simulations of the program and erase operations are based on a description of
the nanocrystal memory dynamics in terms of a master equation. The related
transition rates are computed with a one dimensional Poisson-Schroedinger
solver which allows the computation of the tunnelling currents and of
generation and recombination rates between the outer reservoir and localized
states in the dielectric layer. Comparison between simulations and experiments
available in the literature provides useful insights of the storing mechanisms.
In particular, simulations allow us to rule out that electrons are stored in
confined states in the conduction band of silicon nanocrystals, whereas they
suggest that electrons are actually trapped in localized states in the silicon
gap at an energy close to the silicon valence band edge, and located at the
interface between the nanocrystals and the surrounding silicon oxide.
