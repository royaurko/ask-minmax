We compute the locations of satellite galaxies with respect to their hosts
using the Lambda-CDM GIF simulation. If the major axes of the hosts' images are
perfectly aligned with the major axes of their projected mass, the satellites
are located preferentially close to the hosts' major axes. In this case, the
degree of anisotropy in the satellite locations is a good tracer of the
flattening of the hosts' halos. If all hosts have luminous circular disks, the
symmetry axes of the projected mass and light are not perfectly aligned, and
the locations of the satellites depend upon how the hosts' disks are placed
within their halos. If the disk angular momentum vectors are aligned with the
major axes of the halos, the satellites show a pronounced "Holmberg effect". If
the disk angular momentum vectors are aligned with the intermediate axes of the
local large scale structure, the distribution of satellite locations is
essentially isotropic. If the disk angular momentum vectors are aligned with
either the minor axes or with the net angular momentum vectors of the halos,
the satellites are distributed anisotropically about their hosts, with a
preference for being found nearby the hosts' major axes. This agrees well with
the observation that satellite galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey tend to
be found nearby the major axes of their hosts, and suggests that the mass and
light of SDSS host galaxies must be fairly well aligned in projection on the
sky.
