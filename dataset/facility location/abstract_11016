The Liquid Xenon Gamma-Ray Imaging Telescope (LXeGRIT) is the first
realization of a liquid xenon time projection chamber for Compton imaging of
MeV gamma-ray sources in astrophysics. By measuring the energy deposit and the
three spatial coordinates of individual gamma-ray scattering points, the
location of the source in the sky is inferred with Compton kinematics
reconstruction. The angular resolution is determined by the detector's energy
and spatial resolutions, as well as by the separation in space between the
first and second scattering. The imaging response of LXeGRIT was established
with gamma-rays from radioactive sources, during calibration and integration at
the Columbia Astrophysics Laboratory, prior to the 2000 balloon flight mission.
In this paper we describe in detail the various steps involved in imaging
sources with LXeGRIT and present experimental results on angular resolution and
other parameters which characterize its performance as a Compton telescope.
