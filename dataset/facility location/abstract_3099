This paper proposes a control algorithm for a UAV to circumnavigate an
unknown target at a fixed radius when the location information of the UAV is
unavailable. By assuming that the UAV has a constant velocity, the control
algorithm makes adjustments to the heading angle of the UAV based on range and
range rate measurements from the target, which may be corrupted by additive
measurement noise. The control algorithm has the added benefit of being
globally smooth and bounded. Exploiting the relationship between range rate and
bearing angle, we transform the system dynamics from Cartesian coordinate in
terms of location and heading to polar coordinate in terms of range and bearing
angle. We then formulate the addition of measurement errors as a stochastic
differential equation. A recurrence result is established showing that the UAV
will reach a neighborhood of the desired orbit in finite time. Some statistical
measures of performance are obtained to support the technical analysis.
