We investigate both analytically and numerically the renormalization group
equations in 2D Z(N) vector models. The position of the critical points of the
two phase transitions for N>4 is established and the critical index \nu\ is
computed. For N=7, 17 the critical points are located by Monte Carlo
simulations and some of the corresponding critical indices are determined. The
behavior of the helicity modulus is studied for N=5, 7, 17. Using these and
other available Monte Carlo data we discuss the scaling of the critical points
with N and some other open theoretical problems.
