A class of numerical methods to determine Pollicott-Ruelle resonances in
chaotic dynamical systems is proposed. This is achieved by relating some
existing procedures which make use of Pade approximants and interpolating
exponentials to both the memory function techniques used in the theory of
relaxation and the filter diagonalization method used in the harmonic inversion
of time correlation functions. This relationship leads to a theoretical
framework in which all these methods become equivalent and which allows for new
and improved numerical schemes.
