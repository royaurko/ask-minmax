Spectrophotometric observations of H-alpha and He I 6678 emission lines of
the nova-like Cataclysmic Variable V3885 Sgr are presented and analyzed. The
binary orbital period was determined as P = 0.20716071(22) days. Doppler
Tomography was performed with both H-alpha and He I lines. Disc radial
emissivity profiles were also computed. The tomography mapping of flickering
sources was performed using the H-alpha line, from which we concluded that the
flickering is not uniformly distributed on the disc. The observed tomogram of
the flickering was compared with simulations, suggesting that the most intense
flickering source in the H-alpha is not located in the accretion disc. It is
proposed that the main line flickering source may be associated with the
illuminated secondary star.
