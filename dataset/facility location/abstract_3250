We discuss MAXIPOL, a bolometric balloon-borne experiment designed to measure
the E-mode polarization anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation
(CMB) on angular scales of 10 arcmin to 2 degrees. MAXIPOL is the first CMB
experiment to collect data with a polarimeter that utilizes a rotating
half-wave plate and fixed wire-grid polarizer. We present the instrument
design, elaborate on the polarimeter strategy and show the instrument
performance during flight with some time domain data. Our primary data set was
collected during a 26 hour turnaround flight that was launched from the
National Scientific Ballooning Facility in Ft. Sumner, New Mexico in May 2003.
During this flight five regions of the sky were mapped. Data analysis is in
progress.
