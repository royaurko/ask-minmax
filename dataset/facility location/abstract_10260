The presence of several clone solutions in the simultaneous measurement of
($\theta_{13},\delta$) has been widely discussed in literature. Here, after a
pedagogical introduction on why these clones arise, we discuss how the clones
location in the ($\theta_{13},\delta$) plane change as a function of the
physical input pair ($\bar\theta_{13},\bar\delta$). We compare the clone flow
of a set of possible future neutrino experiments: the CERN SuperBeam, BetaBeam
and Neutrino Factory proposals. We show that the combination of these specific
BetaBeam and SuperBeam could not help in solving the degeneracies. The
combination of one of them with the Neutrino Factory Golden and Silver channel
can, instead, be used to solve completely the eightfold degeneracy.
