We present a symbolic-execution-based algorithm that for a given program and
a given program location produces a nontrivial necessary condition on input
values to drive the program execution to the given location. We also propose an
application of necessary conditions in contemporary bug-finding and
test-generation tools. Experimental results show that the presented technique
can significantly improve performance of the tools.
