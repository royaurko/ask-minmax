The gas circulation loop LOOPINO has been set up and commissioned at Tritium
Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK) to perform Raman measurements of circulating tritium
mixtures under conditions similar to the inner loop system of the neutrino-mass
experiment KATRIN, which is currently under construction. A custom-made
interface is used to connect the tritium containing measurement cell, located
inside a glove box, with the Raman setup standing on the outside. A tritium
sample (purity > 95%, 20 kPa total pressure) was circulated in LOOPINO for more
than three weeks with a total throughput of 770 g of tritium. Compositional
changes in the sample and the formation of tritiated and deuterated methanes
CT_(4-n)X_n (X=H,D; n=0,1) were observed. Both effects are caused by hydrogen
isotope exchange reactions and gas-wall interactions, due to tritium {\beta}
decay. A precision of 0.1% was achieved for the monitoring of the T_2
Q_1-branch, which fulfills the requirements for the KATRIN experiment and
demonstrates the feasibility of high-precision Raman measurements with tritium
inside a glove box.
