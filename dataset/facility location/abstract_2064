We present the preliminary results of the study of an interesting target in
the first CoRoT exo-planet field (IRa1): CoRoT 102918586. Its light curve
presents additional variability on the top of the eclipses, whose pattern
suggests multi- frequency pulsations. The high accuracy CoRoT light curve was
analyzed by applying an iterative scheme, devised to disentangle the effect of
eclipses from the oscillatory pattern. In addition to the CoRoT photometry we
obtained low resolution spectroscopy with the AAOmega multi-fiber facility at
the Anglo Australian Observatory, which yielded a spectral classification as F0
V and allowed us to infer a value of the primary star effective temperature.
The Fourier analysis of the residuals, after subtraction of the binary light
curve, gave 35 clear frequencies. The highest amplitude frequency, of 1.22 c/d,
is in the expected range for both \gamma Dor and SPB pulsators, but the
spectral classification favors the first hypothesis. Apart from a few multiples
of the orbital period, most frequencies can be interpreted as rotational
splitting of the main frequency (an l = 2 mode) and of its overtones.
