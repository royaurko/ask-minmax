Recent observations show that small, young, stellar groupings of ~10 to 40
members tend of have a centrally-located most massive member, reminiscent of
mass segregation seen in large clustered systems. Here, we analyze hydrodynamic
simulations which form small clusters and analyze their properties in a manner
identical to the observations. We find that the simulated clusters possess
similar properties to the observed clusters, including a tendency to exhibit
mass segregation. In the simulations, the central location of the most massive
member is not due to dynamical evolution, since there is little interaction
between the cluster members. Instead, the most massive cluster member appears
to form at the center. We also find that the more massive stars in the cluster
form at slightly earlier times.
