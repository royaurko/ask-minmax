This document gives an overview of a Grid testbed architecture proposal for
the NorduGrid project. The aim of the project is to establish an inter-Nordic
testbed facility for implementation of wide area computing and data handling.
The architecture is supposed to define a Grid system suitable for solving data
intensive problems at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. We present the various
architecture components needed for such a system. After that we go on to give a
description of the dynamics by showing the task flow.
