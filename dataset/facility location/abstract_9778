Levy flights were introduced through the mathematical research of the algebra
or random variables with infinite moments. Mandelbrot recognized that the Levy
flight prescription had a deep connection to scale-invariant fractal random
walk trajectories. The theory of Continuous Time Random Walks (CTRW) can be
described in terms of Levy distribution functions and it can be used to explain
some earthquake characteristics like the distribution of waiting times and
hypocenter locations in a seismic region. This paper checks the validity of
this assumption analyzing three seismic series localized in South Spain. The
three seismic series (Alboran, Antequera and Loja) show qualitatively the same
behavior, although there are quantitative differences between them.
