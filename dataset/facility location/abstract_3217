We have used the ATNF Mopra antenna and the SEST antenna to search in the
directions of several class II methanol maser sources for emission from six
methanol transitions in the frequency range 85-115 GHz. The transitions were
selected from excitation studies as potential maser candidates. Methanol
emission at one or more frequencies was detected from five of the maser
sources, as well as from Orion KL. Although the lines are weak, we find
evidence of maser origin for three new lines in G345.01+1.79, and possibly one
new line in G9.62+0.20.
  The observations, together with published maser observations at other
frequencies, are compared with methanol maser modelling for G345.01+1.79 and
NGC6334F. We find that the majority of observations in both sources are
consistent with a warm dust (175 K) pumping model at hydrogen density ~10^6
cm^-3 and methanol column density ~5 x 10^17 cm^-2. The substantial differences
between the maser spectra in the two sources can be attributed to the geometry
of the maser region.
