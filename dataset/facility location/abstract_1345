Understanding the patterns of mobility of individuals is crucial for a number
of reasons, from city planning to disaster management. There are two common
ways of quantifying the amount of travel between locations: by direct
observations that often involve privacy issues, e.g., tracking mobile phone
locations, or by estimations from models. Typically, such models build on
accurate knowledge of the population size at each location. However, when this
information is not readily available, their applicability is rather limited. As
mobile phones are ubiquitous, our aim is to investigate if mobility patterns
can be inferred from aggregated mobile phone call data alone. Using data
released by Orange for Ivory Coast, we show that human mobility is well
predicted by a simple model based on the frequency of mobile phone calls
between two locations and their geographical distance. We argue that the
strength of the model comes from directly incorporating the social dimension of
mobility. Furthermore, as only aggregated call data is required, the model
helps to avoid potential privacy problems.
