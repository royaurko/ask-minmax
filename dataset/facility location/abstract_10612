To discuss the salient role of the statistical memory effects in the human
brain functioning we have analyzed a set of stochastic memory quantifiers that
reflects the dynamical characteristics of neuromagnetic brain responses to a
flickering stimulus of different color combinations from a group of control
subjects which is contrasted with those from a patient with photosensitive
epilepsy (PSE). We have discovered the emergence of strong memory and the
accompanying transition to a regular and robust regime of chaotic behavior of
the signals in the separate areas for a patient with PSE. This finding most
likely identifies the regions of the location the protective mechanism in a
human organism against occurrence of PSE.
