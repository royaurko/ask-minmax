We present the first high resolution HeII 4686 images of the high excitation
nebula around the WR star Brey 2 in the LMC. This nebula presents a striking
morphology: a small arc-like feature some 3.6pc in radius is particularly
prominent in the HeII 4686 line. We further discover a previously unknown faint
HeII emission that extends over an area of 22*17 pc^2. An even fainter HeII
emission is apparently associated with the interstellar bubble blown by the
progenitor of Brey2. The total HeII flux corresponds to an ionizing flux of
4*10^{47} photons/s. Halpha, [OIII], and HeI 5876 images and long-slit spectra
are also examined in this letter, enabling us to investigate the detailed
physical properties at various locations of the nebula.
