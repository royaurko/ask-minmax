Here we present the discovery of a triple radio continuum source associated
with IRAS 16547-4247. The spectral indices of the three components are
consistent with a jet powered by a massive O-type star in the process of
formation, with the outer radio components being the shocked gas at the working
surfaces of the jet. The detected radio continuum emission from the central
object is thought to arise from the jet itself, prior to the formation of a
detectable HII region. All three radio continuum components are located within
a molecular core of mass 10^3 M_sun. Our discovery makes IRAS 16547-4247 the
most luminous (6.2 x 10^4 L_sun) young stellar object from which a thermal jet
emanates, suggesting that the mechanism that produces jets in low-mass star
formation also operates in high-mass star formation.
