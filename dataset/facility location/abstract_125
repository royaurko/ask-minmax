Magnetic skyrmions have been proposed for applications in future information
storage because of their small size, their stability, and their facile movement
with low current. For such purposes, the ability to create single skyrmions is
required, and an understanding of the process of skyrmion creation and decay is
highly desirable. Here we numerically show that the location and the moment of
skyrmion creation or annihilation can be precisely controlled by a nanosecond
unpolarized current pulse. To analyze the microscopic process, we employ a
lattice version of the topological charge. It provides a clear picture of spin
trajectories and orientations that locally trigger a topological transition,
and it reveals the topological origin of a skyrmion's stability at finite
temperatures. The robustness and experimental feasibility of the proposed
mechanism are numerically examined.
