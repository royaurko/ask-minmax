The discovery of the X-ray source IGR J17252-3616 by INTEGRAL was reported on
9 February 2004. Regular monitoring by INTEGRAL shows that IGR J17252-3616 is a
persistent hard X-ray source with an average count rate of 0.96 counts/s (~6.4
mCrab) in the 20-60 keV energy band. A follow-up observation with XMM-Newton,
which was performed on 21 March 21 2004, showed that the source is located at
R.A.(2000.0)=17h25m11.4 and Dec.=-36degr16'58.6" with an uncertainty of 4". The
only infra-red counterpart to be found within the XMM-Newton error circle was
2MASS J17251139-3616575, which has a Ks-band magnitude of 10.7 and is located
1" away from the XMM-Newton position.
  The analysis of the combined INTEGRAL and XMM-Newton observations shows that
the source is a binary X-ray pulsar with a spin period of 413.7 s and an
orbital period of 9.72 days. The spectrum can be fitted with a flat power law
plus an energy cut off (Gamma~0.02,Ecut~8.2 keV) or a Comptonized model
(kTe~5.5 keV, tau~7.8). The spectrum also indicates a large hydrogen column
density of Nh~15x1e22 atoms/cm-2 suggesting an intrinsic absorption. The Fe
Kalpha line at 6.4 keV is clearly detected. Phase-resolved spectroscopy does
not show any variation in the continuum except the total emitted flux. The
absorption is constant along the pulse phase. This source can be associated
with EXO 1722-363 as both systems show common timing and spectral features. The
observations suggest that the source is a wind-fed accreting pulsar accompanied
by a supergiant star.
