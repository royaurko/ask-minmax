The partner mode with respect to a vacuum state for a given mode (like that
corresponding to one of the thermal particles emitted by a black hole) is
defined and calculated. The partner modes are explicitly calculated for a
number of cases, in particular for the modes corresponding to a particle
detector being excited by turn-on/turn-off transients, or with the thermal
particles emitted by the accelerated mirror model for black hole evaporation.
One of the key results is that the partner mode in general is just a vacuum
fluctuation, and one can have the partner mode be located in a region where the
state cannot be distinguished from the vacuum state by any series of local
measurements, including the energy density. I.e., "information" (the
correlations with the thermal emissions) need not be associated with any energy
transport. The idea that black holes emit huge amounts of energy in their last
stages because of all the information which must be emitted under the
assumption of black-hole unitarity is found not necessarily to be the case.
