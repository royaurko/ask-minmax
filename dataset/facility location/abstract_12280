We analyze the masses and spatial distributions of fourteen young stellar
groups in Taurus, Lupus3, ChaI, and IC348. These nearby groups, which typically
contain 20 to 40 members, have membership catalogs complete to ~0.02 M_sun, and
are sufficiently young that their locations should be similar to where they
formed. These groups show five properties seen in clusters having many more
stars and much greater surface density of stars: (1) a broad range of masses,
(2) a concentration of the most massive star towards the centre of the group,
(3) an association of the most massive star with a high surface density of
lower-mass stars, (4) a correlation of the mass of the most massive star with
the total mass of the group, and (5) the distribution of a large fraction of
the mass in a small fraction of the stars.
