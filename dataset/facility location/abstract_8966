We have carried out further analysis of the tentative, short-term
brightenings reported by Sahu et al. (2001), which were suggested to be
possible lensings of Galactic-bulge stars by free-floating planets in the
globular cluster M22. Closer examination shows that--unlikely as it may
seem--small, point-like cosmic rays had hit very close to the same star in both
of a pair of cosmic-ray-split images, which cause the apparent brightenings of
stars at the times and locations reported. We show that the observed number of
double hits is consistent with the frequency of cosmic rays in WFPC2 images,
given the number of stars and epochs observed. Finally, we point to ways in
which cosmic rays can be more directly distinguished.
