An important issue in the study of cities is defining a metropolitan area, as
different definitions affect the statistical distribution of urban activity. A
commonly employed method of defining a metropolitan area is the Metropolitan
Statistical Areas (MSA), based on rules attempting to capture the notion of
city as a functional economic region, and is constructed using experience. The
MSA is time-consuming and is typically constructed only for a subset (few
hundreds) of the most highly populated cities. Here, we introduce a new method
to designate metropolitan areas, denoted the "City Clustering Algorithm" (CCA).
The CCA is based on spatial distributions of the population at a fine
geographic scale, defining a city beyond the scope of its administrative
boundaries. We use the CCA to examine Gibrat's law of proportional growth,
postulating that the mean and standard deviation of the growth rate of cities
are constant, independent of city size. We find that the mean growth rate of a
cluster utilizing the CCA exhibits deviations from Gibrat's law, and that the
standard deviation decreases as a power-law with respect to the city size. The
CCA allows for the study of the underlying process leading to these deviations,
shown to arise from the existence of long-range spatial correlations in the
population growth. These results have socio-political implications, such as
those pertaining to the location of new economic development in cities of
varied size.
