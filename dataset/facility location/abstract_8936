We present a systematic and homogeneous analysis of population gradients for
the Local Group dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) Carina, Sculptor, Sextans, Tucana,
Andromeda I-III, V, and VI. For all of the Milky Way companions studied here we
find significant population gradients. The same is true for the remote dSph
Tucana located at the outskirts of the LG. Among the M 31 dSph companions only
Andromeda I and VI show obvious gradients. In all cases where a HB morphology
gradient is visible, the red HB stars are more centrally concentrated. The
occurence of a HB morphological gradient shows a correlation with a morphology
gradient in the red giant branch. It seems likely that metallicity is the
driver of the gradients in Sextans, Sculptor, Tucana, and Andromeda VI, while
age is an important factor in Carina. We find no evidence that the vicinity of
a nearby massive spiral galaxy influences the formation of the population
gradients.
