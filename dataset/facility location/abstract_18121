On Thursday, September 1, 1859, the British astronomer Richard Carrington,
for the first time ever, observes a spectacular gleam of visible light on the
surface of the solar disk, the photosphere. The Carrington Event, as it is
nowadays known by scientists, occurred because of the high solar activity that
had visible consequences on Earth, in particular reports of outstanding aurorae
activity that amazed thousands of people in the western hemisphere during the
dawn of September 2. The geomagnetic storm, generated by the solar-terrestrial
event, had such a magnitude that the auroral oval expanded towards the equator,
allowing low latitudes, like Panama's 9$^\circ$ N, to catch a sight of the
aurorae. An expedition was carried out to review several historical reports and
books from the northern cities of Colombia, allowing the identification of a
narrative from Monter\'ia, Colombia (8$^\circ$ 45' N), that describes phenomena
resembling those of an aurorae borealis, such as fire-like lights, blazing and
dazzling glares, and the appearance of an immense S-like shape in the sky. The
very low latitude of the geomagnetic north pole in 1859, the lowest value in
over half a millennia, is proposed to have allowed the observations of auroral
events at locations closer to the equator, and supports the historical
description found in Colombia. The finding of such chronicle represents one of
the most complete descriptions of low-latitude sightings of aurorae caused by
the Carrington Event.
