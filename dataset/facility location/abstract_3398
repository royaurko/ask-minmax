The production of the Lambda and Sigma0 hyperons has been measured via the
pp->pK+Lambda / Sigma0 reaction at the internal COSY-11 facility in the excess
energy range between 14 and 60 MeV. The transition of the Lambda/Sigma0 cross
section ratio from about 28 at Q<=13 MeV to the high energy level of about 2.5
is covered by the data showing a strong decrease of the ratio between 10 and 20
MeV excess energy.
  Effects from the final state interactions in the p-Sigma0 channel seem to be
much smaller compared to the p-Lambda one. Estimates of the effective range
parameters are given for the N-Lambda and the N-Sigma systems.
