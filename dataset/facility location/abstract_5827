A simple model of noninteracting electrons with a separable one-body
potential is used to discuss the possible pole structure of single particle
Green's functions for fermions on unphysical sheets in the complex frequency
plane as a function of the system parameters. The poles in the exact Green's
function can cross the imaginary axis, in contrast to recent claims that such a
behaviour is unphysical. As the Green's function of the model has the same
functional form as an approximate Green's function of coupled Luttinger liquids
no definite conclusions concerning the concept of "confined coherence" can be
drawn from the locations of the poles of this Green's function.
