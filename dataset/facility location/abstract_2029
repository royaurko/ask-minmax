This paper demonstrates the usefulness of pulsed laser ablation in liquids as
a fast screening synthesis method able to prepare even complex compositions at
the nanoscale. Nanoparticles of Y2O3:Eu3+, Lu2O2S: Eu3+, Gd2SiO5:Ce3+ and
Lu3TaO7:Gd3+,Tb3+ are successfully synthesized by pulsed laser ablation in
liquids. The phase and stoichiometries of the original materials are preserved
while the sizes are reduced down to 5-10 nm. The optical properties of the
materials are also preserved but show some small variations and some additional
structures which are attributed to the specificities of the nanoscale (internal
pressure, inhomogeneous broadening, surface states...)
