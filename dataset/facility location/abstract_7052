We study the regularization dependence on meson properties and the phase
diagram of quark matter by using the two flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. We
find that the meson properties and the phase structure do not show drastically
difference depending the regularization procedures. We also find that the
location or the existence of the critical end point highly depends on the
regularization methods and the model parameters. Then we think that
regularization and parameters are carefully considered when one investigates
the QCD critical end point in the effective model studies.
