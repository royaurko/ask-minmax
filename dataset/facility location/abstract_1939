In frames of effective Regge action the vertices describing conversion of two
reggeized gluons to one two and three ordinary gluons was constructed. The
self-consistency: Bose symmetry and gauge invariance properties checks was
shown to be fulfilled. The simplest one with creation of a single gluon was
intensively verified in programs of experimental and theoretical treatment
since it determine the kernel of of the known BFKL equation. Here we discuss
the possibility to check the vertex with creation of two real gluons, which can
reveal itself in process of scalar mesons production in high energy peripheral
nucleons collisions. We show that the mechanisms which include emission of two
gluons in the same effective vertex contribution dominate compared with one
with the creation of two separate gluons. Numerical estimations of cross
section of pair of charged pions production for LHC facility give the value or
order $10 mb$. As well we estimate the excess of production of positively
charged muons (as a decay of pions) created by cosmic ray proton collisions
with the atmosphere gas nuclei to be in a reasonable agreement with modern
data.
