Visible light communication (VLC) has become a promising research topic in
recent years, and finds its wide applications in indoor environments.
Particularly, for location based services (LBS), visible light also provides a
practical solution for indoor positioning. Multipath-induced dispersion is one
of the major concerns for complex indoor environments. It affects not only the
communication performance but also the positioning accuracy. In this paper, we
investigate the impact of multipath reflections on the positioning accuracy of
indoor VLC positioning systems. Combined Deterministic and Modified Monte Carlo
(CDMMC) approach is applied to estimate the channel impulse response
considering multipath reflections. Since the received signal strength (RSS)
information is used for the positioning algorithm, the power distribution from
one transmitter in a typical room configuration is first calculated. Then, the
positioning accuracy in terms of root mean square error is obtained and
analyzed.
