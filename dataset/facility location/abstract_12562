In the last few years Fermi and AGILE observations have indicated the
existence of a possible population of transient MeV-GeV sources located on the
Galactic plane and characterized by fast flares lasting only a very few days.
Notably, no blazar-like counterparts are known within their error boxes so they
could represent a completely new class of Galactic transient high energy
emitters. The task of identifying their counterparts at lower energies remains
very challenging. Despite this difficulty, INTEGRAL observations have provided
intriguing hints that reliable candidate counterparts for these unidentified
MeV-GeV transients could be found among the members of the recently discovered
class of Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). In this context, to date the
best test case is represented by the association between the two sources IGR
J17354-3255 and AGL J1734-3310. We will discuss their possible physical link
and implications stemming from this association.
