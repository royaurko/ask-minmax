We present a theoretical analysis of recent experiments on current-driven
vortex dynamics in the Corbino disk geometry. This geometry introduces
controlled spatial gradients in the driving force and allows the study of the
onset of plasticity and tearing in clean vortex lattices. We describe plastic
slip in terms of the stress-driven unbinding of dislocation pairs, which in
turn contribute to the relaxation of the shear, yielding a nonlinear response.
The steady state density of free dislocations induced by the applied stress is
calculated as a function of the applied current and temperature. A criterion
for the onset of plasticity at a radial location $r$ in the disk yields a
temperature-dependent critical current that is in qualitative agreement with
experiments.
