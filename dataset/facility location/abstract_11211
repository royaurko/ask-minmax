We consider the Efimov trimer theory as a possible framework to explain
recently observed losses by inelastic three-body collisions in a
three-hyperfine-component ultracold mixture of lithium 6. Within this
framework, these losses would arise chiefly from the existence of an Efimov
trimer bound state below the continuum of free triplets of atoms, and the loss
maxima (at certain values of an applied magnetic field) would correspond to
zero-energy resonances where the trimer dissociates into three free atoms. Our
results show that such a trimer state is indeed possible given the two-body
scattering lengths in the three-component lithium mixture, and gives rise to
two zero-energy resonances. The locations of these resonances appear to be
consistent with observed losses.
