Different from conventional electroactive polymers, here we firstly present a
new facile actuator made from aluminum alloy. The high-frequency electrically
induced flapping motion was characterized under varied physical factors. This
electroactuation results from alternative processes of charge induction and
discharge, which is confirmed by the existence of periodical pulse current in
the circuit. The metal actuator is of great stability and can maintain several
days if not for any structural fatigue. Easy fabrication, high tunable
frequency and durability make it potential for implementation of actuators for
sensors, microelectromechanical systems and robotics.
