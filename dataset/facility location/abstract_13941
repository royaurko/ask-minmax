After reviewing the importance of light as a probe for testing the structure
of space-time, we describe the GINGER project. GINGER will be a
three-dimensional array of large size ring-lasers able to measure the de Sitter
and Lense-Thirring effects. The instrument will be located at the underground
laboratory of GranSasso, in Italy. We describe the preliminary actions and
measurements already under way and present the full road map to GINGER. The
intermediate apparatuses GP2 and GINGERino are described. GINGER is expected to
be fully operating in few years.
