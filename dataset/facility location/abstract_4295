The paper addresses the issue of existence and confinement of electromagnetic
modes guided by linear defects in photonic crystals. Sufficient condition are
provided for existence of such waves near a given spectral location.
Confinement to the guide is achieved due to a photonic band gap in the bulk
dielectric medium.
