The behavior of metals at high pressure is of great importance to the fields
of shock physics, geophysics, astrophysics, and nuclear materials. In order to
further understand the properties of metals at high pressures we studied the
equation of state of aluminum using first-principles techniques up to 2500 GPa,
pressures within reach of the planned L.L.N.L. National Ignition Facility. Our
simulations use density-functional theory and density-functional perturbation
theory in the generalized gradient approximation at 0K. We found core overlaps
to become relevant beyond pressures of 1200 GPa. The equations of state for
three phases (fcc, bcc, and hcp) were calculated predicting the fcc-hcp,
fcc-bcc, and hcp-bcc transitions to occur at 215 GPa, 307 GPa, and 435 GPa
respectively. From the phonon dispersions at increasing pressure, we predict a
softening of the lowest transverse acoustic vibrational mode along the [110]
direction, which corresponds to a Born instability of the fcc phase at 725 GPa.
