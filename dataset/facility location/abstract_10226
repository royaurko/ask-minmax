We present high energy spectra and zenith-angle distributions of the
atmospheric muons computed for the depths of the locations of the underwater
neutrino telescopes. We compare the calculations with the data obtained in the
Baikal and the AMANDA muon experiments. The prompt muon contribution to the
muon flux underwater due to recent perturbative QCD-based models of the charm
production is expected to be observable at depths of the large underwater
neutrino telescopes. This appears to be probable even at rather shallow depths
(1-2 km), provided that the energy threshold for muon detection is raised above
$\sim 100$ TeV.
