By combining large-scale mosaics of ROSAT PSPC, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku X-ray
observations, we present evidence for large-scale motions in the intracluster
medium of the nearby, X-ray bright Perseus Cluster. These motions are suggested
by several alternating and interleaved X-ray bright, low-temperature,
low-entropy arcs located along the east-west axis, at radii ranging from ~10
kpc to over a Mpc. Thermodynamic features qualitatively similar to these have
previously been observed in the centers of cool core clusters, and were
successfully modeled as a consequence of the gas sloshing/swirling motions
induced by minor mergers. Our observations indicate that such sloshing/swirling
can extend out to larger radii than previously thought, on scales approaching
the virial radius.
