The interpretation of ferroelectric domain images obtained with piezoresponse
force microscopy (PFM) is discussed. The influences of an inherent experimental
background on the domain contrast in PFM images (enhancement, nulling,
inversion) as well as on the shape and the location of the domain boundaries
are described. We present experimental results to evidence our analysis of the
influence of the background on the domain contrast in PFM images.
