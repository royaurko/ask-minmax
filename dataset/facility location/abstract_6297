The dynamics of relativistically strong electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation
in hot electron-positron plasma is investigated. The possibility of finding
localized stationary structures of EM waves is explored. It is shown that under
certain conditions the EM wave forms a stable localized soliton-like structures
where plasma is completely expelled from the region of EM field location.
