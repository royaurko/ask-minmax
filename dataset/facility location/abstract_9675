In a semi-infinite geometry, a 1D, M-component model of biological evolution
realizes microscopically an inhomogeneous branching process for $M \to \infty$.
This implies in particular a size distribution exponent $\tau'=7/4$ for
avalanches starting at a free end of the evolutionary chain. A bulk--like
behavior with $\tau'=3/2$ is restored if `conservative' boundary conditions
strictly fix to its critical, bulk value the average number of species directly
involved in an evolutionary avalanche by the mutating species located at the
chain end. A two-site correlation function exponent ${\tau_R}'=4$ is also
calculated exactly in the `dissipative' case, when one of the points is at the
border. These results, together with accurate numerical determinations of the
time recurrence exponent $\tau_{first}'$, show also that, no matter whether
dissipation is present or not, boundary avalanches have the same space and time
fractal dimensions as in the bulk, and their distribution exponents obey the
basic scaling laws holding there.
