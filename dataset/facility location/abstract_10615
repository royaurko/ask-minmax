We report the observation of intermittency in gravity-capillary wave
turbulence on the surface of mercury. We measure the temporal fluctuations of
surface wave amplitude at a given location. We show that the shape of the
probability density function of the local slope increments of the surface waves
strongly changes across the time scales. The related structure functions and
the flatness are found to be power laws of the time scale on more than one
decade. The exponents of these power laws increase nonlinearly with the order
of the structure function. All these observations show the intermittent nature
of the increments of the local slope in wave turbulence. We discuss the
possible origin of this intermittency.
