Intra Cluster Media (ICMs) located at galaxy clusters is in the state of hot,
tenuous, magnetized, and highly ionized X-ray emitting plasmas. This overall
collisionless, viscous, and conductive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in
ICM is simulated using hyper and physical magnetic diffusivity. The results
show that fluctuating random plasma motion amplifies the magnetic field, which
cascades toward the diffusivity scale passing through the viscous scale. The
kinetic eddies in the subviscous scale are driven and constrained by the
magnetic tension which finally gets balanced with the highly damping effect of
the kinetic eddies. However, the saturated kinetic energy spectrum is deeper
than that of the incompressible or compressible hydrodynamics fluid. To explain
this unusual field profile we set up two simultaneous differential equations
for the kinetic and magnetic energy spectrum using an Eddy Damped Quasi Normal
Markovianized (EDQNM) approximation. The analytic solution tells us that the
magnetic energy in addition to the viscous damping effect constrains the plasma
motion leading to the power spectra: kinetic energy spectrum $E_V^k\sim k^{-3}$
and corresponding representative magnetic energy spectrum $E_M^k\sim k^{-1/2}$.
Also the comparison of simulation results with different resolutions and
magnetic diffusivities implies the role of small scale magnetic energy in
dynamo.
