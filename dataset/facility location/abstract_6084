We study the effects of strong magnetic fields ($B> 10^{13}$~G) in the cross
section for $\nu_e n\to p e$ scattering in the presence of a degenerate
electron background. This can be relevant for the $\nu_e$ propagation in the
proto-neutron star stage after supernovae collapse. We find that for field
strengths $B> 10^{16}$~G$(E_\nu/10$ MeV$)^2$ the $\nu_e$ opacity is sizeably
affected by the magnetic field and can lead to a shift in the location of the
electron neutrino sphere towards lower densities.
  We discuss the implications that this may have for scenarios proposed to
explain the observed pulsar velocities.
