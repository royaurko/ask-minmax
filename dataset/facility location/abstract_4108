The Long Baseline Neutrino Oscillation Experiment (LBNE) is proposed to
determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and measure the CP phase in the leptonic
sector. The current design of LBNE Phase I consists of a 10 kt liquid argon
time projection chamber (LBNE10). The neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry in the
electron-neutrino appearance probability has contributions from both the CP
phase and the matter effect. For this reason, experimental sensitivity to the
mass hierarchy depends both on the true value of the CP phase and the true mass
hierarchy; LBNE10 will determine the mass hierarchy at high levels of
significance for half of CP phase space. We propose placing a second detector
at an off-axis location. Such a detector will share the same beamline as the
primary LBNE detector. The detector location is chosen such that this detector
focuses on a measurement of electron (anti-)neutrino appearance at the second
oscillation maximum. We will show that this configuration will enhance the
ability of LBNE to determine the mass hierarchy and to discover CP violation in
the leptonic sector.
