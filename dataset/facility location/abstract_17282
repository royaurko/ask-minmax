The analysis of narrowband drifting of type III-like structures in radio
bursts dynamic spectra allows to obtain unique information about primary energy
release mechanisms in solar flares. The SSRT spatially resolved images and a
high spectral and temporal resolution allow direct determination not only the
positions of its sources but also the exciter velocities along the flare loop.
Practically, such measurements are possible during some special time intervals
when the SSRT (about 5.7 GHz) is observing the flare region in two high-order
fringes; thus, two 1D scans are recorded simultaneously at two frequency bands.
The analysis of type III-like bursts recorded during the flare 14 Apr 2002 is
presented. Using-muliwavelength radio observations recorded by SSRT, SBRS,
NoRP, RSTN we study an event with series of several tens of drifting microwave
pulses with drift rates in the range from -7 to 13 GHz/s. The sources of the
fast-drifting bursts were located near the top of the flare loop in a volume of
a few Mm in size. The slow drift of the exciters along the flare loop suggests
a high pitch-anisotropy of the emitting electrons.
