We show that hopping via the alkali atoms plays an important role for the t1u
band of A4C60 (A=K, Rb), in strong contrast to A3C60. Thus the t1u band is
broadened by more than 40 % by the presence of the alkali atoms. The difference
between A4C60 and A3C60 is in particular due to the less symmetric location of
the alkali atoms in A4C60.
