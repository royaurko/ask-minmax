The recent catalog of spectral types of Galactic O-type stars by
Mai'z-Apella'niz et al. has been used to study the differences between the
frequencies of various subtypes of O-type stars in the field, in OB
associations and among runaway stars. At a high level of statistical
significance the data show that O-stars in clusters and associations have
earlier types (and hence presumably larger masses and/or younger ages) than
those that are situated in the general field. Furthermore it is found that the
distribution of spectral subtypes among runaway O-stars is indistinguishable
from that among field stars, and differs significantly from that of the O-type
stars that are situated in clusters and associations. The difference is in the
sense that runaway O-stars, on average, have later subtypes than do those that
are still located in clusters and associations.
