The location of HII regions, which indicates the locus of present star
formation in galaxies, is analyzed for a large collection of 110 irregular
galaxies (Irr) imaged in H$\alpha$ and nearby continuum. The analysis is
primarily by visual inspection, although a two-dimensional quantitative measure
is also employed. The two different analyses yield essentially identical
results. HII regions appear preferentially at the edges of the light
distribution, predominantly on one side of the galaxy, contrary to what is
expected from stochastic self-propagating star formation scenarios. This
peculiar distribution of star forming regions cannot be explained by a scenario
of star formation triggered by an interaction with extragalactic gas, or by a
strong one-armed spiral pattern.
