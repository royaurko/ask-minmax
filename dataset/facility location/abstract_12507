(abridged) The activities of the Commission have continued to focus on
controlling unwanted light and radio emissions at observatory sites, monitoring
of conditions at observatory sites, and education and outreach. Commission
members have been active in securing new legislation in several locations to
further the protection of observatory sites as well as in the international
regulation of the use of the radio spectrum and the protection of radio
astronomical observations.
  In 2009, at its XXVII General Assembly in Rio de Janeiro, the IAU passed
Resolution B5 in Defence of the Night Sky and the Right to Starlight. The
Resolution encourages IAU members to assist in raising public awareness about
the contents and objectives of the International Conference in Defence of the
Quality of the Night Sky and the Right to Observe Stars
[http://www.starlight2007.net/], in particular the importance of preserving
access to an unpolluted night sky for all mankind.
