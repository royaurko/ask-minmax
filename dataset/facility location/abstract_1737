Inclusive as well as exclusive energy spectra of the light charged particles
emitted in the $^{28}Si(E_{lab}=112.6 MeV) + ^{28}Si,^{12}C$ reactions have
been measured at the Strasbourg VIVITRON facility in the angular range 15^0 -
150^0, using the ICARE multidetector array. The experimental energy spectra of
$\alpha$-particles are generally well reproduced by the statistical model with
a spin-dependent level density indicating the onset of defomations at high
spin.
