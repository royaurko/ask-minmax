The evolution of the properties of the hot gas that fills the potential well
of galaxy clusters is poorly known, since models are unable to give robust
predictions and observations lack a sufficient redshift leverage and are
affected by selection effects. Here, with just two high redshift, z approx 1.8,
clusters avoiding selection biases, we obtain a significant extension of the
redshift range and we begin to constrain the possible evolution of the X-ray
luminosity vs temperature relation. The two clusters, JKC041 at z=2.2 and
ISCSJ1438+3414 at z=1.41, are respectively the most distant cluster overall,
and the second most distant that can be used for studying scaling relations.
Their location in the X-ray luminosity vs temperature plane, with an X-ray
luminosity 5 times lower than expected, suggests at the 95 % confidence that
the evolution of the intracluster medium has not been self-similar in the last
three quarters of the Universe age. Our conclusion is reinforced by data on a
third, X-ray selected, high redshift cluster, too faint for its temperature
when compared to a sample of similarly selected objects. Our data suggest that
non-gravitational effects, such as the baryon physics, influence the evolution
of galaxy cluster. Precise knowledge of evolution is central for using galaxy
clusters as cosmological probes in planned X-ray surveys such as WFXT or JDEM.
