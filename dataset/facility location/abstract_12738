Frequency discrimination is a fundamental task of the auditory system. The
mammalian inner ear, or cochlea, provides a place code in which different
frequencies are detected at different spatial locations. However, a temporal
code based on spike timing is also available: action potentials evoked in an
auditory-nerve fiber by a low-frequency tone occur at a preferred phase of the
stimulus-they exhibit phase locking-and thus provide temporal information about
the tone's frequency. In an accompanying psychoacoustic study, and in agreement
with previous experiments, we show that humans employ this temporal information
for discrimination of low frequencies. How might such temporal information be
read out in the brain? Here we demonstrate that recurrent random neural
networks in which connections between neurons introduce characteristic time
delays, and in which neurons require temporally coinciding inputs for spike
initiation, can perform sharp frequency discrimination when stimulated with
phase-locked inputs. Although the frequency resolution achieved by such
networks is limited by the noise in phase locking, the resolution for realistic
values reaches the tiny frequency difference of 0.2% that has been measured in
humans.
