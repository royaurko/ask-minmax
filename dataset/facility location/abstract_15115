Accreting black holes are believed to be sites of possible particle
acceleration with favorable conditions also for effective gamma-ray production.
However, because of photon-photon pair production, only low energy (MeV)
gamma-rays can escape these compact objects with typically very large
compactness parameter, given that in most cases the accretion disks within 10
Schwarzschild radii radiate with a power exceeding 10 percent of the Eddington
luminosity. Therefore, the high-energy gamma-ray emission of these objects
(both stellar mass and supermassive BHs) is generally suppressed, and
consequently the unique information on possible particle acceleration process
near the event horizon of the BH is essentially lost. Fortunately, this is not
the case for the super-massive BH located at the dynamical center of our Galaxy
(Sgr A*) which, thanks to its extraordinary low bolometric luminosity is
transparent fo gamma-rays up to very high energies, about 10 TeV. We discuss
different scenarios of gamma-ray production in Sgr A* and show that for a
reasonable set of parameters one can expect detectable gamma-ray fluxes of both
hadronic and electronic origin. Some of these scenarios are applicable not only
for the TeV gamma-ray emission recently reported from the direction of Galactic
Center, but may have broader implications relevant to highly variable
nonthermal emission of Sgr A* in radio, IR and X-ray bands.
