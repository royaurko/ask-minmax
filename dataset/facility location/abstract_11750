We report on a new merging group of galaxies, Suzaku J1552+2739 at z ~ 0.08
revealed by a SUZAKU observation. The group was found by observing a junction
of galaxy filaments optically identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
spectroscopic data. Suzaku J1552+2739 exhibits an irregular morphology and
presents several peaks in its X-ray image. A bright elliptical galaxy,
observable in the central peak, allows the localization of the group at z =
0.083. We found a significant hot spot visible in the X-ray hardness map, close
to the second peak. The spectroscopic temperature is T = 1.6+0.4-0.1 keV within
R500 = 0.6 Mpc and T = 3 - 5 keV in the hot spot. We interpret those results as
Suzaku J1552+2739 being located in the center of a major merging process. The
observation of a galaxy group showing multiple X-ray peaks and a hot spot at
the same time is rare and we believe in particular that the study of Suzaku
J1552+2739 potentially presents a significant interest to better understand the
dynamical and thermal evolution of the intragroup and intracluster medium, as
well as its relation with surrounding environment.
