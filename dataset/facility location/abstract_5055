Formation of planets in the Neptune size range with low-mass, but voluminous,
H_2/He gaseous envelopes is modeled by detailed numerical simulations according
to the core-nucleated accretion scenario. Formation locations ranging from 0.5
to 4 AU from a star of 1 solar mass are considered. The final planets have
heavy-element cores of 2.2--2.5 Earth masses and envelopes in the range
0.037--0.16 Earth masses. After the formation process, which lasts 2 Myr or
less, the planets evolve at constant mass up to an age of several Gyr. For
assumed equilibrium temperatures of 250, 500, and 1000 K, their calculated
final radii are compared with those observed by the Kepler spacecraft. For the
particular case of Kepler-11 f, we address the question whether it could have
formed in situ or whether migration from a formation location farther out in
the disk is required.
