The Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) full-sky maps obtained with the Interstellar
Boundary Explorer (IBEX) show an unexpected bright narrow band of increased
intensity. This so-called ENA ribbon results from charge exchange of
interstellar neutral atoms with protons in the outer heliosphere or beyond.
Amongst other hypotheses it has been argued that this ribbon may be related to
a neutral density enhancement, or H-wave, in the local interstellar medium.
Here we quantitatively demonstrate, on the basis of an analytical model of the
principal large-scale heliospheric structure, that this scenario for the ribbon
formation leads to results that are fully consistent with the observed location
of the ribbon in the full-sky maps at all energies detected with high-energy
sensor IBEX-Hi.
