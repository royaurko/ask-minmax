We search for the charmed pentaquark candidate reported by the H1
collaboration, the Theta_c(3100)^0, in e^+e^- interactions at a center-of-mass
(c.m.) energy of 10.58 GeV, using 124~fb-1 of data recorded with the BaBar
detector at the PEP-II e^+e^- facility at SLAC. We find no evidence for such a
state in the same pD^{*-} decay mode reported by H1, and we set limits on its
production cross section times branching fraction into pD^{*-} as a function of
c.m. momentum. The corresponding limit on its total rate per e^+e^- -> qqbar
event, times branching fraction, is about three orders of magnitude lower than
rates measured for the charmed Lambda_c and Sigma_c baryons in such events.
