Optical observation through sub-meter telescope equipped with CCD camera
becomes alternative method for increasing orbital debris detection and
surveillance. This observational mode is expected to eye medium-sized objects
in higher orbits (e.g. MEO, GTO, GSO \& GEO), beyond the reach of usual radar
system. However, such observation of fast-moving objects demands special
treatment and analysis technique. In this study, we performed photometric
analysis of the satellite track images photographed using rehabilitated Schmidt
Bima Sakti telescope in Bosscha Observatory. The Hough transformation was
implemented to automatically detect linear streak from the images. From this
analysis and comparison to USSPACECOM catalog, two satellites were identified
and associated with inactive Thuraya-3 satellite and Satcom-3 debris which are
located at geostationary orbit. Further aperture photometry analysis revealed
the periodicity of tumbling Satcom-3 debris. In the near future, it is not
impossible to apply similar scheme to establish an analysis pipeline for
optical space surveillance system hosted in Indonesia.
