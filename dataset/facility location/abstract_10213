Because too many interesting things are going on now, I have tried to squeeze
three different subjects into one talk. The first is a brief summary of the
color super-conductivity. During the last year we learned that
instanton-induced forces can not only break chiral symmetry in the QCD vacuum,
but also create correlated scalar diquarks and form new phases,some similar to
the Higgs phase of the Standard model. The second issue I discuss is the
remnant of the so called $tricritical$ point, which in QCD with physical masses
is the endpoint of the first order transition. I will argue that exchange of
sigmas (which are massless at this point even with quark masses included)
create interesting event-by-event fluctuations, which can be used to locate it.
Finally I describe first results on $flow$ calculations for non-central
collisions at RHIC. It was found that it is extremely sensitive to Equation of
State (EOS). Furthermore, the unusual ``nutcracker'' picture emerges for
lattice-motivated EOS, which is formation of two $shells$ which are physically
separated $before$ the freeze-out.
