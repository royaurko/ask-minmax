We analyze a (120 h^{-1} Mpc)^3 adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic
simulation that contains a higher-resolution 31 x 31 x 35 h^{-3} Mpc subvolume
centered on a ~30 Mpc diameter void. Our detailed ~1 kpc resolution allows us
to identify 1300 galaxies within this void to a limiting halo mass of ~10^{10}
M_sun. Nearly 1000 galaxies are found to be in underdense regions, with 300
galaxies residing in regions less than half the mean density of the simulation
volume. We construct mock observations of the stellar and gas properties of
these systems, and reproduce the range of colors and luminosities observed in
the SDSS for nearby (z < 0.03) galaxies. We find no trends with density for the
most luminous (M_r < -18) galaxies, however our dwarf void galaxies (M_r >
-16), though they are less reliably resolved, typically appear bluer, with
higher rates of star formation and specific star formation and lower mean
stellar ages than galaxies in average density environments. We find a
significant population of low luminosity (M_r ~ -14) dwarf galaxies that is
preferentially located in low density regions and specifically in the void
center. This population may help to reduce, but not remove, the discrepancy
between the predicted and observed number of void galaxies.
