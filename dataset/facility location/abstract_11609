We present a simple model for a description of magnetization processes in
rare-earth tetraborides. The model is based on the coexistence of two
subsystems, and namely, the spin subsystem described by the Ising model and the
electronic subsystem described by the Falicov-Kimball model on the
Shastry-Sutherland lattice (SSL). Moreover, both subsystems are coupled by the
anisotropic spin-dependent interaction of the Ising type. We have found, that
the switching on the spin-dependent interaction ($J_z$) between the electron
and spin subsystems and taking into account the electron hopping on the nearest
($t$) and next-nearest ($t'$) lattice sites of the SSL leads to a stabilization
of new magnetization plateaus. In addition, to the Ising magnetization plateau
at $m^{sp}/m_s^{sp}=1/3$ we have found three new magnetization plateaus located
at $m^{sp}/m_s^{sp}=1/2$, 1/5 and 1/7 of the saturated spin magnetization
$m_s^{sp}$. The ground-states corresponding to magnetization plateaus have the
same spin structure consisting of parallel antiferromagnetic bands separated by
ferromagnetic stripes.
