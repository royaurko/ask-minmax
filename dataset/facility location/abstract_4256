We derive a semiclassical approximation to the Husimi functions of stationary
states of spin systems. We rederive the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization for spin
by locating the poles of the corresponding local Green function. The residues
correspond to the Husimi functions, which are seen to agree very well with
exact calculations.
