Mutual dependencies of mass and orbital moment increase for rotating bodies
of various configurations (a string with uniform mass distribution, a string
with squared mass distribution or a sphere with uniform mass distribution,
double system of point masses) are considered in quasiclassical approximation.
Results are used for analysis of meson, baryon resonances of rotating nature,
and also for dipion and dinucleon resonances. For oneparticle resonances a
string configuration with squared mass distribution is has been chosen. Radius
values and their possible changes with spin increase are obtained. At this, in
particular, for proton and $\delta$-isobar, which are the founders of rotating
bands, values 0.45 and 0.63 are defined, respectively. Dipion and dinucleon
resonances are pre-sented as two rotating point bodies at distances of some
fermy. Each of reso-nances is located in four rotary bands. Possible reasons of
formation of some rotary bands for these resonances are discussed.
