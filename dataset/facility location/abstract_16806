The very young open cluster NGC 6383 centered on the O-star binary HD 159176
is an interesting place for studying the impact of early-type stars with strong
radiation fields and powerful winds on the formation processes of low-mass
stars. To investigate this process, it is necessary to determine the
characteristics (age, presence, or absence of circumstellar material) of the
population of low-mass pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in the cluster. We
obtained deep U B V (R I)_c H-alpha photometric data of the entire cluster as
well as medium-resolution optical spectroscopy of a subsample of X-ray selected
objects. Our spectroscopic data reveal only very weak H-alpha emission lines in
a few X-ray selected PMS candidates. We photometrically identify a number of
H-alpha emission candidates but their cluster membership is uncertain. We find
that the fainter objects in the field of view have a wide range of extinction
(up to A_V = 20), one X-ray selected OB star having A_V ~ 8. Our investigation
uncovers a population of PMS stars in NGC 6383 that are probably coeval with HD
159176. In addition, we detect a population of reddened objects that are
probably located at different depths within the natal molecular cloud of the
cluster. Finally, we identify a rather complex spatial distribution of H-alpha
emitters, which is probably indicative of a severe contamination by foreground
and background stars.
