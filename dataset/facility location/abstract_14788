We report results of the Chandra deep imaging observation of the closest
post-core collapse globular cluster, NGC 6397. Some 25 sources are detected
within 2 arcmin of the cluster center of which about 20 are likely cluster
members with L_x ~ 3x10^29 erg/s. The x-ray spectra suggest identifications
with 1 quiescent low mass x-ray binary (qLMXB) detected by the thermal emission
from its neutron star (NS) and 9 cataclysmic variables (CVs), 8 of which are
identified in our deep HST imaging survey (reported separately). Three (of 16)
BY Draconis main sequence binary candidates identified in our earlier HST
imaging study (Taylor et al) are detected of which one is indeed the
counterpart of the eclipsing millisecond pulsar (MSP) recently located by
D'Amico et al. Two other BY Dra candidates are also detected, whereas none of
the probable He white dwarf (WD) binaries identified by Taylor et al are
indicating they do not contain MSP primaries. The x-ray color magnitude diagram
suggests that the remaining 5 probable cluster sources are a mixture of faint
CVs, BY Dra binaries and MSPs. Compact binaries containing WDs appear to
dominate this cluster, in contrast to those containing NSs in 47Tuc.
