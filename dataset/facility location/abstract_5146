The problem of target localization with censored noise free binary detectors
is considered. In this setting only the detecting sensors report their
locations to the fusion center. It is proven that if the radius of detection is
not known to the fusion center, a minimum variance unbiased (MVU) estimator
does not exist. Also it is shown that when the radius is known the center of
mass of the possible target region is the MVU estimator. In addition, a
sub-optimum estimator is introduced whose performance is close to the MVU
estimator but is preferred computationally. Furthermore, minimal sufficient
statistics have been provided, both when the detection radius is known and when
it is not. Simulations confirmed that the derived MVU estimator outperforms
several heuristic location estimators.
