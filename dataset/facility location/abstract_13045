Cloud computing is a complex infrastructure of software, hardware,
processing, and storage that is available as a service. Cloud computing offers
immediate access to large numbers of the world's most sophisticated
supercomputers and their corresponding processing power, interconnected at
various locations around the world, proffering speed in the tens of trillions
of computations per second. Information in databases and software scattered
around the Internet. There are many service providers in the internet, we can
call each service as a cloud, each cloud service will exchange data with other
cloud, so when the data is exchanged between the clouds, there exist the
problem of security. Security is an important issue for cloud computing, both
in terms of legal compliance and user trust, and needs to be considered at
every phase of design. In contrast to traditional solutions, where the IT
services are under proper physical, logical and personnel controls, Cloud
Computing moves the application software and databases to the large data
centers, where the management of the data and services may not be trustworthy.
This unique attribute, however, poses many new security challenges. Cloud
computing seems to offer some incredible benefits for communicators.
