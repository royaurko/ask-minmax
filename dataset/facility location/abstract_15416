We present analysis of extensive monitoring of SS433 by the RXTE observatory
collected over the period 1996-2005. The difference between energy spectra
taken at different precessional and orbital phases shows the presence of a
strong photoabsorption near the optical star, probably due to its powerful
dense wind. Assuming that a precessing accretion disk is thick, we recover the
temperature profile in the X-ray emitting jet that best fits the observed
precessional variations of the X-ray emission temperature. The hottest visible
part of the X-ray jet is located at a distance of $l_0/a\sim0.06-0.09$, or
$\sim2-3\times10^{11}$cm from the central compact object and has a temperature
of about $T_{\rm max}\sim30$ keV. We discovered appreciable orbital X-ray
eclipses at the ``crossover'' precessional phases (jets are in the plane of the
sky, disk is edge-on) which put a lower limit on the size of the optical
component $R/a\ga0.5$ and an upper limit on a mass ratio of binary companions
$q=M_{\rm x}/M_{\rm opt}\la0.3-0.35$. The size of the eclipsing region can be
larger than secondary's Roche lobe because of substantial photoabsorption by
dense stellar wind. This must be taken into account when evaluating the mass
ratio from analysis of X-ray eclipses.
