This technical report reviews the tests performed at the Best Cyclotron
Systems, Inc. facility in regards to developing a cost effective ion source,
beam line transport system, and acceleration system capable of high H$_2^+$
current output for the IsoDAR (Isotope Decay At Rest) experiment. We begin by
outlining the requirements for the IsoDAR experiment then provide overview of
the Versatile Ion Source, Low Energy Beam Transport system, spiral inflector,
and cyclotron. The experimental measurements are then discussed and the results
are compared with a thorough set of simulation studies. Of particular
importance we note that the Versatile Ion Source (VIS) proved to be a reliable
ion source capable of generating a large amount of H$_2^+$ current. The results
suggest that with further upgrades, the VIS could potentially be a suitable
candidate for IsoDAR. The conclusion outlines the key results from our tests
and introduces the forthcoming work this technical report has motivated.
