Sources of non-linear response of PIPS detector, when detecting highly
ionizing particles like recoils (EVR), fission fragments and heavy ions,
including formation of large pulse-height defect (PHD) are considered. An
analytical formula to calculate the recombination component of EVR PHD is
proposed on the base of surface recombination model with some empirical
correction. PC-based simulation code for generating the spectrum of the
measured recoil signal amplitudes of the heavy implanted nuclei is presented.
The simulated spectra are compared with the experimental ones for the different
facilities: the Dubna Gas Filled Recoil Separator (DGFRS), SHIP and RIKEN
gas-filled separator. After the short reviewing of the detection system of the
DGFRS, is considered the real-time matrix algorithm application aimed to the
radical background suppression in the complete-fusion heavy-ion induced nuclear
reactions. Typical examples of application in the long term experiments aimed
to the synthesis of superheavy elements Z=112-118 are presented [1-9].
