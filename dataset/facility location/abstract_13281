General topological principles how to transfer the planar orders onto a
sphere are considered. Formation of extended topological defects (ETDs), which
have a reconstructed inner structure surrounded by perfect initial order, is
discussed. Topological charge of the ETD can be determined from the shape of a
characteristic polygon bounding the defect. Relation between the total
topological charge of all defects in the spherical structure and the type of
initial planar order is found. It is also demonstrated that in the spherical
hexagonal crystal a dislocation located in the ETD area is actually absorbed by
it, because the order outside the defect doesn't display existence of
dislocation in any way. For the case of singly connected spherical hexagonal
order arising from mutual repulsion of N particles (N < 1000) only
triangulation of the order inside the ETD regions recovers the linear scars
which represent a narrow parts of wider ETD areas.
