The Borexino experiment, located in the Gran Sasso National Laboratory, is an
organic liquid scintillator detector conceived for the real time spectroscopy
of low energy solar neutrinos. The data taking campaign phase I (2007 - 2010)
has allowed the first independent measurements of 7Be, 8B and pep fluxes as
well as the first measurement of anti-neutrinos from the earth. After a
purification of the scintillator, Borexino is now in phase II since 2011. We
review here the recent results achieved during 2013, concerning the seasonal
modulation in the 7Be signal, the study of cosmogenic backgrounds and the
updated measurement of geo-neutrinos. We also review the upcoming measurements
from phase II data (pp, pep, CNO) and the project SOX devoted to the study of
sterile neutrinos via the use of a 51Cr neutrino source and a 144Ce-144Pr
antineutrino source placed in close proximity of the active material.
