In the upcoming synoptic all--sky survey era of astronomy, thousands of new
multiply imaged quasars are expected to be discovered and monitored regularly.
Light curves from the images of gravitationally lensed quasars are further
affected by superimposed variability due to microlensing. In order to
disentangle the microlensing from the intrinsic variability of the light
curves, the time delays between the multiple images have to be accurately
measured. The resulting microlensing light curves can then be analyzed to
reveal information about the background source, such as the size of the quasar
accretion disc. In this paper we present the most extensive and coherent
collection of simulated microlensing light curves; we have generated $>2.5$
billion light curves using the GERLUMPH high resolution microlensing
magnification maps. Our simulations can be used to: train algorithms to measure
lensed quasar time delays, plan future monitoring campaigns, and study light
curve properties throughout parameter space. Our data are openly available to
the community and are complemented by online eResearch tools, located at
