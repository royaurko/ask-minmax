Subsequent to announcements by the AGILE and by the Fermi-LAT teams of the
discovery of gamma-ray flares from the Crab Nebula in the fall of 2010, an
international collaboration has been monitoring X-Ray emission from the Crab on
a regular basis using the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. Observations occur
typically once per month when viewing constraints allow. The aim of the program
is to characterize in depth the X-Ray variations within the Nebula, and, if
possible, to much more precisely locate the origin of the gamma-ray flares. In
2011 April we triggered a set of Chandra Target-of-Opportunity observations in
conjunction with the brightest gamma-ray flare yet observed. We briefly
summarize the April X-ray observations and the information we have gleaned to
date.
