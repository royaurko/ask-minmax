This paper presents the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) studies of Nd doped phosphate glasses
before and after gamma irradiation. The intensity and location of LIII edge
white line peak of Nd are found to be dependent on the concentration of Nd as
well as on the ratio of O/Nd in the glass matrix. The decrease in the peak
intensity of white line of XANES spectra and asymmetry in the profile of Nd
3d5/2 peak of XPS after gamma irradiation clearly indicates that Nd3+ gets
reduced to Nd2+ in the glass matrix, which increases with an increase in the
doses of irradiation. Sharpening of Nd 3d5/2 XPS profile indicates about the
deficiency of oxygen in the glass after gamma irradiation, which is supported
by EDX measurement.
