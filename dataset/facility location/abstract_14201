Context. Impulsive solar energetic particle events in the inner heliosphere
show the long-lasting enrichment of 3He. Aims. We study the source regions of
long-lasting 3He-rich solar energetic particle (SEP) events Methods. We located
the responsible open magnetic field regions, we combined potential field source
surface extrapolations (PFSS) with the Parker spiral, and compared the magnetic
field of the identified source regions with in situ magnetic fields. The
candidate open field regions are active region plages. The activity was
examined by using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images from the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO) and STEREO together with radio observations from STEREO and
WIND. Results. Multi-day periods of 3He-rich SEP events are associated with ion
production in single active region. Small flares or coronal jets are their
responsible solar sources. We also find that the 3He enrichment may depend on
the occurrence rate of coronal jets.
