We use the results from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) for
the locations of peaks and troughs of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
power spectrum, together with constraints from large-scale structure, to study
a quintessence model in which the pure exponential potential is modified by a
polynomial factor. Our analysis, in the $(\Omega_m, h, n_s)$ cosmological
parameters space shows that this quintessence model is favoured compared to
$\Lambda$CDM for $n_s\approx 1$ and relatively high values of early
quintessence; for $n_s<1$, quintessence and $\Lambda$CDM give similar results,
except for high values of early quintessence, in which case $\Lambda$CDM is
favoured.
