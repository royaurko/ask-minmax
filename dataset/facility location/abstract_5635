The central part of the globular cluster NGC 288 was surveyed in a search for
short-period variable stars. We obtained the V-band light curves for 4 SX Phe
stars and 2 RR Lyrae variables, five of which are new discoveries. All SX Phe
stars belong to blue stragglers. We present a color-magnitude diagram including
stars from the tip of red giant branch to the level of the main-sequence
turnoff. Three likely hot subdwarfs were located on the extension of the blue
horizontal branch of the cluster.
