In Ginzburg-Landau Theory of superconductivity, the density and location of
the superconducting electrons is measured by a complex-valued wave function,
the order parameter. In this paper, when the intensity of the applied magnetic
field is close to the second critical field, and when the order parameter
minimizes the Ginzburg-Landau functional defined over a two dimensional domain,
the leading order approximation of its $L^2$-norm in `small' squares is given
as the Ginzburg-Landau parameter tends to infinity.
