Bornmann and Leydesdorff (in press) proposed methods based on Web-of-Science
data to identify field-specific excellence in cities where highly-cited papers
were published more frequently than can be expected. Top performers in output
are cities in which contributors are located who publish a number of highly-cited
papers that is statistically significantly higher than can be expected for
these cities. Using papers published between 1989 and 2009 in information
science improvements to the methods of Bornmann and Leydesdorff (in press) are
presented and an alternative mapping approach based on the indicator I3 is
introduced here. The I3 indicator was introduced by Leydesdorff and Bornmann
(in press).
