Sampled-data analysis and harmonic balance analysis are applied to analyze
switching DC-DC converters under constant on-time control. Design-oriented
boundary conditions for the period-doubling bifurcation and the saddle-node
bifurcation are derived. The required ramp slope to avoid the bifurcations and
the assigned pole locations associated with the ramp are also derived. The
derived boundary conditions are more general and accurate than those recently
obtained. Those recently obtained boundary conditions become special cases
under the general modeling approach presented in this paper. Different analyses
give different perspectives on the system dynamics and complement each other.
Under the sampled-data analysis, the boundary conditions are expressed in terms
of signal slopes and the ramp slope. Under the harmonic balance analysis, the
boundary conditions are expressed in terms of signal harmonics. The derived
boundary conditions are useful for a designer to design a converter to avoid
the occurrence of the period-doubling bifurcation and the saddle-node
bifurcation.
