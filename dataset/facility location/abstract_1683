In general, attempts to extend the standard model will include extra gauge
structure. We parameterize string and technicolor models for a Z' boson with
primitive lepton flavor violating interactions. Calculations for its muon
conversion rate (mu N -> e N) on Titanium are made and used to show the
potential of forthcoming experiments MECO at Brookhaven National Laboratory and
PRIME at the Japan Hadron Facility (to be renamed). For reasonable choices of
parameters, such U(1) bosons with masses the order 10 TeV and mu-e Z' charge as
low as ~10^-5 are demonstrated to be accessible for MECO and PRIME. Also, a
demonstration of the complementarity of parameter space coverage for future
colliders and muon conversion experiments is given.
