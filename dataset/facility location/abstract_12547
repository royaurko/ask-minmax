We consider Glauber dynamics (starting from an extremal configuration) in a
monotone spin system, and show that interjecting extra updates cannot increase
the expected Hamming distance or the total variation distance to the stationary
distribution. We deduce that for monotone Markov random fields, when block
dynamics contracts a Hamming metric, single-site dynamics mixes in O(n log n)
steps on an n-vertex graph. In particular, our result completes work of Kenyon,
Mossel and Peres concerning Glauber dynamics for the Ising model on trees. Our
approach also shows that on bipartite graphs, alternating updates
systematically between odd and even vertices cannot improve the mixing time by
more than a factor of log n compared to updates at uniform random locations on
an n-vertex graph. Our result is especially effective in comparing block and
single-site dynamics; it has already been used in works of Martinelli,
Sinclair, Mossel, Sly, Ding, Lubetzky, and Peres in various combinations.
