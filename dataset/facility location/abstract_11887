After 2010, three outbursts of H 1743-322 were detected by RXTE. We have
carried out timing and spectral analysis of the data, emphasizing on the two
with relatively complete evolution history presented in the RXTE/PCA
observations. We then constitute an enlarged outburst sample for H 1743-322
which allows to investigate the spectral transitions in more details. We find
that the spectral transitions to high-soft state constrain a region for four
outbursts in hardness-intensity diagram. An extension of the region locates in
the vicinity of the failed outburst in 2008, and excludes it from a successful
group. We therefore suggest the failed outburst in 2008 may present the first
almost successful outburst sample, which is important for modelling the
outburst, especially upon the conditions required for transition to high-soft
state.
