In this work, we use HyLoop (Winter et al. 2011), a loop model that can
incorporate the effects of both MHD and non-thermal particle populations, to
simulate soft X-ray emissions in various situations. First of all, we test the
effect of acceleration location on the emission in several XRT filters by
simulating a series of post flare loops with different injection points for the
non-thermal particle beams. We use an injection distribution peaked at the loop
apex to represent a direct acceleration model, and an injection distribution
peaked at the footpoints to represent the Alf\'en wave interaction model. We
find that footpoint injection leads to several early peaks in the
apex-tofootpoint emission ratio. Second, we model a loop with cusp-shaped
geometry based on the eruptionmodel developed by Lin & Forbes (2000) and
Reeves& Forbes (2005a), and find that early in the flare, emission in the loop
footpoints is much brighter in the XRT filters if non-thermal particles are
included in the calculation. Finally, we employ a multi-loop flare model to
simulate thermal emission and compare with a previous model where a
semi-circular geometry was used (Reeves et al. 2007). We compare the
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) emission from the two
models and find that the cusp-shaped geometry leads to a smaller GOES class
flare.
