A small air shower array operating over many years has been used to search
for ultra-high energy (UHE) gamma radiation ($\geq 50$ TeV) associated with
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by the BATSE instrument on the Compton
Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO). Upper limits for a one minute interval after each
burst are presented for seven GRBs located with zenith angles $\theta <
20^{\circ}$. A $4.3\sigma$ excess over background was observed between 10 and
20 minutes following the onset of a GRB on 11 May 1991. The confidence level
that this is due to a real effect and not a background fluctuation is 99.8\%.
If this effect is real then cosmological models are excluded for this burst
because of absorption of UHE gamma rays by the intergalactic radiation fields.
