We consider a fluid of $d$-dimensional spherical particles interacting via a
pair potential $\phi(r)$ which takes a finite value $\epsilon$ if the two
spheres are overlapped ($r<\sigma$) and 0 otherwise. This penetrable-sphere
model has been proposed to describe the effective interaction of micelles in a
solvent. We derive the structural and thermodynamic functions in the limit
where the reduced temperature $k_BT/\epsilon$ and density $\rho\sigma^d$ tend
to infinity, their ratio being kept finite. The fluid exhibits a spinodal
instability at a certain maximum scaled density where the correlation length
diverges and a crystalline phase appears, even in the one-dimensional model. By
using a simple free-volume theory for the solid phase of the model, the
fluid-solid phase transition is located.
