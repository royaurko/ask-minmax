The star HD72089 is located behind the Vela supernova remnant and shows a
complex array of high and low velocity interstellar absorption features arising
from shocked clouds. A spectrum of this star was recorded over the wavelength
range 1196.4 to 1397.2 Angstroms at a resolving power lambda/Delta lambda =
110,000 and signal-to-noise ratio of 32 by STIS on the Hubble Space Telescope.
We have identified 7 narrow components of C I and have measured their relative
populations in excited fine-structure levels. Broader features at heliocentric
velocities ranging from -70 to +130 km/s are seen in C II, N I, O I, Si II, S
II and Ni II. In the high-velocity components, the unusually low abundances of
N I and O I, relative to S II and Si II, suggest that these elements may be
preferentially ionized to higher stages by radiation from hot gas immediately
behind the shock fronts.
