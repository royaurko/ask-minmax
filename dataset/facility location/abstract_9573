It is assumed that HXR sources map to the primary energy release site in
flares where particle acceleration occurs. Strong HXR sources are mostly
observed at confined regions along the reconnecting magnetic arcade. We make a
general approach on how the geometry of the reconnecting current sheet (CS) may
influence the strength and localization of observed HXR sources. For this we
use results from an analysis on the 3B/X3.8 flare on January 17, 2005 (Temmer
et al., 2007), as well as measurements from the associated CME. Due to the
close match of the CME acceleration profile and the flare HXR flux, we suppose
that the CME might play a certain role in modifying the geometry of the CS
('symmetric' versus 'asymmetric' vertically stretched CS). This could be the
driver for 'guiding' the accelerated particles to confined areas along the
flaring arcade and might explain the spatially limited occurrence of strong HXR
sources in comparison to elongated ribbons as seen in H-alpha and UV.
