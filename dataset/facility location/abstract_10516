The Relativistic Hartree Bogoliubov (RHB) model is applied in the description
of ground-state properties of proton-rich odd-Z nuclei in the region $53 \leq Z
\leq 69$. The NL3 effective interaction is used in the mean-field Lagrangian,
and pairing correlations are described by the pairing part of the finite range
Gogny interaction D1S. The model predicts the location of the proton drip-line,
the ground-state quadrupole deformations and one-proton separation energies at
and beyond the drip-line, the deformed single-particle orbitals occupied by the
odd valence proton, and the corresponding spectroscopic factors. The results of
fully self-consistent RHB calculations are compared with available experimental
data, and with predictions of the macroscopic-microscopic mass model.
