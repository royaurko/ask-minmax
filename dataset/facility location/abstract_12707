We derive astrophysical and structural parameters of the poorly studied open
clusters NGC 6866, NGC 7062, and NGC 2360 based on filtered 2MASS (J, J -H)
diagrams, and stellar radial density profiles. The field star decontamination
technique is utilised for selecting high-probability cluster members. The E(B
-V) reddening values of the three clusters derived from 2MASS JHKs agree with
those inferred from UBV and uvby-{\beta} photometries. We find that the core
mass function slopes are flatter than the halo's for the three clusters. The
large core and cluster radii of NGC 6866 and NGC 2360 indicate an expanded
core, which may suggest the presence of stellar mass black-holes. NGC 2360 is
located in the third quadrant (l = 229.80), where Giant Molecular Clouds are
scarce that, together with its relatively large mass (~ 1800 msun), might
explain its longevity(~ 1.8Gyr) in the Galaxy.
