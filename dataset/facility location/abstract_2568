The Mantid framework is a software solution developed for the analysis and
visualization of neutron scattering and muon spin measurements. The framework
is jointly developed by software engineers and scientists at the ISIS Neutron
and Muon Facility and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The objectives,
functionality and novel design aspects of Mantid are described.
