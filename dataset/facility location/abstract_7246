Data obtained with the NICMOS instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) have been used to determine the H-band luminosity function (LF) and mass
function (MF) of three stellar fields in the globular cluster M15, located ~7'
from the cluster centre. The data confirm that the cluster MF has a
characteristic mass of ~0.3 Msolar, as obtained by Paresce & De Marchi (2000)
for a stellar field at 4.6' from the centre. By combining the present data with
those published by other contributors for various radial distances (near the centre,
at 20" and at 4.6'), we have studied the radial variation of the LF due to the
effects of mass segregation and derived the global mass function (GMF) using
the Michie-King approach. The model that simultaneously best fits the LF at
various locations, the surface brightness profile and the velocity dispersion
profile suggests that the GMF should resemble a segmented power-law with the
following indices: x ~ 0.8 for stars more massive than 0.8 Msolar, x ~ 0.9 for
0.3 - 0.8 Msolar and x ~ -2.2 at smaller masses (Salpeter's IMF would have
x=1.35). The best fitting model also suggests that the cluster mass is ~5.4
10^5 Msolar and that the mass-to-light ratio is on average M/L_V ~ 2.1, with
M/L_V ~ 3.7 in the core. A large amount of mass (~ 44 %) is found in the
cluster core in the form of stellar heavy remnants, which may be sufficient to
explain the mass segregation in M15 without invoking the presence of an
intermediate-mass black hole.
