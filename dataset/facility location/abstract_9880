The demixing transition of a binary fluid mixture of additive hard spheres is
analyzed for different size asymmetries by starting from the exact low-density
expansion of the pressure. Already within the second virial approximation the
fluid separates into two phases of different composition with a lower consolute
critical point. By successively incorporating the third, fourth, and fifth
virial coefficients, the critical consolute point moves to higher values of the
pressure and to lower values of the partial number fraction of the large
spheres. When the exact low-density expansion of the pressure is rescaled to
higher densities as in the Percus-Yevick theory, by adding more exact virial
coefficients a different qualitative movement of the critical consolute point
in the phase diagram is found. It is argued that the Percus-Yevick factor
appearing in many empirical equations of state for the mixture has a deep
influence on the location of the critical consolute point, so that the
resulting phase diagram for a prescribed equation has to be taken with caution.
