Catalog Services play a vital role on Data Grids by allowing users and
applications to discover and locate the data needed. On large Data Grids, with
hundreds of geographically distributed sites, centralized Catalog Services do
not provide the required scalability, performance or fault-tolerance. In this
article, we start by presenting and discussing the general requirements on Grid
Catalogs of applications being developed by the EGEE user community. This
provides the motivation for the second part of the article, where we present
the replication and distribution mechanisms we have designed and implemented
into the AMGA Metadata Catalog, which is part of the gLite software stack being
developed for the EGEE project. Implementing these mechanisms in the catalog
itself has the advantages of not requiring any special support from the
relational database back-end, of being database independent, and of allowing
tailoring the mechanisms to the specific requirements and characteristics of
Metadata Catalogs.
