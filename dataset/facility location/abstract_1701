We analyze the antimatter yield of supersymmetric (SUSY) models with large
neutralino annihilation cross sections. We introduce three benchmark scenarios,
respectively featuring bino, wino and higgsino-like lightest neutralinos, and
we study in detail the resulting antimatter spectral features. We carry out a
systematic and transparent comparison between current and future prospects for
direct detection, neutrino telescopes and antimatter searches. We demonstrate
that often, in the models we consider, antimatter searches are the only
detection channel which already constrains the SUSY parameter space.
Particularly large antiprotons fluxes are expected for wino-like lightest
neutralinos, while significant antideuteron fluxes result from resonantly
annihilating binos. We introduce a simple and general recipe which allows to
assess the visibility of a given SUSY model at future antimatter search
facilities. We provide evidence that upcoming space-based experiments, like
PAMELA or AMS, are going to be, in many cases, the unique open road towards
dark matter discovery.
