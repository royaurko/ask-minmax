In this paper we study the one dimensional random geometric graph when the
location of the nodes are independent and exponentially distributed. We derive
exact results and the limit theorems for the connectivity and other properties
associated with this random graph. We show that the asymptotic properties of a
graph with a truncated exponential distribution can be obtained using the
exponential random geometric graph.
