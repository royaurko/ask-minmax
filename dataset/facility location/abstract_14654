The morphology and kinematics of the luminous blue starburst galaxy NGC 7673
are explored using the WIYN 3.5m telescope. Signs of a past kinematic
disturbance are detected in the outer galaxy; the most notable feature is a
luminous ripple located 1.55 arc minutes from the center of NGC 7673. Sub-arc
second imaging in B and R filters also reveals red dust lanes and blue star
clusters that delineate spiral arms in the bright inner disk and narrow band
Halpha imaging shows that the luminous star clusters are associated with giant
H II regions. The Halpha kinematics measured with echelle imaging spectroscopy
using the WIYN DensePak fiber array imply that these HII regions are confined
to a smoothly rotating disk. The velocity dispersion in ionized gas in the disk
is approximately 24 km/s, which sets an upper bound on the dispersion of young
stellar populations. Broad emission components with velocity dispersion approx.
63 km/s are found in some regions are likely produced by mechanical power
supplied by massive, young stars; a violent starburst is occurring in a
kinematically calm disk. Although the asymmetric outer features point to a
merger or interaction as the starburst trigger, the inner disk structure
constrains the strength of the event to the scale of a minor merger or weak
interaction that occurred at least an outer disk dynamical time scale in the
past.
