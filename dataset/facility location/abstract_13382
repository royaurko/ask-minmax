It is shown that spin-orbit interaction leads to drastic changes in wave
patterns generated by a flow of two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
past an obstacle. The combined Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction
affects in different ways two types of excitations---density and polarization
waves---which can propagate in a two-component BEC. We show that the density
and polarization "ship wave" patterns rotate in opposite directions around the
axis located at the obstacle position and the angle of rotation depends on the
strength of spin-orbit interaction. This rotation is accompanied by narrowing
of the Mach cone. The influence of spin-orbit coupling on density solitons and
polarization breathers is studied numerically.
