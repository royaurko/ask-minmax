The vector and tensor analysing powers, $A_y$ and $A_{yy}$, of the $\vec{p}d
\to n\{pp\}_{s}$ charge-exchange reaction have been measured at a beam energy
of 600 MeV at the COSY-ANKE facility by using an unpolarised proton beam
incident on an internal storage cell target filled with polarised deuterium
gas. The low energy recoiling protons were measured in a pair of silicon
tracking telescopes placed on either side of the target. Putting a cut of 3 MeV
on the diproton excitation energy ensured that the two protons were dominantly
in the $^{1}S_{0}$ state, here denoted by $\{pp\}_{s}$. The polarisation of the
deuterium gas was established through measurements in parallel of
proton-deuteron elastic scattering. By analysing events where both protons
entered the same telescope, the charge-exchange reaction was measured for
momentum transfers $q\geq 160$ MeV/$c$. These data provide a good continuation
of the earlier results at $q\leq 140$ MeV/$c$ obtained with a polarised
deuteron beam. They are also consistent with impulse approximation predictions
with little sign evident for any modifications due to multiple scatterings.
