We present an overview of and status report on the WEAVE next-generation
spectroscopy facility for the William Herschel Telescope (WHT). WEAVE
principally targets optical ground-based follow up of upcoming ground-based
(LOFAR) and space-based (Gaia) surveys. WEAVE is a multi-object and multi-IFU
facility utilizing a new 2-degree prime focus field of view at the WHT, with a
buffered pick-and-place positioner system hosting 1000 multi-object (MOS)
fibres, 20 integral field units, or a single large IFU for each observation.
The fibres are fed to a single spectrograph, with a pair of 8k(spectral) x 6k
(spatial) pixel cameras, located within the WHT GHRIL enclosure on the
telescope Nasmyth platform, supporting observations at R~5000 over the full
370-1000nm wavelength range in a single exposure, or a high resolution mode
with limited coverage in each arm at R~20000. The project is now in the final
design and early procurement phase, with commissioning at the telescope
expected in 2017.
