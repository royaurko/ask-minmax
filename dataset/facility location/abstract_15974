The near zone energy-momentum tensor of a supersonic heavy quark jet moving
through a strongly-coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma is analyzed in terms of
first-order Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics. It is shown that the hydrodynamical
description of the near quark region worsens with increasing quark velocities.
For realistic quark velocities, $v=0.99$, the non-hydrodynamical region is
located at a narrow band surrounding the quark with a width of approximately
$3/\pi T$ in the direction parallel to the quark's motion and with a length of
roughly $10/\pi T$ in the perpendicular direction. Our results can be
interpreted as an indication of the presence of coherent Yang-Mills fields
where deviation from hydrodynamics is at its maximum. In the region where
hydrodynamics does provide a good description of the system's dynamics, the
flow velocity is so small that all the nonlinear terms can be dropped. Our
results, which are compatible with the thermalization timescales extracted from
elliptic flow measurements, suggest that if AdS/CFT provides a good description
of the RHIC system, the bulk of the quenched jet energy has more than enough
time to locally thermalize and become encoded in the collective flow. The
resulting flow pattern close to the quark, however, is shown to be considerably
different than the superposition of Mach cones and diffusion wakes observed at
large distances.
