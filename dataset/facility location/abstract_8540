We present the fifth part of the OGLE Catalog of Periodic Variable Stars in
the Galactic bulge. 574 variable stars: 44 pulsating, 369 eclipsing and 161
miscellaneous type were detected in four fields located symmetrically in
galactic lattitude around the Galactic center: MM5-A, MM5-B, MM7-A and MM7-B.
The Catalog and individual observations are available in digital form from the
OGLE Internet archive.
