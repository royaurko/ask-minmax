Using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and Spectroscopy, we probe the electronic
structures of single layer ${\small MoS_2}$ on graphite. We show that the
quasiparticle energy gap of single layer ${\small MoS_2}$ is 2.15 $\pm$ 0.07 eV
at 77 K. Combining with temperature dependent photoluminescence studies, we
deduce an exciton binding energy of 0.22 $\pm$ 0.1 eV, a value that is much
lower than current theoretical predictions. Consistent with theoretical
predictions we directly observed metallic edge states of single layer ${\small
MoS_2}$. In the bulk region of ${\small MoS_2}$, the Fermi level is located at
1.8 eV above the valence band maximum, possibly due to the formation of a
graphite/${\small MoS_2}$ heterojunction. At the edge, however, we observe an
upward band bending of 0.6 eV within a short depletion length of about 5 nm,
analogous to the phenomena of Fermi level pinning of a 3D semiconductor by
metallic surface states.
