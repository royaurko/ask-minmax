We estimate errors from the application of the main sequence $(H-K)_0 \ vs. \
(J-H)_0$ and $(J-K)_0 \ vs. \ M_J$ relations on 2mass photometry to provide
stellar extinctions and distances. The error propagation on individual stars in
the Serpens -- Aquila star forming region is investigated. Results: errors on
the $J-band$ extinction $\sigma_{A_J}$ are found in the range from 0.05 to 0.20
mag and peak at $\approx$0.1. For the absolute $J-band$ magnitudes the
$\sigma_{M_J}$ range is found from 0.1 to 0.5 mag and the distribution has a
pronounced maximum at $\approx$0.3 mag. Individual relative distance errors,
$\sigma_{distance}/distance$, are found in the interval from 8$%$ to 25$%$ and
peak at 15$%$. If cloud distances are identified with the location of a local
maximum of the $A_J(median)/distance(median)$ variation the Serpens -- Aquila
cloud may be at 203$\pm$7 pc. We propose that the median absolute deviation
from the median of $A_J$ could be used as a cloud distance indicator
