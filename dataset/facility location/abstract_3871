Compared to Multi Wires Proportional Chambers (MWPC), Micro-Pattern Gas
Detectors (MPGD) used in HEP to detect MIPs offer better spatial resolution,
counting rate capability, and radiation hardness; their fabrication is also
more reproducible. Provided similar advantages are applicable to detect
neutrons, MPGDs might contribute significantly to the development of neutron
scientific instrumentation. In order to evaluate the prospects of neutron
MPGDs, it is worth knowing the applications which would benefit from a gain in
performance, and if they offer a competitive alternative to conventional 3He
detectors. These questions have been at the focus of the workshop "Neutron
Detection with Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detectors" organized by RD51 in
collaboration with HEPTech, which took place at CERN on October 14-15, 2013.
The goal of this workshop was to help disseminating MPGD technologies beyond
High Energy Physics, and to give the possibility to academic institutions,
potential users and industry to meet together.
  This summary article starts with a short summary of the state of the art of
MPGD techniques for HEP; then specificities in the design of neutron detector
are described; the consequence of the 3He shortage are briefly discussed;
requirements for neutron scattering science at current facilities and at the
future ESS are described; finally, we give some recommendations about possible
directions where we believe the development of neutron MPGDs is of particular
interest for possible use on neutron scattering instruments.
