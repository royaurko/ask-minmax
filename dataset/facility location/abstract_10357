We compute the D-brane tensions in the type IIA plane-wave background by
comparing the interaction potential between widely separated D-branes in string
theory with the supergravity mode exchange between the D-branes. We found that
the D-brane tensions and RR charges in the plane-wave background are the same
as those in the flat space. Also we work out the stringy halo behavior of the
$DpD\bar{p}$ spacelike branes and find the explicit dependence on the light
cone separation $r^+$. This suggests that the detailed tachyon dynamics for the
spacelike $DpD\bar{p}$ branes are different from those in the flat space case.
We also discuss specific features of the exchange amplitudes in relation to the
geometric properties of the IIA plane wave background. When branes are located
at focal points, full or partial restoration of the translation invariance
occurs and the amplitudes are similar to those in the flat space.
