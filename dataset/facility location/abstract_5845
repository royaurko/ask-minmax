Results of a first-principles study of the Li impurity in GaN are presented.
We find Li is a channel interstitial, with an onset for diffusion at T$\sim$
600 K. Above this temperature, Li can transform to a Ga-substitutional acceptor
by exothermic recombination with Ga vacancies. This process implies capture of
at least one electron; therefore Li acts as an electron sink. Li$_{\rm Ga}$ is
stable again interstitialcy, and has a shallow first ionization levels of 0.16
eV, and second ionization at 0.63 eV. Lattice locations and their temperature
dependence are in close agreement with recent experiments.
