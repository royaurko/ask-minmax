Spatial process models for analyzing geostatistical data entail computations
that become prohibitive as the number of spatial locations become large. This
manuscript develops a class of highly scalable Nearest Neighbor Gaussian
Process (NNGP) models to provide fully model-based inference for large
geostatistical datasets. We establish that the NNGP is a well-defined spatial
process providing legitimate finite-dimensional Gaussian densities with sparse
precision matrices. We embed the NNGP as a dimension-reducing prior within a
rich hierarchical modeling framework and develop computationally efficient
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms avoiding the storage or
decomposition of large matrices. The floating point operations (flops) per
iteration of this algorithm is linear in the number of spatial locations,
thereby delivering substantial scalability. We illustrate the computational and
inferential benefits of the NNGP using simulation experiments and also infer on
forest biomass from a massive United States Forest Inventory dataset.
