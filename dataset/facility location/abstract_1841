This paper describes the mechanical design of the downstream beam transport
line for the second axis of the Dual Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test (DARHT
II) Facility. The DARHT-II project is a collaboration between LANL, LBNL and
LLNL. DARHT II is a 20-MeV, 2000-Amperes, 2-msec linear induction accelerator
designed to generate short bursts of x-rays for the purpose of radiographing
dense objects. The down-stream beam transport line is approximately 20-meter
long region extending from the end of the accelerator to the bremsstrahlung
target. Within this proposed transport line there are 15 conventional solenoid,
quadrupole and dipole magnets; as well as several speciality magnets, which
transport and focus the beam to the target and to the beam dumps. There are two
high power beam dumps, which are designed to absorb 80-kJ per pulse during
accelerator start-up and operation. Aspects of the mechanical design of these
elements are presented.
