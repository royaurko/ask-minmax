We explore the room for possible deviations from the Standard Model (SM)
Higgs boson coupling structure in a systematic study of Higgs coupling scale
factor benchmark scenarios using the latest signal rate measurements from the
Tevatron and LHC experiments. We employ chi-squared fits performed with
HiggsSignals, which takes into account detailed information on signal
efficiencies and major correlations of theoretical and experimental
uncertainties. All considered scenarios allow for additional non-standard Higgs
boson decay modes, and various assumptions for constraining the total decay
width are discussed. No significant deviations from the SM Higgs boson coupling
structure are found in any of the investigated benchmark scenarios. We derive
upper limits on an additional (undetectable) Higgs decay mode under the
assumption that the Higgs couplings to weak gauge bosons do not exceed the SM
prediction. We furthermore discuss the capabilities of future facilities for
probing deviations from the SM Higgs couplings, comparing the high luminosity
upgrade of the LHC with a future International Linear Collider (ILC), where for
the latter various energy and luminosity scenarios are considered. At the ILC
model-independent measurements of the coupling structure can be performed, and
we provide estimates of the precision that can be achieved.
