The RFQD is designed to decelerate antiprotons of momentum 100 MeV/c (kinetic
energy 5.33MeV)down to a kinetic energy variable between ~10 keV and 120 keV.
Inside the RFQ body, at ground potential, the rf structure of the four-rod type
is mounted on insulating supports. It can be biased between plus/minus 60 kV dc
to achieve the continuous adjustment of output energy required by the ASACUSA
experiment at the CERN Antiproton Decelerator AD. The different parts of the
system are described and the present status reported.
