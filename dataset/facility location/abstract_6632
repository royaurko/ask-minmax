Fusion data for $^{48}$Ca+$^{96}$Zr are analyzed by coupled-channels
calculations. Puzzling features of a previous analysis are eliminated by
applying a potential that has a shallow pocket in the entrance channel. Thus
the observed $S$ factor for fusion, which develops a maximum at low energy, can
be reproduced fairly well. The high-energy data can also be accounted for but
that requires the use of a weak, short-ranged imaginary potential that absorbs
the incoming flux near the location of the minimum of the potential pocket.
Predictions of the fusion hindrance in other Ca+Zr systems are made and are
compared with the systematics that has been developed previously.
