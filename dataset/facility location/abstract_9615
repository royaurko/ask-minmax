In certain mean field models for spin glasses there occurs a one step replica
symmetry breaking pattern. As an example of general $1/N$-corrections in such
systems, the fluctuations in the internal energy are calculated. For this
specific quantity the outcome is known from the specific heat. It is shown that
the correct result can be derived by assuming that the both the height and the
location of the breakpoint fluctuate. This effect enlarges the commonly
considered space of allowed fluctuations of the order parameter in loop
calculations for short range spin glasses of this type. The phenomenon does not
occur in spin glasses with infinite order replica symmetry breaking.
