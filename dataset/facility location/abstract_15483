The H.E.S.S. array of imaging Cherenkov telescopes has discovered a number of
previously unknown gamma-ray sources in the very high energy (VHE) domain above
100 GeV. The good angular resolution of H.E.S.S. (~0.1 degree per event), as
well as its sensitivity (a few percent of the Crab Nebula flux) and wide
5-degree field of view, allow a much better constrained search for counterparts
in comparison to previous instruments. In several cases, the association of the
VHE sources revealed by H.E.S.S. with pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) is supported
by a combination of positional and morphological evidence, multi-wavelength
observations, and plausible PWN model parameters. These include the plerions in
the composite supernova remnants G 0.9+0.1 and MSH 15-52, the recently
discovered Vela X nebula, two new sources in the Kookaburra complex, and the
association of HESS J1825-137 with PSR B1823-13. The properties of these
better-established associations are reviewed. A number of other sources
discovered by H.E.S.S. are located near high spin-down power pulsars, but the
evidence for association is less complete. These possible associations are also
discussed, in the context of the available multi-wavelength data and plausible
PWN scenarios.
