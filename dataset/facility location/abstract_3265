We present BAX, Base de Donnees Amas de Galaxies X
(http://webast.ast.obs-mip.fr/bax), a multi-wavelength database dedicated to
X-ray clusters and groups of galaxies allowing detailed information retrieval.
BAX is designed to support astronomical research by providing access to
published measurements of the main physical quantities and to the related
bibliographic references: basic data stored in the database are cluster/group
identifiers, equatorial coordinates, redshift, flux, X-ray luminosity (in the
ROSAT band) and temperature, and links to additional linked parameters (in
X-rays, such as spatial profile parameters, as well as SZ parameters of the hot
gas, lensing measurements,and data at other wavelengths, such as optical and
radio). The clusters and groups in BAX can be queried by the basic parameters
as well as the linked parameters or combinations of these. We expect BAX to
become an important tool for the astronomical community. BAX will optimize
various aspects of the scientific analysis of X-ray clusters and groups of
galaxies, from proposal planning to data collection, interpretation and
publication, from both ground based facilities like MEGACAM (CFHT), VIRMOS
(VLT) and space missions like XMM-Newton, Chandra and Planck.
