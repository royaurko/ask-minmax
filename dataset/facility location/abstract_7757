Complementing our Washington photometric studies on Galactic open clusters
(OCs), we now focus on four poorly studied OCs located in the first and fourth
Galactic quadrants, namely BH 84, NGC 5381, BH 211 and Czernik 37. We have
obtained CCD photometry in the Washington system $C$ and $T_1$ passbands down
to $T_1$ $\sim$ 18.5 magnitudes for these four clusters. Their positions and
sizes were determined using the stellar density radial profiles. We derived
reddening, distance, age and metallicity of the clusters from extracted
$(C-T_1,T_1)$ color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), using theoretical isochrones
computed for the Washington system. There are no previous photometric data in
the optical band for BH 84, NGC 5381 and BH 211. The CMDs of the observed
clusters show relatively well defined main sequences, except for Czernik 37,
wherein significant differential reddening seems to be present. The red giant
clump is clearly seen only in BH 211. For this cluster, we estimated the age in
(1000$^{+260}_{-200}$) Myr, assuming a metallicity of $Z$ = 0.019. BH 84 was
found to be much older than it was previously believed, while NGC 5381 happened
to be much younger than previously reported. The heliocentric distances to
these clusters are found to range between 1.4 and 3.4 kpc. BH 84 appears to be
located at the solar galactocentric distance, while NGC 5381, BH 211 and
Czernik 37 are situated inside the solar ring.
