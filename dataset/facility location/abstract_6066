We present results on the QCD phase diagram for small densities without
reweighting. Our simulations are performed with an imaginary chemical potential
mu_I for which the fermion determinant is positive. On an 8^3x4 lattice with 2
flavors of staggered quarks, we map out the pseudo-critical temperature
T_c(mu_I). For mu_I/T < pi/3, this is an analytic function whose Taylor
expansion converges rapidly, with truncation errors smaller than statistical
ones. The result is analytically continued to give the location of the
pseudo-critical line for real mu_B<500 MeV.
