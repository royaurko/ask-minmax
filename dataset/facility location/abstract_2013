The excitation spectra in the deformed nucleus 230Th were studied by means of
the (p,t) reaction, using the Q3D spectrograph facility at the Munich Tandem
accelerator. The angular distributions of tritons are measured for about 200
excitations seen in the triton spectra up to 3.3 MeV. Firm 0+ assignments are
made for 16 excited states by comparison of experimental angular distributions
with the calculated ones using the CHUCK code. Additional assignments are
possible: relatively firm for 4 states and tentative also for 4 states.
Assignments up to spin $6^+$ are made for other states. Sequences of the states
are selected which can be treated as rotational bands and as multiplets of
excitations. Experimental data are compared with interacting boson model IBM)
and quasiparticle-phonon model (QPM) calculations.
