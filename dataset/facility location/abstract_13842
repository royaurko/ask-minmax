We point out that if a certain variant of "Quirks", particles that carry
ordinary color and some other color' exist, then we can have a completely novel
and efficient mode of long distance communications and of acceleration to very
high energies. For very low scale $\Lambda'$ the scale of the new gauge group
in the theory, and associated string tension of the new color' the Quirks can
be captured in ordinary materials. Having then the Quirk Q' and anti-Quirk
$\bar{Q}'$ in two separate piezoelectric crystals at arbitrarily far out points
A and B allows Alice and Bob at these locations to communicate by generating
transverse waves along the connecting color' string. Also releasing the Quirks
allows them to collide at extremely high energies.
