We present results from very high signal-to-noise spectropolarimetric
observations of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783. Position Angle (PA) changes
across the Balmer lines show that the scatterer is resolving the Broad-Emission
Line Region (BLR). A broad component seen in polarized light and located
bluewards from the H$\beta$ line very likely corresponds to HeII$\lambda4686$.
The lack of PA changes across this line suggests that the region responsible
for this emission appears to the scatterer as unresolved as the continuum
source, in agreement with the stratified BLR structure determined from
reverberation mapping.
