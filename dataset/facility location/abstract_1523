The goal of searching back in cosmic time to find star formation during the
epoch of reionization will soon be within reach. We assess the detectability of
high-redshift galaxies by combining cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of
galaxy formation, stellar evolution models appropriate for the first
generations of stars, and estimates of the efficiency for Lyman alpha to escape
from forming galaxies into the intergalactic medium. Our simulated observations
show that Lyman alpha emission at z ~ 8 may be observable in the near-infrared
with 8-meter class telescopes and present-day technology. Not only is the
detection of early star-forming objects vital to understanding the underlying
cause of the reionization of the universe, but the timely discovery of a z > 7
star-forming population -- or even an interesting upper limit on the emergent
flux from these objects -- will have implications for the design of the next
generation of ground- and space-based facilities.
