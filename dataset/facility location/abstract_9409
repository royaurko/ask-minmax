We report the first detection of radio emission from any anomalous X-ray
pulsar (AXP). Data from the Very Large Array (VLA) MAGPIS survey with angular
resolution 6" reveals a point-source of flux density 4.5 +/- 0.5 mJy at 1.4 GHz
at the precise location of the 5.54 s pulsar XTE J1810-197. This is greater
than upper limits from all other AXPs and from quiescent states of soft
gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs). The detection was made in 2004 January, 1 year
after the discovery of XTE J1810-197 during its only known outburst. Additional
VLA observations both before and after the outburst yield only upper limits
that are comparable to or larger than the single detection, neither supporting
nor ruling out a decaying radio afterglow related to the X-ray turn-on. Another
hypothesis is that, unlike the other AXPs and SGRs, XTE J1810-197 may power a
radio synchrotron nebula by the interaction of its particle wind with a
moderately dense environment that was not evacuated by previous activity from
this least luminous, in X-rays, of the known magnetars.
