The MiniBooNE large axial-mass anomaly has motivated the development of new
theoretical Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) cross-section models in recent
years. These proceedings review the development of the neutrino simulation
generator NEUT to incorporate these more sophisticated CCQE models, including
multi-nucleon interaction (2p2h) effects. The fit results on the MINER$\nu$A
and MiniBoone data are used to tune neutrino interaction models in NEUT and
develop a default cross-section model for T2K.
