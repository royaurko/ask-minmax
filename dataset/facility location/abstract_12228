We discuss the case when a fermion occupies an excited non-zero frequency
level in the field of domain wall. We demonstrate that a solution exists for
the coupling constant in the limited interval $1<g<g_{max}\approx 1.65$. We
show that indeed there are different branches of stable solution for $g$ in
this interval. The first one corresponds to a fermion located on the domain
wall ($1<g<\sqrt[4]{2\pi}$). The second branch, which belongs to the interval
$\sqrt[4]{2\pi}\le g\le g_{max}$, describes a polarized fermion off the domain
wall. The third branch with $1<g<g_{max}$ describes an excited antifermion in
the field of the domain wall.
