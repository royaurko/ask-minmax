Pollet et al have questioned our claim staked in Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 085701
(2009) that from the location of sharp features in the compressibility in the
trap, it is possible to map out the phase boundary between two phases within
reasonable accuracy. We stand by it and use this reply to sharpen the
conditions under which "sharp" features in compressibility reflect the effects
of critical fluctuations.
