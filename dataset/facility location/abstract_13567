A Lie algebraic method for propagation of the Wigner quasi-distribution
function under quadratic Hamiltonian was presented by Zoubi and Ben-Aryeh. We
show that the same method can be used in order to propagate a rather general
class of quasi distribution functions, which we call "Gaussian class". This
class contains as special cases the well-known Wigner, Husimi, Glauber and
Kirkwood-Rihaczek quasi-distribution functions. We present some examples of the
calculation of the time-evolution of those functions.
