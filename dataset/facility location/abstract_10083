We extract all the invariants (i.e. all the functions which do not depend on
the choice of phase-space coordinates) of the dynamics of two point-masses, at
the third post-Newtonian (3PN) approximation of general relativity. We start by
showing how a contact transformation can be used to reduce the 3PN higher-order
Hamiltonian derived by Jaranowski and Sch\"afer to an ordinary Hamiltonian. The
dynamical invariants for general orbits (considered in the center-of-mass
frame) are then extracted by computing the radial action variable
$\oint{p_r}dr$ as a function of energy and angular momentum. The important case
of circular orbits is given special consideration. We discuss in detail the
plausible ranges of values of the two quantities $\oms$, $\omk$ which
parametrize the existence of ambiguities in the regularization of some of the
divergent integrals making up the Hamiltonian. The physical applications of the
invariant functions derived here (e.g. to the determination of the location of
the last stable circular orbit) are left to subsequent work.
