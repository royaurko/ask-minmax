Zeckendorf's theorem states that every positive integer can be written
uniquely as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers ${F_n}$, with initial
terms $F_1 = 1, F_2 = 2$. We consider the distribution of the number of
summands involved in such decompositions. Previous work proved that as $n \to
\infty$ the distribution of the number of summands in the Zeckendorf
decompositions of $m \in [F_n, F_{n+1})$, appropriately normalized, converges
to the standard normal. The proofs crucially used the fact that all integers in
$[F_n, F_{n+1})$ share the same potential summands.
  We generalize these results to subintervals of $[F_n, F_{n+1})$ as $n \to
\infty$; the analysis is significantly more involved here as different integers
have different sets of potential summands. Explicitly, fix an integer sequence
$\alpha(n) \to \infty$. As $n \to \infty$, for almost all $m \in [F_n,
F_{n+1})$ the distribution of the number of summands in the Zeckendorf
decompositions of integers in the subintervals $[m, m + F_{\alpha(n)})$,
appropriately normalized, converges to the standard normal. The proof follows
by showing that, with probability tending to $1$, $m$ has at least one
appropriately located large gap between indices in its decomposition. We then
use a correspondence between this interval and $[0, F_{\alpha(n)})$ to obtain
the result, since the summands are known to have Gaussian behavior in the
latter interval. % We also prove the same result for more general linear
recurrences.
