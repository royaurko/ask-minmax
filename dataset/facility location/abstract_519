The location and width of the time window in which a sequence of processes
converges to equilibrum are given under conditions of exponential convergence.
The location depends on the side: the left-window and right window cutoffs may
have different locations. Bounds on the distance to equilibrium are given for
both sides. Examples prove that the bounds are tight.
