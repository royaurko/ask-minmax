The method of location and spectral estimation of weak signals on a noise
background is being considered. The method is based on the optimized on order
and noise dispersion autoregressive model of a sought signal. A new approach of
model order determination is being offered. Available estimation of the noise
dispersion is close to the real one. The optimized model allows to define
function of empirical data spectral and dynamic features changes. The analysis
of the signal as dynamic invariant in respect of the linear shift
transformation yields the function of model consistency. Use of these both
functions enables to detect short-time and nonstationary wave packets at signal
to noise ratio as from -20 dB and above.
