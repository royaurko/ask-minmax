This Paper outlines study behaviour of rotating shaft with high speed under
thermal effects. The method of obtaining the frequency response functions of a
rotor system with study whirl effect in this revision the raw data obtained
from the experimental results (using Smart Office program) are curve-fitted by
theoretical data regenerated from some of the experimental data and simulating
it using finite element (ANSYS 12). (FE) models using the Eigen analysis
capability were used to simulate the vibration. The results were compared with
experimental data show analysis data with acceptable accuracy and performance.
The rotating effect causes un-symmetry in the system matrices, resulting in
complexity in decoupling the mathematical models of the system for the purpose
of modal analysis. Different method is therefore required, which can handle
general system matrices rather than symmetrical matrices, which is normal for
passive structures. Mathematical model of the system from the test data can be
assembled. The frequency response functions are extracted, Campbell diagram are
draw and simulated. (FE) is used to carry out such as simulation since it has
good capability for Eigen analysis and also good graphical facility.
