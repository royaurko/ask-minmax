We address Bessel photonic lattices of radial symmetry imprinted in cubic
Kerr-type nonlinear media and show that they support families of stable
dipole-mode solitons featuring two out-of-phase light spots located in
different lattice rings. We show that the radial symmetry of the Bessel
lattices afford a variety of unique soliton dynamics including controlled
radiation-free rotation of the dipole-mode solitons.
