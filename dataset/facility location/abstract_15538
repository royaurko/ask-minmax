We report on simulations of layered superconductors using the
Lawrence-Doniach model in the framework of the lowest Landau level
approximation. We find a first order phase transition with a $B(T)$ dependence
which agrees very well with the experimental ``melting'' line in YBaCuO. The
transition is not associated with vortex lattice melting, but separates two
vortex liquid states characterised by different degrees of short-range
crystalline order and different length scales of correlations between vortices
in different layers. The transition line ends at a critical end-point at low
fields. We find the magnetization discontinuity and the location of the lower
critical magnetic field to be in good agreement with experiments in YBaCuO.
Length scales of order parameter correlations parallel and perpendicular to the
magnetic field increase exponentially as 1/T at low temperatures. The dominant
relaxation time scales grow roughly exponentially with these correlation
lengths. We find that the first order phase transition persists in the presence
of weak random point disorder but can be suppressed entirely by strong
disorder. No vortex glass or Bragg glass state is found in the presence of
disorder. The consistency of our numerical results with various experimental
features in YBaCuO, including the dependence on anisotropy, and the temperature
dependence of the structure factor at the Bragg peaks in neutron scattering
experiments is demonstrated.
