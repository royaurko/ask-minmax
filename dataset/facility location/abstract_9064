We present maps of the Galactic X-ray Halo and constrain the location of
X-ray absorbing gas using the X-ray radiation transfer as distance a indicator.
Based on a consistent model of the soft X-ray background (SXRB) and the ROSAT
all-sky survey, we derive the morphology of some components involved in the
SXRB. In particular we focus on their spatial and temperature distributions
across the sky. Starting from our SXRB model, we extract information on the
3-dimensional composition of the X-ray emitting and absorbing material. Using
this approach, it is possible to differentiate between absorbing gas within or
behind the Galactic X-ray Halo.
