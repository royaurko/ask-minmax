We present a sample of 13 candidates for single-mode second overtone Cepheids
discovered in the 2.4 square degree area of the SMC bar during the OGLE
microlensing search. All candidates passed four photometric tests: analysis of
Fourier parameters of the light curve, R_21 and \phi_21, position in the
period-luminosity diagram and location in the color-magnitude diagram.
  The stars form a very homogeneous group of objects with very similar light
curves of low amplitude and almost sinusoidal shape. Their color indices B-V
and V-I are also very similar and the objects determine the observational blue
edge of the instability strip of the first overtone Cepheids. This is the first
firm sample of the single-mode second overtone Cepheids detected so far.
