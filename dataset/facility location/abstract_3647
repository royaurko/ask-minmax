We report the discovery of a faint L6 \pm 1 companion to the previously known
M9 dwarf, 2MASS J01303563-4445411, based on our near-infrared imaging and
spectroscopic observations with the 3m Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX
imager/spectrometer. The visual binary is separated by 3. 28 \pm 0. 05 on the
sky at a spectrophotometric distance of 40 \pm 14 pc. The projected physical
separation is 130 \pm 50 AU, making it one of the widest VLM field multiples
containing a brown dwarf companion. 2MASS J0130-4445 is only one of ten wide
VLM pairs and only one of six in the field. The secondary is considerably
fainter ({\Delta}K ~ 2.35 mag) and redder ({\Delta} (J - Ks) ~ 0.81 dex),
consistent with component near-infrared types of M9.0 \pm 0.5 and L6 \pm 1
based on our resolved spectroscopy. The component types suggest a secondary
mass well within the hydrogen-burning limit and an age-dependent mass ratio of
0.6-0.9. The system's space motion and spectroscopic indicators suggest an age
of 2-4 Gyr while the model-dependent masses and binding energies suggest that
this system is unlikely to have formed via dynamical ejection. The age,
composition, and separation of the 2MASS J01303563-4445411 system make it
useful for tests of VLM formation theories and of condensate cloud formation in
L dwarfs.
