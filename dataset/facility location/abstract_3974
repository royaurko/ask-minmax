We revisit in this paper the location of the various components observed in
the AGN of NGC1068. Discrepancies between previously published studies are
explained, and a new measurement for the absolute location of the K-band
emission peak is provided. It is found to be consistent with the position of
the central engine as derived by Gallimore (1997), Capetti (1997) and Kishimoto
(1999). A series of map overlays is then presented and discussed. Model
predictions of dusty tori show that the nuclear unresolved NIR-MIR emission is
compatible with a broad range of models: the nuclear SED alone does not
strongly constrain the torus geometry, while placing reasonable constraints on
its size and thickness. The extended MIR emission observed within the ionizing
cone is shown to be well explained by the presence of optically thick dust
clouds exposed to the central engine radiation and having a small covering
factor. Conversely, a distribution of diffuse dust particles within the
ionizing cone is discarded. A simple model for the H2 and CO emission observed
perpendicularly to the axis of the ionizing cone is proposed. We show that a
slight tilt between the molecular disc and the Compton thick central absorber
naturally reproduces the observed distribution of H2 of CO emission.
