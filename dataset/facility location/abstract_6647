In this paper, a lower bound is determined in the minimax sense for change
point estimators of the first derivative of a regression function in the
fractional white noise model. Similar minimax results presented previously in
the area focus on change points in the derivatives of a regression function in
the white noise model or consider estimation of the regression function in the
presence of correlated errors.
