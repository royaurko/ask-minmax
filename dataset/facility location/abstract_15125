The surroundings of globular clusters in the outer halo are one of the best
places to look for the remnants of ancient dwarf satellites. The classical
Searle & Zinn (1978) scenario of the formation of the Milky Way, in which the
halo globular clusters formed in larger dwarf galaxies, can nowadays be
considered the local manifestation of the hierarchical galaxy formation. It is
now well known that some Galactic globular clusters are actually associated
with the tidal stellar stream resulting from the accretion of dwarf satellites,
thereby confirming that this process plays an important role in the building of
the Milky Way globular cluster system. Furthermore, several recent studies have
suggested that the two most luminous Galactic globular clusters (M54,
associated with Sagittarius and Omega Centauri) might be the nuclei of dwarf
galaxies. Extending previous suggestions, van den Bergh (2000) has argued that
the ``young'' globulars located in the outer halo might be the nuclei of
extinct dwarf galaxies and suggests that a search for evidence of this may
prove worthwhile. If these clusters formed within larger stellar systems, we
would expect to find them surrounded by a stellar population that should be
revealed by deep photometry over a wide field. In this paper, we present the
first (most interesting) preliminary results from a long term project designed
to search for tidal debris around remote halo globular clusters, debris that
may be the vestiges of the larger systems in which these clusters formed.
