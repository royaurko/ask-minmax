We explore near $\pm m$ the discrete spectrum generated by complex
perturbations in $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^3,\mathbb{C}^4)$ of the three-dimensional
Dirac operator $$\alpha \cdot (-i\nabla - \textbf{A}) + m \beta$$ with
non-constant magnetic fields. Here $\alpha := (\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3)$ and
$\beta$ are the $4 \times 4$ standard Dirac matrices and $m > 0$ is the mass of
a particle. We give a simple criterion for the potentials to generate discrete
spectrum near $\pm m$. In the case of creation of discrete spectrum this
criterion gives also the location of the discrete eigenvalues. Further, sharp
upper bounds are obtained on the number of the discrete eigenvalues in annulus
near $\pm m$.
