We present K band photometry of the region including the radio error box of
the soft X-ray transient 4U 1630-47 during its 1998 outburst. We detect a
variable source at K=16.1 mag located inside the radio error circle which we
identify as the counterpart to the X-ray source. We discuss the properties of
the source, and conclude that it is most likely a black-hole X-ray binary
similar to 4U 1543-47, GRO J1655-40 or SAX J1819.3-2525, containing a
relatively early-type secondary.
