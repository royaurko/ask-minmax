On 2010 August 1, a global solar event was launched involving almost the
entire Earth-facing side of the Sun. This event mainly consisted of a C3.2
flare, a polar crown filament eruption and two Earth-directed coronal mass
ejections (CMEs). The observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) showed that all the
activities were coupled together, suggesting a global character of the magnetic
eruption. We reconstruct the three-dimensional geometry of the polar crown
filament using observations from three different viewpoints (STEREO A, B and
SDO) for the first time. The filament undergoes two eruption processes.
Firstly, the main body of the filament rises up, while it also moves towards
the low-latitude region with a change in inclination by 48 degree and expands
only in the altitudinal and latitudinal direction in the field of view of
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. We investigate the true velocities and
accelerations of different locations along the filament, and find that the
highest location always has the largest acceleration during this eruption
process. During the late phase of the first eruption, part of the filament
material separates from the eastern leg. This material displays a projectile
motion and moves towards the west at a constant velocity of 141.8 km/s. This
may imply that the polar crown filament consists of at least two groups of
magnetic systems.
