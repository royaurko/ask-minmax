The MINERvA experiment is aimed at precisely measuring the cross-sections for
various neutrino interaction channels. It is located at Fermilab in the
underground cavern in front of MINOS near detector. MINERvA is a fine-grained
scintillator with electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry regions. There are
various nuclear targets located inside and in front of the detector for
studying nuclear medium effects in neutrino-induced interactions. The
installation was completed in March 2010 and since then the detector has been
collecting data. In this paper, the method for determining the neutrino flux is
described in detail with the associated uncertainties as well as the techniques
for their reduction. The general structure of the detector is given with the
emphasis on the nuclear targets region. Preliminary results related to nuclear
effects studies are presented followed by their discussion and future plans.
