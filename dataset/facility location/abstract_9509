We present VI photometry of the metal-poor inner halo globular clusters
NGC6293 and NGC6541 using the planetary camera of the WFPC2 on board HST. Our
color-magnitude diagrams of the clusters show well-defined BHB populations,
consistent with their low metallicities and old ages. NGC6293 appears to have
blue straggler stars in the cluster's central region. We discuss the
interstellar reddening and the distance modulus of NGC6293 and NGC6541 and
obtain E(B-V) = 0.40 and (m-M)_0 = 14.61 for NGC6293 and E(B-V) = 0.14 and
(m-M)_0 = 14.19 for NGC6541. Our results confirm that NGC6293 and NGC6541 are
clearly located in the Galaxy's central regions (R_{GC} < 3 kpc). We also
discuss the differential reddening across NGC6293. The interstellar reddening
value of NGC6293 appears to vary by Delta E(B-V) ~ 0.02 -- 0.04 mag within our
small field of view.
  The most notable result of our study is that the inner halo clusters NGC6293
and NGC6541 essentially have the same ages as M92, confirming the previous
result from the HST NIC3 observations of NGC6287.
