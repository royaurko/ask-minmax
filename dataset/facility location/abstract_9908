We report the observation of anomalies in the longitudinal magnetoresistance
of tensile-strained (Ga,Mn)As epilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.
Magnetoresistance measurements carried out in the planar geometry (magnetic
field parallel to the current density) reveal "spikes" that are antisymmetric
with respect to the direction of the magnetic field. These anomalies always
occur during magnetization reversal, as indicated by a simultaneous change in
sign of the anomalous Hall effect. The data suggest that the antisymmetric
anomalies originate in anomalous Hall effect contributions to the longitudinal
resistance when domain walls are located between the voltage probes. This
interpretation is reinforced by carrying out angular sweeps of $\vec{H}$,
revealing an antisymmetric dependence on the helicity of the field sweep.
