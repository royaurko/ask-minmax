We have used the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) to measure the
Galactic HI 21-cm line absorption towards 102 extragalactic radio continuum
sources, located at high (|b| >15deg.) Galactic latitudes. The Declination
coverage of the present survey is Decl. ~ -45deg.. With a mean rms optical
depth of ~0.003, this is the most sensitive Galactic HI 21-cm line absorption
survey to date. To supplement the absorption data, we have extracted the HI
21-cm line emission profiles towards these 102 lines of sight from the Leiden
Dwingeloo Survey of Galactic neutral hydrogen. We have carried out a Gaussian
fitting analysis to identify the discrete absorption and emission components in
these profiles. In this paper, we present the spectra and the components. A
subsequent paper will discuss the interpretation of these results.
