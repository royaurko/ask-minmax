PARS (Plasma Acceleration Research Station) is an electron beam driven plasma
wakefield acceleration test stand proposed for VELA/CLARA facility in Daresbury
Laboratory. In order to optimise various operational configurations, 2D
numerical studies were performed by using VSIM for a range of parameters such
as bunch length, radius, plasma density and positioning of the bunches with
respect to each other for the two-beam acceleration scheme. In this paper, some
of these numerical studies and considered measurement methods are presented.
