The Eurybates family is a compact core inside the Menelaus clan, located in
the L4 swarm of Jupiter Trojans. Fornasier et al. (2007) found that this family
exhibits a peculiar abundance of spectrally flat objects, similar to
Chiron-like Centaurs and C-type main belt asteroids. On the basis of the
visible spectra available in literature, Eurybates family's members seemed to
be good candidates for having on their surfaces water/water ice or aqueous
altered materials. To improve our knowledge of the surface composition of this
peculiar family, we carried out an observational campaign at the Telescopio
Nazionale Galileo (TNG), obtaining near-infrared spectra of 7 members. Our data
show a surprisingly absence of any spectral feature referable to the presence
of water, ices or aqueous altered materials on the surface of the observed
objects. Models of the surface composition are attempted, evidencing that
amorphous carbon seems to dominate the surface composition of the observed
bodies and some amount of silicates (olivine) could be present.
