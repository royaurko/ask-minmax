Photoproduction of mesons is an excellent tool for the study of nucleon
resonances. Complementary to pion induced reactions, photoproduction on the
free proton contributes to the determination of the basic properties of nucleon
resonances like excitation energy, decay widths, spin, and the coupling to the
photon. Photoproduction from light nuclei, in particular from the deuteron,
reveals the isospin structure of the electromagnetic excitation of the nucleon.
During the last few years, progress in this field has been substantial. New
accelerator facilities combined with state-of-the-art detector technologies
have pushed the experiments to unprecedented sensitivity and precision. The
experimental progress has been accompanied by new developments for the reaction
models, necessary to extract the properties of the nucleon states, and for
modern hadron models which try to connect these properties to QCD. The emphasis
of this review lies on the experimental side and focuses on experiments aiming
at precise studies of the low-lying nucleon resonances.
