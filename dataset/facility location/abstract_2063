The parity nonconservation (PNC) effect on the laser-induced 2^3S_1 - 2^1S_0
transition in heavy heliumlike ions is considered. A simple analytical formula
for the PNC correction to the cross section is derived for the case, when the
opposite-parity 2^1S_0 and 2^3P_0 states are almost degenerate and, therefore,
the PNC effect is strongly enhanced. Numerical results are presented for
heliumlike gadolinium and thorium, which seem most promising candidates for
such kind of experiments. In both Gd and Th cases the photon energy required
will be anticipated with a high-energy laser built at GSI. Alternatively, it
can be gained with ultraviolet lasers utilizing relativistic Doppler tuning at
FAIR facilities in Darmstadt.
