With high-angular-resolution, near-infrared observations of the young stellar
object T Tauri at the end of 2002, we show that, contrary to previous reports,
none of the three infrared components of T Tau coincide with the compact radio
source that has apparently been ejected recently from the system (Loinard,
Rodriguez, and Rodriguez 2003). The compact radio source and one of the three
infrared objects, T Tau Sb, have distinct paths that depart from orbital or
uniform motion between 1997 and 2000, perhaps indicating that their interaction
led to the ejection of the radio source. The path that T Tau Sb took between
1997 and 2003 may indicate that this star is still bound to the presumably more
massive southern component, T Tau Sa. The radio source is absent from our
near-infrared images and must therefore be fainter than K = 10.2 (if located
within 100 mas of T Tau Sb, as the radio data would imply), still consistent
with an identity as a low-mass star or substellar object.
