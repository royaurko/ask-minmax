A tau lepton can be produced in a charged current interaction by cosmic ray
tau neutrino with material inside a mountain. If it escapes from the mountain,
it will decay and initiate a shower in the air, which can be detected by an air
shower fluorescence/Cherenkov light detector. Designed according to such a
principle, the Cosmic Ray Tau Neutrino Telescope (CRTNT) experiment, located at
the foothill of Mt. Balikun in Xinjiang, China, will search for very
high-energy cosmic tau neutrinos from energetic astrophysical sources by
detecting those showers. This paper describes a Monte Carlo simulation for a
detection of tau neutrino events by the CRTNT experiment. Ultra-high-energy
cosmic ray events are also simulated to estimate the potential contamination.
With the CRTNT experiment composed of four detector stations, each covering 64
by 14 degrees field of view, the expected event rates are 28.6, 21.9 and 4.7
per year assuming AGN neutrino flux according to Semikoz et. al. 2004, MPR AGN
jet model and SDSS AGN core model, respectively. Null detection of such tau
event by the CRTNT experiment in one year could set 90% C.L. upper limit at
19.9 (eV^-1 cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1) for E^-2 neutrino spectrum.
