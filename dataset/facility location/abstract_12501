Over the past 3 years, Auckland University of Technology has established the
first radio astronomical observatory in New Zealand, which, because of its
remote geographic location, has quickly become a member of a number of
international VLBI networks, in particular the IVS and the LBA. Not only has
this added significantly to the observational power in the Pacific and Oceania,
but by utilising new fibre connections within New Zealand, and across the
Pacific and the Tasman Sea, the New Zealand radio telescopes have now been
linked to many in Australia, Asia and the Pacific. Recent astronomical results
are presented and plans for widening New Zealand participation in Australasian,
Asia-Pacific and global VLBI research and development are outlined. Real-time
e-VLBI is a vital part of New Zealand's capability development towards the SKA.
The rapid and challenging establishment of New Zealand radio astronomy can
serve as a model for the engagement in mega-Science and e-Science by
resource-limited institutions and nations. Perspectives for collaboration
between New Zealand and Thailand in the field of radio astronomy are included.
