We report the first ultrafast pulse radiolysis transient absorption
spectroscopy measurements from the Terawatt Ultrafast High Field Facility
(TUHFF) at Argonne National Laboratory. TUHFF houses a 20 TW Ti:sapphire laser
system that generates 2.5 nC sub-picosecond pulses of multi-MeV electrons at 10
Hz using laser wakefield acceleration. The system has been specifically
optimized for kinetic measurements in a pump-probe fashion. This requires
averaging over many shots which necessitates stable, reliable generation of
electron pulses. The latter were used to generate excess electrons in pulse
radiolysis of liquid water and concentrated solutions of perchloric acid. The
hydronium ions in the acidic solutions react with the hydrated electrons
resulting in the rapid decay of the transient absorbance at 800 nm on the
picosecond time scale. Time resolution of a few picoseconds has been
demonstrated. The current time resolution is determined primarily by the
physical dimensions of the sample and the detection sensitivity. Subpicosecond
time resolution can be achieved by using thinner samples, more sensitive
detection techniques and improved electron beam quality.
