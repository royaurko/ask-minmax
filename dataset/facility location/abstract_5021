According to the recent rulings of the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC), TV white spaces (TVWS) can now be accessed by secondary users (SUs)
after a list of vacant TV channels is obtained via a geo-location database.
Proper business models are therefore essential for database operators to manage
geo-location databases. Database access can be simultaneously priced under two
different schemes: the registration scheme and the service plan scheme. In the
registration scheme, the database reserves part of the TV bandwidth for
registered White Space Devices (WSDs). In the service plan scheme, the WSDs are
charged according to their queries. In this paper, we investigate the business
model for the TVWS database under a hybrid pricing scheme. We consider the
scenario where a database operator employs both the registration scheme and the
service plan scheme to serve the SUs. The SUs' choices of different pricing
schemes are modeled as a non-cooperative game and we derive distributed
algorithms to achieve Nash Equilibrium (NE). Considering the NE of the SUs, the
database operator optimally determines pricing parameters for both pricing
schemes in terms of bandwidth reservation, registration fee and query plans.
