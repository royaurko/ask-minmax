Fault identification and testing has always been the most specific concern in
the field of software development. To identify and testify the bug we should be
aware of the source of the failure or any unwanted issue. In this paper, we are
trying to extract the location of failure and trying to cope up with the bug.
Using directed graph, we tried to obtain the dependency of multiple activities
in live environment to trace the origin of fault. Software development comes up
with series of activities and we tried to show the dependency of multiple
activities on each other. Critical activities are considered as they cause
abnormal functioning of the whole system. The paper discuss about the
priorities of activities of dependency of software failure on the critical
activities. Matrix representation of activities as part of the software is
chosen to determine root of the failure using concept of dependency. It can
vary with the topography of network and software environment. When faults
occur, the possible symptoms will be reflected in the dependency matrix with
high probability in fault itself. Thus, independent faults are located in the
main diagonal of dependency matrix.
