In tau physics, we are at the frontier between the completion of the LEP
program and the start of analyses from b-factories, which are expected to
produce results in the coming years. Nice results from CLEO are steadily
delivered in the meantime. For charm, impressive progress have been achieved by
fixed target experiments in the search for CP violation and D^0 - \bar D^0
oscillations. First results from b-factories demonstrate the power of these
facilities in such areas. The novel measurement of the D* width by CLEO happens
to be rather different from current expectations. The absence of a charm
factory explains the lack or the very slow progress in the absolute scale
determinations for charm decays.
