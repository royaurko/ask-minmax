Recent measurements of the Chandra satellite have shown that a supermassive
black hole of $M = 2.6 \times 10^{6} M_{\odot}$ is located in the Galactic
Center; it seems probable that, from other observations, this fact is common in
the majority of galaxies. On the other hand, GRB explosions are typical
phenomenon linked to the galactic dynamics. In the present paper we discuss the
possibility that GRBs are tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes
located in the center of galaxies. This conjecture can be tested by a
gravitational wave detector of the class of AURIGA.
