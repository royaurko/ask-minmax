We review recent theoretical advances on controlling the fluid-fluid phase
transition with electric fields. Using a mean-field approach, we compare the
effects of uniform versus non-uniform electric fields, and show how non-uniform
fields are better at altering the phase diagram. Focusing on non-uniform
fields, we then discuss the behavior of the fluid concentration profile and the
parameters (temperature, fluid concentration, etc.) that control the location
of the fluid-fluid interface from both equilibrium and dynamic perspectives.
