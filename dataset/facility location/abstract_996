Extreme star formation includes star formation in starbursts and regions
forming super star clusters. We survey the current problems in our
understanding of the star formation process in starbursts and super star
clusters - initial mass functions, cluster mass functions, star formation
efficiencies, and radiative feedback into molecular clouds - that are critical
to our understanding of the formation and survival of large star clusters,
topics that will be the drivers of the observations of the next decade.
