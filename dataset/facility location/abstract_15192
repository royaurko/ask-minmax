In this Letter, we report the discovery of a new dwarf satellite to the Milky
Way, located at ($\alpha_{2000}, \delta_{2000}$) $=$ (158.72,51.92) in the
constellation of Ursa Major. This object was detected as an overdensity of red,
resolved stars in Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. The color-magnitude diagram of
the Ursa Major dwarf looks remarkably similar to that of Sextans, the lowest
surface brightness Milky Way companion known, but with approximately an order
of magnitude fewer stars. Deeper follow-up imaging confirms this object has an
old and metal-poor stellar population and is $\sim$ 100 kpc away. We roughly
estimate M$_V =$ -6.75 and $r_{1/2} =$ 250 pc for this dwarf. Its luminosity is
several times fainter than the faintest known Milky Way dwarf. However, its
physical size is typical for dSphs. Even though its absolute magnitude and size
are presently quite uncertain, Ursa Major is likely the lowest luminosity and
lowest surface brightness galaxy yet known.
