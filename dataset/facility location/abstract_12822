The low -\beta magnet systems are located in the LHC insertion regions around
the four interaction points. They are the key elements in the beams
focusing/defocusing process and will allow proton collisions at a luminosity of
up to 10**34/cm**2s. Large radiation dose deposited at the proximity of the
beam collisions dictate stringent requirements for the design and operation of
the systems. The hardware commissioning phase of the LHC was completed in the
winter of 2010 and permitted to validate this system safe operation. This paper
presents the analysis used to qualify and quantify the safe operation of the
low -\beta magnet systems in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for the first
years of operation.
