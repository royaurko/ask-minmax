The new proposals for high luminosity B/Flavor factories, near and on top of
the $\Upsilon$ resonances, allow for a detailed investigation of CP-violation
in the $\tau$-pair production. In particular, bounds on the tau electric dipole
moment can be obtained from genuine CP-odd observables related to the
$\tau$-pair production. We perform an independent analysis from low energy (10
GeV) data by means of linear spin observables. We show that, for a
longitudinally polarized electron beam, a CP-odd asymmetry, associated to the
normal polarization term, can be measured at these low energy facilities both
at resonant and non resonant energies. In this way, stringent and independent
bounds to the tau electric dipole moment, which are orders of magnitude below
other high or low energy bounds, can be obtained.
