We observe that excited hadrons provide an opportunity to probe from
experiment the power-law running of the quark mass in the mid infrared, while
the condition m(k)<k remains valid. A relatively clean analysis is possible for
the maximum spin excitations of the Delta baryons, analogous to the yrast
states in nuclei. Such states are accessible at current experimental facilities
such as ELSA and Jlab.
