The clustering properties of clusters, galaxies and AGN as a function of
redshift are briefly discussed. It appears that extremely red objects at z ~ 1,
and objects with J-K > 1.7 and photometric redshifts 2 < z_phot < 4 are highly
clustered, indicating that a majority of these objects constitutes the
progenitors of nearby ellipticals. Similarly clustered seem luminous radio
galaxies at z\sim 1, indicating that these objects comprise a short lived phase
in the lifetime of these red objects. The high level of clustering furthermore
suggests that distant powerful radio galaxies (e.g. z>2) might be residing in
the progenitors of nearby clusters -- proto-clusters. A number of observational
projects targetting fields with distant radio galaxies, including studies of
Lya and Ha emitters, Lyman break galaxies and (sub)mm and X-ray emitters, all
confirm that such radio galaxies are located in such proto-clusters. Estimates
of the total mass of the proto-clusters are similar to the masses of local
clusters. If the total star formation rate which we estimate for the entire
proto-clusters is sustained up to z~1, the metals in the hot cluster gas of
local clusters can easily be accounted for.
