Slowly extracted relativistic beams of light nuclei and a beam transportation
line net system constitute a good base for secondary nuclear beams forming at
the LHE accelerator facility. A recent years activity in the field at the
Laboratory is connected with a project on study light nuclei structure by means
the emulsion technique [1,2]. The paper shortly summarizes results of the work.
