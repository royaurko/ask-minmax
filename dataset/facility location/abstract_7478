Montage is a portable software toolkit for constructing custom, science-grade
mosaics by composing multiple astronomical images. The mosaics constructed by
Montage preserve the astrometry (position) and photometry (intensity) of the
sources in the input images. The mosaic to be constructed is specified by the
user in terms of a set of parameters, including dataset and wavelength to be
used, location and size on the sky, coordinate system and projection, and
spatial sampling rate. Many astronomical datasets are massive, and are stored
in distributed archives that are, in most cases, remote with respect to the
available computational resources. Montage can be run on both single- and
multi-processor computers, including clusters and grids. Standard grid tools
are used to run Montage in the case where the data or computers used to
construct a mosaic are located remotely on the Internet. This paper describes
the architecture, algorithms, and usage of Montage as both a software toolkit
and as a grid portal. Timing results are provided to show how Montage
performance scales with number of processors on a cluster computer. In
addition, we compare the performance of two methods of running Montage in
parallel on a grid.
