We present \xmm observations of hard X-ray emission from the field of IC443,
a supernova remnant interacting with a molecular cloud. The hard emission from
the field is dominated by 12 isolated sources having 2--10 keV flux $\ga
10^{-14}$ $\enf$. Only a fraction of the sources are expected to be
extragalactic or stars on statistical grounds, while the others may be
associated with the remnant. We have analyzed near-infrared K band and also DSS
optical data for all of the detected sources, finding that six X-ray sources
are located in a relatively small $15^\prime\times 15^\prime$ region where
there is strong 2.2 $\mu {\rm m}$ infrared emission, indicating interaction
with a molecular cloud. The source 1SAX J0618.0+2227, the brightest in this
region (excluding the plerion), is resolved with \xmm into two sources, one of
which is extended and has a hard power law spectrum photon index $\lsim$ 1.5)
and shows some indications of spectral line signatures (e.g. Si), while the
other is point-like and has a featureless spectrum of steeper photon index
$\sim$ 2.2. Possible interpretations of some of the discrete sources in terms
of interaction between the SNR and the molecular cloud are discussed.
