We study the hydrodynamical expansion of a hot and baryon-dense quark fluid
coupled to classical real-time evolution of the long wavelength modes of the
chiral field. Significant density inhomogeneities develop dynamically when the
transition to the symmetry-broken state occurs. We find that the amplitude of
the density inhomogeneities is larger for expansion trajectories crossing the
line of first-order transitions than for crossovers, which could provide some
information on the location of a critical point. A few possible experimental
signatures for inhomogeneous decoupling surfaces are mentioned briefly.
