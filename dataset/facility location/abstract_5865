The properties of the archetypal Co/Cu giant magnetoresistance (GMR)
spin-valve structure have been modified by the insertion of very thin
(sub-monolayer) $\delta$-layers of various elements at different points within
the Co layers, and at the Co/Cu interface. Different effects are observed
depending on the nature of the impurity, its position within the periodic
table, and its location within the spin-valve. The GMR can be strongly enhanced
or suppressed for various specific combinations of these parameters, giving
insight into the microscopic mechanisms giving rise to the GMR.
