The formation and field response of head-to-head domain walls in curved
permalloy wires, fabricated to contain a single anti-notch, have been
investigated using Lorentz microscopy. High spatial resolution maps of the
vector induction distribution in domain walls close to the anti-notch have been
derived and compared with micromagnetic simulations. In wires of 10 nm
thickness the walls are typically of a modified asymmetric transverse wall
type. Their response to applied fields tangential to the wire at the anti-notch
location was studied. The way the wall structure changes depends on whether the
field moves the wall away from or further into the notch. Higher fields are
needed and much more distorted wall structures are observed in the latter case,
indicating that the anti-notch acts as an energy barrier for the domain wall.
