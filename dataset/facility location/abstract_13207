Magnetic reconnection associated to the double tearing mode (DTM) is
investigated by means of resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RRMHD)
simulations. A linearly unstable double current sheet system in two dimensional
cartesian geometry is considered. For initial perturbations of large enough
longitudinal wavelengths, a fast reconnection event is triggered by a secondary
instability that is structurally driven by the nonlinear evolution of the
magnetic islands. The latter reconnection phase and time scale appear to weakly
depend on the plasma resistivity and magnetization parameter. We discuss the
possible role of such explosive reconnection dynamics to explain the MeV flares
observed in the Crab pulsar nebula. Indeed the time scale and the critical
minimum wavelength give constraints on the Lorentz factor of the striped wind
and on the location of the emission region respectively.
