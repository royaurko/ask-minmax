Motivated by the energy representation of Riemannian metric, in this paper we
study different approaches toward the geometrical concept of black hole
thermodynamics. We investigate thermodynamical Ricci scalar of Weinhold,
Ruppeiner and Quevedo metrics and show that their number and location of
divergences do not coincide with phase transition points arisen from heat
capacity. Next, we introduce a new metric to solve these problems. We show that
the denominator of the Ricci scalar of the new metric contains terms which
coincide with different types of phase transitions. We elaborate the
effectiveness of the new metric and shortcomings of the previous metrics with
some examples. Furthermore, we find a characteristic behavior of the new
thermodynamical Ricci scalar which enables one to distinguish two types of
phase transitions. In addition, we generalize the new metric for the cases of
more than two extensive parameters and show that in these cases the
divergencies of thermodynamical Ricci scalar coincide with phase transition
points of the heat capacity.
