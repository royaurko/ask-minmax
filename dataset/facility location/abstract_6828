Production factories in which stable voltage is critical, e.g.,
electro-plating factory, require constantly stable voltage to minimize loss by
adjusting incoming voltage in real time, even if low-quality electricity is
supplied from outside. To solve such problem often being raised from the
factories located in the area with unstable electricity supply, we designed N-M
switching control system and verified its correctness using LTL model checking
technique.
