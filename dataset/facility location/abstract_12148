We consider the random matrix model with external source, in case where the
potential V(x) is an even polynomial and the external source has two
eigenvalues a, -a of equal multiplicity. We show that the limiting mean
eigenvalue distribution of this model can be characterized as the first
component of a pair of measures (mu_1,mu_2) that solve a constrained vector
equilibrium problem. The proof is based on the steepest descent analysis of the
associated Riemann-Hilbert problem for multiple orthogonal polynomials.
  We illustrate our results in detail for the case of a quartic double well
potential V(x) = x^4/4 - tx^2/2. We are able to determine the precise location
of the phase transitions in the ta-plane, where either the constraint becomes
active, or the two intervals in the support come together (or both).
