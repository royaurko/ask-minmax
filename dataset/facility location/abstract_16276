Here we show that Iapetus can serve to discriminate between satellite
formation models. Its accretion history can be understood in terms of a
two-component gaseous subnebula, with a relatively dense inner region, and an
extended tail out to the location of the irregular satellites, as in the SEMM
model of Mosqueira and Estrada (2003a,b). Following giant planet formation,
planetesimals in the feeding zone of Jupiter and Saturn become dynamically
excited, and undergo a collisional cascade. Ablation and capture of
planetesimal fragments crossing the gaseous circumplanetary disks delivers
enough collisional rubble to account for the mass budgets of the regular
satellites of Jupiter and Saturn. This process can result in rock/ice
fractionation provided the make up of the population of disk crossers is
non-homogeneous, thus offering a natural explanation for the marked
compositional differences between outer solar nebula objects and those that
accreted in the subnebulae of the giant planets. Consequently, our model leads
to an enhancement of the ice content of Iapetus, and to a lesser degree those
of Ganymede, Titan and Callisto, and accounts for the (non-stochastic)
compositions of these large, low-porosity outer regular satellites of Jupiter
and Saturn. (abridged)
