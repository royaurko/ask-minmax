The galactic Cepheid S Muscae has recently been added to the important list
of Cepheids linked to open clusters, in this case the sparse young cluster ASCC
69. Low-mass members of a young cluster are expected to have rapid rotation and
X-ray activity, making X-ray emission an excellent way to discriminate them
from old field stars. We have made an XMM-Newton observation centered on S Mus
and identified (Table 1) a population of X-ray sources whose near-IR 2MASS
counterparts lie at locations in the J, (J-K) color-magnitude diagram
consistent with cluster membership at the distance of S Mus. Their median
energy and X-ray luminosity are consistent with young cluster members as
distinct from field stars. These strengthen the association of S Mus with the
young cluster, making it a potential Leavitt Law (Period-Luminosity relation)
calibrator.
