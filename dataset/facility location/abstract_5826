In this paper we will give a short rewiew about the conductance of a
mesoscopic waveguide strip with a few impurities. Green-function method is used
allowing to treat systems with low number of impurities, not only the completly
clean case. Investigating a wire containing Dirac-delta potentials (modelling
the impurities) we found that increasing number of impurities can cause a
transition of the structure of conductance. The staircase like structure of the
clean system vanishes and the conductance of a system containing finite number
of impurities located periodically will be determined by the band structure of
