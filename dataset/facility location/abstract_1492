We report on a limited search for pure-rotational molecular hydrogen emission
associated with young, pre-main-sequence stars. We looked for H_2 v=0 J = 3->1
and J = 4->2 emission in the mid-infrared using the Texas Echelon-Cross-Echelle
Spectrograph (TEXES) at NASA's 3m Infrared Telescope Facility. The high
spectral and spatial resolution of our observations lead to more stringent
limits on narrow line emission close to the source than previously achieved.
One star, AB Aur, shows a possible (2sigma) H_2 detection, but further
observations are required to make a confident statement. Our non-detections
suggest that a significant fraction, perhaps all, of previously reported H_2
emission towards these objects could be extended on scales of 5" or more.
