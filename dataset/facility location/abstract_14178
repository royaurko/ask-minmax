A sample of 70 E+A galaxies are selected from 37, 206 galaxies in the second
data release (DR2) of Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope
(LAMOST) according to the criteria for E+A galaxies defined by Goto, and each
of these objects is further visually identified. In this sample, most objects
are low redshift E+A galaxies with z < 0.25, and locate in the high latitude
sky area with magnitude among 14 to 18 mag in g, r and i bands. A stellar
population analysis for the whole sample indicates that the E+A galaxies are
characterized by both young and old stellar populations (SPs), and the
metal-rich SPs have relatively higher contributions than the metal-poor ones.
Additionally, a morphological classification for these objects is performed
based on the images taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
