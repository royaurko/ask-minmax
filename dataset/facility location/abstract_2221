The coming years will see routine use of solar data of unprecedented spatial
and spectral resolution, time cadence, and completeness in the wavelength
domain. To capitalize on the soon to be available radio facilities such as the
expanded OVSA, SSRT and FASR, and the challenges they present in the
visualization and synthesis of the multi-frequency datasets, we propose that
realistic, sophisticated 3D active region and flare modeling is timely now and
will be a forefront of coronal studies over the coming years. Here we summarize
our 3D modeling efforts, aimed at forward fitting of imaging spectroscopy data,
and describe currently available 3D modeling tools. We also discuss plans for
future generalization of our modeling tools.
