The Tianshan Radio Experiment for Neutrino Detection (TREND) is a sino-french
collaboration (CNRS/IN2P3 and Chinese Academy of Science) developing an
autonomous antenna array for the detection of high energy Extensive Air Showers
(EAS) on the site of the 21CMA radio observatory. The autonomous detection and
identification of EAS was achieved by TREND on a prototype array in 2009. This
result was confirmed soon after when EAS radio-candidates could be tagged as
cosmic ray events by an array of particle detectors running in parallel at the
same location. This result is an important milestone for TREND, and more
generally, for the maturation of the EAS radio-detection technique. The array
is presently composed of 50 antennas covering a total area of ~1.2 km^2,
running in steady conditions since March 2011. We are presently processing the
data to identify EAS radio-candidates. In a long term perspective, TREND is
intended to search for high energy tau neutrinos. Here we only report on the
results achieved so far by TREND.
