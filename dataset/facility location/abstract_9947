Numerical calculations of lattice thermal conductivity are reported for the
binary alloys NiPd and NiPt. The present work is a continuation of an earlier
paper by us [PRB, 72, 214207 (2005)]which had developed a theoretical framework
for the calculation of configuration-averaged lattice thermal conductivity and
thermal diffusivity in disordered alloys. The formulation was based on the
augmented space theorem combined with a scattering diagram technique. In this
paper we shall show dependence of the lattice thermal conductivity on a series
of variables like phonon frequency, temperature and alloy composition. The
temperature dependence of $\kappa(T)$ and its realtion to the measured thermal
conductivity is discussed. The concentration dependence of $\kappa$ appears to
justify the notion of a minimum thermal conductivity as discussed by Kittel,
Slack and others. We also study the frequency and composition dependence of the
thermal diffusivity averaged over modes. A numerical estimate of this quantity
gives an idea about the location of mobility edge and the fraction of states in
the frequency spectrum which is delocalized.
