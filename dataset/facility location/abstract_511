Let $t_1,\ldots,t_n \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and consider the location recovery
problem: given a subset of pairwise direction observations $\{(t_i - t_j) /
\|t_i - t_j\|_2\}_{i<j \in [n] \times [n]}$, where a constant fraction of these
observations are arbitrarily corrupted, find $\{t_i\}_{i=1}^n$ up to a global
translation and scale. We propose a novel algorithm for the location recovery
problem, which consists of a simple convex program over $dn$ real variables. We
prove that this program recovers a set of $n$ i.i.d. Gaussian locations exactly
and with high probability if the observations are given by an \erdosrenyi
graph, $d$ is large enough, and provided that at most a constant fraction of
observations involving any particular location are adversarially corrupted. We
also prove that the program exactly recovers Gaussian locations for $d=3$ if
the fraction of corrupted observations at each location is, up to
poly-logarithmic factors, at most a constant. Both of these recovery theorems
are based on a set of deterministic conditions that we prove are sufficient for
exact recovery.
