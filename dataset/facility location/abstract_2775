This paper is a sequel to the series of papers [gr-qc/9409010, gr-qc/9505034,
gr-qc/9603022, gr-qc/9609035, gr-qc/9609046, gr-qc/9704033, gr-qc/9704038,
gr-qc/9708014], being an immediate continuation and supplement to the last of
them, where gravitational autolocalization of a body has been considered. A
resulting solution, which describes a one-place location, has been called
gravilon. Here it is shown that a gravilon is the only solution, i.e., that
many-place gravitational autolocalization is unreal. This is closely related to
nonreality of tunneling in the conditions under consideration.
