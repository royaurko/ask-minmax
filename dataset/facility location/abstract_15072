We have carried out a sensitive search for OH (1720 MHz) masers in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) toward five regions using the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA). Our source list includes the 30 Doradus region, and four
supernova remnants (SNRs): N44, N49, N120, and N132D. These data have a typical
resolution of ~8 arcsec and rms noise levels of 5-10 mJy/beam. We have detected
OH (1720 MHz) masers in the NE part of 30 Doradus and toward the SNR N49. The
OH (1720 MHz) maser emission in 30 Doradus is coincident with a cluster of
young stars known as ``Knot 1'', and is almost certainly of the star formation
variety. Our spectral resolution (0.68 km/s) is insufficient to detect the
Zeeman effect from the strongest (320 mJy/beam) of the 30 Doradus OH (1720 MHz)
masers, leading to an upper limit to the field strength of 6 mG. The weak OH
(1720 MHz) maser emission (35 mJy/beam) detected toward the LMC SNR N49 is
located just west of a previously identified CO cloud, and are indicative of an
interaction between the SNR and the molecular cloud. Although the statistics
are low, the detection rate seems consistent with that seen for Galactic star
forming regions and SNR type OH (1720 MHz) masers -- both of which are low.
