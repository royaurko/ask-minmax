We report measurements of the electron temperature at about a dozen locations
in the extended emission-line regions of five active (Seyfert and radio)
galaxies. Temperatures (T_{[OIII]} and T_{[NII]}) have been determined from
both the I([OIII]\lambda4363)/I([OIII]\lambda5007) and
I([NII]\lambda5755)/I[NII]\lambda6583) ratios. T_{[OIII]} lies in the
range (1.0 -- 1.7) \times 10^{4}K. We find a strong trend for T_{[OIII]}
to be higher than T_{[NII]}, with the difference typically being \approx
5,000K. Because the critical density for collisional de-excitation of the
^{1}D{_2} level in NII is lower than that of the same level in OIII, the
deviations of the measured intensity ratios from those expected for
T_{[OIII]} = T_{[NII]} in the low density limit are unlikely to result from
collisional de-excitation. The measured values of T_{[OIII]} and the
differences between T_{[OIII]} and T_{[NII]} are very similar to those
found in Galactic planetary nebulae. It is argued that the dominant form of
energy input to the clouds is photoionization, but detailed modelling indicates
that the temperature difference is too large to be accounted for in terms of
photoionization of ionization-bounded clouds. We propose instead that both
matter- and ionization-bounded clouds are present in the extended emission-line
regions, with most of the [OIII] emission originating from a hot zone in the
matter-bounded clouds and essentially all of the [NII] from the
ionization-bounded clouds.
