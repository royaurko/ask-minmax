Due to the increasing concern on greenhouse gas emmissions and fossil fuel
security, Electric Vehicles (EVs) have attracted much attention in recent
years. However, the increasing popularity of EVs may cause stability issues to
the power grid if their charging behaviors are uncoordinated. In order to
address this problem, we propose a novel coordinated strategy for large-scale
EV charging. We formulate the energy trade among aggregators with locational
marginal pricing to maximize the aggregator profits and to indirectly control
the loads to reduce power network congestion. We first develop a centralized
iterative charging strategy, and then present a distributed optimization-based
heuristic to overcome the high computational complexity and user privacy
issues. To evaluate our proposed approach, a modified IEEE 118 bus testing
system is employed with 10 aggregators serving 30 000 EVs. The simulation
results indicate that our proposed approach can effectively increase the total
profit of aggregators, and enhance the power grid stability.
