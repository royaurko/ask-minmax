We report the detection of a double planetary system around HD 140718 as well
as the discovery of two long period and massive planets orbiting HD 171238 and
HD 204313. Those discoveries were made with the CORALIE Echelle spectrograph
mounted on the 1.2-m Euler Swiss telescope located at La Silla Observatory,
Chile. The planetary system orbiting the nearby G9 dwarf HD 147018 is composed
of an eccentric inner planet (e=0.47) with twice the mass of Jupiter (2.1 MJup
) and with an orbital period of 44.24 days. The outer planet is even more
massive (6.6 MJup) with a slightly eccentric orbit (e=0.13) and a period of
1008 days. The planet orbiting HD 171238 has a minimum mass of 2.6 MJup, a
period of 1523 days and an eccentricity of 0.40. It orbits a G8 dwarfs at 2.5
AU. The last planet, HD 204313 b, is a 4.0 MJup -planet with a period of 5.3
years and has a low eccentricity (e = 0.13). It orbits a G5 dwarfs at 3.1 AU.
The three parent stars are metal rich, which further strengthened the case that
massive planets tend to form around metal rich stars.
