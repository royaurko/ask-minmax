We present integrated Washington CT1 photometry of 18 bright blue objects
discovered in the dwarf galaxy UGC 7636 which is located 5'.5 southeast of the
giant elliptical galaxy NGC 4472, the brightest galaxy in the Virgo cluster.
Several lines of evidence indicate that UGC 7636 is interacting violently with
NGC 4472. These objects are very blue with colors of -0.4 < (C-T1) < 0.6, and
their magnitudes are in the range of 20.6 < T1 < 22.9 mag which corresponds to
absolute magnitudes of -10.6 < M(T1) < -8.3 mag for a distance modulus of
(m-M)o = 31.2. These objects are grouped spatially in three regions: the
central region of UGC 7636, the tidal tail region, and the HI cloud region. No
such objects were found in the counter tail region. It is concluded that these
objects are probably young star clusters which formed < 0.1Gyr ago during the
interaction between UGC 7636 and NGC 4472. Surface photometry of UGC 7636 (r <
83") shows that there is a significant excess of blue light along the tidal
tail region compared with other regions. The star clusters are bluer than the
stellar light in the tidal tail region, indicating that these clusters might
have formed later than most stars in the tidal tail region which were formed
later than most stars in the main body of the galaxy.
