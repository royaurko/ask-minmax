The polarization data of the radio galaxy NGC4869, belonging to the Coma
cluster and located in its central region, allow us to obtain information on
the structure of magnetic field associated with the cluster itself. A magnetic
field of $\sim$ 8.5 $\mu$G, tangled on scales of the order of less than 1 kpc,
is required to explain the observed fluctuations of the rotation measure. This
magnetic field is more than one order of magnitude stronger than the
equipartition value obtained for Coma C. This implies that the halo source Coma
C may not be at the equipartition. Moreover, the need of efficient
reacceleration mechanisms for the electrons radiating in Coma C is stronger.
The energy supply to the Coma C radiating electrons is probably provided by the
cluster merger process.
