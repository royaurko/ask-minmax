Because accretion-generated luminosity dominates the radiated energy of most
cataclysmic variables, they have been ``traditionally'' observed primarily at
short wavelengths. Infrared observations of cataclysmic variables contribute to
the understanding of key system components that are expected to radiate at
these wavelengths, such as the cool outer disk, accretion stream, and secondary
star. We have compiled the J, H, and Ks photometry of all cataclysmic variables
located in the sky coverage of the 2 Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) 2nd
Incremental Data Release. This data comprises 251 systems with reliably
identified near-IR counterparts and S/N > 10 photometry in one or more of the
three near-IR bands.
