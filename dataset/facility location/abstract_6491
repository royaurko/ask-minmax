We consider a spatial branching process with emigration in which children
either remain at the same site as their parents or migrate to new locations and
then found their own colonies. We are interested in asymptotics of the
partition of the total population into colonies for large populations with rare
migrations. Under appropriate regimes, we establish weak convergence of the
rescaled partition to some random measure that is constructed from the
restriction of a Poisson point measure to a certain random region, and whose
cumulant solves a simple integral equation.
