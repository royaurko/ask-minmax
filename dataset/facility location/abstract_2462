Indus-2 is a synchrotron radiation source which is operational at RRCAT,
Indore; India. It is essentially pertinent in any synchrotron radiation
facility to store the electron beam without beam loss. During the day to day
operation of Indus-2 storage ring difficulty was being faced in accumulating
higher beam current. After examining, it was found that the working point was
shifting from its desired value during accumulation. For smooth beam
accumulation, a fixed desired tune in both horizontal and vertical plane plays
a great role in avoiding the beam loss via resonance process. This demanded a
betatron tune feedback system to be put in storage ring and after putting ON
this feedback, the beam accumulation was smooth. The details of this feedback
and its working principle are described in this paper.
