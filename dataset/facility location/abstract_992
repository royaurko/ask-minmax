The MINER$\nu$A TestBeam Detector calibrations will take place in the MTEST
facility at Fermilab. It will use a beam of hadrons between 300 and 1500 MeV/c
to analyze the response of the MINERvA detector components. The aim of the
present work is to design the beam while considering radiation hazards at the
hall. To accomplish this, we are using a Monte Carlo simulation based on Geant4
and actual data taken from measurements of the elements that make up the
beamline.
