Chen et al. (1) applied three-dimensional (3D) Fourier filtering together
with equal-slope tomographic reconstruction for an observation of nearly all
the atoms in a multiply twinned platinum nanoparticle. However, their
methodology suffers from fundamental methodological flaws, as initially brought
up by a recent Communications Arising (2) and now analyzed in-depth in this
report written on June 20, 2014. The contributors of (1) read this report and wrote
a reply containing 5 points. While we have solid reasons to disagree with their
points, we will not include our responses here, and will address their first
two points using Nature's online commenting facility.
