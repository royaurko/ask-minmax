Nano particle-plasmons are attributed to quasi-static oscillation with no
wave propagation due to their subwavelength size. However, when located within
a band-gap medium (even in air if the particle is small enough), the particle
interfaces are acting as wave-mirrors, incurring small negative retardation.
The latter when compensated by a respective (short) propagation within the
particle substantiates a full-fledged resonator based on constructive
interference. This unusual wave interference in the deep subwavelength regime
(modal-volume<0.001lambda^3) significantly enhances the Q-factor, e.g. 50
compared to the quasi-static limit of 5.5.
