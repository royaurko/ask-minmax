Distribution of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from catalogs of the BATSE and
BeppoSAX space observatories relative to the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
data by Planck space mission is studied. Three methods were applied for data
analysis: 1) a histogram of CMB signal values in GRB directions, 2) mosaic
correlation maps calculated for GRB locations and CMB distribution, 3)
calculation of an average response in the area of "an average population GRB"
on the CMB map. A correlation between GRB locations and CMB fluctuations was
discovered which can be interpreted as systematic effects in the process of
observations. Besides, in averaged areas of CMB maps a difference between
distributions of average fluctuations for short and long GRBs was detected,
which can be caused by different natures of these events.
