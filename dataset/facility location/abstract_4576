We have developped a procedure for the search of periodic signals in the data
of gravitational wave detectors. We report here the analysis of one year of
data from the resonant detector Explorer, searching for pulsars located in the
Galactic Center (GC). No signals with amplitude greater than $\bar{h}=
2.9~10^{-24}$, in the range 921.32-921.38 Hz, were observed using data
collected over a time period of 95.7 days, for a source located at
$\alpha=17.70 \pm 0.01$ hours and $\delta=-29.00 \pm 0.05$ degrees. Our
procedure can be extended for any assumed position in the sky and for a more
general all-sky search, even with a frequency correction at the source due to
the spin-down and Doppler effects.
