Rapidly moving transient features have been detected in magnetic and Doppler
images of super-active region NOAA 10486 during the X17/4B flare of 28 October
2003 and the X10/2B flare of 29 October 2003. Both these flares were extremely
energetic white-light events. The transient features appeared during impulsive
phases of the flares and moved with speeds ranging from 30 to 50 km s$^{-1}$.
These features were located near the previously reported compact acoustic
\cite{Donea05} and seismic sources \cite{Zharkova07}. We examine the origin of
these features and their relationship with various aspects of the flares, {\it
viz.}, hard X-ray emission sources and flare kernels observed at different
layers - (i) photosphere (white-light continuum), (ii) chromosphere (H$\alpha$
6563\AA), (iii) temperature minimum region (UV 1600\AA), and (iv) transition
region (UV 284\AA).
