We report on the identification of a new cluster in the far halo of the M31
galaxy. The cluster, named Bologna 514 (B514) has an integrated magnitude
M_V=-8.5 +- 0.6, and a radial velocity, as estimated from two independent
low-resolution spectra, V_r=-456 +- 23 km/s, which fully confirms its
membership to the M31 system. The observed integrated spectrum is very similar
to those of classical globular clusters. Being located at ~ 4^o (~55 kpc in
projected distance) from the center of the parent galaxy, B514 is by far the
most remote M31 cluster ever discovered. Its projected position, near the
galaxy major axis, and M31-centric velocity, similar to that observed in the
outermost regions of the HI rotation curve, may indicate that it belongs to the
subsystem of M31 clusters that has been recently proposed (Morrison et al.
2004) to be part of the dynamically-cold thin disc of the galaxy.
