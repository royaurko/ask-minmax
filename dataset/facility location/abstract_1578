Computed flame motion through and between swirling eddys exhibits a maximum
advancement rate which is related to the time duration of flame motion between
eddys. This eddy spatial structure effect upon the apparent turbulent flame
speed appears to be similar to the square-root dependence observed in wrinkled
flamelet data. The rate-limiting behavior at one eddy length-scale can be
removed by inclusion of smaller eddys which reside between the larger eddys.
This large-eddy, small-eddy concept yields a recursion relation and repeated
functional iteration can be done to approximate a desired flame speed relation.
As an example, an iteration to produce $S_T \ln S_T = u'$ is given for the
range of $u'$ observed in liquid flames. Currently, the iteration process is a
post-diction of flame speed, but if a universality can be developed, then a
predictive theory of turbulent flame propagation might be achieved.
