We propose a method to control the number of species of lattice fermions
which yields new classes of minimally doubled lattice fermions. We show it is
possible to control the number of species by handling $O(a)$ Wilson-term-like
corrections in fermion actions, which we will term ``Twisted-ordering Method".
Using this method we obtain new minimally doubled actions with one exact chiral
symmetry and exact locality. We classify the known minimally doubled fermions
into two types based on the locations of the propagator poles in the Brillouin
zone.
