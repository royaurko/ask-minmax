Jefferson Lab experiment E08-007 measured the proton elastic form factor
ratio $\mu_pG_E/G_M$ in the range of $Q^2=0.3-0.7(\mathrm{GeV}/c)^2$ by recoil
polarimetry. Data were taken in 2008 at the Thomas Jefferson National
Accelerator Facility in Virginia, USA. A 1.2 GeV polarized electron beam was
scattered off a cryogenic hydrogen target. The recoil proton was detected in
the left HRS in coincidence with the elasticly scattered electrons tagged by
the BigBite spectrometer. The proton polarization was measured by the focal
plane polarimeter (FPP). In this low $Q^2$ region, previous measurement from
Jefferson Lab Hall A (LEDEX) along with various fits and calculations indicate
substantial deviations of the ratio from unity. For this new measurement, the
proposed statistical uncertainty ($<1%$) was achieved. These new results are a
few percent lower than expected from previous world data and fits, which
indicate a smaller $G_{Ep}$ at this region. Beyond the intrinsic interest in
nucleon structure, the new results also have implications in determining the
proton Zemach radius and the strangeness form factors from parity violation
experiments.
