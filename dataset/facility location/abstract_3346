The determination of the most straightforward evidence for the existence of
the Superworld requires a guide for non-experts (especially experimental
physicists) for them to make their own judgement on the value of such
predictions. For this purpose we review the most basic results of Super-Grand
unification in a simple and clear way. We focus the attention on two specific
models and their predictions. These two models represent an example of a direct
comparison between a traditional unified-theory and a string-inspired approach
to the solution of the many open problems of the Standard Model. We emphasize
that viable models must satisfy {\em all} available experimental constraints
and be as simple as theoretically possible. The two well defined supergravity
models, $SU(5)$ and $SU(5)\times U(1)$, can be described in terms of only a few
parameters (five and three respectively) instead of the more than twenty needed
in the MSSM model, \ie, the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard
Model. A case of special interest is the strict no-scale $SU(5)\times U(1)$
supergravity where all predictions depend on only one parameter (plus the
top-quark mass). A general consequence of these analyses is that supersymmetric
particles can be at the verge of discovery, lurking around the corner at
present and near future facilities. This review should help anyone distinguish
between well motivated predictions and predictions based on arbitrary choices
of parameters in undefined models.
