A series of publications of the WASA collaboration culminates in a recent
paper of Pricking, Bashkanov and Clement [1] claiming a dibaryon resonance at
2370 MeV. However, as explained here, there are logical flaws in this result. A
natural alternative arises from the reaction pd -> N N*(1440)p_s where p_s is a
spectator proton. There is supporting evidence from a recent experiment of
Mielke et al. on dp -> 3He-piplus-piminus
