The purpose of this paper is to establish L^p error estimates, a Bernstein
inequality, and inverse theorems for approximation by a space comprising
spherical basis functions located at scattered sites on the unit n-sphere. In
particular, the Bernstein inequality estimates L^p Bessel-potential Sobolev
norms of functions in this space in terms of the minimal separation and the L^p
norm of the function itself. An important step in its proof involves measuring
the L^p stability of functions in the approximating space in terms of the l^p
norm of the coefficients involved. As an application of the Bernstein
inequality, we derive inverse theorems for SBF approximation in the L^P norm.
Finally, we give a new characterization of Besov spaces on the n-sphere in
terms of spaces of SBFs.
