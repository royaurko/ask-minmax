Recent ion source developments resulted in the generation of high brilliance,
high current beams of protons and light ions. After extraction and transport
the beams with large internal space charge forces have to be captured, bunched
and preaccelerated for the injection into the following driver part of a new
generation of high intensity beam facilities for neutron sources, energy
production, transmutation e.g. A combination of RFQ and DTL is considered to be
a good solution for such a high current ion injector. Some preliminary beam
dynamics layouts have been investigated by multiparticle simulations. Basic
parameters like frequency, ion energy and sparking have been varied for the
International Fusion Material Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) scenario as an
example. The main interest was directed to high transmission, low losses and
emittance conservation. The beam matching to the RFQ is shortly discussed as
well as the matching between RFQ and DTL.
