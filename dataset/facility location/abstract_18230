The VLBA and the VLA have been used to image the continuum radio emission
from Mrk 231, a Seyfert 1 galaxy and the brightest infrared galaxy in the local
universe. The smallest scales reveal a double source less than 2 pc in extent.
The components of this central source have minimum brightness temperatures of
10^9 to 10^{10} K, spectral turnovers between 2 and 10 GHz, and appear to
define the galaxy nucleus plus the inner regions of a jet. The components may
be free-free absorbed or synchtrotron self-absorbed.
  On larger scales, the images confirm a previously known north-south triple
source extending 40 pc and elongated perpendicular to a 350-pc starburst disk.
Both lobes show evidence for free-free absorption near 2 GHz, probably due to
ionized gas with a density of 1-2 X 10^3 cm^{-3} in the innermost parts of the
starburst disk. The absorbing gas may be ionized by the active nucleus or by
local regions of enhanced star formation. The elongation of the 40-pc triple
differs by 65 deg from that of the 2-pc source. The different symmetry axes on
different scales imply strong curvature in the inner part of the radio jet.
  The radio continuum from the 350-pc disk has a spectral index near -0.4 above
1.4 GHz and is plausibly energized by a massive burst of star formation. On VLA
scales, asymmetric and diffuse emission extends for more than 25 kpc. This
emission has a steep spectrum, linear polarization exceeding 50% at some
locations, and shares the symmetry axis of the 40-pc triple. The diffuse radio
source is probably generated by energy deposition from a slow-moving nuclear
jet, which conceivably could help energize the off-nuclear starburst as well.
