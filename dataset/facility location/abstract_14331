MAGIC is a stereoscopic system of two Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes
(IACTs) located at La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain) and working in the field of
very high energy gamma-ray astronomy. It makes use of a traditional digital
trigger with an energy threshold of around 55 GeV. A novel trigger strategy,
based on the analogue sum of signals from partially overlapped patches of
pixels, leads to a lower threshold. In 2008, this principle was proven by the
detection of the Crab Pulsar at 25 GeV by MAGIC in single telescope operation.
During Winter 2013/14, a new system, based on this concept, was implemented for
stereoscopic observations after several years of development. In this
contribution the strategy of the operative stereoscopic trigger system, as well
as the first performance studies, are presented. Finally, some possible future
improvements to further reduce the energy threshold of this trigger are
addressed.
