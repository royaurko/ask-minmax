A search for $\nuebar$'s in excess of the number expected from conventional
sources has been made using the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector, located
30 m from a proton beam dump at LAMPF. A $\nuebar$ signal was detected via the
reaction $\nuebar\,p \rightarrow e^{+}\,n$ with $e^+$ energy between 36 and
$60\mev$, followed by a $\gamma$ from $np\rightarrow d\gamma$ ($2.2\mev$).
Using strict cuts to identify $\gamma$'s correlated with positrons results in a
signal of 9 events, with an expected background of $2.1 \pm 0.3$. A likelihood
fit to the entire $e^+$ sample yields a total excess of $16.4^{+9.7}_{-8.9}\pm
3.3$ events, where the second uncertainty is systematic. If this excess is
attributed to neutrino oscillations of the type $\numubar\rightarrow\nuebar$,
it corresponds to an oscillation probability of ($0.34^{+0.20}_{-0.18}\pm
0.07$)\%.
