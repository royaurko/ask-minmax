Recent progress in preparing well controlled 2D van der Waals heterojunctions
has opened up a new frontier in materials physics. In this paper we address the
intriguing energy gaps that are sometimes observed when a graphene sheet is
placed on a hexagonal boron nitride substrate, demonstrating that they are
produced by an interesting interplay between structural and electronic
properties, including electronic many-body exchange interactions. Our theory is
able to explain the observed gap behavior by accounting first for the
structural relaxation of graphene's carbon atoms when placed on a boron nitride
substrate and then for the influence of the substrate on low-energy
$\pi$-electrons located at relaxed carbon atom sites. The methods we employ can
be applied to many other van der Waals heterojunctions.
