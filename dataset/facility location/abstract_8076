A pilot study with the powerful new backend of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio
Telescope (WSRT) of two galaxy clusters at z=0.2 has revealed neutral hydrogen
emission from 39 galaxies. The volume probed for each cluster is 1.7x10^4
Mpc^3, with spatial and velocity resolutions of 54x86 kpc^2 and 19.7 km/s,
covering both clusters and the large scale structure in which they are
embedded. The spatial distribution of the HI detected galaxies is very
different for the two clusters. In Abell 963, most of the gas-rich galaxies are
located to the northeast, at 1-3 Mpc from the cluster center in projection.
Their velocities are slightly redshifted with respect to the cluster mean. This
could be a gas-rich group falling in from the front. Abell 2192 is less massive
and more diffuse, with the gas rich galaxies more uniformly spread over a large
region around the cluster. The HI masses of the detected galaxies range from
5x10^9 to 4x10^10 Msun. Some HI-rich galaxies are spatially resolved and
rudimentary rotation curves are derived, showing the prospect for Tully-Fisher
studies of different galaxy populations in these environments. Only one galaxy
is detected within a 1 Mpc radius from the center of the Butcher-Oemler cluster
Abell 963, and none of the blue B-O galaxies which are all located within the
central Mpc. The HI detected galaxies outside the central Mpc are of similar
colour and magnitude as the non-detected B-O galaxies, indicating that the blue
B-O galaxies are gas-poor compared to their counterparts in the field.
