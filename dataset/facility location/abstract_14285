After a prolonged and deep solar minimum at the end of Cycle 23, the current
Solar Cycle 24 is one of the lowest cycles. These two periods of deep minimum
and mini maximum are separated by a period of increasing solar activity. We
study the cosmic-ray intensity variation in relation with the solar activity,
heliospheric plasma and field parameters, including the heliospheric current
sheet, during these three periods (phases) of different activity level and
nature: (a) a deep minimum, (b) an increasing activity period and (c) a mini
maximum. We use neutron monitor data from stations located around the globe to
study the rigidity dependence on modulation during the two extremes, i.e.,
minimum and maximum. We also study the time lag between the cosmic-ray
intensity and various solar and interplanetary parameters separately during the
three activity phases. We also analyze the role of various parameters,
including the current sheet tilt, in modulating the cosmic-ray intensity during
the three different phases. Their relative importance and the implications of
our results are also discussed.
