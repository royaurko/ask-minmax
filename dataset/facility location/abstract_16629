This article is part of a collection that strives to collect and provide in
an unified form data about all the critical points on the scalar manifold of
SO(8)-gauged N=8 supergravity in four dimensions known so far. The vast
majority of these were obtained using the enhanced sensitivity backpropagation
method introduced by the contributor in 2008.
  This part of the collection describes 41 critical points, 7 of which have
been known for more than two decades, 8 of which were discovered recently, and
26 are novel. The residual gauge symmetries of these 41 critical points
(likely) are SO(8) with N=8 SUSY (1x), SO(7) (2x), SU(4) (1x), G2 with N=1 SUSY
(1x), SU(3)xU(1) with N=2 SUSY (1x), SO(3)xSO(3) (2x), SO(3)xU(1)xU(1) (1x),
SO(3)xU(1) (3x), SO(3) (3x), U(1)xU(1) with N=1 SUSY (1x), U(1)xU(1) without
SUSY (4x), U(1) (11x), and None (10x). Analytic conjectures (not yet proven but
overwhelmingly likely correct) are given for the locations and cosmological
constants of some critical points.
