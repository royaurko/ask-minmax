We propose a new technique, called wild binary segmentation (WBS), for
consistent estimation of the number and locations of multiple change-points in
data. We assume that the number of change-points can increase to infinity with
the sample size. Due to a certain random localisation mechanism, WBS works even
for very short spacings between the change-points and/or very small jump
magnitudes, unlike standard binary segmentation. On the other hand, despite its
use of localisation, WBS does not require the choice of a window or span
parameter, and does not lead to a significant increase in computational
complexity. WBS is also easy to code. We propose two stopping criteria for WBS:
one based on thresholding and the other based on what we term the `strengthened
Schwarz information criterion'. We provide default recommended values of the
parameters of the procedure and show that it offers very good practical
performance in comparison with the state of the art. The WBS methodology is
implemented in the R package wbs, available on CRAN. In addition, we provide a
new proof of consistency of binary segmentation with improved rates of
convergence, as well as a corresponding result for WBS.
