On 1998 November 14, Saturn and its rings occulted the star GSC 0622-00345.
We observed atmospheric immersion with NSFCAM at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's Infrared Telescope Facility on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.
Immersion occurred at 55.5\circ S planetocentric latitude. A 2.3 {\mu}m,
methane-band filter suppressed reflected sunlight. Atmospheric emersion and
ring data were not successfully obtained. We describe our observation,
light-curve production, and timing techniques, including improvements in
aperture positioning, removal of telluric scintillation effects, and timing.
Many of these techniques are known within the occultation community, but have
not been described in the reviewed literature. We present a light curve whose
signal-to-noise ratio per scale height is 267, among the best ground-based
signals yet achieved, despite a disadvantage of up to 8 mag in the stellar flux
compared to prior work.
