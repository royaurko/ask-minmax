This conference demonstrated the tremendous progress that has been made in
the last decade in our observational and theoretical understanding of compact,
young, massive star clusters. One of the Hubble Space Telescope's main
achievements was to show that these are young analogues of classical globular
clusters and form in profusion in the local universe. They are now recognized
as key players in the problems of galaxy evolution and star formation. A major
result of the conference is the commonality of the star and cluster formation
process across an astonishing range of environments and scales. With the demise
of HST, the focus of the field will probably shift to the critical early phases
of cluster formation and evolution as revealed with new infrared and radio/mm
facilities.
