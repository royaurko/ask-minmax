Phase angle-induced spectral effects are important to characterize since they
affect spectral band parameters such as band depth and band center, and
therefore skew mineralogical interpretations of planetary bodies via
reflectance spectroscopy. Dwarf planet (1) Ceres is the next target of NASA's
Dawn mission, which is expected to arrive in March 2015. The visible and
near-infrared mapping spectrometer (VIR) onboard Dawn has the spatial and
spectral range to characterize the surface between 0.25-5.0 microns. Ceres has
an absorption feature at 3.0 microns due to hydroxyl- and/or water-bearing
minerals (e.g. Lebofsky et al. 1981, Rivkin et al. 2003). We analyzed phase
angle-induced spectral effects on the 3-micron absorption band on Ceres using
spectra measured with the long-wavelength cross-dispersed (LXD: 1.9-4.2
microns) mode of the SpeX spectrograph/imager at the NASA Infrared Telescope
Facility (IRTF). Ceres LXD spectra were measured at different phase angles
ranging from 0.7o to 22o. We found that the band center slightly increases from
3.06 microns at lower phase angles (0.7o and 6o) to 3.07 microns at higher
phase angles (11 o and 22o), the band depth decreases by ~20% from lower phase
angles to higher phase angles, and the band area decreases by ~25% from lower
phase angles to higher phase angles. Our results will have implications for
constraining the abundance of OH on the surface of Ceres from VIR spectral
data, which will be acquired by Dawn starting spring 2015.
