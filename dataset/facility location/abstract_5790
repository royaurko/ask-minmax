The lifetime of whispering gallery modes in a dielectric cavity with a
metallic inclusion is shown to fluctuate by orders of magnitude when size and
location of the inclusion are varied. We ascribe these fluctuations to
tunneling transitions between resonances quantized in different regions of
phase space. This interpretation is confirmed by a comparison of the classical
phase space structure with the Husimi distribution of the resonant modes. A
model Hamiltonian is introduced that describes the phenomenon and shows that it
can be expected in a more general class of systems.
