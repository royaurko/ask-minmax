We present X-ray observations of PSR 0540-69.3 with the XMM-Newton
observatory. The spectra obtained with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer
reveal, for the first time, emission from ionized species of O, Ne and Fe
originating from the SNR shell. Analysis of the emission line spectrum allows
us to derive estimates of the temperature, ionization timescale, abundances,
location, and velocity of the emitting gas.
