A taxonomy of large financial crashes proposed in the literature locates the
burst of speculative bubbles due to endogenous causes in the framework of
extreme stock market crashes, defined as falls of market prices that are
outlier with respect to the bulk of drawdown price movement distribution. This
paper goes on deeper in the analysis providing a further characterization of
the rising part of such selected bubbles through the examination of drawdown
and maximum drawdown movement of indices prices. The analysis of drawdown
duration is also performed and it is the core of the risk measure estimated
here.
