In the infrared and visible bandpass, optical propagation theory
conventionally assumes that humidity does not contribute to the effects of
atmospheric turbulence on optical beams. While this assumption may be
reasonable for dry locations, we demonstrate in this paper that there is an
unequivocal effect due to the pre sence of humidity upon the strength of
turbulence parameter, $C_n^2$, from data collected in the Chesapeake Bay area
over 100-m length horizontal propagation paths. We describe and apply a novel
technique, Hilbert Phase Analysis, to the relative humidity, temperature and
$C_n^2$ data to show the contribution of the re levant climate variable to
$C_n^2$ as a function of time.
