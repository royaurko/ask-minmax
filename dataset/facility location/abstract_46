A method and facilities for delivering payload and people into outer space
are presented. This method uses, in general, engines located on a planetary
surface. The installation consists of a space apparatus, power drive stations,
which include a flywheel accumulator (for storage) of energy, a variable
reducer, a powerful homopolar electric generator and electric rails. The drive
stations accelerate the apparatus up to hypersonic speed.
  The estimations and computations show the possibility of making this project
a reality in a short period of time (for payloads which can tolerate high
g-forces). The launch will be very cheap at a projected cost of 3 - 5 dollars
per pound. The contributors developed a theory of this type of the launcher.
