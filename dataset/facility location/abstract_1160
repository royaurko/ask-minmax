The Gemini Multiobject Spectrograph (GMOS) installed on the Gemini-North
telescope has a facility for integral field spectroscopy over the wavelength
range 0.4-1.0um. GMOS is converted to this mode by the remote insertion of an
integral field unit (IFU) into the beam in place of the masks used for
multiobject spectroscopy. With the IFU deployed, integral field spectroscopy is
available over a fully-filled contiguous field of 5 x 7 arcsec with a sampling
of 0.2 arcsec. A separate field of half the area, but otherwise identical, is
also provided to aid background subtraction. The IFU contains 1500
lenslet-coupled fibres and is the largest-format fibre-based IFU yet tested on
the sky and the first facility of any type for integral field spectroscopy
employed on an 8/10m telescope. We describe the IFU and present results from
commissioning.
