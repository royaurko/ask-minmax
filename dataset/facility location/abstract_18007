During the past decade circumbinary disks have been discovered around various
young binary stars. Hydrodynamical calculations indicate that the gravitational
interaction between the central binary star and the surrounding disk results in
global perturbations of the disk density profile. We study the observability of
characteristic large-scale disk structures resulting from the binary-disk
interaction in the case of close binary systems. We derived the structure of
circumbinary disks from smoothed-particle hydrodynamic simulations.
Subsequently, we performed radiative transfer simulations to obtain scattered
light and thermal reemission maps. We investigated the influence of the binary
mass ratio, the inclination of the binary orbit relative to the disk midplane,
and the eccentricity of the binary orbit on observational quantities. We find
that ALMA will allow tracing asymmetries of the inner edge of the disk and
potentially resolving spiral arms if the disk is seen face-on. For an edge-on
orientation, ALMA will allow detecting perturbations in the disk density
distribution through asymmetries in the radial brightness profile. Through the
asymmetric structure of the disks, areas are formed with a temperature $2.6$
times higher than at the same location in equivalent unperturbed disks. The
time-dependent appearance of the density waves and spiral arms in the disk
affects the total re-emission flux of the object by a few percent.
