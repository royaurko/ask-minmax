Sudden brightenings of HD 96273 or BD+07 2411B were observed with the
HIPPARCOS satellite in 1992,which still require a convincing explanation. A new
analysis of all known data of these two stars is given, including additional
information on the Balmer line equivalent widths. The brightenings can be
explained as SU UMa type dwarf nova outbursts, superimposed on the combined
light of two normal F and G type main sequence stars. Since the hypothetical
dwarf nova turns out to be located at the same distance as HD 96273 and BD+07
2411B, we possibly see here the first case of a cataclysmic variable as a
member of a multiple star system. Questions on history and evolution, as well
as possible ways to confirm this interpretation, are briefly outlined.
