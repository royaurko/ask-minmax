The nature of the Lambda(1405), and its place in the baryon spectrum has
remained uncertain for decades. Theoretical studies have shown that it may
possess strong dynamical components which are not seen in other well-known
baryons. Using the CLAS detector system in Hall B at Jefferson Lab, we have
measured the photoproduction reaction gamma+p->K+ Lambda(1405) with high
statistics and over different Sigma pi decay channels. The reconstructed
invariant mass distribution (lineshape) has been measured, as well as the
differential cross sections for the Lambda(1405), Sigma(1385), and
Lambda(1520). Our analysis method is discussed and our near-final results for
the Lambda(1405) lineshape and differential cross section are presented.
