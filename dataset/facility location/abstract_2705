We demonstrate a facile method to produce crystallographically textured,
macroporous materials using a combination of modified ice templating and
templated grain growth (TGG). The process is demonstrated on alumina and the
lead-free piezoelectric material sodium potassium niobate. The method provides
macroporous materials with aligned, lamellar ceramic walls which are made up of
crystallographically aligned grains. Each method showed that the ceramic walls
present a long-range order over the entire sample dimensions and have
crystallographic texture as a result of the TGG process. We also present a
modification of the March-Dollase equation to better characterize the overall
texture of materials with textured but slightly misaligned walls. The
controlled crystallographic and morphologic orientation at two different length
scales demonstrated here can be the basis of multifunctional materials.
