Using the chemical potential of a solid in a dissolved state or the
corresponding component of the chemical potential tensor at equilibrium with
the solution, a new concept of grand thermodynamic potential for solids has
been suggested. This allows generalizing the definition of Gibbs' quantity
$\sigma$ (surface work often called the solid-fluid interfacial free energy) at
a planar surface as an excess grand thermodynamic potential per unit surface
area that (1) does not depend on the dividing surface location and (2) is
common for fluids and solids.
