Diagnostic X (D-X) transport system would extract the beam from the
downstream transport line of the second- axis of the Dual Axis Radiographic
Hydrodynamic Test facility (DARHT-II) and transport this beam to the D-X firing
point via four branches of the beamline in order to provide four lines of sight
for x-ray radiography. The design goal is to generate four DARHT-II-like x-ray
pulses on each line of sight. In this paper, we discuss several potential beam
quality degradation processes in the passive magnet lattice beamline and
indicate how they constrain the D-X beamline design parameters, such as the
background pressure, the pipe size, and the pipe material
