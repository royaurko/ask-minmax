The CLEO detector is located at the CESR e+e- collider in Ithaca, NY. CLEO's
wide range of experimental measurements in b-hadron decays is represented by
improved measurements of Vcb and Vub, rare B decays, and bb-bar spectroscopy.
New experimental results in exclusive hadronic transitions will aid theorists
in developing a theory of hadronic B decays. Such a theory will have
consequences for the extraction of angles of the unitarity triangle, especially
gamma. Recently, the CLEO collaboration has shifted its focus towards precision
measurements at lower energies. Based on the new Y(3S) data, we present the
observation of a new bound bb-bar state. An outlook on the planned running at
tau/charm-energies (CLEO-c) is given and implications for b-physics are
discussed.
