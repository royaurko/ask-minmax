Gamma-ray bursters emit a small fraction of their flux in X rays, and because
X-ray detectors are often very sensitive they may probe the gamma-ray burst
universe more deeply than the current best gamma-ray instruments. On the
reasonable assumptions that spectra of bursts observed by BATSE may be used to
predict the X-ray fluxes of gamma-ray bursts, and that any corona of bursts
around M31 is similar to the one around the Milky Way, we predict the rate at
which the wide field cameras on board BeppoSAX should detect bursts from the
Milky Way and M31. These rates are such that a one-month observation of M31
would have to either detect bursts from M31 or exclude most galactic models of
gamma-ray bursts. (It is shown how the remainder can be dealt with.) Therefore
such an observation would settle the long-standing dispute over their location.
