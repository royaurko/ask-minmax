The first direct mass-measurement of $^{6}$He has been performed with the
TITAN Penning trap mass spectrometer at the ISAC facility. In addition, the
mass of $^{8}$He was determined with improved precision over our previous
measurement. The obtained masses are $m$($^{6}$He) = 6.018 885 883(57) u and
$m$($^{8}$He) = 8.033 934 44(11) u. The $^{6}$He value shows a deviation from
the literature of 4$\sigma$. With these new mass values and the previously
measured atomic isotope shifts we obtain charge radii of 2.060(8) fm and
1.959(16) fm for $^{6}$He and $^{8}$He respectively. We present a detailed
comparison to nuclear theory for $^6$He, including new hyperspherical harmonics
results. A correlation plot of the point-proton radius with the two-neutron
separation energy demonstrates clearly the importance of three-nucleon forces.
