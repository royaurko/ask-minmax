Using reflection positivity as the main tool, we establish a connection
between the existence of a critical point in classical spin models and the
triviality of a certain local cohomology class related to the Noether current
of the model in the continuum limit. Furthermore we find a relation between the
location of the critical point and the momentum space autocorrelation function
of the Noether current.
