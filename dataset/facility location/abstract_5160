The gravitational influence of a planet on a nearby disk provides a powerful
tool for detecting and studying extrasolar planetary systems. Here we
demonstrate that gaps can be opened in dynamically cold debris disks at the
mean-motion resonances of an orbiting planet. The gaps are opened away from the
orbit of the planet itself, revealing that not all disk gaps need contain a
planetary body. These gaps are large and deep enough to be detectable in
resolved disk images for a wide range of reasonable disk-planet parameters,
though we are not aware of any such gaps detected to date. The gap shape and
size are diagnostic of the planet location, eccentricity and mass, and allow
one to infer the existence of unseen planets, as well as many important
parameters of both seen and unseen planets in these systems. We present
expressions to allow the planetary mass to be calculated from observed gap
width and location.
