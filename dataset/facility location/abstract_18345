In a 52 ks-long Chandra ACIS-S observation of the nearby starburst galaxy NGC
3628, obtained to study the starburst-driven outflow from this galaxy, we have
detected a very luminous (L_X = 1.1e40 erg/s in the 0.3-8.0 keV energy band)
point source located at least 20 arcsec (~970 pc) from the nucleus of the
galaxy. No radio, optical or near-IR counterpart to this source has been found.
  This is most probably the reappearance of the strongly-variable
X-ray-luminous source discovered by Dahlem et al (1995), which faded by a
factor >27 between December 1991 and March 1994 (at which point it had faded
below the detection limit in a ROSAT HRI observation). This source is clearly a
member of an enigmatic class of X-ray sources that are considerably more
luminous than conventional X-ray binaries but less luminous than AGN, and which
are not found at the dynamical center of the host galaxy.
  The Chandra spectrum is best-fit by an absorbed power law model with a photon
index of Gamma = 1.8+/-0.2, similar to that seen in Galactic BH binary
candidates in their hard state. Bremsstrahlung models or multi-color disk
models (the favored spectral model for objects in this class based on ASCA
observations) can provide statistically acceptable fits only if the data at
energies E > 5 keV is ignored. This is one of the first X-ray spectra of such
an object that is unambiguously that of the source alone, free from the
spectral contamination by X-ray emission from the rest of the galaxy that
affects previous spectral studies of these objects using ASCA.
