We present deep Washington photometry of 45 poorly populated star cluster
candidates in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We have performed a systematic
study to estimate the parameters of the cluster candidates by matching
theoretical isochrones to the cleaned and de-reddened cluster color-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs). We were able to estimate the basic parameters for 33 clusters,
out of which, 23 are identified as single clusters and 10 are found to be
members of double clusters. Other 12 cluster candidates have been classified as
possible clusters/asterisms. About 50% of the true clusters are in the 100-300
Myr age range, while some are older or younger. We have discussed the
distribution of age, location, reddening with respect to field as well as size
of true clusters. The sizes and masses of the studied sample are found to be
similar to that of open clusters in the Milky Way. Our study adds to the lower
end of cluster mass distribution in the LMC, suggesting that the LMC apart from
hosting rich clusters also has formed small, less massive open clusters in the
100-300 Myr age range.
