The Photo-Injector Test facility at DESY, Zeuthen site (PITZ), produces
pulsed electron beams with low transverse emittance and is equipped with
diagnostic devices for measuring various electron bunch properties, including
the longitudinal and transverse electron phase space distributions. The
longitudinal bunch structure is recorded using a streak camera located outside
the accelerator tunnel, connected to the diagnostics in the beam-line stations
by an optical system of about 30 m length. This system mainly consists of
telescopes of achromatic lenses, which transport the light pulses and image
them onto the entrance slit of the streak camera. Due to dispersion in the
lenses, the temporal resolution degrades during transport. This article
presents general considerations for time-resolving optical systems as well as
simulations and measurements of specific candidate systems. It then describes
the development of an imaging system based on mirror telescopes which will
improve the temporal resolution, with an emphasis on off-axis parabolic mirror
systems working at unit magnification. A hybrid system of lenses and mirrors
will serve as a proof of principle.
