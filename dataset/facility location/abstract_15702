This paper presents a real-time application of the 16-bit fixed point Digital
Signal Processors (DSPs), in the Muon System of the D0 detector located at the
Fermilab Tevatron, presently the world's highest-energy hadron collider. As
part of the Upgrade for a run beginning in the year 2000, the system is
required to process data at an input event rate of 10 KHz without incurring
significant deadtime in readout. The ADSP21csp01 processor has high I/O
bandwidth, single cycle instruction execution and fast task switching support
to provide efficient multisignal processing. The processor's internal memory
consists of 4K words of Program Memory and 4K words of Data Memory. In addition
there is an external memory of 32K words for general event buffering and 16K
words of Dual Port Memory for input data queuing. This DSP fulfills the
requirement of the Muon subdetector systems for data readout. All error
handling, buffering, formatting and transferring of the data to the various
trigger levels of the data acquisition system is done in software. The
algorithms developed for the system complete these tasks in about 20
microseconds per event.
