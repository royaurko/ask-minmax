A Regge-inspired model is used to discuss the hard exclusive two-body
hadronic reactions (pbar p ----> pi+ pi-, pi0 pi0, K+ K-, Kbar0 K0) for the
FAIR facility project at GSI with the Panda detector. The comparison between
the differential cross sections predictions and the available data is shown to
determine the values of the few parameters of the model.
