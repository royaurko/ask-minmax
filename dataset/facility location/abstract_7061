Pulsed field emission from cold carbon-nanotube cathodes placed in a
radiofrequency resonant cavity was observed. The cathodes were located on the
backplate of a conventional $1+\frac{1}{2}$-cell resonant cavity operating at
1.3-GHz and resulted in the production of bunch train with maximum average
current close to 0.7 Amp\`ere. The measured Fowler-Nordheim characteristic,
transverse emittance, and pulse duration are presented and, when possible,
compared to numerical simulations. The implications of our results to
high-average-current electron sources are briefly discussed.
