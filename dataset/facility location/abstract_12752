We plan to install an infrared telescope at the new site of Tibet, China. The
primary mirror diameter is 50cm, and the focal ratio F8. The Xenics
640\times512 near infrared camera is employed, equipped with a dedicated high
speed InGaAs detector array, working up to 1.7{\mu}m. The new site is located
on 5100m mountain, near Gar town, Ali, where is an excellent site for both
infrared and submillimeter observations. The telescope will be remotely
controlled through internet. The goal of IRT is to make site testing, detect
variable stars, and search for extrasolar planets.
