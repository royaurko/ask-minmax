We consider a continuum percolation model consisting of two types of nodes,
namely legitimate and eavesdropper nodes, distributed according to independent
Poisson point processes (PPPs) in $\bbR ^2$ of intensities $\lambda$ and
$\lambda_E$ respectively. A directed edge from one legitimate node $A$ to
another legitimate node $B$ exists provided the strength of the {\it signal}
transmitted from node $A$ that is received at node $B$ is higher than that
received at any eavesdropper node. The strength of the received signal at a
node from a legitimate node depends not only on the distance between these
nodes, but also on the location of the other legitimate nodes and an
interference suppression parameter $\gamma$. The graph is said to percolate
when there exists an infinite connected component. We show that for any finite
intensity $\lambda_E$ of eavesdropper nodes, there exists a critical intensity
$\lambda_c < \infty$ such that for all $\lambda > \lambda_c$ the graph
percolates for sufficiently small values of the interference parameter.
Furthermore, for the sub-critical regime, we show that there exists a
$\lambda_0$ such that for all $\lambda < \lambda_0 \leq \lambda_c$ a suitable
graph defined over eavesdropper node connections percolates that precludes
percolation in the graphs formed by the legitimate nodes.
