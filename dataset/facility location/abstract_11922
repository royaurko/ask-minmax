We present the 100 strongest 1.4 GHz point sources from a new mosaic image in
the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The observations making up
the mosaic were made over a ten year period and were combined with Parkes
single dish data at 1.4 GHz to complete the image for short spacing. An initial
list of co-identifications within 10" at 0.843, 4.8 and 8.6 GHz consisted of
2682 sources. Elimination of extended objects and artifact noise allowed the
creation of a refined list containing 1988 point sources. Most of these are
presumed to be background objects seen through the LMC; a small portion may
represent compact H II regions, young SNRs and radio planetary nebulae. For the
1988 point sources we find a preliminary average spectral index of -0.53 and
present a 1.4 GHz image showing source location in the direction of the LMC.
