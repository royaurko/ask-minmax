License Plate Recognition plays an important role on the traffic monitoring
and parking management. Administration and restriction of those transportation
tools for their better service becomes very essential. In this paper, a fast
and real time method has an appropriate application to find plates that the
plat has tilt and the picture quality is poor. In the proposed method, at the
beginning, the image is converted into binary mode with use of adaptive
threshold. And with use of edge detection and morphology operation, plate
number location has been specified and if the plat has tilt; its tilt is
removed away. Then its characters are distinguished using image processing
techniques. Finally, K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifier was used for
character recognition. This method has been tested on available data set that
has different images of the background, considering distance, and angel of view
so that the correct extraction rate of plate reached at 98% and character
recognition rate achieved at 99.12%. Further we tested our character
recognition stage on Persian vehicle data set and we achieved 99% correct
recognition rate.
