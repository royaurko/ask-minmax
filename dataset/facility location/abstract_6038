The lateral and longitudinal profiles of the hadronic showers detected by
iron-scintillator tile hadron calorimeter with longitudinal tile configuration
have been investigated. The results are based on 100 GeV pion beam data. Due to
the beam scan provided many different beam impact locations with cells it is
succeeded to obtain detailed picture of transverse shower behavior. The
underlying radial energy densities for four depths and for overall calorimeter
have been reconstructed. The three-dimensional hadronic shower parametrisation
have been suggested.
