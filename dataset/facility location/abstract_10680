The Karlsruhe multi-detector set-ups KASCADE, KASCADE-Grande, and LOPES aim
on measurements of cosmic rays in the energy range of the so called knee
between 10^14 eV and 10^18 eV. The multidimensional analysis of the air shower
data measured by KASCADE indicates a distinct knee in the energy spectra of
light primary cosmic rays and an increasing dominance of heavy ones towards
higher energies. This provides, together with the results of large scale
anisotropy studies, implications for discriminating astrophysical models of the
origin of the knee. To improve the reconstruction quality and statistics at
higher energies, where the knee of the heavy primaries is expected at around
100 PeV, KASCADE has been extended by a factor 10 in area to the new experiment
KASCADE-Grande. LOPES is located on site of the KASCADE-Grande experiment. It
measures radio pulses from extensive air showers with the goal to establish
this renewed detection technique for future large scale experiments.
