One of the main goals of RENO (Reactor Experiment for Neutrino Oscillation)
is to measure the smallest neutrino mixing angle {\theta}13 using reactor
neutrinos in Korea. RENO is the first reactor experiment taking data with two
identical detectors in different locations (Near and Far), which is critical to
reduce systematic uncertainty in reactor neutrino flux. Our data taking has
been almost continuous since Aug. 2011 and we have collected about 434,000
(54,000) electron anti-neutrinos in the Near (Far) detector by 2013. Using this
data (about 800 live days) we present a new result on {\theta}13:
sin22{\theta}13 = 0.101 +/- 0.008 (stat.) +/- 0.010 (syst.). We also report the
5 MeV excess present in the prompt signal spectrum in our data, and its
correlation with our reactor thermal power.
