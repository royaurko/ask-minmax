Location management refers to the problem of updating and searching the
current location of mobile nodes in a wireless network. To make it efficient,
the sum of update costs of location database must be minimized. Previous work
relying on fixed location databases is unable to fully exploit the knowledge of
user mobility patterns in the system so as to achieve this minimization. The
study presents an intelligent location management approach which has interacts
between intelligent information system and knowledge-base technologies, so we
can dynamically change the user patterns and reduce the transition between the
VLR and HLR. The study provides algorithms are ability to handle location
registration and call delivery
