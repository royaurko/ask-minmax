In this paper we present the results of time-dependent simulations of dipolar
axisymmetric magnetospheres of neutron stars carried out both within the
framework of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and within the framework of
resistive force-free electrodynamics. The results of force-free simulations
reveal the inability of our numerical method to accommodate the equatorial
current sheets of pulsar magnetospheres and raise a question mark over the
robustness of this approach. On the other hand, the MHD approach allows to make
a significant progress. We start with a nonrotating magnetically dominated
dipolar magnetospheres and follow its evolution as the stellar rotation is
switched on. We find that the time-dependent solution gradually approaches the
steady state that is very close to the stationary solution of the Pulsar
Equation found by Contopoulos et al.(1999). This result suggests that other
stationary solutions that have the y-point located well inside the light
cylinder are unstable. The role of the particle inertia and pressure on the
structure and dynamics of MHD magnetospheres is studied in details, as well as
the potential implications of the dissipative processes in the equatorial
current sheet. We argue that pulsars may have differentially rotating
magnetospheres which develop noticeable structural oscillations and that this
may help to explain the nature of the sub-pulse phenomena.
