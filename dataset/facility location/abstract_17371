Current leads are utilized to deliver electrical power from a room
temperature junction mounted on the vacuum vessel to a superconducting magnet
located within the vacuum space of a cryostat. There are many types of current
leads used at laboratories throughout the world, however, conduction-cooled
current leads are often chosen for their simplicity and reliability.
Conduction-cooled leads have the advantage of using common materials, have no
superconducting/normal state transition, and have no boil-off vapor to collect.
The XFEL (X-Ray Free Electron Laser) magnets are operated at 2 K, which makes
vapor-cooled current leads impractical due to the sub-atmospheric bath
pressure. This paper presents a numerical model for conduction-cooled current
lead heat loads. This model takes into account varying material and fluid
thermal properties, varying thicknesses along the length of the lead, heat
transfer in the circumferential and longitudinal directions, electrical power
dissipation, and the effect of thermal intercepts. The model is validated by
comparing the numerical model results to ideal cases where analytical equations
are valid. The models are compared using the geometry and operating conditions
for the XFEL prototype current leads.
