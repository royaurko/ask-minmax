MUSE, a giant integral field spectrograph, is about to become the newest
facility instrument at the VLT. It will see first light in February 2014. Here,
we summarize the properties of the instrument as built and outline
functionality of the data reduction system, that transforms the raw data that
gets recorded separately in 24 IFUs by 4k CCDs, into a fully calibrated,
scientifically usable data cube. We then describe recent work regarding
geometrical calibration of the instrument and testing of the processing
pipeline, before concluding with results of the Preliminary Acceptance in
Europe and an outlook to the on-sky commissioning.
