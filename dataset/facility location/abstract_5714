We report the detection of a new radio transient source, GCRT J1746-2757,
located only 1.1 degrees north of the Galactic center. Consistent with other
radio transients toward the Galactic center, this source brightened and faded
on a time scale of a few months. No X-ray counterpart was detected. We also
report new 0.33 GHz measurements of the radio counterpart to the X-ray
transient source, XTE J1748-288, previously detected and monitored at higher
radio frequencies. We show that the spectrum of XTE J1748-288 steepened
considerably during a period of a few months after its peak. We also discuss
the need for a more efficient means of finding additional radio transients.
