The Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) is one of three science instruments on the
Spitzer Space Telescope. The IRS comprises four separate spectrograph modules
covering the wavelength range from 5.3 to 38micron with spectral resolutions, R
\~90 and 600, and it was optimized to take full advantage of the very low
background in the space environment. The IRS is performing at or better than
the pre-launch predictions. An autonomous target acquisition capability enables
the IRS to locate the mid-infrared centroid of a source, providing the
information so that the spacecraft can accurately offset that centroid to a
selected slit. This feature is particularly useful when taking spectra of
sources with poorly known coordinates. An automated data reduction pipeline has
been developed at the Spitzer Science Center.
