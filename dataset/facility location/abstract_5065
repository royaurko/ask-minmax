The results of ultra-high vacuum low-temperature scanning-tunneling
microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) of atomically clean (111) surface of
the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ are presented. We observed several types
of new subsurface defects whose location and charge correspond to p-type
conduction of grown crystals. The sign of the thermoelectric effect also
indicates p-type conduction. STM and STS measurements demonstrate that the
chemical potential is always located inside the bulk band gap. We also observed
changes in the local density of states in the vicinity of the quintuple layer
steps at the studied surface. This changes correspond either to the shift of
the Dirac cone position or to the shift of the chemical potential near the step
edge.
