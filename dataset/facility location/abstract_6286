We present an investigation of the electromagnetic instabilities which are
trig gered when an ultra relativistic electron beam passes through a plasma.
The linear growth rate is computed for every direction of propagation of the
unstable modes, and temperatures are modelled using simple waterbag
distribution functions. The ultra relativistic unstable spectrum is located
around a very narrow band centered on a critical angle which value is given
analytically. The growth rate of modes propagating in this direction decreases
like k^(-1/3).
