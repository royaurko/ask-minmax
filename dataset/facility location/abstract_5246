Compton scattering by the proton has been measured using the tagged-photon
facility at MAMI (Mainz) and the large-acceptance arrangement LARA. The new
data are interpreted in terms of dispersion theory based on the SAID-SM99K
parameterization of photo-meson amplitudes. It is found that two-pion exchange
in the t-channel is needed for a description of the data in the second
resonance region. The data are well represented if this channel is modeled by a
single pole with mass parameter m(sigma)=600 MeV. The asymptotic part of the
spin dependent amplitude is found to be well represented by pi-0-exchange in
the t-channel. A backward spin-polarizability of
gamma(pi)=(-37.1+-0.6(stat+syst)+-3.0(model))x10^{-4}fm^4 has been determined
from data of the first resonance region below 455 MeV. This value is in a good
agreement with predictions of dispersion relations and chiral pertubation
theory. From a subset of data between 280 and 360 MeV the resonance
pion-photoproduction amplitudes were evaluated leading to a E2/M1 multipole
ratio of the p-to-Delta radiative transition of EMR(340
MeV)=(-1.7+-0.4(stat+syst)+-0.2(model))%. It was found that this number is
dependent on the parameterization of photo-meson amplitudes. With the MAID2K
parameterization an E2/M1 multipole ratio of EMR(340
MeV)=(-2.0+-0.4(stat+syst)+-0.2(model))% is obtained.
