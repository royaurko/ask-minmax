The AMANDE facility produces monoenergetic neutron fields from 2 keV to 20
MeV for metrological purposes. To be considered as a reference facility,
fluence and energy distributions of neutron fields have to be determined by
primary measurement standards. For this purpose, a micro Time Projection
Chamber is being developed to be dedicated to measure neutron fields with
energy ranging from 8 keV up to 1 MeV. In this work we present simulations
showing that such a detector, which allows the measurement of the ionization
energy and the 3D reconstruction of the recoil nucleus, provides the
determination of neutron energy and fluence of these neutron fields.
