Although playing a key role in the understanding of the supernova phenomenon,
the evolution of massive stars still suffers from uncertainties in their
structure, even during their "quiet" main sequence phase and later on during
their subgiant and helium burning phases. What is the extent of the mixed
central region? In the local mixing length theory (LMLT) frame, are there
structural differences using Schwarzschild or Ledoux convection criterion?
Where are located the convective zone boundaries? Are there intermediate
convection zones during MS and post-MS phase, and what is their extent and
location? We discuss these points and show how asteroseismology could bring
some light on these questions.
