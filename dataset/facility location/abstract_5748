The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will operate as an AM/FM
receiver for gravitational waves. For binary systems, the source location,
orientation and orbital phase are encoded in the amplitude and frequency
modulation. The same modulations spread a monochromatic signal over a range of
frequencies, making it difficult to identify individual sources. We present a
method for detecting and subtracting individual binary signals from a data
stream with many overlapping signals.
