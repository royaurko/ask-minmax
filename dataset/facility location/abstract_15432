We have estimated the age of the young moving group TW Hydrae Association, a
cohort of a few dozen stars and brown dwarfs located near the Sun which share
the same kinematic properties and, presumably, the same origin and age. The
chronology has been determined by analyzing different properties (magnitudes,
colors, activity, lithium) of its members and comparing them with several
well-known star forming regions and open clusters, as well as theoretical
models. In addition, by using medium-resolution optical spectra of two M8
members of the association (2M1139 and 2M1207 -an accreting brown dwarf with a
planetary mass companion), we have derived spectral types and measured H(alpha)
and lithium equivalent widths. We have also estimated their effective
temperature and gravity, which were used to produce an independent age
estimation for these two brown dwarfs. We have also collected spectra of
2M1315, a candidate member with a L5 spectral type and measured its H(alpha)
equivalent width. Our age estimate for the association, 10 Myr (in the range
3-20 Myr), agrees with previous values cited in the literature. In the case of
the two brown dwarfs, we have derived an age of 15 Myr (in the range 5-30 Myr),
which also agree with our estimate for the whole group. We compared our results
with recent articles published on the same subject using other techniques, and
discuss the limits of the age-dating techniques.
