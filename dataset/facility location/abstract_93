We present results on $B\to J/\psi\xspace K\pi$ decays using $e^+e^-$
annihilation data collected with the BABAR detector at the $\Upsilon(4S)$
resonance. The detector is located at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy storage ring
facility at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Using approximately 88
million $B\bar{B}$ pairs, we measure the decay amplitudes for the flavor
eigenmodes and observe strong-phase differences indicative of final-state
interactions with a significance of 7.6 standard deviations. We use the
interference between the $K\pi$ $S$-wave and $P$-wave amplitudes in the region
of the $K^*(892)$ to resolve the ambiguity in the determination of these strong
phases. We then perform an ambiguity-free measurement of $\cos2\beta$ using the
angular and time-dependent asymmetry in $B\to J/\psi\xspace K^{*0}(K_S^0\pi^0$)
dec With $\sin 2 \beta$ fixed at its measured value and $\cos 2 \beta$ treated
as an in we find $\cos 2\beta=2.72_{-0.79}^{+0.50}\mathrm{(stat)} \pm
0.27\mathrm{(syst)}$, de sign of $\cos 2\beta$ to be positive at 86% CL.
