SPINOR is a new spectro-polarimeter that will serve as a facility instrument
for the Dunn Solar Telescope at the National Solar Observatory. This instrument
is capable of achromatic operation over a very broad range of wavelengths, from
$\sim$400 up to 1600 nm, allowing for the simultaneous observation of several
visible and infrared spectral regions with full Stokes polarimetry. Another key
feature of the design is its flexibility to observe virtually any combination
of spectral lines, limited only by practical considerations (e.g., the number
of detectors available, space on the optical bench, etc). SPINOR is scheduled
for commissioning by the end of 2005. In this paper we report on the current
status of the project and present actual observations of active regions in the
Ca II infrared triplet and the He I multiplet at 1083 nm.
