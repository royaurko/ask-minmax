Observational studies of a planetary boundary layer (PBL) are difficult.
Ground-born measurements usually characterize only a small portion of the PBL
immediately above the surface. Air-born measurements cannot be obtained close
to the surface and therefore cannot capture any significant portion of the PBL
interior. Moreover, observations are limited in choice of instrumentation,
time, duration, location of measurements and occasional weather conditions.
Although turbulence-resolving simulations with a large-eddy simulation (LES)
code do not supplant observational studies, they provide valuable complementary
information on different aspect of the PBL dynamics, which otherwise difficult
to acquire. These circumstances motivated development of a medium-resolution
database (DATABASE64) of turbulence-resolving simulations, which is available
on ftp://ftp.nersc.no/igor/. DATABASE64 covers a range of physical parameters
typical for the barotropic SBL over a homogeneous rough surface. LES runs in
DATABASE64 simulate 16 hours' evolution of the PBL turbulence. They are
utilized to study both transition and equilibrium SBL cases as well as to
calibrate turbulence parameterizations of meteorological models. The data can
be also used to falsify theoretical constructions with regards to the PBL.
