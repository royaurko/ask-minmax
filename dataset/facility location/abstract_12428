We report the results of an experimental comparison of different airplane
boarding methods. This test was conducted in a mock 757 fuselage, located on a
Southern California soundstage, with 12 rows of six seats and a single aisle.
Five methods were tested using 72 passengers of various ages. We found a
significant reduction in the boarding times of optimized methods over
traditional methods. These improved methods, if properly implemented, could
result in a significant savings to airline companies.
