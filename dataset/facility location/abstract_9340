Imaging the vicinity of black hole is one of the ultimate goals of VLBI
astronomy. The closest massive black hole, SgrA*, located at Galactic center is
the leading candidate for such observations. Combined with recent VLBI
recording technique and sub-mm radio engineering, we now have the sufficient
sensitivity for the observations. We here show performance simulations of
sub-mm VLBI arrays for imaging SgrA*. An excellent image is obtained from a
sub-mm VLBI array in the Southern hemisphere like the configuration of VLBA. We
also note that even with a small array, we can estimate the shadow size and
then the mass of black hole from visibility analysis. Now, if only constructing
a sub-mm VLBI array in Southern hemisphere, we can unveil the black hole
environments of SgrA*.
