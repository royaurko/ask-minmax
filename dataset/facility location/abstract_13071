Spherical, micrometer-sized particles within a Coulomb crystal levitated in
the sheath above the powered lower electrode in a GEC reference cell are
perturbed using a Zyvex S100 Nanomanipulator. Using the S100, a vertical probe
is positioned within the cell at various locations with respect to the crystal
formed within the sheath. As the probe is lowered toward the horizontal plane
of the dust layer, a circular cavity opens in the center of the crystal and
expands. To explore the minimally perturbative state, the probe is lifted to
the position that closes this cavity, the probe potential is oscillated, and
the motion of the particle directly beneath the probe is analyzed. Using a
simple electric field model for the plasma sheath, the change predicted in the
levitation height is compared with experiment.
