I have isolated a population of numerous F stars that appear to be
pre-main-sequence (PMS). The candidate PMS stars have been identified using CM
diagram, reddening, flux excess in the UV and near-infrared, and luminosity
anomaly. Negative luminosity anomaly and excessive UV flux for many of these
stars is suggestive of accretion disks, while the NIR excess is indicative in
many cases of the presence of dust disk thermal emission.
 Observed overluminosity of many PMS candidates is consistent with their
pre-main-sequence status. The bulk of the PMS candidates is located within
 200 pc, exhibiting strong association with regions of star formation that are
numerous between ~130 to 180 pc. The number of PMS candidates plummets redward
of the spectral type ~ F5. This effect may provide important clues for
understanding the evolution of PMS stars in the solar-mass range.
