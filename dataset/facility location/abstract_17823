The origin of cosmic rays have remained a mistery for more than a century.
JEM-EUSO is a pioneer space-based telescope that will be located at the
International Space Station (ISS) and its aim is to detect Ultra High Energy
Cosmic Rays (UHECR) and Extremely High Energy Cosmic Rays (EHECR) by observing
the atmosphere. Unlike ground-based telescopes, JEM-EUSO will observe from
upwards, and therefore, for a properly UHECR reconstruction under cloudy
conditions, a key element of JEM-EUSO is an Atmospheric Monitoring System
(AMS). This AMS consists of a space qualified bi-spectral Infrared Camera, that
will provide the cloud coverage and cloud top height in the JEM-EUSO Field of
View (FoV) and a LIDAR, that will measure the atmospheric optical depth in the
direction it has been shot. In this paper we will explain the effects of clouds
for the determination of the UHECR arrival direction. Moreover, since the cloud
top height retrieval is crucial to analyze the UHECR and EHECR events under
cloudy conditions, the retrieval algorithm that fulfills the technical
requierements of the Infrared Camera of JEM-EUSO to reconstruct the cloud top
height is presently reported.
