The unusual supernova remnant candidate G357.7-0.1 and the compact source
G357.63-0.06 have been observed with the Very Large Array at 1.4 and 8.3 GHz.
The H92$\alpha$ line (8.3 GHz) was detected from the compact source with a
surprising velocity of about -210 km/s indicating that this source is an \HII
region, is most likely located at the Galactic center, and is unrelated to the
SNR. The \HI absorption line (1.4 GHz) data toward these sources supports this
picture and suggests that G357.7-0.1 lies farther away than the Galactic
center.
