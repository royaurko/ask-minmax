Vertical movement of zirconia-yttria stabilized 2 mm balls is measured by a
laser facility at the surface of a vibrated 3D granular matter under gravity.
Realizations z(t) are measured from the top of the container by tuning the
fluidized gap with a 1D measurement window in the direction of the gravity. The
statistics obeys a Fermi-like configurational approach which is tested by the
relation between the dispersions in amplitude and velocity. We introduce a
generalized equipartition law to characterize the ensemble of particles which
cannot be described in terms of a Brownian motion. The relation between global
granular temperature and the external excitation frequency is established.
