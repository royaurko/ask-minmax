Gravitational wave science is on the verge of direct observation of the waves
predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and opening the exciting
new field of gravitational wave astronomy. In the coming decades,
ultra-sensitive arrays of ground-based instruments and complementary
spaced-based instruments will observe the gravitational wave sky, inevitably
discovering entirely unexpected phenomena while providing new insight into many
of the most profound astrophysical phenomena known. in July 2007 the
Gravitational Wave International Committee (GWIC) initiated the development of
a strategic roadmap for the field of gravitational wave science with a 30-year
horizon. The goal of this roadmap is to serve the international gravitational
wave community and its stakeholders as a tool for the development of
capabilities and facilities needed to address the exciting scientific
opportunities on the intermediate and long-term horizons.
