Within a dynamical and statistical approach we study the main regularities in
production of hypernuclei coming from projectile and target residues in
relativistic ion collisions. We demonstrate that yields of hypernuclei increase
considerably above the energy threshold for Lambda hyperons, and there is a
saturation for yields of single hypernuclei with increasing the beam energy up
to few TeV. Production of specific hypernuclei depend very much on the isotopic
composition of the projectile, and this gives a chance to obtain exotic
hypernuclei that may be difficult to reach in traditional hypernuclear
experiments. Possibilities for the detection of such hypernuclei with planned
and available relativistic ion facilities are discussed.
