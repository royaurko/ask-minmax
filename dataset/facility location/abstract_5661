The photometric estimate of the metallicity and the age of the Azzopardi et
al. (1991, A&AS 88, 265) carbon stars (Ng 1997, A&A 328, 211) is revised to
respectively Z~0.004 and ~0.1 Gyr. Under the hypothesis that the carbon stars
are located at a distance related to the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, the broad
velocity dispersion of the stars can only be explained if they were formed out
of Galactic material during a recent crossing of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy
through the Galactic plane.
