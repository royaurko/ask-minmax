We present precise localizations of AXP 1E1841-045 and SGR 1627-41 with
Chandra. We obtained new infrared observations of SGR 1627-41 and reanalyzed
archival observations of AXP 1E1841-045 in order to refine their positions and
search for infrared counterparts. A faint source is detected inside the error
circle of AXP 1E1841-045. In the case of SGR 1627-41, several sources are
located within the error radius of the X-ray position and we discuss the
likelihood of one of them being the counterpart. We compare the properties of
our candidates to those of other known AXP and SGR counterparts. We find that
the counterpart candidates for SGR 1627-41 and SGR 1806-20 would have to be
intrinsically much brighter than AXPs to have detectable counterparts with the
observational limits currently available for these sources. To confirm the
reported counterpart of SGR 1806-20, we obtained new IR observations during the
July 2003 burst activation of the source. No brightening of the suggested
counterpart is detected, implying that the counterpart of SGR 1806-20 remains
yet to be identified.
