The study of the eightfold degeneracy at a neutrino complex that includes a
standard $\beta$-Beam and a Super-Beam facility is presented for the first time
in this paper. The scenario where the neutrinos are sent toward a Megaton water
Cerenkov detector located at the Fr\'{e}jus laboratory (baseline 130 Km) is
exploited. The performance in terms of sensitivity for measuring the continuous
($\theta_{13}$ and $\delta$) and discrete (${sign} [ \Delta m^2_{23} ]$ and
${sign} [\tan (2\theta_{23}) ]$) oscillation parameters for the $\beta$-Beam
and Super-Beam alone, and for their combination has been studied. A brief
review of the present uncertainties on the neutrino and antineutrino
cross-sections is also reported and their impact on the discovery potential
discussed.
