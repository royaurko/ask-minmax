This paper puts forward the vision of fully decoupling market operations from
security considerations through controllable power flows. In "A Fully
Controllable Power System", power system security is no longer dependent on the
location of the power injection points. In the ideal case, this leads to the
elimination of redispatching costs, which amount to several million dollars per
year in large systems. This paper determines the upper and lower bounds for the
number of controllable lines and number of controllers to achieve this
decoupling in any system. It further introduces the notion of the
controllability vector CV, which expresses the effect of any controller on the
AC line flows. Based on two alternative definitions for controllability, two
controller placement algorithms to maximize controllability are presented and
their results are compared.
