The past decade has witnessed order of magnitude increases in computing
power, data storage capacity and network speed, giving birth to applications
which may handle large data volumes of increased complexity, distributed over
the Internet. Grids computing promises to resolve many of the difficulties in
facilitating medical image analysis to allow radiologists to collaborate
without having to co-locate. The EU-funded MammoGrid project aims to
investigate the feasibility of developing a Grid-enabled European database of
mammograms and provide an information infrastructure which federates multiple
mammogram databases. This will enable clinicians to develop new common,
collaborative and co-operative approaches to the analysis of mammographic data.
This paper focuses on one of the key requirements for large-scale distributed
mammogram analysis: resolving queries across a grid-connected federation of
images.
