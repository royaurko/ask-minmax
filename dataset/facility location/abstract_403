With the advent of mobile computing, location-based services have recently
gained popularity. Many applications use the location provenance of users,
i.e., the chronological history of the users' location for purposes ranging
from access control, authentication, information sharing, and evaluation of
policies. However, location provenance is subject to tampering and collusion
attacks by malicious users. In this paper, we examine the secure location
provenance problem. We introduce a witness-endorsed scheme for generating
collusion-resistant location proofs. We also describe two efficient and
privacy-preserving schemes for protecting the integrity of the chronological
order of location proofs. These schemes, based on hash chains and Bloom filters
respectively, allow users to prove the order of any arbitrary subsequence of
their location history to auditors. Finally, we present experimental results
from our proof-of-concept implementation on the Android platform and show that
our schemes are practical in today's mobile devices.
