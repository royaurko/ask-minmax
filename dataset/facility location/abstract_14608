Using a multi-plane lensing method that we have developed, we follow the
evolution of light beams as they propagate through inhomogeneous universes. We
use a P3M code to simulate the formation and evolution of large-scale
structure. The resolution of the simulations is increased to sub-Megaparsec
scales by using a Monte Carlo method to locate galaxies inside the
computational volume according to the underlying particle distribution. The
galaxies are approximated by isothermal spheres, with each morphological type
having its own distribution of masses and core radii. The morphological types
are chosen in order to reproduce the observed morphology-density relation. This
algorithm has an effective resolution of 9 orders of magnitudes in length, from
the size of superclusters down to the core radii of the smallest galaxies.
  We consider cold dark matter models normalized to COBE, and perform a large
parameter survey by varying the cosmological parameters Omega_0, lambda_0, H_0,
and n (the tilt of the primordial power spectrum). The values of n are chosen
by imposing particular values or sigma_8, the rms mass fluctuation at a scale
of 8/h Mpc. We use the power spectrum given by Bunn & White. This is the
largest parameter survey ever done is this field.
