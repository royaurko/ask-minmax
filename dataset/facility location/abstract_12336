We have found that KK 246, the only confirmed galaxy located within the
nearby Tully Void, is a dwarf galaxy with an extremely extended H I disk and
signs of an H I cloud with anomalous velocity. It also exhibits clear
misalignment between the kinematical major and minor axes, indicative of an
oval distortion, and a general misalignment between the H I and optical major
axes. We measure a H I mass of 1.05 +- 0.08 x 10^8 M_sun, and a H I extent 5
times that of the stellar disk, one of the most extended H I disks known. We
estimate a dynamical mass of 4.1 x 10^9 M_sun, making this also one of the
darkest galaxies known, with a mass-to-light ratio of 89. The relative
isolation and extreme underdense environment make this an interesting case for
examining the role of gas accretion in galaxy evolution.
