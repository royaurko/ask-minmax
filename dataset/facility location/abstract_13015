This paper studies the problem of determining the sensor locations in a large
sensor network using relative distance (range) measurements only. Our work
follows from a seminal paper by Khan et al. [1] where a distributed algorithm,
known as DILOC, for sensor localization is given using the barycentric
coordinate. A main limitation of the DILOC algorithm is that all sensor nodes
must be inside the convex hull of the anchor nodes. In this paper, we consider
a general sensor network without the convex hull assumption, which incurs
challenges in determining the sign pattern of the barycentric coordinate. A
criterion is developed to address this issue based on available distance
measurements. Also, a new distributed algorithm is proposed to guarantee the
asymptotic localization of all localizable sensor nodes.
