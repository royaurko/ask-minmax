The Argon Dark Matter (ArDM-1t) experiment is a ton-scale liquid argon (LAr)
double-phase time projection chamber designed for direct Dark Matter searches.
Such a device allows to explore the low energy frontier in LAr with a charge
imaging detector. The ionization charge is extracted from the liquid into the
gas phase and there amplified by the use of a Large Electron Multiplier in
order to reduce the detection threshold. Direct detection of the ionization
charge with fine spatial granularity, combined with a measurement of the
amplitude and time evolution of the associated primary scintillation light,
provide powerful tools for the identification of WIMP interactions against the
background due to electrons, photons and possibly neutrons if scattering more
than once. A one ton LAr detector is presently installed on surface at CERN to
fully test all functionalities and it will be soon moved to an underground
location. We will emphasize here the lessons learned from such a device for the
design of a large LAr TPC for neutrino oscillation, proton decay and
astrophysical neutrinos searches.
