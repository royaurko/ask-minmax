We discuss expectations for the absorption of high-energy gamma-rays by
gamma-gamma pair production with intergalactic radiation fields (IRFs) at very
high redshifts (z~5-20), and the prospects thereof for probing the cosmic
reionization era. For the evolving IRF, a semi-analytical model incorporating
both Population II and Population III stars is employed, which is consistent
with a wide variety of existing high-z observations including QSO spectral
measurements, WMAP Thomson depth constraints, near-IR source count limits, etc.
We find that the UV IRF below the Lyman edge energy with intensities in the
range of a few times 10^{-19} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} Hz^{-1} sr^{-1} can cause
appreciable attenuation above ~12 GeV at z~5, down to ~6-8 GeV at z>~8-10. This
may be observable in the spectra of blazars or gamma-ray bursts by the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope or next generation facilities such as the Cherenkov
Telescope Array, Advanced Gamma-ray Imaging System or 5@5, providing invaluable
insight into early star formation and cosmic reionization.
