We developed a common access facility to homogeneously formatted
accelerometric event data and to the corresponding sheet of ground motion
parameters. This paper is focused on the description of the technical
development of the accelerometric data server and the link with the
accelerometric data explorer. The server is the third node of the 3-tier
architecture of the distributed archive system for accelerometric data. The
server is the link between the data users and the accelero- metric data portal.
The server follows three main steps: (1) Reading and analysis of the end-user
request; (2) Processing and converting data; and (3) Archiving and updating the
accelerometric data explorer. This paper presents the description of the data
server and the data explorer for accessing data.
