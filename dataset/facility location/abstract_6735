We use Levy processes to generate joint prior distributions, and therefore
penalty functions, for a location parameter as p grows large. This generalizes
the class of local-global shrinkage rules based on scale mixtures of normals,
illuminates new connections among disparate methods, and leads to new results
for computing posterior means and modes under a wide class of priors. We extend
this framework to large-scale regularized regression problems where p>n, and
provide comparisons with other methodologies.
