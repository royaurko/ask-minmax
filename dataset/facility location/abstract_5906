Magnetically and optically confined Bose-Einstein condensates were studied
near a microfabricated surface. Condensate fragmentation observed in
microfabricated magnetic traps was not observed in optical dipole traps at the
same location. The measured condensate lifetime was $\geq 20$ s and independent
of the atom-surface separation under both magnetic and optical confinement.
Radio-frequency spin-flip transitions driven by technical noise were directly
observed for optically confined condensates and could limit the condensate
lifetime in microfabricated magnetic traps.
