The radio galaxy MRC 1138-262 at z=2.16 is most likely a brightest cluster
galaxy in an early stage of evolution. Here we present observations of the
luminous emission line halo and the stellar components of this radio galaxy.
Optical narrow band imaging shows a very extended (about 160 kpc) and luminous
Lyman alpha halo. Infrared narrow band imaging reveals a much smaller H alpha
halo with a very different morphology. We advocate a model in which the inner
part of the halo is photoionized by direct AGN illumination or by UV photons
from young stars. Far from the nucleus (about 25 kpc), there is a region of
greatly enhanced Lyman alpha emission. At this location, it is likely that
shock ionization is important as indicated by a bend in the radio jet.
Spectroscopy of several continuum clumps in the halo shows that, although there
are striking differences between the emission and absorption features of the
spectra of various regions, they have properties similar to those of
Lyman-break galaxies. This is further evidence for a scenario in which massive
galaxies form hierarchically from smaller building blocks.
