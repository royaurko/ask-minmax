The work is aimed at experimental determining and computer simulating the
independent and cumulative yields of residual product nuclei in the target and
structure materials of the transmutation facilities driven by high-current
accelerators. The ITEP U-10 accelerator was used in 48 experiments to obtain
more than 4000 values of the yields of radioactive residual product nuclei in
0.1-2.6 GeV proton-irradiated thin 182,183,184,186-W, nat-W, 56-Fe, 58-Ni,
93-Nb, 232-Th, nat-U, 99-Tc, 59-Co 63,65-Cu, nat-Hg, 208-Pb, and 27-Al targets.
The results of verifying the LAHET, CEM95, CEM2k, CASCADE, CASCADE/INPE,
YIELDX, HETC, INUCL, and other simulation codes are presented.
