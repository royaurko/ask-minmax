CCAT is a sub-millimeter telescope to be built on Cerro Chajnantor in Chile
near the ALMA site. The remote location means that all observing will be done
by remote observers with the future goal of fully autonomous observing using a
dynamic scheduler. The fully autonomous observing mode provides a natural means
for accepting transient alert notifications for immediate follow up.
