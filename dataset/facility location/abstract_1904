The Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) facility is a conventional
horn-focused neutrino beam which produces muon neutrinos from a beam of mesons
directed into a long evacuated decay volume. The relative alignment of the
primary proton beam, target, and focusing horns affects the neutrino energy
spectrum delivered to experiments. This paper describes a check of the
alignment of these components using the proton beam.
