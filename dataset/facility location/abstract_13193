The BL Lac object 1ES 0229+200 is a firmly established very-high-energy (VHE;
E >100 GeV) source. Located at a redshift of 0.1396, its published VHE spectrum
is particularly hard (Gamma ~2.5) and is widely used to perform studies on the
extragalactic background light (EBL) and the intergalactic magnetic field
(IGMF). We present here the results of a long-term observing campaign on 1ES
0229+200 with VERITAS, lasting from 2009 to 2012, supported by multi-wavelength
observations. We discuss the VERITAS results with a particular emphasis on the
implications for the synchrotron-self-Compton modeling of the source emission
and for the theoretical studies (especially on the intergalactic magnetic
field) based on its VHE spectrum.
