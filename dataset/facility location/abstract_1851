KAERI (Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute) has been performing the
project named KOMAC (Korea Multi-purpose Accelerator Complex) within the frame
work of national mid and long term nuclear research plan. The final objectives
of KOMAC is to build a 20-MW (1 GeV and 20 mA) cw (100% duty factor) proton
linear accelerator. As the first stage, the low energy accelerator up to 20 MeV
is being developed in KTF (KOMAC Test Facility). The low energy accelerator
consists of an injector, RFQ, CCDTL, and RF systems. The proton injector with
Duoplasmatron ion source has been developed, and the LEBT with solenoid lens is
under development. The RFQ linac that will accelerate a 20mA proton beam from
50keV to 3MeV has been designed and is being fabricated. The RF system for RFQ
is being developed, and the CCDTL up to 20MeV is being designed. The status of
the low energy accelerator will be presented.
