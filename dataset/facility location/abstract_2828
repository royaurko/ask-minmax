In the famous Three-Door-Game Monte cannot help to win all the time by
signaling location of the prize, using only the freedom he allowed to use. No
matter which strategies played, there is always at least one door where the
prize will not be found. However, already in the game with four doors
cooperative Monte can reveal two useless doors in sequence (leaving two doors
unrevealed), to inform Conie about location of the prize, so enabling her to
beat the only-switching strategies and win all the time.
