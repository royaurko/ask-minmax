In present work the contributor presents a new set of spacetime measures for both,
subluminal and superluminal motion regimes, which do not diverge for the speed
of light in the former case and each regime has its own light-like cone which
warrants causality to each regime. For events located in the vicinity of the
light cone and inside it, there exists the possibility to transit across the
speed of light value in a discrete way, in terms of the very small constant
which we introduce here to prevent the divergence of our spacetime measures at
the speed of light.
