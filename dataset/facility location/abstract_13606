In this work we establish and point out connections between the notion of
query-answer causality in databases and database repairs, model-based diagnosis
in its consistency-based and abductive versions, and database updates through
views. The mutual relationships among these areas of data management and
knowledge representation shed light on each of them and help to share notions
and results they have in common. In one way or another, these are all
approaches to uncertainty management, which becomes even more relevant in the
context of big data that have to be made sense of.
