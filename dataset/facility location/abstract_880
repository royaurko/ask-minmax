The MuCool Test Area (MTA) is an intense primary beam facility derived
directly from the Fermilab Linac to test heat deposition and other technical
concerns associated with the liquid hydrogen targets being developed for
cooling intense muon beams. In this shielding study the results of Monte Carlo
radiation shielding calculations performed using the MARS14 code for the MuCool
Test Area and including the downstream portion of the target hall and berm
around it, access pit, service building, and parking lot are presented and
discussed within the context of the proposed MTA experimental configuration.
