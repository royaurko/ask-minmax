High resolution VLA observations of the Arches cluster near the Galactic
center show evidence of continuum emission at $\lambda$3.6, 6, 20 and 90cm. The
continuum emission at $\lambda$90cm is particularly striking because thermal
sources generally become optically thick at longer wavelengths and fall off in
brightness whereas non-thermal sources increase in brightness. It is argued
that the radio emission from this unique source has compact and diffuse
components produced by thermal and nonthermal processes, respectively. Compact
sources within the cluster arise from stellar winds of mass-losing stars (Lang,
Goss & Rodriguez 2001a) whereas diffuse emission is likely to be due to
colliding wind shocks of the cluster flow generating relativistic particles due
to diffuse shock acceleration. We also discuss the possibility that
$\gamma$-ray emission from 3EG J1746--2851, located within 3.3$'$ of the Arches
cluster, results from the inverse Compton scattering of the radiation field of
the cluster.
