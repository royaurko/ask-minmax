It has been a common practice to place electrodes based on external
landmarks, rather than locating the appropriate organ first by imaging
technuiqes such as CT scan, ultrasound, etc. Therefore, aside from abiding the
cutaneous EGG (electrogastrography) electrodes placement rule, identification
of its waveform should be performed to ease the validation of one's EGG
recording method. This research focused on the assembly of EGG instrument, its
performance testing, and its usage on local white rabbit (O. cuniculus). A
total of 72 recordings obtained and processed. Data procession implies EGG
parameterization based on segmentation and time domain analysis. Therefore this
research gives an insight of an EGG recording method that could be applied on
another preclinical, veterinary, and even for clinical examination.
