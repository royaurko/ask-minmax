We have recently proposed a simplified scenario for blazars in which these
sources are classified as flat-spectrum radio quasars or BL Lacs according to
the prescriptions of unified schemes, and to a varying combination of Doppler
boosted radiation from the jet, emission from the accretion disk, the broad
line region, and light from the host galaxy. This scenario has been thoroughly
tested through detailed Monte Carlo simulations and reproduces all the main
features of existing radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray surveys. In this paper we
consider the case of very high energy emission (E > 100 GeV) extrapolating from
the expectations for the GeV band, which are in full accordance with the
Fermi-LAT survey results, and make detailed predictions for current and future
Cherenkov facilities, including the Cherenkov Telescope Array. Our results
imply that >~ 100 new blazars can be detected now at very high energy and up to
z ~1, consistently with the very recent MAGIC detection of S4 0218+35 at
z=0.944.
