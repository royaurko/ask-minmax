The distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is crucial for the
calibration of the Cosmic Distance Scale. We derive a distance to the LMC based
on an analysis of ground-based photometry and HST-based spectroscopy and
spectrophotometry of the LMC eclipsing binary system HV2274. Analysis of the
optical light curve and HST/GHRS radial velocity curve provides the masses and
radii of the binary components. Analysis of the HST/FOS UV/optical
spectrophotometry provides the temperatures of the component stars and the
interstellar extinction of the system. When combined, these data yield a
distance to the binary system. After correcting for the location of HV2274 with
respect to the center of the LMC, we find d(LMC) = 45.7 +/- 1.6 kpc or DM(LMC)
= 18.30 +/- 0.07 mag. This result, which is immune to the metallicity-induced
zero point uncertainties that have plagued other techniques, lends strong
support to the ``short'' LMC distance scale as derived from a number of
independent methods.
