SS433 is the prototype microquasar in the Galaxy and may even be analogous to
the ULX sources if the jets' kinetic energy is taken into account. However, in
spite of 20 years of study, our constraints on the nature of the binary system
are extremely limited as a result of the difficulty of locating spectral
features that can reveal the nature and motion of the mass donor. Newly
acquired, high resolution blue spectra taken when the (precessing) disc is
edge-on suggest that the binary is close to a common-envelope phase, and hence
providing kinematic constraints is extremely difficult. Nevertheless, we do
find evidence for a massive donor, as expected for the inferred very high mass
transfer rate, and we compare SS433's properties with those of Cyg X-3.
