In a pilot study, we use the topological charge density defined by the
eigenmodes of the overlap Dirac operator (with ultraviolet filtering by
mode-truncation) to search for lumps of topological charge in SU(2) pure gauge
theory. Augmenting this search with periodic and antiperiodic temporal boundary
conditions for the overlap fermions, we demonstrate that the lumps can be
classified either as calorons or as separate caloron constituents (dyons).
Inside the topological charge clusters the (smeared) Polyakov loop is found to
show the typical profile characteristic for calorons and dyons. This
investigation, motivated by recent caloron/dyon model studies, is performed at
the deconfinement phase transition for SU(2) gluodynamics on 20^3 x 6 lattices
described by the tadpole improved L\"uscher-Weisz action. The transition point
has been carefully located. As a necessary condition for the caloron/dyon
detection capability, we check that the LW action, in contrast to the Wilson
action, generates lattice ensembles, for which the overlap Dirac eigenvalue
spectrum smoothly behaves under smearing and under the change of the boundary
conditions.
