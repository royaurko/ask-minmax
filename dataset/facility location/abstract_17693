The crystal structure, superconducting properties, and electronic structure
of a novel superconducting 122-type antimonide, BaPt$_2$Sb$_2$, have been
investigated by measurements of powder X-ray diffraction patterns, electrical
resistivity, ac magnetic susceptibility, specific heat as well as ab-initio
calculations. This material crystallizes in a new-type of monoclinic variant of
the CaBe$_2$Ge$_2$-type structure, in which Pt$_2$Sb$_2$ layers consisting of
PtSb$_4$ tetrahedra and Sb$_2$Pt$_2$ layers consisting of SbPt$_4$ tetrahedra
are stacked alternatively and Ba atoms are located between the layers.
Measurements of electrical resistivity, ac magnetic susceptibility and specific
heat revealed that BaPt$_2$Sb$_2$ is a superconducting material with a $T_{\rm
c}$ of 1.8 K. The electronic heat capacity coefficient $\gamma_{\rm n}$ and
Debye temperature $\theta_{\rm D}$ were 8.6(2) mJ/mol K$^2$ and 146(4) K, where
the figures in parentheses represent the standard deviation. The upper critical
field $\mu_{\rm 0}H_{\rm c2}(0)$ and the Ginzburg-Landau coherent length
$\xi(0)$ were determined to be 0.27 T and 35 nm. Calculations showed that it
has two three-dimensional Fermi surfaces (FSs) and two two-dimensional FSs,
leading to anisotropic transport properties. The d-states of the Pt atoms in
the Pt2Sb2 layers mainly contribute to $N(E_{\rm F})$. A comparison between
experimental and calculated results indicates that BaPt$_2$Sb$_2$ is a
superconducting material with moderate coupling.
