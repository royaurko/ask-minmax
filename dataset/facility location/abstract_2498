Recent resurgence of interest in applications of dense plasma focus and
doubts about the conventional view of dense plasma focus as a purely
irrotational compressive flow have re-opened questions concerning device
optimization. In this context, this paper re-appraises and extends the
analytical snowplow model of plasma focus sheath evolution developed by F.
Gratton and J.M. Vargas (GV) (Energy Storage, Compression and Switching, Ed. V.
Nardi, H. Sahlin, and W. H. Bostick, Eds., vol. 2. New York: Plenum, 1983, p.
353) and shows its relevance to contemporary research. The GV model enables
construction of a special orthogonal coordinate system in which the plasma flow
problem can be simplified and a model of sheath structure can be formulated.
The LPP plasma focus facility, which reports neutron yield better than global
scaling law, is shown to be operating closer to an optimum operating point of
the GV model as compared with PF-1000.
