We present for the first time a two-dimensional velocity field of the central
region of the grand-design spiral galaxy NGC 5248, at 0.9 arcsec spatial
resolution. The H-alpha velocity field is dominated by circular rotation. While
no systematic streaming motions are seen in the area of the nuclear
grand-design spiral or the circumnuclear ring, the amplitude of residual
velocities, after subtracting a model circular velocity field, reaches 20 km/s
in projection. The rotation curve levels out at around 140 km/s, after a
well-resolved and rather shallow rise. We have generated an analytical model
for the nuclear spiral and fitted it to our observations to obtain estimates of
the pattern speed of the spiral and the sound speed in the central region of
NGC 5248. Our results are consistent with a low pattern speed, suggesting that
the nuclear spiral rotates with the same rate as the main spiral structure in
NGC 5248, and thus that the spiral structure is coupled from scales of a few
hundred parsecs to several kiloparsecs. We have also compared the observed
structure and kinematics between the nuclear regions of NGC 5248 and M100.
Several similarities and differences are discussed, including the location of
the peak emission regions on major and minor axes, and the spiral arm streaming
motions. We find no kinematic evidence for a presence of a nuclear bar in NGC
5248.
