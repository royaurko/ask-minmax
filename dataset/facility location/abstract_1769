A research program with the aim of investigating the spin dependence of the
three-nucleon continuum in pd collisions at intermediate energies was carried
out at IUCF using the Polarized INternal Target EXperiments (PINTEX) facility.
In the elastic scattering experiment at 135 and 200 MeV proton beam energies a
total of 15 independent spin observables were obtained. The breakup experiment
was done with a vector and tensor polarized deuteron beam of 270 MeV and an
internal polarized hydrogen gas target. We developed a novel technique for the
analysis of the breakup observables, the sampling method. The new approach
takes into account acceptance and non-uniformities of detection efficiencies
and is suitable for any kinematically complete experiment with three particles
in the final state.
