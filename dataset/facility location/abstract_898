We report a successful tuning of Co valence state in cobalt oxyhydrate
superconductor via a facile post reduction using NaOH as reducing agent. The
change in Co valence was precisely determined by measuring the volume of the
released oxygen. The possible hydronium-incorporation was greatly suppressed in
concentrated NaOH solution, making the absolute Co valence determinable. As a
result, an updated superconducting phase diagram was obtained, which shows that
the superconducting transition temperature increases monotonically with
increasing Co valence in a narrow range from +3.58 to +3.65.
