Recent ionospheric modification experiments with the 3.6 MW transmitter at
the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) facility in Alaska
led to discovery of artificial ionization descending from the nominal
interaction altitude in the background F-region ionosphere by ~60 km. This
paper presents a physical model of an ionizing wavefront created by
suprathermal electrons accelerated by the HF-excited plasma turbulence.
