We study semi-classical multi-spin strings in the non-supersymmetric
backgrounds of $AdS$ Black Hole and Witten's confining model. We consider
constant radius strings with rotations along the isometries of the backgrounds.
In the $AdS$ Black Hole, solutions exist only if there is a non-zero spin in
the Black Hole part. In contrast with the $AdS$ background, we find solutions
which although have no rotation in the $S^5$ part, have a regular $\lambda$
expansion in the expression for large energy. In the near-extremal $D_3$ and
$D_4$ backgrounds, we find that strings have to be located on the confining
wall. We also discuss the stability of solutions by considering the fluctuation
Lagrangians.
