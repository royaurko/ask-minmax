Non-self-sustained electric discharge and electric breakdown were triggered
and guided by a train of picosecond UV pulses overlapped with a long
free-running UV pulse of a hybrid Ti:Sapphire-KrF laser facility. Photocurrent
sustained by this train is two orders of magnitude higher, and electric
breakdown distance is twice longer than those for the discharge triggered by
the long UV pulse only.
