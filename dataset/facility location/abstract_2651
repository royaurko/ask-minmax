Crystal channeling technology has offered various opportunities in
accelerator community with a viability of ultrahigh gradient (TV/m)
acceleration for future HEP collider in Energy Frontier. The major challenge of
the channeling acceleration is that ultimate acceleration gradients might
require high power driver at hard x-ray regime (~ 40 keV), exceeding those
conceivable for x-rays as of today, though x-ray lasers can efficiently excite
solid plasma and accelerate particles inside a crystal channel. Moreover, only
disposable crystal accelerators are possible at such high externally excited
fields which would exceed the ionization thresholds destroying the atomic
structure, so acceleration will take place only in a short time before full
dissociation of the lattice. Carbon- based nanostructures have great potential
with a wide range of flexibility and superior physical strength, which can be
applied to channeling acceleration. This paper present beam-driven channeling
acceleration concept with CNTs and discuss feasible experiments with the
Advanced Superconducting Test Area (ASTA) in Fermilab and beyond.
