We report the kinematic discovery of the Pisces Stellar Stream (PSS), at
Galactic longitude of roughly l=135 degrees and longitude between -39 < b < -36
deg. We originally identified this halo substructure from velocities of red
giant branch stars in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8, and
confirmed its presence in turnoff stars from SDSS photometric data. The PSS is
a narrow, kinematically cold tidal stream, with a velocity dispersion of 8
km/s. Its metallicity is [Fe/H]=-2.2, with ~0.3 dex dispersion. The
color-magnitude signature of the stream turnoff, combined with our measured
metallicity, places the PSS at a distance of 35+/-3 kpc. The Pisces Stellar
Stream is the same as the previously announced "Triangulum stream" and part of
the proposed "stream a". We rule out an association of the PSS with other
previously known Milky Way substructures in the same region of the sky.
