Monoenergetic muon neutrinos (235.5 MeV) from positive kaon decay-at-rest are
considered as a source for an electron neutrino appearance search. In
combination with a liquid argon time projection chamber based detector, such a
source could provide discovery-level sensitivity to the neutrino oscillation
parameter space indicative of a sterile neutrino. Current and future intense >3
GeV kinetic energy proton facilities around the world can be employed for this
experimental concept.
