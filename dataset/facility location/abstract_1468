The ESO Imaging Survey (EIS) is an ongoing project to carry out public
imaging surveys to support programs on the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT). The
first phase of the project started in July 1997 and consisted of a moderately
deep, large-area survey (EIS-WIDE) and a deep optical/infrared survey
(EIS-DEEP) using the ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT). EIS has recently
reached another milestone with the completion of a Pilot Survey using the
Wide-Field Image (WFI), an 8k by 8k mosaic CCD camera mounted on the MPG/ESO
2.2m telescope at La Silla. This paper briefly reviews the results of the
original EIS and gives an update of the results obtained from the observations
carried out as part of the Pilot Survey. Work in progress on the development of
an advanced pipeline for handling data from large CCD mosaics and facilities to
make the access to data products easier for external users are also discussed.
