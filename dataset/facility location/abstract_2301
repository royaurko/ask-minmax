We conduct a search for the 4He-eta bound state with WASA-at-COSY facility,
via a measurement of the excitation functions for the dd->3Heppi- reaction,
where the outgoing p-pi- pairs originate from the conversion of the eta meson
on a nucleon inside the He nucleus. Determination of the profile of the
excitation curve below the threshold of the dd->4He-eta reaction will allow to
establish the binding energy and the width of the He-eta bound state. In June,
2008 first measurements of the excitation functions for the dd->3Heppi-
reaction were performed. In the experiment we used a slowly ramped COSY
deuteron beam, scanning the range of momenta corresponding to the variation of
the excess energy for the 4He-eta system from -51.4 MeV to 22 MeV.
