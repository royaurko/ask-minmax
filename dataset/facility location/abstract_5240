The work contained herein constitutes a report of the ``Beyond the Standard
Model'' working group for the Workshop "Physics at TeV Colliders", Les Houches,
France, 26 May--6 June, 2003. The research presented is original, and was
performed specifically for the workshop. Tools for calculations in the minimal
supersymmetric standard model are presented, including a comparison of the dark
matter relic density predicted by public codes. Reconstruction of
supersymmetric particle masses at the LHC and a future linear collider facility
is examined. Less orthodox supersymmetric signals such as non-pointing photons
and R-parity violating signals are studied. Features of extra dimensional
models are examined next, including measurement strategies for radions and
Higgs', as well as the virtual effects of Kaluza Klein modes of gluons. An LHC
search strategy for a heavy top found in many little Higgs model is presented
and finally, there is an update on LHC $Z'$ studies.
