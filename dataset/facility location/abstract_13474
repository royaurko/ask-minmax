It is believed that there are currently millions of vehicles on the roads
worldwide. The over speed of vehicles,theft of vehicles, disobeying traffic
rules in public, an uncontributorized person entering the restricted area are keep
on increasing. In order restrict against these criminal activities, we need an
automatic public security system. Each vehicle has their own Vehicle
Identification Number (VIN) as their primary identifier. The VIN is actually a
License Number which states a legal license to participate in the public
traffic. The proposed paper is to identify the vehicle with the help of
vehicles License Plate (LP).LPRS is one the most important part of the
Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) to locate the LP. In this paper certain
existing algorithm drawbacks are overcome by the proposed morphological
operations for LPRS. Morphological operation is chosen due to its higher
efficiency, noise filter capacity, accuracy, exact localization of LP and
speed.
