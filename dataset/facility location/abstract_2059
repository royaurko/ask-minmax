We report on the investigation of strong radiative shocks generated with the
high energy, sub-nanosecond iodine laser at PALS. These shock waves are
characterized by a developed radiative precursor and their dynamics is analyzed
over long time scales (~50 ns), approaching a quasi-stationary limit. We
present the first preliminary results on the rear side XUV spectroscopy. These
studies are relevant to the understanding of the spectroscopic signatures of
accretion shocks in Classical T Tauri Stars.
