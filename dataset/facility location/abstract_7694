We present high spatial resolution CO(1-0) mapping of the luminous infrared
galaxy NGC6240 obtained with the IRAM - Plateau de Bure Interferometer. This
source is a well-known early-stage merging system hosting two AGN. We find a
broad CO(1-0) line profile, with maximum velocity 800 km/s and FWZI=1400 km/s,
and displaying several kinematic components, revealing the complexity of the
gas dynamics in this system. We detect a blueshifted CO emission with velocity
in the range -200 and -500 km/s, peaked around the southern AGN, at the same
position where the H2 outflow is located, and with a mass loss rate of ~500
Msun/yr. We interpret this blueshifted component as a outflow, originating from
the southern nucleus. The spatial and spectral match strongly suggests that the
CO outflow is connected to the H2 superwind located around the southern
nucleus, and to the large scale CO outflow, with similar velocities, extended
on scales of 10 kpc. The large mass loading factor (dM/dt /SFR ~ 10) of the
molecular gas suggests that the outflow is likely driven by both SNa winds and
the radiation of the southern AGN. We discovered a nuclear, redshifted CO
emission peaking in the mid point of the two nuclei, as it is the case for the
CO emission at the systemic velocity. The large velocity dispersion, which
reaches its maximum (~500 Km/s) in the mid point between the two nuclei,
suggests that the gas might be highly turbulent in this region, although the
presence of an unresolved rotation component cannot be ruled out.
