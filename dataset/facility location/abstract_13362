Blow-up in second and fourth order semi-linear parabolic partial differential
equations (PDEs) is considered in bounded regions of one, two and three spatial
dimensions with uniform initial data. A phenomenon whereby singularities form
at multiple points simultaneously is exhibited and explained by means of a
singular perturbation theory. In the second order case we pre- dict that points
furthest from the boundary are selected by the dynamics of the PDE for
singularity. In the fourth order case, singularities can form simultaneously at
multiple locations, even in one spatial dimension. In two spatial dimensions,
the singular perturbation theory reveals that the set of possible singularity
points depends subtly on the geometry of the domain and the equation
parameters. In three spatial dimensions, preliminary numerical simulations
indicate that the multiplicity of singularities can be even more complex. For
the aforementioned scenarios, the analysis highlights the dichotomy of
behaviors exhibited between the second and fourth order cases.
