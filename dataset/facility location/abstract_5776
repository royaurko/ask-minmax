Archival Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field/Planetary Camera 2 observations of
the Small Magellanic Cloud serendipitously reveal a possible counterpart to the
Anomalous X-ray Pulsar CXOU J010043.1-721134. The candidate is faint, but its
location and strange colours make it an interesting object. We estimate, that
the probability of such a detection being due to a non-physical source is less
than 1.5%. We have tried to confirm the identification with Gemini-South and
Magellan, but the conditions were insufficiently favourable. If confirmed, the
object will allow the first detailed studies of the optical and ultraviolet
emission of magnetars.
