We have organized an extensive multiwavelength campaign on BL Lacertae in the
second half of 2000. Simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous observations were taken
at radio frequencies, in the optical - carried out by the WEBT collaboration -,
in X-rays - using BeppoSAX and RXTE -, and at VHE gamma-rays with the CAT and
HEGRA Cherenkov telescope facilities. In this paper, we are presenting first
results from this campaign. The WEBT optical campaign achieved an unprecedented
time coverage, virtually continuous over several 10 - 20 hour segments, and
revealed intraday variability on time scales of ~ 1.5 hours. The X-ray
observations of Nov. 1 - 2, 2000, revealed significant variability on similar
time scales, and provided evidence for the synchrotron spectrum extending out
to ~ 10 keV during that time. At higher energies, the onset of the hard
power-law commonly observed in radio-loud quasars and radio-selected BL Lac
objects is seen. From the energy-resolved X-ray variability patterns, we find
evidence that electron cooling might not be dominated by one single radiation
mechanism; rather, a combination of synchrotron and Compton cooling seems to be
required.
