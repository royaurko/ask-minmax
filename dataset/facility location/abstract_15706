We make a numerical study of the finite temperature properties of the SO(3)
lattice gauge theory. As its symmetry properties are quite different from those
of the SU(2) LGT, a different set of observables have to be considered in this
model. We study several observables, such as, the plaquette square, the Z(2)
monopole density, the fundamental and adjoint Wilson line, and the tiled Wilson
line correlation function. Our simulations show that the Z(2) monopoles
condense at strong coupling just as in the bulk system. This transition is seen
at approximately the same location as in the bulk system. A surprising
observation is the multiple valuedness of the adjoint Wilson line at high
temperatures. At high temperatures, we observe long lived metastable states in
which the adjoint Wilson line takes positive and negative values. The numerical
values of other observables in these two states appear to be almost the same.
We study these states using different methods and also make comparisons with
the high temperature behaviour of the SU(2) LGT. Finally, we discuss various
interpretations of our results and point out their relevance for the phase
diagram of the SO(3) LGT at finite temperature.
