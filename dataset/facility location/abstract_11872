Simulated landscapes have been used for decades to evaluate search strategies
whose goal is to find the landscape location with maximum fitness. Applications
include modeling the capacity of enzymes to catalyze reactions and the clinical
effectiveness of medical treatments. Understanding properties of landscapes is
important for understanding search difficulty. This paper presents a novel and
transparent characterization of NK landscapes.
  We prove that NK landscapes can be represented by parametric linear
interaction models where model coefficients have meaningful interpretations. We
derive the statistical properties of the model coefficients, providing insight
into how the NK algorithm parses importance to main effects and interactions.
An important insight derived from the linear model representation is that the
rank of the linear model defined by the NK algorithm is correlated with the
number of local optima, a strong determinant of landscape complexity and search
difficulty. We show that the maximal rank for an NK landscape is achieved
through epistatic interactions that form partially balanced incomplete block
designs. Finally, an analytic expression representing the expected number of
local optima on the landscape is derived, providing a way to quickly compute
the expected number of local optima for very large landscapes.
