The Beta Beam, the concept of generating a pure and intense (anti) neutrino
beam by letting accelerated radioactive ions beta decay in a storage ring
called the Decay Ring (DR), is the basis of one of the proposed next generation
neutrino oscillation facilities, necessary for a complete study of the neutrino
oscillation parameter space. Sensitivities of the unknown neutrino oscillation
parameters depend on the DR's ion intensity and of its duty factor (the filled
ratio of the ring). Different methods, including analytical calculations and
multiparticle tracking simulations, were used to estimate the DR's potential to
contain enough ions in as small a part of the ring as needed for the
sensitivities. Studies of transverse blow up of the beams due to resonance wake
fields show that a very challenging upper limit of the transverse broadband
impedance is required to avoid instabilities and beam loss.
