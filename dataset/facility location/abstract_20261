PandaX is a large upgradable liquid-xenon detector system that can be used
for both direct dark-matter detection and $^{136}$Xe double-beta decay search.
It is located in the Jinping Deep-Underground Laboratory in Sichuan, China. The
detector operates in dual-phase mode, allowing detection of both prompt
scintillation, and ionization charge through proportional scintillation. The
central time projection chamber will be staged, with the first stage
accommodating a target mass of about 120\,kg. In stage II, the target mass will
be increased to about 0.5\,ton. In the final stage, the detector can be
upgraded to a multi-ton target mass. In this paper a detailed description of
the stage-I detector design and performance results established during the
commissioning phase is presented.
