The single electron tunneling spectroscopy on superconductor
Na$_{x}$CoO$_2$$\cdot$ yH$_2$O and its starting compound Na$_{x}$CoO$_2$ has
been studied with point-contact method. The spectra of Na$_{x}$CoO$_2$ have two
types of distinct shapes at different random locations, this is attributed to
the non-uniformly distributed sodium escaped from the inner part of the sample.
While all the measured spectra of the superconducting samples
Na$_{x}$CoO$_2$$\cdot$ yH$_2$O have a good spatial reproducibility, and show a
remarkable zero bias conductance depression appearing below an onset
temperature which associates very well with the resistance upturn at around 45
K. The latter behavior resembles in some way the pseudogap feature in
high-T$_c$ cuprate uperconductors.
