The SNS Project intends to integrate Conventional Facility Controls with its
EPICS-based Accelerator and Target Control Systems. EPICS will therefore be
used to provide distributed high-level access to all subsystems of the SNS
conventional facilities, including cooling water towers, chilled water,
de-ionized water, HVAC, waste processing, and power monitoring. EPICS will
provide operator displays and high-level control for more than 1000 process
variables. EPICS support will be provided by four IOCs using PowerPC-based
VMEbus controllers . Low-level control will be provided by Allen-Bradley
ControlLogix PLCs that will communicate among themselves using ControlNet and
with EPICS using EtherNet/IP [2]. Both the PLC layer and the EPICS layer will
be implemented by an industrial supplier. File server support will be
Linux-based and Concurrent Versions System (CVS) will be used to manage version
control, both for EPICS and for PLC program and configuration files. All system
process variable names, hardware, software, and database configuration
properties will be maintained in a master Oracle database which will be used to
generate and maintain EPICS and PLC databases for the entire project.
