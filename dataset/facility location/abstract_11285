Many datasets such as market basket data, text or hypertext documents, and
sensor observations recorded in different locations or time periods, are
modeled as a collection of sets over a ground set of keys. We are interested in
basic aggregates such as the weight or selectivity of keys that satisfy some
selection predicate defined over keys' attributes and membership in particular
sets. This general formulation includes basic aggregates such as the Jaccard
coefficient, Hamming distance, and association rules.
  On massive data sets, exact computation can be inefficient or infeasible.
Sketches based on coordinated random samples are classic summaries that support
approximate query processing.
  Queries are resolved by generating a sketch (sample) of the union of sets
used in the predicate from the sketches these sets and then applying an
estimator to this union-sketch.
  We derive novel tighter (unbiased) estimators that leverage sampled keys that
are present in the union of applicable sketches but excluded from the union
sketch. We establish analytically that our estimators dominate estimators
applied to the union-sketch for {\em all queries and data sets}. Empirical
evaluation on synthetic and real data reveals that on typical applications we
can expect a 25%-4 fold reduction in estimation error.
