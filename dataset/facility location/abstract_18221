G359.87+0.18 is an enigmatic object located 15' from Sgr A*. It has been
variously classified as an extragalactic source, Galactic jet source, and young
supernova remnant. We present new observations of G359.87+0.18 between 0.33 and
15 GHz and use these to argue that this source is an Faranoff-Riley II radio
galaxy. We are able to place a crude limit on its redshift of z > 0.1. The
source has a spectral index \alpha < -1 (S \propto \nu^\alpha), suggestive of a
radio galaxy with a redshift z >~ 2.
  The scattering diameters of Sgr A* and several nearby OH masers (~ 1" at 1
GHz) indicate that a region of enhanced scattering is along the line of sight
to the Galactic center. If the region covers the Galactic center uniformly, the
implied diameter for a background source is at least 600" at 0.33 GHz, in
contrast with the observed 20" diameter of G359.87+0.18. Using the scattering
diameter of a nearby OH maser OH 359.762+0.120 and the widths of two, nearby,
non-thermal threads, G0.08+0.15 and G359.79+0.17, we show that a uniform
scattering region should cover G359.87+0.18. We therefore conclude that the
Galactic center scattering region is inhomogeneous on a scale of 5' (~ 10 pc at
a distance of 8.5 kpc). This scale is comparable to the size scale of molecular
clouds in the Galactic center. The close agreement between these two lengths
scales is an indication that the scattering region is linked intimately to the
Galactic center molecular clouds.
