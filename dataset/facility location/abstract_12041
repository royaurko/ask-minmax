We have performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on the
(111) surface of the topological crystalline insulator SnTe. Distinct from a
pair of Dirac-cone surface states across the X_bar point of the surface
Brillouin zone on the (001) surface, we revealed two types of Dirac-cone
surface states each centered at the G_bar and M_bar points, which originate
from the bulk-band inversion at the L points. We also found that the energy
location of the Dirac point and the Dirac velocity are different from each
other. This ARPES experiment demonstrates the surface states on different
crystal faces of a topological material, and it elucidates how
mirror-symmetry-protected Dirac cones of a topological crystalline insulator
show up on surfaces with different symmetries.
