This article reviews recent progress of QCD phase structure, including color
superconductor at high baryon density and strongly interacting quark-gluon
plasma (sQGP) at high temperature created through relativistic heavy ion
collision. A brief overview is given on the discovery of sQGP at RHIC. The
possibility of locating the critical end point (CEP) from the property of bulk
viscosity over entropy density is discussed. For the phase structure at high
baryon density, the status of the unconventional color superconducting phase
with mismatched pairing is reviewed. The chromomagnetic instability, Sarma
instability and Higgs instability in the gapless color superconducting phase
are clarified.
