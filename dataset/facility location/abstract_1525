It has been suggested in the literature that the (Fe/alpha) abundance ratio
may be used as a chronometer, due to a delay in this ratio reaching its solar
value as predicted by galactic chemical evolution models. Using grids of
photoionization models along a sequence of the (Fe/Mg) abundance ratio vs.\
metallicity with time in a giant elliptical starburst scenario, we investigate
the relationship between the (Fe/Mg) abundance ratio and the FeII/MgII emission
line flux ratio under the assumption that these lines originate in photoionized
clouds within the broad emission line regions of quasars.
