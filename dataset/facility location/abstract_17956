Impurities cause radiation losses and plasma dilution, and in stellarator
plasmas the neoclassical ambipolar radial electric field is often unfavorable
for avoiding strong impurity peaking. In this work we use a new continuum
drift-kinetic solver, the SFINCS code (the Stellarator Fokker-Planck Iterative
Neoclassical Conservative Solver) [M. Landreman et al., Phys. Plasmas 21 (2014)
042503] which employs the full linearized Fokker-Planck operator, to calculate
neoclassical impurity transport coefficients for a Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X)
magnetic configuration. We compare SFINCS calculations with theoretical
asymptotes in the high collisionality limit. In intermediate and high
collisionality regimes, a momentum conserving collision operator is critical to
correctly determine the impurity transport coefficients, and a simple
pitch-angle scattering approximation can lead to transport predictions in the
wrong direction. In the low collisionality regime pitch-angle scattering is
sufficient to accurately describe impurity transport through self-interaction,
but lacks the ability to describe inter-species interaction. We also use SFINCS
to analyze how the impurity content affects the neoclassical impurity dynamics
and the bootstrap current. We show that a change in plasma effective charge
Zeff of order unity can affect the bootstrap current enough to cause a
deviation in the divertor strike point locations.
