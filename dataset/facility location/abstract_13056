Egocentric vision technology consists in capturing the actions of persons
from their own visual point of view using wearable camera sensors. We apply
this new paradigm to instrumental activities monitoring with the objective of
providing new tools for the clinical evaluation of the impact of the disease on
persons with dementia. In this paper, we introduce the current state of the
development of this technology and focus on two technology modules: automatic
location estimation and visual saliency estimation for content interpretation.
