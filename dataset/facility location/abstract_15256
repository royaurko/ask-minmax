We present early WHT ISIS optical spectroscopy of the afterglow of gamma-ray
burst GRB 050730. The spectrum shows a DLA system with the highest measured
hydrogen column to date: N(HI) = 22.1 +/- 0.1 at the third-highest GRB redshift
z = 3.968. Our analysis of the Swift XRT X-ray observations of the early
afterglow show X-ray flares accompanied by decreasing X-ray absorption. From
both the optical and the X-ray spectra we constrain the dust and gas properties
of the host galaxy. We find the host to be a low metallicity galaxy, with low
dust content. Much of the X-ray absorbing gas is situated close to the GRB,
whilst the HI absorption causing the DLA is most likely located further out.
