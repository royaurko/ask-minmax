The Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) is a huge (5200 cm2) coded aperture
imager that will detect gamma-ray bursts in real time and provide a location
that the Swift satellite will use to slew the optical and x-ray telescopes. The
huge size of BAT is a challenge for the on-board triggering: a change as small
as 1% is equivalent to a 1 sigma statistical variation in 1 second. There will
be three types of triggers, two based on rates and one based on images. The
first type of trigger is for short time scales (4 msec to 64 msec). These will
be traditional triggers (single background) and we check about 25,000
combinations of time-energy-focal plane subregions per second. The second type
of trigger will be similar to what is used on HETE: fits to multiple background
regions to remove trends for time scales between 64 msec and 64 seconds. About
500 triggers will be checked per second. For these rate triggers, false
triggers and variable non-GRB sources will be rejected by requiring a new
source to be present in an image. The third type of trigger works on longer
time scales (minutes), and will be based on routine images that are made of the
field of view.
