In a recent paper we presented a truncation-type method of deriving Backlund
transformations for ordinary differential equations. This method is based on a
consideration of truncation as a mapping that preserves the locations of a
natural subset of the movable poles that the equation possesses. Here we apply
this approach to the third and fifth Painleve equations. For the third Painleve
equation we are able to obtain all fundamental Backlund transformations for the
case where the parameters satisfy $\gamma\delta\neq0$. For the fifth Painleve
equation our approach yields what appears to be all known Backlund
transformations.
