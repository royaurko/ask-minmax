We propose a coefficient that measures the dependence among large values for
spatial processes of maxima. Its main properties are: a) $k$ locations can be
taken into account; b) it takes values in $[0,1]$ and higher values indicate
stronger dependence; c) it is independent of the univariate marginal
distributions of the random field; d) it can be related with the tail
dependence and the extremal coefficients; e) it agrees with the concordance
property for multivariate distributions; f) it has as a particular case the
variogram from geostatistics; g) it can be easily estimated.
