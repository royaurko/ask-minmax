The aim of the present paper is to investigate the spatial structure of a
protoplanetary disc whose dynamics is governed by magnetorotational turbulence.
We perform a series of local 3D chemo-radiative MHD simulations located at
different radii of a disc which is twice as massive as the standard minimum
mass solar nebula of Hayashi (1981). The ionisation state of the disc is
calculated by including collisional ionisation, stellar X-rays, cosmic rays and
the decay of radionuclides as ionisation sources, and by solving a simplified
chemical network which includes the effect of the absorption of free charges by
{\mu}m-sized dust grains. In the region where the ionisation is too low to
assure good coupling between matter and magnetic fields, a non-turbulent
central "dead zone" forms, which ranges approximately from a distance of 2 AU
to 4 AU from the central star. The approach taken in the present work allows
for the first time to derive the global spatial structure of a protoplanetary
disc from a set of physically realistic numerical simulations.
