The Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) is a large public spectroscopic survey that aims at
observing with FLAMES@VLT the main stellar components of our Galaxy. The study
of the population of open clusters is one of the main objectives of GES. We
present some results from the first 18 months of observations, among them, a
preliminary view of the radial metallicity gradient as traced by open cluster
data and a comparison of the chemical patterns of clusters located in different
parts of the Galactic disk.
