Current status of TAMA and CLIO detectors in Japan is reported in this
article. These two interferometric gravitational-wave detectors are being
developed for the large cryogenic gravitational wave telescope (LCGT) which is
a future plan for detecting gravitational wave signals at least once per year.
  TAMA300 is being upgraded to improve the sensitivity in low frequency region
after the last observation experiment in 2004. To reduce the seismic noises, we
are installing new seismic isolation system, which is called TAMA Seismic
Attenuation System, for the four test masses. We confirmed stable mass locks of
a cavity and improvements of length and angular fluctuations by using two SASs.
We are currently optimizing the performance of the third and fourth SASs. We
continue TAMA300 operation and R&D studies for LCGT. Next data taking in the
summer of 2007 is planned.
  CLIO is a 100-m baseline length prototype detector for LCGT to investigate
interferometer performance in cryogenic condition. The key features of CLIO are
that it locates Kamioka underground site for low seismic noise level, and
adopts cryogenic Sapphire mirrors for low thermal noise level. The first
operation of the cryogenic interferometer was successfully demonstrated in
February of 2006. Current sensitivity at room temperature is close to the
target sensitivity within a factor of 4. Several observation experiments at
room temperature have been done. Once the displacement noise reaches at thermal
noise level of room temperature, its improvement by cooling test mass mirrors
should be demonstrated.
