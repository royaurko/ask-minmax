We examine the leading order noncommutative corrections to the differential
and total cross sections for e+ e- --> q q-bar. After averaging over the
earth's rotation, the results depend on the latitude for the collider, as well
as the direction of the incoming beam. They also depend on scale and direction
of the noncommutativity. Using data from LEP, we exclude regions in the
parameter space spanned by the noncommutative scale and angle relative to the
earth's axis. We also investigate possible implications for phenomenology at
the future International Linear Collider.
