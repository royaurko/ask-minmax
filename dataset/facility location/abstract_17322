We investigated the environment of the infrared dust bubble N68 and searched
for evidence of triggered star formation in its surroundings. We performed a
multiwavelength study of the nebula with data taken from several large-scale
surveys: GLIMPSE, MIPSGAL, IRAS, NVSS, GRS, and JCMT. We analyzed the spectral
profile and the distribution of the molecular gas (^{13}CO J = 1 - 0 and J = 3
- 2), and the dust in the environment of the N68. The position-velocity diagram
clearly shows that the N68 may be expanding outward. We used two three-color
images of the mid-infrared emission to explore the physical environment, and
one color-color diagram to investigate the distribution of young stellar
objects (YSOs). We found that the 24 \mu m emission is surrounded by the 8.0
\mu m emission. Morphologically, the 1.4 GHz continuum correlates strongly with
the 24 \mu m emission, and the ^{13}CO J = 1 - 0 and J = 3 - 2 emissions
correlate well with the 8.0 \mu m emission. We investigated two compact cores
located at the shell of the N68. The spectral intensity ratios of ^{13}CO J = 3
- 2 to J = 1 - 0 range from 5 to 0.3. In addition, young star objects, masers,
IRAS, and UC HII regions distribute at the shell of bubble. The active region
may be triggered by the expanding of the bubble N68.
