The spectral statistics of the circular billiard with a point-scatterer is
investigated. In the semiclassical limit, the spectrum is demonstrated to be
composed of two uncorrelated level sequences. The first corresponds to states
for which the scatterer is located in the classically forbidden region and its
energy levels are not affected by the scatterer in the semiclassical limit
while the second sequence contains the levels which are affected by the
point-scatterer. The nearest neighbor spacing distribution which results from
the superposition of these sequences is calculated analytically within some
approximation and good agreement with the distribution that was computed
numerically is found.
