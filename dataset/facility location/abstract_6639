We present high spatial and temporal resolution Ca II 8542 observations of a
kink wave in an on-disk chromospheric active region fibril. The properties of
the wave are similar to those observed in off-limb spicules. From the observed
phase and period of the wave we determine a lower limit for the field strength
in the chromospheric active region fibril located at the edge of a sunspot to
be a few hundred Gauss. We find indications that the event was triggered by a
small-scale reconnection event higher up in the atmosphere.
