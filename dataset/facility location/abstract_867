The Radio-Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) linac that will accelerate a 20mA proton
beam from 50keV to 3MeV has been designed and is being fabricated as the first
phase, KOMAC Test Facility (KTF), of the Korea Multipurpose Accelerator Complex
(KOMAC) project at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI). The
physical, engineering designs and fabrication status of the RFQ are described.
