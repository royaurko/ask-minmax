The spatiotemporal structure of reactive media supporting a solitary spiral
wave is studied for systems where the local reaction law exhibits a
period-doubling cascade to chaos. This structure is considerably more complex
than that of simple period-1 oscillatory media. As one moves from the core of
the spiral wave the local dynamics takes the form of perturbed period-doubled
orbits whose character varies with spatial location relative to the core. An
important feature of these media is the existence of a curve where the local
dynamics is effectively period-1. This curve arises as a consequence of the
necessity to reconcile the conflict between the global topological organization
of the medium induced by the presence of a spiral wave and the topological
phase space structure of local orbits determined by the reaction rate law. Due
to their general topological nature, the phenomena described here should be
observable in a broad class of systems with complex periodic behavior.
