The performance of IACT's arrays is sensitive to the altitude and geomagnetic
field (GF) of the observatory site. Both effects play important role in the
region of the sub-TeV gamma-ray measurements. We investigate the influence of
GF on detection rates and the energy thresholds for five possible locations of
the future CTA observatory using the Monte Carlo simulations. We conclude that
the detection rates of gamma rays and the energy thresholds of the arrays can
be fitted with linear functions of the altitude and the component of the GF
perpendicular to the shower axis core. These results can be directly
extrapolated for any possible localization of the CTA. In this paper we also
show the influence of both geophysical effects on the images of shower and
gamma/hadron separation.
