Service-oriented workflows are typically executed using a centralised
orchestration approach that presents significant scalability challenges. These
challenges include the consumption of network bandwidth, degradation of
performance, and single-points of failure. We provide a decentralised
orchestration architecture that attempts to address these challenges. Our
architecture adopts a design model that permits the computation to be moved
"closer" to services in a workflow. This is achieved by partitioning workflows
specified using our simple dataflow language into smaller fragments, which may
be sent to remote locations for execution.
