This paper presents archival ROSAT PSPC observations of the G65.2+5.7
supernova remnant (also known as G65.3+5.7). Little material obscures this
remnant and so it was well observed, even at the softest end of ROSAT's
bandpass (~0.11 to 0.28 keV). These soft X-ray images reveal the remnant's
centrally-filled morphology which, in combination with existing radio frequency
observations, places G65.2+5.7 in the thermal composite (mixed morphology)
class of supernova remnants. Not only might G65.2+5.7 be the oldest known
thermal composite supernova remnant, but owing to its optically revealed cool,
dense shell, this remnant supports the proposal that thermal composite
supernova remnants lack X-ray bright shells because they have evolved beyond
the adiabatic phase. These observations also reveal a slightly extended point
source centered on RA = 19h 36m 46s, dec = 30deg 40' 07'' and extending 6.5
arcmin in radius in the band 67 map. The source of this emission has yet to be
discovered, as there is no known pulsar at this location.
