Location awareness is a key factor for a wealth of wireless indoor
applications. Its provision requires the careful fusion of diverse information
sources. For agents that use radio signals for localization, this information
may either come from signal transmissions with respect to fixed anchors, from
cooperative transmissions in between agents, or from radar-like monostatic
transmissions. Using a-priori knowledge of a floor plan of the environment,
specular multipath components can be exploited, based on a geometric-stochastic
channel model. In this paper, a unified framework is presented for the
quantification of this type of position-related information, using the concept
of equivalent Fisher information. We derive analytical results for the
Cram\'er-Rao lower bound of multipath-assisted positioning, considering
bistatic transmissions between agents and fixed anchors, monostatic
transmissions from agents, cooperative measurements in-between agents, and
combinations thereof, including the effect of clock offsets and missing
synchronization. Awareness of this information enables highly accurate and
robust indoor positioning. Computational results show the applicability of the
framework for the characterization of the localization capabilities of some
environment, quantifying the influence of different system setups, signal
parameters, and the impact of path overlap.
