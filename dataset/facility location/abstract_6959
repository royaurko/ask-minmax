AX J1745.6-2901 and GRS 1741-2853 are two transient neutron star low-mass
X-ray binaries that are located within ~10' from the Galactic center.
Multi-year monitoring observations with the Swift/XRT has exposed several
accretion outbursts from these objects. We report on their updated X-ray light
curves and renewed activity that occurred in 2010-2013.
