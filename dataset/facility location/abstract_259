This paper describes the construction and operational status of an
accelerator test facility for Project X. The purpose of this facility is for
Project X component development activities that benefit from beam tests and any
development activities that require 325 MHz or 650 MHz RF power. It presently
includes an H- beam line, a 325 MHz superconducting cavity test facility, a 325
MHz (pulsed) RF power source, and a 650 MHz (CW) RF power source. The paper
also discusses some specific Project X components that will be tested in the
facility.
