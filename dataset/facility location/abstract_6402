We present a method to search for gravitational waves from coalescing
supermassive binary black holes in LISA data. The search utilizes the
$\mathcal{F}$-statistic to maximize over, and determine the values of, the
extrinsic parameters of the binary system. The intrinsic parameters are
searched over hierarchically using stochastically generated multi-dimensional
template banks to recover the masses and sky locations of the binary. We
present the results of this method applied to the mock LISA data Challenge 1B
data set.
