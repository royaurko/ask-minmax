The LUNA (Laboratory Underground for Nuclear Astrophysics) facility has been
designed to study nuclear reactions of astrophysical interest. It is located
deep underground in the Gran Sasso National Laboratory, Italy. Two
electrostatic accelerators, with 50 and 400 kV maximum voltage, in combination
with solid and gas target setups allowed to measure the total cross sections of
the radiative capture reactions $^2$H(p,$\gamma$)3He and
$^{14}$N(p,$\gamma$)$^{15}$O within their relevant Gamow peaks. We report on
the gamma background in the Gran Sasso laboratory measured by germanium and
bismuth germanate detectors, with and without an incident proton beam. A method
to localize the sources of beam induced background using the Doppler shift of
emitted gamma rays is presented. The feasibility of radiative capture studies
at energies of astrophysical interest is discussed for several experimental
scenarios.
