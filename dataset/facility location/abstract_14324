We propose a Calculus of Mobility and Communication (CMC) for the modelling
of mobility, communication and context-awareness in the setting of ubiquitous
computing. CMC is an ambient calculus with the in and out capabilities of
Cardelli and Gordon's Mobile Ambients. The calculus has a new form of global
communication similar to that in Milner's CCS. In CMC an ambient is tagged with
a set of ports that agents executing inside the ambient are allowed to
communicate on. It also has a new context-awareness feature that allows
ambients to query their location. We present reduction semantics and labelled
transition system semantics of CMC and prove that the semantics coincide. A new
notion of behavioural equivalence is given by defining capability barbed
bisimulation and congruence which is proved to coincide with barbed
bisimulation congruence. The expressiveness of the calculus is illustrated by
two case studies.
