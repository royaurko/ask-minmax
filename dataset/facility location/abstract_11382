We use the AdS/CFT correspondence to show that the heavy quark (static)
potential in a strongly-coupled plasma develops an imaginary part at finite
temperature. Thus, deeply bound heavy quarkonia states acquire a small nonzero
thermal width when the t'Hooft coupling $\lambda=g^2 N_c \gg 1$ and the number
of colors $N_c \to \infty$. In the dual gravity description, this imaginary
contribution comes from thermal fluctuations around the bottom of the classical
sagging string in the bulk that connects the heavy quarks located at the
boundary. We predict a strong suppression of $\Upsilon$'s in heavy-ion
collisions and discuss how this may be used to estimate the initial
temperature.
