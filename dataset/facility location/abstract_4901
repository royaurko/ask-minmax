We investigate a magnetic impurity in Bernal stacked bilayer graphene by a
non-perturbative numerical exact approach. In the two cases we study, impurity
is placed on the top of two different sublattices (A and B) in bilayer
graphene. We find that similar to the monolayer case, magnet moment of the
impurity could still be tuned in a wide range through changing the chemical
potential. However, the property of the impurity depends strongly on its
location due to the broken symmetry between sublattices A and B caused by the
Bernal stacking. This difference becomes more apparent with the increase in the
hybridization and decrease in the on-site Coulomb repulsion. Additionally, we
calculate the impurity spectral densities and the correlation functions between
the impurity and the conduction-band electrons. All the computational results
show the same spatial dependence on the location of the impurity.
