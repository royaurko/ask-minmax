A pulsar wind nebula inside a supernova remnant provides a unique insight
into the properties of the central neutron star, the relativistic wind powered
by its loss of rotational energy, its progenitor supernova, and the surrounding
environment. In this paper, we present a new semi-analytic model for the
evolution of such a pulsar wind nebula which couples the dynamical and
radiative evolution of the pulsar wind nebulae, traces the evolution of the
pulsar wind nebulae throughout the lifetime of the supernova remnant produced
by the progenitor explosion, and predicts both the dynamical and radiative
properties of the pulsar wind nebula during this period. We also discuss the
expected evolution for a particular set of these parameters, and show it
reproduces many puzzling features of known young and old pulsar wind nebulae.
The model also predicts spectral features during different phases of its
evolution detectable with new radio and gamma-ray observing facilities.
Finally, this model has implications for determining if pulsar wind nebulae can
explain the recent measurements of the cosmic ray positron fraction by PAMELA
and the cosmic ray lepton spectrum by ATIC and HESS.
