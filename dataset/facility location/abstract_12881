An adaptive method of controlling parametric instabilities in laser produced
plasmas is proposed. It involves fast temporal modulation of a laser pulse on
the fastest instability's amplification time scale, adapting to changing and
unknown plasma conditions. These pulses are comprised of on and off sequences
having at least one or two orders of magnitude contrast between them. Such
laser illumination profiles are called STUD pulses for Spike Trains of Uneven
Duration and Delay. The STUD pulse program includes scrambling the speckle
patterns spatially in between the laser spikes. The off times allow damping of
driven waves. The scrambling of the hot spots allows tens of damping times to
elapse before hot spot locations experience recurring high intensity spikes.
Damping in the meantime will have healed the scars of past growth. Another
unique feature of STUD pulses on crossing beams is that their temporal profiles
can be interlaced or staggered, and their interactions thus controlled with an
on-off switch and a dimmer.
