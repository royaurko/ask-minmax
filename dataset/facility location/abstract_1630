This paper summarizes the contributions to the experimental sessions on
polarized lepton nucleon scattering at the DIS 99 workshop. Results are
reported about the flavor decomposition of the quark polarization, a first
direct measurement of a positive gluon polarization, the observation of a
double-spin asymmetry in diffractive rho production, the polarization of lambda
hyperons, the observation of transverse single-spin asymmetries and the
measurement of the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule. Prospects of future fixed
target and collider facilities are discussed.
