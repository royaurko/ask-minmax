In this work, we present detailed simulations for propagation of ultra-high
energy (UHE) heavy nuclei, with E > 60 EeV, within recent Galactic Magnetic
Field (GMF) models. We investigate the impacts of the regular and turbulent
components of the GMF. We show that with UHE heavy nuclei, there is no
one-to-one correspondence between the arrival directions of cosmic rays (CR)
measured at Earth and the direction of their extragalactic sources. Sources can
have several distorted images on the sky. We compute images of galaxy clusters
and of the supergalactic plane in recent GMF models and show the challenges,
and possibilities, of "UHECR astronomy" with heavy nuclei. Finally, we present
a quantitative study of the impact of the GMF on the (de-)magnification of
source fluxes, due to magnetic lensing effects. We find that for 60 EeV iron
nuclei, sources located in up to about one fifth of the sky would have their
fluxes so strongly demagnified that they would not be detectable at Earth, even
by the next generation of UHECR experiments.
