The two-Equation of State (EoS) model is used to describe the hadron-quark
phase transition in asymmetric matter formed at high density in heavy-ion
collisions. For the quark phase, the three-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL)
effective theory is used to investigate the influence of dynamical quark mass
effects on the phase transition. At variance to the MIT-Bag results, with fixed
current quark masses, the main important effect of the chiral dynamics is the
appearance of an End-Point for the coexistence zone. We show that a first order
hadron-quark phase transition may take place in the region T=(50-80)MeV and
\rho_B=(2-4)\rho_0, which is possible to be probed in the new planned
facilities, such as FAIR at GSI-Darmstadt and NICA at JINR-Dubna. From isospin
properties of the mixed phase somepossible signals are suggested. The
importance of chiral symmetry and dynamical quark mass on the hadron-quark
phase transition is stressed. The difficulty of an exact location of
Critical-End-Point comes from its appearance in a region of competition between
chiral symmetry breaking and confinement, where our knowledge of effective QCD
theories is still rather uncertain.
