Tremendous growth in the demand for wireless applications such as streaming
audio/videos, Skype and video games require high data rate irrespective of
user's location in the cellular network. However, the Quality of Service (QoS)
of users degrades at the cell boundary. Relay enhanced multi-hop cellular
network is one of the cost effective solution to improve the performance of
cell edge users. Optimal deployment of Fixed Relay Nodes (FRNs) is essential to
satisfy the QoS requirement of edge users. We propose new schemes for channel
partitioning and FRN placement in cellular networks. Path-loss, Signal to
Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) experienced by users, and effects of
shadowing have been considered. The analysis gives more emphasis on the
cell-edge users (worst case scenario). The results show that these schemes
achieve higher system performance in terms of spectral efficiency and also
increase the user data rate at the cell edge.
