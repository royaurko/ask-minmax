The power spectrum of heavy ion collisions is investigated by studying
initial state fluctuations on top of a smooth hydrodynamic flow. In particular,
the stability of the location of the first minimum of the power spectrum and
the dependence of the hydrodynamic response v_n / epsilon_n on n and on eta / s
are discussed. In our study we develop a new Green's function method for the
analytic hydrodynamic flow by S. Gubser and make use of a fully non-linear
hydrodynamics code. We find that there will be no well-defined first minimum of
the response for n < 10, due to the fact that all minima in that region are
found to be sensitive to the location of the initial perturbations. Also, we
find that the often proposed form of the hydrodynamical response, that ln ( v_n
/ epsilon_n ) depend quadratically on n and linearly on eta / s, should not
hold once many events have been averaged over.
