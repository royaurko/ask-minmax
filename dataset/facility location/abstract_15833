Purpose of this work is the development of an automatic system which could be
useful for radiologists in the investigation of breast cancer. A breast
neoplasia is often marked by the presence of microcalcifications and massive
lesions in the mammogram: hence the need for tools able to recognize such
lesions at an early stage. GPCALMA (Grid Platform Computer Assisted Library for
MAmmography), a collaboration among italian physicists and radiologists, has
built a large distributed database of digitized mammographic images (at this
moment about 5500 images corresponding to 1650 patients). This collaboration
has developed a CAD (Computer Aided Detection) system which, installed in an
integrated station, can also be used for digitization, as archive and to
perform statistical analysis. With a GRID configuration it would be possible
for the clinicians tele- and co-working in new and innovative groupings
('virtual organisations') and, using the whole database, by the GPCALMA tools
several analysis can be performed. Furthermore the GPCALMA system allows to be
abreast of the CAD technical progressing into several hospital locations always
with remote working by GRID connection. We report in this work the results
obtained by the GPCALMA CAD software implemented with a GRID connection.
