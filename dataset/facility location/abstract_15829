In the course of exploring some aspects of atom guiding in a hollow, optical
fiber, a small negative potential energy well was found just in front of the
repulsive or guiding barrier. This results from the optical dipole and the van
der Waals potentials. The ground state for atoms bound in this negative
potential well was determined by numerically solving the Schrodinger eq. and it
was found that this negative well could serve as an atom trap. This trap is
referred to as the Annular Shell Atom Trap or ASAT because of the geometry of
the trapped atoms which are located in the locus of points defining a very thin
annular shell just in front of the guiding barrier. A unique feature of the
ASAT is the compression of the atoms from the entire volume to the volume of
the annular shell resulting in a very high density of atoms in this trap. This
trap may have applications to very low temperatures using evaporative cooling
and possibly the formation of BEC. Finally, a scheme is discussed for taking
advantage of the de Broglie wavelength to store atoms in a bottle trap based on
the inability of long de Broglie wavelengths to escape through a selective de
Broglie wavelength filter in the atom bottle trap.
