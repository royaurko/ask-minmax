The SPIREX telescope, located at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, was a
prototype system developed to exploit the excellent conditions for IR observing
at the South Pole. Observations over two winter seasons achieved remarkably
deep, high-resolution, wide-field images in the 3-5um wavelength regime.
Several star forming complexes were observed, including NGC 6334, Chamaeleon I,
eta Chamaeleontis, the Carina Nebula, 30 Doradus, RCW 57, RCW 38, as well as
the Galactic Centre. Images were obtained of lines at 2.42um H2, 3.29um PAH and
4.05um Bra, as well as 3.5um L-band and 4.7um M-band continuum emission. These
data, combined with near-IR, mid-IR, and radio continuum maps, reveal the
environments of these star forming sites, as well as any protostars lying
within them. The SPIREX project, its observing and reduction methods, and some
sample data are summarized here.
