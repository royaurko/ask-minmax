The large numbers of sick children in different diseases are very dreaded,
and when there isn't succor at the proper time and in the type the sick child
need it that makes us lose child. This paper suggested an emergency system for
succoring sick child locally when he required that, and there isn't someone
knows his disease. The proposed system is the first tracking system works
online (24 hour in the day) but only when the sick children requiring the help
using mobile GIS. In, this emergency system the child will send SMS (for easy
he click one button) contains his ID and coordinates (Longitude and Latitude)
via GPRS network to the web server (the child was registered previously on that
server), in this step the server will locate the sick child on Google map and
retrieve the child's information from the database which saved this information
in registration stage, and base on these information will send succoring
facility and at the same time informing the hospital, his parents, doctor, etc.
about that emergency case of the child using the SMS mode through GPRS network
again. The design and implement of the proposed system shows more effective
cost than other systems because it used a minimum configuration (hardware and
software) and works in economic mode.
