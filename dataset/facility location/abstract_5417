A precision measurement of the differential cross sections $d\sigma/d\Omega$
and the linearly polarized photon asymmetry $\Sigma \equiv (d\sigma_\perp -
d\sigma_\parallel) \slash (d\sigma_\perp + d\sigma_\parallel)$ for the
$\vec{\gamma} p \rightarrow \pi^0p$ reaction in the near-threshold region has
been performed with a tagged photon beam and almost $4\pi$ detector at the
Mainz Microtron. The Glasgow-Mainz photon tagging facility along with the
Crystal Ball/TAPS multi-photon detector system and a cryogenic liquid hydrogen
target were used. These data allowed for a precise determination of the energy
dependence of the real parts of the $S$- and all three $P$-wave amplitudes for
the first time and provide the most stringent test to date of the predictions
of Chiral Perturbation Theory and its energy region of agreement with
experiment.
