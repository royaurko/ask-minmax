Nowadays, the Web has become one of the most widespread platforms for
information change and retrieval. As it becomes easier to publish documents, as
the number of users, and thus publishers, increases and as the number of
documents grows, searching for information is turning into a cumbersome and
time-consuming operation. Because of the loose interconnection between
documents, people have difficulty remembering where they have been and
returning to previously visited pages. Navigation through the web faces
problems of locating oneself with respect to space and time. The idea of
graphical assistance navigation is to help users to find their paths in
hyperspace by adapting the style of link presentation to the goals, knowledge
and other characteristics of an individual user. We first introduce the
concepts related to web navigation; we then present an overview of different
graphical navigation tools and techniques. We conclude by presenting a
comparative table of these tools based on some pertinent criteria.
