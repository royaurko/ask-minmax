Presented simple extensions to scala language related to import statements:
exported imports, which provide ability to reuse sequence of import clauses in
composable form and default rewriters, which provide mechanism for pluggable
macro-based AST transformation of overall compilation unit, activated by import
of library object. Using these facilities not only allows more compact code, it
prevents application programmer from producing certain type of errors too and
allows to implement local language extension as libraries on top of standard
compiler. Part of discussed extensions is submitted to scala language committee
as pre-sip \cite{ai-presip} and can be used as first step for refining imports
semantics in the future version of scala language.
