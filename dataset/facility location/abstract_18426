We present a multi-wavelength study of the star forming region ISOSS J
20298+3559, which was identified by a cross-correlation of cold compact sources
from the 170 micron ISOPHOT Serendipity Survey (ISOSS) database coinciding with
objects detected by the MSX, 2MASS and IRAS infrared surveys. ISOSS J
20298+3559 is associated with a massive dark cloud complex (M ~ 760
M$_{\odot}$) and located in the Cygnus X giant molecular cloud. We derive a
distance of 1800 pc on the basis of optical extinction data. The low average
dust temperature (T ~ 16 K) and large mass (M ~ 120 M$_{\odot}$) of the dense
inner part of the cloud, which has not been dispersed, indicates a recent begin
of star formation. The youth of the region is supported by the early
evolutionary stage of several pre- and protostellar objects discovered across
the regio n: I) Two candidate Class 0 objects with masses of 8 and 3.5
M$_{\odot}$, II) a gravitationally bound, cold (T ~ 12 K) and dense (n(H$_{2}$)
\~ 2 x 10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) cloud core with a mass of 50 M$_{\odot}$ and III) a
Herbig B2 star with a mass of 6.5 M$_{\odot}$ and a bolometric luminosity of
2200 L$_{\odot}$, showing evidence for ongoing accretion and a stellar age of
less than 40000 years. The dereddened SED of the Herbig star is well reproduced
by an accretion disc + star model. The externally heated cold cloud core is a
good candidate for a massive pre-protostellar object. The star formation
efficiency in the central cloud region is about 14 %.
