We calculate the branching ratios of the lightest pseudoscalar glueball with
a mass of 2.6 GeV predicted by lattice QCD by using a chiral Lagrangian. This
study is relevant in view of the planned PANDA experiment at the upcoming FAIR
facility, which will measure the energy range in which the pseudoscalar
glueball is predicted to exist.
