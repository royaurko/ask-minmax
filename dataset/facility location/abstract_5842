We study the charged excitations of a double layer at filling factor 2 in the
ferromagnetic regime. In a wide range of Zeeman and tunneling splittings we
find that the low energy charged excitations are spin-isospin textures with the
charge mostly located in one of the layers. As tunneling increases, the parent
spin texture in one layer becomes larger and it induces, in the other layer, a
shadow spin texture antiferromagnetically coupled to the parent texture. These
new quasiparticles should be observable by measuring the strong dependence of
its spin on tunneling and Zeeman couplings.
