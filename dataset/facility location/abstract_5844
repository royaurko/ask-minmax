In this paper we report results from a systematic strong-coupling expansion
of the Bose-Hubbard model in one and two spatial dimensions. We obtain
numerically exact results for the structure factor and the spectrum of single
particle and single hole excitations in the Mott insulator. This enables the
determination of the zero-temperature phase diagram and the location of the
critical endpoints of the Mott lobes. In one dimension we confirm the
occurrence of reentrance behavior from the compressible to the insulating phase
in a region close to the critical point.
