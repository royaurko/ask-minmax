We complete the analysis of the band functions for two-dimensional magnetic
Schr\"odinger operators with piecewise constant magnetic ?elds. The
discontinuity of the magnetic field can create edge currents that ow along the
discontinuity that have been described by physicists. Properties of these edge
currents are directly related to the behavior of the band functions. The
e?ective potential of the fiber operator is an asymmetric double well
(eventually degenerated) and the analysis of the splitting of the bands
incorporates the asymmetry. If the magnetic field vanishes, the reduced
operator has essential spectrum and we provide an explicit description of the
band functions located below the essential spectrum. For non degenerate
magnetic steps, we provide an asymptotic expansion of the band functions at
infinity. We prove that when the ratio of the two magnetic fields is rational,
a splitting of the band functions occurs and has a natural order, predicted by
numerical computations.
