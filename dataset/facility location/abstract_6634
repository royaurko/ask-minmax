We study the probability of two Brownian particles to meet before one of them
exits a finite interval. We obtain an explicit expression for the probability
as a function of the initial distance of the two particles using the
Weierstrass elliptic function. We also find the law of the meeting location.
Brownian simulations show the accuracy of our analysis. Finally, we discuss
some applications to the probability that a double strand DNA break repairs in
confined environments.
