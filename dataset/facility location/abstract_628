Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is the most significant neutron
technique in terms of impact on science and engineering. However, the basic
concept of SANS facilities has not changed since the technique's inception
about 40 years ago, as all SANS instruments, save a few, are still designed as
pinhole cameras. Here we demonstrate a novel concept for a SANS instrument,
based on axisymmetric focusing mirrors. We build and test a small prototype,
which shows a performance comparable to that of conventional large SANS
facilities. By using a detector with 50-micron pixels, we build the most
compact SANS instrument in the world. This work, together with the recent
demonstration that such mirrors could increase the signal rate at least
50-fold, while improving resolution, paves the way to novel SANS instruments,
thus affecting a broad community of scientists and engineers.
