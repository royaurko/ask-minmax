[111] ordered common atom strained layer superlattices (in particular the
common anion GaSb/InSb system and the common cation InAs/InSb system) are
investigated using the ab initio full potential linearized augmented plane wave
(FLAPW) method. We have focused our attention on the potential line-up at the
two sides of the homopolar isovalent heterojunctions considered, and in
particular on its dependence on the strain conditions and on the strain induced
electric fields. We propose a procedure to locate the interface plane where the
band alignment could be evaluated; furthermore, we suggest that the
polarization charges, due to piezoelectric effects, are approximately confined
to a narrow region close to the interface and do not affect the potential
discontinuity. We find that the interface contribution to the valence band
offset is substantially unaffected by strain conditions, whereas the total band
line-up is highly tunable, as a function of the strain conditions. Finally, we
compare our results with those obtained for [001] heterojunctions.
