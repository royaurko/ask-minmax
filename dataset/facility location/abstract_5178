The close active binary HR 5110 was observed at six epochs over 26 days using
a global VLBI array at 15.4~GHz. We used phase-referencing to determine the
position of the radio centroid at each epoch with an uncertainty significantly
smaller than the component separation. After correcting for proper motion and
parallax, we find that the centroid locations of all six epochs have barycenter
separations consistent with an emission source located on the KIV secondary,
and not in an interaction region between the stars or on the F primary. We used
a homogeneous power-law gyrosynchrotron emission model to reproduce the
observed flux densities and fractional circular polarization. The resulting
ranges of mean magnetic field strength and relativistic electron densities are
of order 10 G and $10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ respectively in the source region.
