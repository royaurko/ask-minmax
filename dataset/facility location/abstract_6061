We propose a method to study lattice QCD at finite temperature and chemical
potential. We compare it with direct results and with the Glasgow method by
using n_f=4 QCD at Im(\mu)\neq 0. We locate the critical endpoint (E) of QCD on
the Re(\mu)-T plane. In this study we use n_f=2+1 dynamical staggered quarks
with semi-realistic masses on L_t=4 lattices.
