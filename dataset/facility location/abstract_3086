The quality of life of many people could be improved by autonomous humanoid
robots in the home. To function in the human world, a humanoid household robot
must be able to locate itself and perceive the environment like a human; scene
perception, object detection and segmentation, and object spatial localization
in 3D are fundamental capabilities for such humanoid robots. This paper
presents a 3D multi-class object detection and segmentation method. The
contributions are twofold. Firstly, we present a multi-class detection method,
where a minimal joint codebook is learned in a principled manner. Secondly, we
incorporate depth information using RGB-D imagery, which increases the
robustness of the method and gives the 3D location of objects -- necessary
since the robot reasons in 3D space. Experiments show that the multi-class
extension improves the detection efficiency with respect to the number of
classes and the depth extension improves the detection robustness and give
sufficient natural 3D location of the objects.
