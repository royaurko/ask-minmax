We estimate the accretion rates of 235 Classical T Tauri star (CTTS)
candidates in the Lagoon Nebula using $ugri$H$\alpha$ photometry from the
VPHAS+ survey. Our sample consists of stars displaying H$\alpha$-excess, the
intensity of which is used to derive accretion rates. For a subset of 87 stars,
the intensity of the $u$-band excess is also used to estimate accretion rates.
We find the mean variation in accretion rates measured using H$\alpha$ and
$u$-band intensities to be $\sim$ 0.17 dex, agreeing with previous estimates
(0.04-0.4 dex) but for a much larger sample. The spatial distribution of CTTS
align with the location of protostars and molecular gas suggesting that they
retain an imprint of the natal gas fragmentation process. Strong accretors are
concentrated spatially, while weak accretors are more distributed. Our results
do not support the sequential star forming processes suggested in the
literature.
