We show that the entropy of de Sitter space in any dimension can be
understood as the entropy of a highly excited string located near the horizon.
The string tension is renormalized to $T \sim \Lambda$ due to the large
gravitational redshift near the horizon. The de Sitter temperature is given by
the Hagedorn temperature of the string.
