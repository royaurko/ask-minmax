The problem of short-term forecast of real-time locational marginal price
(LMP) and network congestion is considered from a system operator perspective.
A new probabilistic forecast technique is proposed based on a multiparametric
programming formulation that partitions the uncertainty parameter space into
critical regions from which the conditional probability distribution of the
real-time LMP/congestion is obtained. The proposed method incorporates
load/generation forecast, time varying operation constraints, and probabilistic
contingency models. By shifting the computation cost associated with
multiparametric program offline, the online computation cost is significantly
reduced.
