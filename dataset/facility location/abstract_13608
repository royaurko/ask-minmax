The spin-orbit interaction in heavy hole gas formed at $p$-doped
semiconductor heterojunctions and electron gas at {\mbox SrTiO}${}_3$ surfaces
is cubic in momentum. Here we report magnetotransport properties of k-cubic
Rashba spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional fermionic systems. We study
longitudinal (Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations) and Hall component of the
resistivity tensor analytically as well as numerically. The longitudinal
resistivity shows beating pattern due to different SdH oscillation frequencies
$ f_{\pm} $ for spin-up and spin-down fermions. We propose empirical forms of $
f_{\pm} $ as exact expressions are not available, which are being used to find
location of the beating nodes. The beating nodes and the number of oscillations
between any two successive nodes obtained from exact numerical results are in
excellent agreement with those calculated from the proposed empirical form. In
the Hall resistivity, an additional Hall plateau appears in between two
conventional ones as spin-orbit coupling constant increases. The width of this
additional plateau increases with spin-orbit coupling constant.
