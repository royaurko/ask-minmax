MINOS is a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment designed to make
precision measurements of the neutrino mixing parameters associated with the
atmospheric neutrino mass splitting. Using a neutrino beam from the Main
Injector (NuMI) facility at Fermilab, it compares the neutrino energy spectrum
for neutrino interactions observed in two large detectors located at Fermilab
and in the Soudan mine in northern Minnesota at a distance of 735km. We
describe initial results for electron neutrino appearance in MINOS after two
years of data-taking. We observe 35 events in the Far Detector with a
background prediction of $27\pm 5 {\rm (stat.)} \pm 2 {\rm (syst.)$ based on
the measurement in the Near Detector. The 1.5$\sigma$ excess of events can be
interpreted in terms of $\nu_{\mu}$ to $\nu_{e}$ oscillations. At 90% CL we
obtain an upper limit range of $\sin^2(2\theta_{13})< 0.28-0.34$ for the normal
neutrino mass hierarchy and $\sin^2(2\theta_{13})< 0.36-0.42$ for the inverted
hierarchy depending upon $\delta_{CP}$.
