We present high-resolution VLT spectra of a new helium-rich DO white dwarf
and a new PG1159 star, which we identified in the ESO SPY survey. We performed
NLTE model atmosphere analyses and found that the PG1159 star is a low-gravity,
extremely hot (Teff=160,000K, logg=6) star, having a carbon-helium dominated
atmosphere with considerable amounts of oxygen and neon (He=38%, C=54%, O=6%,
Ne=2% by mass). It is located within the planetary nebula nuclei instability
strip, hence, future searches for an associated PN as well as for stellar
pulsations might be successful. The DO white dwarf is a unique object. From the
relative strength of neutral and ionized helium lines we found Teff approx.
60,000K, however, the HeII lines are extraordinarily strong and cannot be
fitted by any model. Similar problems were encountered with hot subdwarfs and
white dwarfs showing signatures of a super-hot wind. The reason is unknown.
