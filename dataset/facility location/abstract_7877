AMiBA is the largest hexapod astronomical telescope in current operation. We
present a description of this novel hexapod mount with its main mechanical
components -- the support cone, universal joints, jack screws, and platform --
and outline the control system with the pointing model and the operating modes
that are supported. The AMiBA hexapod mount performance is verified based on
optical pointing tests and platform photogrammetry measurements. The
photogrammetry results show that the deformations in the inner part of the
platform are less than 120 micron rms. This is negligible for optical pointing
corrections, radio alignment and radio phase errors for the currently
operational 7-element compact configuration. The optical pointing error in
azimuth and elevation is successively reduced by a series of corrections to
about 0.4 arcmin rms which meets our goal for the 7-element target
specifications.
