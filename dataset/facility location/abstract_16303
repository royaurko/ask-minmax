We present a catalogue of 17 filamentary X-ray features located within a
68\times34 arcmin^2 view centred on the Galactic Centre region from images
taken by Chandra. These features are described by their morphological and
spectral properties. Many of the X-ray features have non-thermal spectra that
are well fitted by an absorbed power law. Of the 17 features, we find six that
have not been previously detected, four of which are outside the immediate
20\times20 arcmin^2 area centred on the Galactic Centre. Seven of the 17
identified filaments have morphological and spectral properties expected for
pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) with X-ray luminosities of 5\times10^32 to 10^34 erg
s^-1 in the 2.0-10.0 keV band and photon indices in the range of \Gamma = 1.1
to 1.9. In one feature, we suggest the strong neutral Fe K\alpha emission line
to be a possible indicator for past activity of Sgr A*. For G359.942-0.03, a
particular filament of interest, we propose the model of a ram pressure
confined stellar wind bubble from a massive star to account for the morphology,
spectral shape and 6.7 keV He-like Fe emission detected. We also present a
piecewise spectral analysis on two features of interest, G0.13-0.11 and
G359.89-0.08, to further examine their physical interpretations. This analysis
favours the PWN scenario for these features.
