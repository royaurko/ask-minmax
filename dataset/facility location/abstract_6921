We describe a geometrical way to unify gravity with the other natural forces
by adding fermionic Lorentz scalar variables, characterising attribute, or
property, to space-time location. [With five such properties one can
accommodate all known leptons and quarks.] Using just one property, viz.
electricity, the general relativity of such a scheme and its superscalar
curvature automatically produces the Einstein-Maxwell Lagrangian and a
cosmological term. By adding more properties we envisage the geometrical
unification of the standard model with gravitation.
