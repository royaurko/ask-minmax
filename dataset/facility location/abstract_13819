In this paper we discuss the collisionless transport equations, continuity,
momentum and energy conservation, derived from a kinetic exospheric model of
the solar wind based on a kappa velocity distribution function of the
electrons. The model is stationary and is based on a non-monotonic potential
energy for the protons. The present study is carried out for an exobase located
at 1.5 solar radii and for two different values of the kappa index. The maximum
radial distance considered is equal to one astronomical unit. The moments of
the velocity distribution function computed with the kinetic exospheric model
for both electrons and protons are introduced into the mass continuity
equation, momentum conservation equation and energy conservation equation. The
relative importance of various terms in the macroscopic transport equations for
each component species are analyzed and discussed. The results obtained show
that the kinetic description based on kappa velocity distribution functions
satisfies rigorously the transport equations that give a macroscopic
description of the solar wind plasma.
