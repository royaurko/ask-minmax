In many cases, government data is still "locked" in several "data silos",
even within the boundaries of a single (inter-)national public organization
with disparate and distributed organizational units and departments spread
across multiple sites. Opening data and enabling its unified querying from a
single site in an efficient and effective way is a semantic application
integration and open government data challenge. This paper describes how NARA
is using Semantic Web technology to implement an application integration
approach within the boundaries of its organization via opening and querying
multiple governmental data sources from a single site. The generic approach
proposed, namely S3-AI, provides support to answering unified,
ontology-mediated, federated queries to data produced and exploited by
disparate applications, while these are being located in different
organizational sites. S3-AI preserves ownership, autonomy and independency of
applications and data. The paper extensively demonstrates S3-AI, using the D2RQ
and Fuseki technologies, for addressing the needs of a governmental "IT
helpdesk support" case.
