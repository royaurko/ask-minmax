Coherent photoproduction of eta mesons from the deuteron has been measured
from threshold up to incident photon energies of 750 MeV using the photon
spectrometer TAPS at the tagged photon facility at the Mainz microtron MAMI.
For the first time, differential coherent cross sections have been deduced from
the coincident detection of the eta meson and the recoil deuteron. A missing
energy analysis was used for the suppression of background events so that a
very clean identification of coherent eta-photoproduction was achieved. The
resulting cross sections agree with previous experimental results except for
angles around 90 deg in the photon-deuteron cm-system where they are smaller.
They are compared to various model calculations.
