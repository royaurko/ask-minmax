Frequency-selective readout for superconducting qubits opens the way towards
scaling qubit circuits up without increasing the number of measurement lines.
Here we demonstrate the readout of an array of 7 flux qubits located on the
same chip. Each qubit is placed near an individual lambda/4 resonator which, in
turn, is coupled to a common microwave transmission line. We performed
spectroscopy of all qubits and determined their parameters in a single
measurement run.
