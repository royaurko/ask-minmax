We present a comparative numerical study of the ordered and the random
two-dimensional sine-Gordon models on a lattice. We analytically compute the
main features of the expected high temperature phase of both models, described
by the Edwards-Wilkinson equation. We then use those results to locate the
transition temperatures of both models in our Langevin dynamics simulations. We
show that our results reconcile previous contradictory numerical works
concerning the superroughening transition in the random sine-Gordon model. We
also find evidence supporting the existence of two different low temperature
phases for the disordered model. We discuss our results in view of the
different analytical predictions available and comment on the nature of these
two putative phases.
