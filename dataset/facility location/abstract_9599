A set of MapleV R.4/5 software routines for calculating the numerical
evolution of dynamical systems and flexibly plotting the results is presented.
The package consists of an initial condition generator (on which the user can
impose quite general constraints), a numerical solving manager, plotting
commands that allow the user to locate and focus in on regions of possible
interest and, finally, a set of routines that calculate the fractal dimension
of the boundaries of those regions. A special feature of the software routines
presented here is an optional interface in C, permitting fast numerical
integration using standard Runge-Kutta methods, or variations, for high
precision numerical integration
