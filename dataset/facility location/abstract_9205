Matter accreting onto black holes has long been known to have standing or
oscillating shock waves. The post-shock matter puffs up in the form of a torus,
which intercepts soft photons from the outer Keplerian disc and inverse
Comptonizes to produce hard photons. The post-shock region also produces jets.
We study the interaction of both hard photons and soft photons, with on-axis
electron-positron jets. We show that the radiation from post-shock torus
accelerates the flow to relativistic velocities, while that from the Keplerian
disc has marginal effect. We also show that, the velocity at infinity or
terminal velocity ${\vartheta}$, depends on the shock location in the disc.
