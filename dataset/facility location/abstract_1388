Accurate location information is essential for many wireless sensor network
(WSN) applications. A location-aware WSN generally includes two types of nodes:
sensors whose locations to be determined and anchors whose locations are known
a priori. For range-based localization, sensors' locations are deduced from
anchor-to-sensor and sensor-to-sensor range measurements. Localization accuracy
depends on the network parameters such as network connectivity and size. This
paper provides a generalized theory that quantitatively characterizes such
relation between network parameters and localization accuracy. We use the
average degree as a connectivity metric and use geometric dilution of precision
(DOP), equivalent to the Cramer-Rao bound, to quantify localization accuracy.
We prove a novel lower bound on expectation of average geometric DOP
(LB-E-AGDOP) and derives a closed-form formula that relates LB-E-AGDOP to only
three parameters: average anchor degree, average sensor degree, and number of
sensor nodes. The formula shows that localization accuracy is approximately
inversely proportional to the average degree, and a higher ratio of average
anchor degree to average sensor degree yields better localization accuracy.
Furthermore, the paper demonstrates a strong connection between LB-E-AGDOP and
the best achievable accuracy. Finally, we validate the theory via numerical
simulations with three different random graph models.
