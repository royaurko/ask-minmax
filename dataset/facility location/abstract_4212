Neutrino interaction rates for experiments placed off axis in the NuMI beam
are calculated. Primary proton beam energy is 120 GeV and four locations at 810
km from target and 6, 12, 30 and 40 km off axis are considered. This report is
part of the Joint FNAL/BNL Future Long Baseline Neutrino Oscillation Experiment
Study.
