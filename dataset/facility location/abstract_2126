In this work we present the results of a theoretical analysis of the data on
photoproduction of $f_0(980)$ meson in the laboratory photon energy between 3.0
and 3.8 GeV. A comparison is done to the measurements performed by the CLAS
collaboration at JLab accelerator for the exclusive reaction $\gamma
p\rightarrow pf_0(980)$. In the analysis the partial S-wave differential cross
section is described by a model based on Regge approach with reggeized
exchanges and distinct scenarios for the $f_0(980)\rightarrow V\gamma$ coupling
are considered. It is shown that such a process can provide information on the
resonance structure and production mechanism.
