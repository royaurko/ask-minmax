Context. V838 Mon is an eruptive variable, which exploded in 2002. It
displayed the most spectacular light echo ever observed. However, neither the
origin of the reflecting matter nor the nature of the 2002 outburst have been
firmly constrained. Aims. We investigate the nature of the CO radio emission
detected in the field of the light echo. In particular, we explore its
connection to the echoing dust around V838 Mon. Methods. We observed the echo
region in multiple CO rotational transitions. We present and analyse maps of
the region obtained in the 12CO(1-0) and (3-2) lines. In addition, deep spectra
at several positions were acquired in 12CO(1-0), (2-1), (3-2), and 13CO(1-0),
(2-1). Radiative transfer modelling of line intensities is performed for chosen
positions to constrain the kinetic temperatures and densities. We derive global
parameters (e.g. mass, distance, total column density) of the emitting cloud.
Results. We found that a compact molecular cloud is located within the echo
region. The molecular emission is physically connected to the dusty environment
seen in the optical echo and they both belong to the same translucent cloud.
The interstellar nature of the cloud is confirmed by its high mass of 90-150
Msun. We propose that the cloud consists of material remaining after the
formation of the cluster to which V838 Mon belongs. This indicates that the
eruptive star has young age (3-10 Myr).
