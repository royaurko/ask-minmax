We have obtained FUSE and HST/STIS time-resolved spectroscopy of the polar AM
Herculis during a deep low state. The spectra are entirely dominated by the
emission of the white dwarf. Both the far-ultraviolet (FUV) flux as well as the
spectral shape vary substantially over the orbital period, with maximum flux
occurring at the same phase as during the high state. The variations are due to
the presence of a hot spot on the white dwarf, which we model quantitatively.
The white dwarf parameters can be determined from a spectral fit to the faint
phase data, when the hot spot is self-eclipsed. Adopting the distance of
79+8-6pc determined by Thorstensen, we find an effective temperature of
19800+-700K and a mass of Mwd=0.78+0.12-0.17Msun. The hot spot has a lower
temperature than during the high state, ~34000-40000K, but covers a similar
area, ~10% of the white dwarf surface. Low state FUSE and STIS spectra taken
during four different epochs in 2002/3 show no variation of the FUV flux level
or spectral shape, implying that the white dwarf temperature and the hot spot
temperature, size, and location do not depend on the amount of time the system
has spent in the low state. Possible explanations are ongoing accretion at a
low level, or deep heating, both alternatives have some weaknesses that we
discuss. No photospheric metal absorption lines are detected in the FUSE and
STIS spectra, suggesting that the average metal abundances in the white dwarf
atmosphere are lower than 1e-3 times their solar values.
