We present new theoretical calculations of the line profile of Lyman gamma
that include transitions in which a photon is absorbed by a neutral hydrogen
atom while it interacts with a proton. Models show that two absorption features
located near 992 A and 996 A are due to H-H^+ collisions. These quasi-molecular
satellites are similar to those that were identified in the wings of Lyman
alpha and Lyman beta lines of hydrogen-rich white dwarfs. We compute synthetic
spectra that take account of these new theoretical profiles and compare them to
the spectra of four DA white dwarfs that were observed with FUSE. The models
predict the absorption features that are observed in the wing of Lyman gamma
near 995 A, and confirm that these features are quasi-molecular satellites.
