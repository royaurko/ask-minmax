We are conducting a survey of several regions of high-mass star formation to
assess their content and structure. The observations include Spitzer
observations, ground-based optical and near-IR imaging surveys, and optical and
IR spectra of objects and locations in the molecular clouds. The goal of the
survey is to gain a better understanding of the processes involved in high mass
star formation by determining the characteristics of the stars detected in
these regions and investigating the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM)
environment in which these stars form. In this contribution, we present results
on the identification and spatial analysis of young stars in three clusters,
W5/AFGL 4029, S255, and S235. First we show how the IRAC data are used to
roughly segregate young stars according to their mid-infrared colors, into two
groups corresponding the SED Class I and Class II young stellar objects. Then
using the IRAC data in combination with 2MASS, we show how more young stars can
be identified. Finally, we examine the spatial distributions of young stars in
these clusters and find a range of morphologies and of peak surface densities.
