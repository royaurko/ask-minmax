We consider the zero dissipation limit of the full compressible Navier-Stokes
equations with Riemann initial data in the case of superposition of two
rarefaction waves and a contact discontinuity. It is proved that for any
suitably small viscosity $\varepsilon$ and heat conductivity $\kappa$
satisfying the relation \eqref{viscosity}, there exists a unique global
piecewise smooth solution to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations.
Moreover, as the viscosity $\varepsilon$ tends to zero, the Navier-Stokes
solution converges uniformly to the Riemann solution of superposition of two
rarefaction waves and a contact discontinuity to the corresponding Euler
equations with the same Riemann initial data away from the initial line $t=0$
and the contact discontinuity located at $x=0$.
