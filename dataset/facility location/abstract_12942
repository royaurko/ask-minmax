We investigate the SU(3)-invariant sector of the one-parameter family of
SO(8) gauged maximal supergravity that has been recently proposed. To this end,
we construct the N=2 truncation of this theory and analyse its full vacuum
structure. The number of critical point is doubled and includes new N=0 and N=1
branches. We numerically exhibit the parameter dependence of the location and
cosmological constant of all extrema. Moreover, we provide their analytic
expressions for cases of special interest. Connections with three-dimensional
RG-flows are pointed out. Finally, while the mass spectra are found to be
parameter independent in most cases, we show that the novel non-supersymmetric
branch with SU(3) invariance provides the first counterexample to this.
