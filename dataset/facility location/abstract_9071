We present HST UV observations of the high-inclination low mass X-ray binary
AC211 (X2127+119), which is located in the globular cluster M15 (NGC 7078). We
have discovered a CIV P Cygni profile in this system, which confirms the
existence of an outflow from AC211. The outflow velocity as measured from the P
Cygni profile is 1500km/s. We calculate that the mass lost through this wind is
too small to support a large period derivative as favoured by Homer & Charles
(1998). Using new X-ray observations we have revised the ephemeris for AC211
and we find no evidence in support of a period derivative. The UV spectrum
exhibits several absorption features due to O, Si and C. The very strong HeII
line at 1640A is not seen to modulate strongly with orbital phase, suggesting
its origin lies in the outer parts of the system. In contrast, the eclipse of
the UV continuum is short compared with the X-ray and optical eclipses.
