In the context of the general consolidation of the CERN ISOLDE facility, a
project has been started to upgrade the ISOLDE control system. We describe the
new ISOLDE control system, emphasizing the systematic use of industrial
components such as PLCs and field buses, their integration with the existing,
VME based, CERN PS control system and their potential applicability to both
existing and new controls problems at the CERN PS complex. We also discuss how
to extend a PLC-based solution to the case where real-time response is an
issue.
