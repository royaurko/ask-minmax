Using high-resolution imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope, we study the
Large Magellanic Cloud HII region N160A and uncover several striking features
of this complex massive star-forming site. The two compact high excitation HII
blobs (HEBs) A1 and A2 are for the first time resolved and their stellar
content and morphology is revealed. A1, being of higher excitation, is powered
by a single massive star whose strong wind has created a surrounding bubble. A2
harbors several exciting stars enshrouded inside large quantities of dust. The
whole N160A nebula is energized by three star clusters for which we obtain
photometry and study their color-magnitude diagram. The HII region is
particularly dusty, with extinction values reaching an A_v~2.5 mag in the
visible, and it is separated from the molecular cloud by an outstanding
ionization front. A previously detected infrared young stellar object is also
accurately located with respect to the HII region.
