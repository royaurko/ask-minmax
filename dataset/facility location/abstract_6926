The diffraction of a plane wave by a magneto-optical cavity located on a
metal interface is investigated. We show that the excitation of localized
eigenmodes of the cavity allows one to efficiently excite the surface plasmon
polariton (SPP). We exploit the symmetry properties of the cavity modes to
propose a new method for controlling the SPP intensity through an external
magnetic field. Our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the
rigorous computations based on the generalized Lorentz reciprocity theorem and
aperiodic Fourier modal method.
