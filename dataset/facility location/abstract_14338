The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is the next-generation gamma-ray
observatory with sensitivity in the energy range from 20 GeV to beyond 300 TeV.
CTA is proposed to consist of two arrays of 40-100 imaging atmospheric
Cherenkov telescopes, with one site located in each of the Northern and
Southern Hemispheres. The evaluation process for the candidate sites for CTA is
supported by detailed Monte Carlo simulations, which take different attributes
like site altitude and geomagnetic field configuration into account. In this
contribution we present the comparison of the sensitivity and performance of
the different CTA site candidates for the measurement of very-high energy gamma
rays.
