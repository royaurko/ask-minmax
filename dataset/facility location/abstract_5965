In this paper we investigate a finite temperature generalization of survey
propagation, by applying it to the problem of finite temperature decoding of a
biased finite connectivity Sourlas code for temperatures lower than the
Nishimori temperature. We observe that the result is a shift of the location of
the dynamical critical channel noise to larger values than the corresponding
dynamical transition for belief propagation, as suggested recently by
Migliorini and Saad for LDPC codes. We show how the finite temperature 1-RSB SP
gives accurate results in the regime where competing approaches fail to
converge or fail to recover the retrieval state.
