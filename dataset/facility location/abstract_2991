We propose a new data structure to compute the Delaunay triangulation of a
set of points in the plane. It combines good worst case complexity, fast
behavior on real data, and small memory occupation.
  The location structure is organized into several levels. The lowest level
just consists of the triangulation, then each level contains the triangulation
of a small sample of the levels below. Point location is done by marching in a
triangulation to determine the nearest neighbor of the query at that level,
then the march restarts from that neighbor at the level below. Using a small
sample (3%) allows a small memory occupation; the march and the use of the
nearest neighbor to change levels quickly locate the query.
