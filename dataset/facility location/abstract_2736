A catalogue is presented with variable (RR Lyrae, semiregular and Mira) stars
located inside field #3 of the Palomar-Groningen Survey, at the outer edge of
the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. One of the semiregular variables is a carbon
star, comparable with those found by Azzopardi et al. (1991). Serendipity
provides the suggestion, that their carbon stars might not be located inside,
but behind the bulge in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
