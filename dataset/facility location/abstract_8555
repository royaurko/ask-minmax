A new magnetic cataclysmic variable is identified as the counterpart of the
X-ray source RX J0719.2+6557. The emission lines show radial velocity
variations with a period of 98.2 min. This coincides with the period of deep
eclipses (up to 4 mag) in the photometric light curve. The phase of the eclipse
relative to the spectroscopic phase, and its structure indicates that the
dominant source of emission is located on the stream of accreting matter, which
is eclipsed by the secondary companion. The emission lines bear evidence of a
weaker component, most probably the contribution from the heated side of the
secondary star. These features define this object as a probable polar in a high
state. NIR spectroscopy revealed some unusual, strong emission features at 8200
\AA and 8660 \AA possibly originating on the heated side of the secondary.
