I provide a pedagogical introduction to the notion of pseudomomentum for
waves in a medium, and show how changes in pseudomomentum may sometimes be used
to compute real forces. I then explain how these ideas apply to sound waves in
a fluid. When the background fluid is in motion, the conservation laws for
pseudomomentum and pseudoenergy are most easily obtained by exploiting the
acoustic metric and the formalism of general relativity.
