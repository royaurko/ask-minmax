The relaxation rates to the invariant density in the chaotic phase space
component of the kicked rotor (standard map) are calculated analytically for a
large stochasticity parameter, $K$. These rates are the logarithms of the poles
of the matrix elements of the resolvent, $ \hat{R}(z)=(z-\hat{U})^{-1} $, of
the classical evolution operator $\hat{U} $. The resolvent poles are located
inside the unit circle. For hyperbolic systems this is a rigorous result, but
little is known about mixed systems such as the kicked rotor. In this work, the
leading relaxation rates of the kicked rotor are calculated in presence of
noise, to the leading order in $1/\sqrt{K}$. Then the limit of vanishing noise
is taken and the relaxation rates are found to be finite, corresponding to
poles lying inside the unit circle. It is found that the slow relaxation rates,
in essence, correspond to diffusion modes in the momentum direction. Faster
relaxation modes intermix the motion in the momentum and the angle space. The
slowest relaxation rate of distributions in the angle space is calculated
analytically by studying the dynamics of inhomogeneities projected down to this
space. The analytical results are verified by numerical simulations.
