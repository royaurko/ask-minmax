An algorithm to find a graded Projected Entangled-Pair State representation
of the ground state wave functions is developed for translationally invariant
strongly correlated electronic systems on infinite-size lattices in two spatial
dimensions. It is tested for the two-dimensional t-J model at and away from
half filling, with truncation dimensions up to 6. We are able to locate a line
of phase separation, which qualitatively agrees with the results based on the
high-temperature expansions. We find that the model exhibits an extended s-wave
superconductivity for J=0.4t at quarter filling. However, we emphasize that the
currently accessible truncation dimensions are not large enough, so it is
necessary to incorporate the symmetry of the system into the algorithm, in
order to achieve results with higher precision.
