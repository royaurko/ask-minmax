Analysis of recent Chandra observations of the elliptical galaxies NGC 4472
and NGC 4649 has revealed faint soft X-ray sources at their centers. The
sources are located to within 1'' of the optical centers of the galaxies. They
are most likely associated with the central supermassive black holes. Interest
in these and several other similar objects stems from the unusually low
luminosity of the supermassive black holes embedded in dense interstellar
medium. Our Chandra sources have very soft spectra. They are detectable only
below ~0.6 keV and have luminosities in the 0.2-2.5 keV energy band of ~ 6 *
10^{37} erg/s and ~1.7 * 10^{38} erg/s in NGC 4649 and NGC 4472, respectively.
