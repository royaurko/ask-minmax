We present the K-band Hubble diagrams (K-z relations) of sub-mm-selected
galaxies and hyperluminous galaxies (HLIRGs). We report the discovery of a
remarkably tight K-z relation of HLIRGs, indistinguishable from that of the
most luminous radiogalaxies. Like radiogalaxies, the HLIRG K-z relation at z<~3
is consistent with a passively evolving ~3L* instantaneous starburst starting
from a redshift of z~10. In contrast, many sub-mm selected galaxies are >~2
magnitudes fainter, and the population has a much larger dispersion. We argue
that dust obscuration and/or a larger mass range may be responsible for this
scatter. The galaxies so far proved to be hyperluminous may have been biased
towards higher AGN bolometric contributions than sub-mm-selected galaxies due
to the 60 micron selection of some, so the location on the K-z relation may be
related to the presence of the most massive AGN. Alternatively, a particular
host galaxy mass range may be responsible for both extreme star formation and
the most massive active nuclei.
