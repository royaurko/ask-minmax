In this article we propose a novel face recognition method based on Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and Log-Gabor filters. The main advantages of the
proposed method are its simple implementation, training, and very high
recognition accuracy. For recognition experiments we used 5151 face images of
1311 persons from different sets of the FERET and AR databases that allow to
analyze how recognition accuracy is affected by the change of facial
expressions, illumination, and aging. Recognition experiments with the FERET
database (containing photographs of 1196 persons) showed that our method can
achieve maximal 97-98% first one recognition rate and 0.3-0.4% Equal Error
Rate. The experiments also showed that the accuracy of our method is less
affected by eye location errors and used image normalization method than of
traditional PCA -based recognition method.
