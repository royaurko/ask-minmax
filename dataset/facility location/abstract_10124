Frequently it is argued that the microstates responsible for the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy should arise from some physical degrees of freedom
located near or on the black hole horizon. In this Essay we elucidate that
instead entropy may emerge from the conversion of physical degrees of freedom,
attached to a generic boundary, into unobservable gauge degrees of freedom
attached to the horizon. By constructing the reduced phase space it can be
demonstrated that such a transmutation indeed takes place for a large class of
black holes, including Schwarzschild.
