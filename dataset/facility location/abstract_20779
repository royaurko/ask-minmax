We report on an all-sky search for periodic gravitational waves in the
frequency band 50-800 Hz and with the frequency time derivative in the range of
0 through -6e-9 Hz/s. Such a signal could be produced by a nearby spinning and
slightly non-axisymmetric isolated neutron star in our galaxy. After recent
improvements in the search program that yielded a 10x increase in computational
efficiency, we have searched in two years of data collected during LIGO's fifth
science run and have obtained the most sensitive all-sky upper limits on
gravitational wave strain to date. Near 150 Hz our upper limit on worst-case
linearly polarized strain amplitude $h_0$ is 1e-24, while at the high end of
our frequency range we achieve a worst-case upper limit of 3.8e-24 for all
polarizations and sky locations. These results constitute a factor of two
improvement upon previously published data. A new detection pipeline utilizing
a Loosely Coherent algorithm was able to follow up weaker outliers, increasing
the volume of space where signals can be detected by a factor of 10, but has
not revealed any gravitational wave signals. The pipeline has been tested for
robustness with respect to deviations from the model of an isolated neutron
star, such as caused by a low-mass or long-period binary companion.
