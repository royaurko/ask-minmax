The FKPP equation with a variable growth rate and advection by an
incompressible velocity field is considered as a model for plankton dispersed
by ocean currents. If the average growth rate is negative then the model has a
survival-extinction transition; the location of this transition in the
parameter space is constrained using variational arguments and delimited by
simulations. The statistical steady state reached when the system is in the
survival region of parameter space is characterized by integral constraints and
upper and lower bounds on the biomass and productivity that follow from
variational arguments and direct inequalities. In the limit of
zero-decorrelation time the velocity field is shown to act as Fickian diffusion
with an eddy diffusivity much larger than the molecular diffusivity and this
allows a one-dimensional model to predict the biomass, productivity and
extinction transitions. All results are illustrated with a simple growth and
stirring model.
