We analyze heating and cooling processes in accretion disks in binaries. For
realistic parameters of the accretion disks in close binaries (with accretion
rates from 1e-12 to 1e-7 Msun/year and \alpha from 0.1 to 0.01), the gas
temperature in the outer parts of the disk is from 1e4 to 1e6 K. Our previous
gas-dynamical studies of mass transfer in close binaries indicate that, for hot
disks (with temperatures for the outer parts of the disk of several hundred
thousand K), the interaction between the stream from the inner Lagrange point
and the disk is shockless. To study the morphology of the interaction between
the stream and a cool accretion disk, we carried out three-dimensional modeling
of the flow structure in a binary for the case when the gas temperature in the
outer parts of the forming disk does not exceed 13600 K. The flow pattern
indicates that the interaction is again shockless. The computations provide
evidence that, as is the case for hot disks, the zone of enhanced energy
release (the "hot line") is located beyond the disk, and originates due to the
interaction between the circum-disk halo and the stream.
