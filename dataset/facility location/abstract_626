We study the prospects for testing classes of atmospheric mixing sum rules at
precision neutrino facilities. Such sum rules, which correlate the atmospheric
mixing angle theta23 with the recently measured reactor angle theta13 and the
cosine of the oscillation phase delta, are predicted by a variety of
semi-direct models based on discrete family symmetry, classified in terms of
finite von Dyck groups. We perform a detailed simulation of the performance of
the next generation of oscillation experiments, including the wide band
superbeam and low-energy neutrino factory proposals, and compare their
discriminating power for testing atmospheric mixing sum rules.
