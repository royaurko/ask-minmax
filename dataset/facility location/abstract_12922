From common proper motion and signatures of youth, researchers have
identified about 30 members of a putative TW Hydrae Association. Only four of
these had parallactic distances from Hipparcos. We have measured parallaxes and
proper motions for 14 primary members. We combine these with literature values
of radial velocities to show that the Galactic space motions of the stars, with
the exception of TWA 9 and 22, are parallel and do not indicate convergence at
a common formation point sometime in the last few million years. The space
motions of TWA 9 and 22 do not agree with the others and indicate that they are
not TWA members. The median parallax is 18 mas or 56 pc. We further analyze the
stars' absolute magnitudes on pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks and find a
range of ages with a median of 10.1 Myr and no correlation between age and
Galactic location. The TWA stars may have formed from an extended and
filamentary molecular cloud but are not necessarily precisely coeval.
