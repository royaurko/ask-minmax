In March 2013, the Sydney--AAO Multi-object Integral field spectrograph
(SAMI) began a major survey of 3400 galaxies at the AAT, the largest of its
kind to date. At the time of writing, over a third of the targets have been
observed and the scientific impact has been immediate. The Manga galaxy survey
has now started at the SDSS telescope and will target an even larger sample of
nearby galaxies. In Australia, the community is now gearing up to deliver a
major new facility called Hector that will allow integral field spectroscopy of
100 galaxies observed simultaneously. By the close of the decade, it will be
possible to obtain integral field spectroscopy of 100,000 galaxies over 3000
square degrees of sky down to r=17 (median). Many of these objects will have HI
imaging from the new ASKAP radio surveys. We discuss the motivation for such a
survey and the use of new cosmological simulations that are properly matched to
the integral field observations. The Hector survey will open up a new and
unique parameter space for galaxy evolution studies.
