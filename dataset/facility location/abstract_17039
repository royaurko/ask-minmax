The origin of crystalline grains in comets and the outer regions of
protoplanetary disks remains a mystery. It has been suggested that such grains
form via annealing of amorphous precursors in the hot, inner region of a
protoplanetary disk, where the temperatures needed for such transformations
were found, and were then transported outward by some dynamical means. Here we
develop a means of tracking the paths that dust grains would have taken through
a diffusive protoplanetary disk and examine the types and ranges of
environments that particles would have seen over a 10$^{6}$ year time period in
the dynamic disk. We then combine this model with three annealing laws to
examine how the dynamic evolution of amorphous grains would have led to their
physical restructuring and their delivery to various regions of the disk. It is
found that "sibling particles"-- those particles that reside at the same
location at a given period of time--take a wide range of unique and independent
paths through the disk to arrive there. While high temperatures can persist in
the disk for very long time periods, we find that those grains which are
delivered to the cold outer regions of the disk are largely annealed in the
first few $\times10^{5}$ yrs of disk history. This suggests that the
crystallinity of grains in the outer disk would be determined early and remain
unchanged for much of disk history, in agreement with recent astronomical
observations.
