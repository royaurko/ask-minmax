High energy CW electron beams at new accelerator facilities allow
electromagnetic production and precision study of hypernuclear structure, and
we report here on the first experiment demonstrating the usefulness of the
(e,e'K+) reaction. This experiment is also the first to take advantage of the
enhanced virtual photon flux available when electrons are scattered at
approximately zero degrees. The observed resolution, ~900 keV, of the
12B(hypernuclear) spectrum is the best yet attained using magnetic
spectrometers. The positions of the major excitations are in agreement with
theoretical predictions and the previous binding energy measurements.
