Disaster response agencies have started to incorporate social media as a
source of fast-breaking information to understand the needs of people affected
by the many crises that occur around the world. These agencies look for tweets
from within the region affected by the crisis to get the latest updates of the
status of the affected region. However only 1% of all tweets are geotagged with
explicit location information. First responders lose valuable information
because they cannot assess the origin of many of the tweets they collect. In
this work we seek to identify non-geotagged tweets that originate from within
the crisis region. Towards this, we address three questions: (1) is there a
difference between the language of tweets originating within a crisis region
and tweets originating outside the region, (2) what are the linguistic patterns
that can be used to differentiate within-region and outside-region tweets, and
(3) for non-geotagged tweets, can we automatically identify those originating
within the crisis region in real-time?
