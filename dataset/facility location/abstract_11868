The line of sight through the Galactic Plane between longitudes l = 37.83
degr and l = 42.50 degr allows for the separation of Galactic Ring Survey
molecular clouds into those that fall within the spiral arms and those located
in the inter-arm regions. By matching these clouds in both position and
velocity with dense clumps detected in the mm continuum by the Bolocam Galactic
Plane Survey, we are able to look for changes in the clump formation efficiency
(CFE), the ratio of clump-to-cloud mass, with Galactic environment. We find no
evidence of any difference in the CFE between the inter-arm and spiral-arm
regions along this line of sight. This is further evidence that, outside the
Galactic Centre region, the large-scale structures of the Galaxy play little
part in changing the dense, potentially star-forming structures within
molecular clouds.
