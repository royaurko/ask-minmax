Supernovae play a large but poorly understood role in our attempts to explain
the evolution of the baryonic universe. Numerous observations throughout
astronomy cannot be explained if we neglect their influence, yet our
quantitative understanding of the ways in which supernovae affect the universe
remains remarkably poor. This is one of the most embarrassing gaps in our
knowledge of the cosmos, and planned telescopes and surveys will probably not
do much to fill it. The problem is that these surveys will be optimized to
observe galaxies and intergalactic material independently of each other, while
(in the contributor's view) by far the best information will come from simultaneous
surveys of galaxies and the intergalactic material (IGM) in their vicinity.
Only this will show directly how galaxies affect their surroundings and provide
a rough energy scale for supernova-driven winds. Redshifts 1<z<3 are ideal for
the joint galaxy/IGM surveys we advocate, because the comoving density of star
formation is near its peak, because the Lyman-alpha forest is thin enough for
QSO spectra to reveal the locations of the dominant metallic species, and
because bright background QSOs are common. But a new UV-capable spectrograph in
space will be required.
