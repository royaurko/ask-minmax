We present new data from BVRI photometric observations of five PMS stars
during the period from April 2013 to July 2014. The stars are located in the
field of NGC 7000/IC 5070 ("Gulf of Mexico") - a region with active star
formation. The presented paper is a continuation of our long-term photometric
investigations of the young stellar objects in this region. The long-term
multicolor photometric observations of PMS stars are very important for their
exact classification. Our results show that the studied stars exhibit different
types of photometric variability in all bands. We tried to classify them using
our data from the long-term photometry and data published by other contributors.
