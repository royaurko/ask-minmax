Using the Owens Valley and Nobeyama Radio Observatory interferometers, we
carried out an unbiased search for hot molecular cores and ultracompact UC HII
regions toward the high-mass star forming region G19.61--0.23. In addition, we
performed 1.2 mm imaging with SIMBA, and retrieved 3.5 and 2 cm images from the
VLA archive data base. The newly obtained 3 mm image brings information on a
cluster of high-mass (proto)stars located in the innermost and densest part of
the parsec scale clump detected in the 1.2 mm continuum. We identify a total of
10 high-mass young stellar objects: one hot core (HC) and 9 UC HII regions,
whose physical parameters are obtained from model fits to their continuum
spectra. The ratio between the current and expected final radii of the UC \HII
regions ranges from 0.3 to 0.9, which leaves the possibility that all O-B stars
formed simultaneously. Under the opposite assumption -- namely that star
formation occurred randomly -- we estimate that HC lifetime is less than
$\sim$1/3 of that of UCHII regions on the basis of the source number ratio
between them.
