Many quasi-simultaneous optical observations of 17 blazars are obtained from
previous papers published over the last 19 years in order to investigate the
spectral slope variability and understand the radiation mechanism of blazars.
The long-period dereddened optical spectral slopes are calculated. We analyse
the average spectral slope distribution, which suggests that the spectra of
flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and high energy peaked BL Lac objects
(HBLs) are probably deformed by other emission components. The average spectral
slopes of low energy peaked BL Lac objects(LBLs), which scatter around 1.5,
show a good accordance with the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) loss-dominated
model. We present and discuss the variability between the spectral slope and
optical luminosity. The spectra of all HBLs and LBLs get flatter when they turn
brighter, while for FSRQs this trend does not exist or may even be reversed.
This phenomenon may imply that there is a thermal contribution to the optical
spectrum for FSRQs. For the FSRQ 1156+295, there is a hint that the slope gets
flatter at both the brightest and faintest states. Our result shows that three
subclasses locate in different regions in the pattern of slope variability
indicator versus average spectral slope. The relativistic jet mechanism is
supported by the significant correlation between the optical Doppler factor and
the average spectral slope.
