A proposal submitted to the FNAL PAC is described to search for light sub-GeV
WIMP dark matter at MiniBooNE. The possibility to steer the beam past the
target and into an absorber leads to a significant reduction in neutrino
background, allowing for a sensitive search for elastic scattering of WIMPs off
nucleons or electrons in the detector. Dark matter models involving a vector
mediator can be probed in a parameter region consistent with the required
thermal relic density, and which overlaps the region in which these models can
resolve the muon g-2 discrepancy. Estimates of signal significance are
presented for various operational modes and parameter points. The experimental
approach outlined for applying MiniBooNE to a light WIMP search may also be
applicable to other neutrino facilities.
