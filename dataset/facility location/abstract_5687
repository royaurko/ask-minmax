The inflation-inspired flat, cold dark matter-dominated models of structure
formation with adiabatic, nearly scale-invariant initial conditions agree very
well with current CMB anisotropy data. The success of these models is
highlighted by the failure of alternatives; we argue that there are no longer
any viable competitors (with the exception of models with more complicated
matter content which are still flat and which still require inflation). CMB
data will soon be of sufficient quality that, if one {\it assumes} inflation,
one can detect a non-zero cosmological constant by combining a determination of
the peak location with Hubble constant measurements.
