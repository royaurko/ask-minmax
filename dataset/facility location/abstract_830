An inexpensive and portable approach to measure the time an experimental
event occurs as measured by a specific electronic clock is presented. The clock
resets in active synchronization with the experimental AC-power cycle. This
allows an efficient and complete correction for correlated noise contributions
to pulse area and time measurements of detector channels equipped with
PhotoMultiplier Tubes. The electronic board that was developed will be
described. The performance for the treatment of correlated noise in
experimental data taken at the BNL-AGS facility, and analyses of spectral
decompositions of this noise, will also be described.
