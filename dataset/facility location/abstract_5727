The number of neutrino induced upward going muons from a single Gamma Ray
Burst (GRB) expected to be detected by the proposed kilometer scale IceCube
detector at the South Pole location has been calculated. The effects of the
Lorentz factor, total energy of the GRB emitted in neutrinos and its distance
from the observer (red shift) on the number of neutrino events from the GRB
have been examined. The present investigation reveals that there is possibility
of exploring the early Universe with the proposed kilometer scale IceCube
neutrino telescope.
