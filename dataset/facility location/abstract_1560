We present the current performances of the AMBER / VLTI instrument in terms
of differential observables (differential phase and differential visibility)
and show that we are already able to reach a sufficient precision for very low
mass companions spectroscopy and mass characterization. We perform some
extrapolations with the knowledge of the current limitations of the instrument
facility. We show that with the current setup of the AMBER instrument, we can
already reach $3\sigma = 10^{-3}$ radians and have the potential to some low
mass companions characterization (Brown dwarves or hypothetical very hot Extra
Solar Giant Planets). With some upgrades of the VLTI infrastructure,
improvements of the instrument calibration and improvements of the observing
strategy, we will be able to reach $3\sigma = 10^{-4}$ radians and will have
the potential to perform Extra Solar Giant Planets spectroscopy and mass
characterization.
