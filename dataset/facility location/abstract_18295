We compute the warping of a disc induced by an inclined dipole. We consider a
magnetised star surrounded by a thin Keplerian diamagnetic disc with an inner
edge that corotates with the star. We suppose the stellar field is a dipole
with an axis that is slightly misaligned with the stellar rotation axis. The
rotation axes of the disc material orbiting at large distances from the star
and that of the star are supposed to coincide. The misalignment of the magnetic
and rotation axes results in the magnetic pressure not being the same on the
upper and lower surfaces of the disc. The resultant net vertical force produces
a warp which appears stationary in a frame corotating with the star. We find
that, if viscosity is large enough (alpha on the order of 0.01-0.1) to damp
bending waves as they propagate away, a smoothly varying warp of the inner
region of the disc is produced. The amplitude of the warp can easily be on the
order of ten percent of the disc inner radius for reasonably small misalignment
angles (less than 30 degrees). Viscous damping also introduces a phase shift
between the warp and the forcing torque, which results in the locations of
maximum elevation above the disc forming a trailing spiral pattern. We apply
these results to recent observations of AA Tau, and show that the variability
of its light curve, which occurs with a period comparable to the expected
stellar rotation period, could be due to obscuration produced by a warp
configuration of the type we obtain.
