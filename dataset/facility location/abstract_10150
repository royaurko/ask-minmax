BABAR, the detector for the SLAC PEP-II asymmetric e+e- B Factory operating
at the upsilon 4S resonance, was designed to allow comprehensive studies of
CP-violation in B-meson decays. Charged particle tracks are measured in a
multi-layer silicon vertex tracker surrounded by a cylindrical wire drift
chamber. Electromagentic showers from electrons and photons are detected in an
array of CsI crystals located just inside the solenoidal coil of a
superconducting magnet. Muons and neutral hadrons are identified by arrays of
resistive plate chambers inserted into gaps in the steel flux return of the
magnet. Charged hadrons are identified by dE/dx measurements in the tracking
detectors and in a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector surrounding the drift
chamber. The trigger, data acquisition and data-monitoring systems, VME- and
network-based, are controlled by custom-designed online software. Details of
the layout and performance of the detector components and their associated
electronics and software are presented.
