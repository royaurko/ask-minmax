The habitable zone (HZ) is the circumstellar region where a planet can
sustain surface liquid water. Searching for terrestrial planets in the HZ of
nearby stars is the stated goal of ongoing and planned extrasolar planet
surveys. Previous estimates of the inner edge of the HZ were based on
one-dimensional radiative-convective models. The most serious limitation of
these models is the inability to predict cloud behavior. Here we use global
climate models with sophisticated cloud schemes to show that due to a
stabilizing cloud feedback, tidally locked planets can be habitable at twice
the stellar flux found by previous studies. This dramatically expands the HZ
and roughly doubles the frequency of habitable planets orbiting red dwarf
stars. At high stellar flux, strong convection produces thick water clouds near
the substellar location that greatly increase the planetary albedo and reduce
surface temperatures. Higher insolation produces stronger substellar convection
and therefore higher albedo, making this phenomenon a stabilizing climate
feedback. Substellar clouds also effectively block outgoing radiation from the
surface, reducing or even completely reversing the thermal emission contrast
between dayside and nightside. The presence of substellar water clouds and the
resulting clement surface conditions will therefore be detectable with the
James Webb Space Telescope.
