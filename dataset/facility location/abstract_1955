The exclusive reactions $\gamma p \to K^{*0} \Sigma^+(1189)$ and $\gamma p
\to K^{0} \pi^{0}\Sigma^+(1189)$, leading to the p 4$\pi^{0}$ final state, have
been measured with a tagged photon beam for incident energies from threshold up
to 2.5 GeV. The experiment has been performed at the tagged photon facility of
the ELSA accelerator (Bonn). The Crystal Barrel and TAPS detectors were
combined to a photon detector system of almost 4$\pi$ geometrical acceptance.
Differential and total cross sections are reported. At energies close to the
threshold, a flat angular distribution has been observed for the reaction
$\gamma p\to K^{0} \pi^{0}\Sigma^+$ suggesting dominant s-channel production.
$\Sigma^*(1385)$ and higher lying hyperon states have been observed. An
enhancement in the forward direction in the angular distributions of the
reaction $\gamma p \to K^{*0}\Sigma^+$ indicates a $t$-channel exchange
contribution to the reaction mechanism. The experimental data are in reasonable
agreement with recent theoretical predictions.
