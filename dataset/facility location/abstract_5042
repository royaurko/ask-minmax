Recently, there has been an upsurge of the number of articles on
spatio-temporal modeling in statistical journals. Many of them focus on
building good nonstationary spatio-temporal models. In this article, we
introduce a state space based nonparametric nonstationary model for the
analysis of spatio-temporal data. We consider that there are some fixed spatial
locations (generally called the monitoring sites) and that the data have been
observed at those locations over a period of time. To model the data we assume
that the data generating process is driven by some latent spatio-temporal
process, which itself is evolving with time in some unknown way. We model this
evolutionary transformation via compositions of a Gaussian processand also
model the unknown functional dependence between the data generating process and
the latent spatio-temporal process (observational transformation) by another
Gaussian process. We investigate this model in detail, explore the covariance
structure and formulate a fully Bayesian method for inference andprediction.
Finally, we apply our nonparametric model on two simulated data sets and a real
data set and establish its effectiveness.
