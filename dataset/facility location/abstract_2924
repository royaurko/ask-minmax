We report THEMIS and Geotail observations of prolonged magnetopause (MP)
expansions during long-lasting intervals of quasi-radial interplanetary
magnetic field (IMF) and nearly constant solar wind dynamic pressure. The
expansions were global: the magnetopause was located more than 3 RE and ~7 RE
outside its nominal dayside and magnetotail locations, respectively. The
expanded states persisted several hours, just as long as the quasi-radial IMF
conditions, indicating steady-state situations. For an observed solar wind
pressure of ~1.1-1.3 nPa, the new equilibrium subsolar MP position lay at ~14.5
RE, far beyond its expected location. The equilibrium position was affected by
geomagnetic activity. The magnetopause expansions result from significant
decreases in the total pressure of the high-beta magnetosheath, which we term
the low-pressure magnetosheath (LPM) mode. A prominent LPM mode was observed
for upstream conditions characterized by IMF cone angles less than 20 ~ 25
grad, high Mach numbers and proton plasma beta<1.3. The minimum value for the
total pressure observed by THEMIS in the magnetosheath adjacent to the
magnetopause was 0.16 nPa and the fraction of the solar wind pressure applied
to the magnetopause was therefore 0.2, extremely small. The equilibrium
location of the magnetopause was modulated by a nearly continuous wavy motion
over a wide range of time and space scales.
