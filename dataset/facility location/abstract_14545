Sunspot proper motions and flares of a super active region NOAA 5395, which
was the biggest and the most flare-active region in the 22nd sunspot cycle,
were analyzed in details. We measured sunspot proper motions by using the
H-alpha - 5.0 A images obtained with the 60-cm Domeless Solar Telescope (DST)
at Hida Observatory, Kyoto University and found some peculiar vortex-like
motions of small satellite spots successively emerged from the leading edge of
this sunspot group. To explain these motions of small sunspots, we proposed a
schematic model of the successive emergence of twisted and winding magnetic
flux ropes coiling around a trunk of magnetic flux tube. The location of the
strongest flare activity was found to coincide with very the site of the
vortex-like motions of sunspots. We conclude that the flare-productive magnetic
shear is produced by the emergence of the twisted magnetic flux bundle.
Magnetic energy is stored in the twisted flux tubes which are originally formed
in the convection zone and released as flares in the course of the emergence of
the twisted flux tubes above the photosphere.
