The aim of this paper is to present a further contribution to the analysis of
absolute convergence (and), associated with the neoclassical theory, and
conditional, associated with endogenous growth theory, of the sectoral
productivity at regional level. Presenting some empirical evidence of absolute
convergence of productivity for each of the economic sectors and industries in
each of the regions of mainland Portugal (NUTS II and NUTS III) in the period
1986 to 1994 and from 1995 to 1999. The finest spatial unit NUTS III is only
considered for each of the economic sectors in the period 1995 to 1999. They
are also presented empirical evidence of conditional convergence of
productivity, but only for each of the economic sectors of the NUTS II of
Portugal, from 1995 to 1999. The structural variables used in the analysis of
conditional convergence is the ratio of capital/output, the flow of
goods/output and location ratio. The main conclusions should be noted that the
signs of convergence are stronger in the first period than in the second and
that convergence is conditional, especially in industry and in all sectors
(1)(Martinho, 2011).
