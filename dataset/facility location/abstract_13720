License Plate recognition plays an important role on the traffic monitoring
and parking management systems. In this paper, a fast and real time method has
been proposed which has an appropriate application to find tilt and poor
quality plates. In the proposed method, at the beginning, the image is
converted into binary mode using adaptive threshold. Then, by using some edge
detection and morphology operations, plate number location has been specified.
Finally, if the plat has tilt, its tilt is removed away. This method has been
tested on another paper data set that has different images of the background,
considering distance, and angel of view so that the correct extraction rate of
plate reached at 98.66%.
