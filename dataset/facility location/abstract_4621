Orbital debris is a constraint on the long-term health of any spacecraft and
must be considered during mission planning. Varying mechanisms have been
proposed to quantify the problem. Assessment of orbital debris employing
ground-based methods such as radar can help determine where debris clouds are
located as well as their density or orbital trajectory. Such data is invaluable
to computer simulations and can allow predictions of the debris environment
over specific time periods [1]. Accurate in-situ data is essential as well with
various types of sensors designed to detect orbital debris impacts employed on
space missions since the 1950's [2]. One of the most common of these is the PZT
(piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate) which is often used in-situ to measure
the momentum of a particle at the time of impact. This paper will discuss a
multiple PZT sensor system capable of determining both impactor momentum and
location currently in development within CASPER.
