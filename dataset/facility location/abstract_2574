A new thermal neutron detector with the domestically produced THGEM (THick
Gas Electron Multiplier) was developed as an alternative to 3He to meet the
needs of the next generation of neutron facilities. One type of Au-coated THGEM
was designed specifically for the neutron detection. A detector prototype had
been developed and the preliminary experimental tests were presented, including
the performance of the Au-coated THGEM working in the Ar/CO2 gas mixtures and
the neutron imaging test with 252CF source, which would provide the reference
of experimental data for the research in future.
