We propose the following model equation:
\[u_{t}+1/2(u^{2}-uu_{s})_{x}=f(x,u_{s}), \] that predicts chaotic shock waves.
It is given on the half-line $x<0$ and the shock is located at $x=0$ for any
$t\ge0$. Here $u_{s}(t)$ is the shock state and the source term $f$ is assumed
to satisfy certain integrability constraints as explained in the main text. We
demonstrate that this simple equation reproduces many of the properties of
detonations in gaseous mixtures, which one finds by solving the reactive Euler
equations: existence of steady traveling-wave solutions and their instability,
a cascade of period-doubling bifurcations, onset of chaos, and shock formation
in the reaction zone.
