Given a Taylor series with a finite radius of convergence, its Borel
transform defines an entire function. A theorem of P\'olya relates the large d
istance behavior of the Borel transform in different directions to
singularities of the original function. With the help of the new asymptotic
interpolation method of van der Hoeven, we show that from the knowledge of a
large number of Taylor coefficients we can identify precisely the location of
such singularities, as well as their type when they are isolated. There is no
risk of getting artefacts with this method, which also gives us access to some
of the singularities beyond the convergence disk. The method can also be
applied to Fourier series of analytic periodic functions and is here tested on
various instances constructed from solutions to the Burgers equation. Large
precision on scaling exponents (up to twenty accurate digits) can be achieved.
