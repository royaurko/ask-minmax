Approximately 30 to 50 percent of the total baryons in the present universe
is supposed to take a form of warm/hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) whose X-ray
continuum emission is very weak. In order to carry out a direct and homogeneous
survey of elusive cosmic missing baryons, we propose a dedicated soft-X-ray
mission, {\it DIOS} (Diffuse Intergalactic Oxygen Surveyor). The unprecedented
energy resolution ($\sim 2$eV) of the XSA (X-ray Spectrometer Array) on-board
{\it DIOS} enables us to identify WHIM with gas temperature $T=10^{6-7}$K and
overdensity $\delta=10-100$ located at $z<0.3$ through emission lines of O{\sc
vii} and O{\sc viii}. {\it DIOS}, hopefully launched in several years, promises
to open a new window of detection and characterization of cosmic missing
baryons, and to provide yet another important and complementary tool to trace
the large-scale structure of the universe.
