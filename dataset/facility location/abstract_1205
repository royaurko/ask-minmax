The Compact Neutron Spectrometer (CNS) is a Joint European Torus (JET)
Enhancement Project, designed for fusion diagnostics in different plasma
scenarios. The CNS is based on a liquid scintillator (BC501A) which allows good
discrimination between neutron and gamma radiation. Neutron spectrometry with a
BC501A spectrometer requires the use of a reliable, fully characterized
detector. The determination of the response matrix was carried out at the Ion
Accelerator Facility (PIAF) of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB).
This facility provides several monoenergetic beams (2.5, 8, 10, 12 and 14 MeV)
and a 'white field'(Emax ~17 MeV), which allows for a full characterization of
the spectrometer in the region of interest (from ~1.5 MeV to ~17 MeV. The
energy of the incoming neutrons was determined by the time of flight method
(TOF), with time resolution in the order of 1 ns. To check the response matrix,
the measured pulse height spectra were unfolded with the code MAXED and the
resulting energy distributions were compared with those obtained from TOF. The
CNS project required modification of the PTB BC501A spectrometer design, to
replace an analog data acquisition system (NIM modules) with a digital system
developed by the 'Ente per le Nuove tecnologie, l'Energia e l'Ambiente' (ENEA).
Results for the new digital system were evaluated using new software developed
specifically for this project.
