We discuss BIMA (Berkeley Illinois Maryland Association) data and present new
high quality optical and near-IR Keck images of the bright radio ring PKS
1830-211. Applying a powerful new deconvolution algorithm we have been able to
identify both images of the radio source. In addition we recover an extended
source in the optical, consistent with the expected location of the lensing
galaxy. The source counterparts are very red, I-K=7, suggesting strong Galactic
absorption with additional absorption by the lensing galaxy at z=0.885, and
consistent with the detection of high redshift molecules in the lens.
