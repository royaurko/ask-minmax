We propose a generalization of the concept of symmetry as a continuous
function of the reference center or line location. We suggest that this concept
can be applied to many closed systems and exploring its time evolution. When
the function changes along time it is an indication that external factors are
acting on the system.The change in the symmetry function along time can be
thought as a current in the symmetry degree and its time behavior a measure of
the effect of the external agent.
