We examine the possibility that one could measure partonic charge symmetry
violation (CSV) by comparing neutrino or antineutrino production through
charged-current reactions induced by electrons or positrons at a possible
electron collider at the LHC. We calculate the magnitude of CSV that might be
expected at such a facility. We show that this is likely to be a several
percent effect, substantially larger than the typical CSV effects expected for
partonic reactions.
