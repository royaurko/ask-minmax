We numerically investigated the sequences of initial data of thin spindle and
thin ring in five-dimensional space-time in the context of the cosmic
censorship conjecture. We modeled the matter in non-rotating homogeneous
spheroidal or toroidal configurations under the momentarily static assumption,
solved the Hamiltonian constraint equation, and searched the apparent horizons.
We discussed when $S^3$ (black hole) or $S^1 \times S^2$ (black ring) horizons
("black objects") are formed. By monitoring the location of the maximum
Kretchmann invariant, an appearance of `naked singularity' or `naked ring'
under special situation is suggested. We also discuss the validity of the {\it
hyper-hoop} conjecture using minimum {\it area} around the object, and show
that the appearance of the ring horizon does not match with this hoop.
