We report on results of imaging and spectral analysis of the supernova
remnant (SNR) RCW 86 observed with Suzaku. The SNR is known to exhibit K-shell
emission of low ionized Fe, possibly originating from supernova ejecta. We
revealed the global distribution of the Fe-rich plasma in the entire remnant,
for the first time; the Fe-K emission was clearly detected from the west,
north, and south regions, in addition to the X-ray brighter shells of southwest
and northeast, where the presence of the Fe-rich ejecta has already been
reported. The spectrum of each region is well represented by a three-component
model consisting of low- and high-temperature thermal plasmas and a non-thermal
emission. The lower-temperature component, with elemental abundances of near
the solar values, likely originates from the forward shocked interstellar
medium, while the Fe-rich ejecta is described by the hotter plasma. From the
morphologies of the forward and reverse shocks in the west region, the total
ejecta mass is estimated to be 1-2M_sun for the typical explosion energy of ~ 1
x 10^{51} erg. The integrated flux of the Fe-K emission from the entire SNR
roughly corresponds to a total Fe mass of about 1M_sun. Both of these estimates
suggest a Type Ia supernova origin of this SNR. We also find possible evidence
of an Fe-rich clump located beyond the forward-shock front in the north rim,
which is reminiscent of ejecta knots observed in the Tycho and Vela SNRs.
