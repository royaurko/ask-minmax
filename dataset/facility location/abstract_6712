Observations and models of solar prominences are reviewed. We focus on
non-eruptive prominences, and describe recent progress in four areas of
prominence research: (1) magnetic structure deduced from observations and
models, (2) the dynamics of prominence plasmas (formation and flows), (3)
Magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves in prominences and (4) the formation and
large-scale patterns of the filament channels in which prominences are located.
Finally, several outstanding issues in prominence research are discussed, along
with observations and models required to resolve them.
