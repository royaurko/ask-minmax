The experimental achievements and the current program with the LPCTrap device
installed at the LIRAT beam line of the SPIRAL1-GANIL facility are presented.
The device is dedicated to the study of the weak interaction at low energy by
means of precise measurements of the {\beta}-{\nu} angular correlation
parameter. Technical aspects as well as the main results are reviewed. The
future program with new available beams is briefly discussed.
