We study planar point location in a collection of disjoint fat regions, and
investigate the complexity of \emph {local updates}: replacing any region by a
different region that is "similar" to the original region. (i.e., the size
differs by at most a constant factor, and distance between the two regions is a
constant times that size). We show that it is possible to create a linear size
data structure that allows for insertions, deletions, and queries in
logarithmic time, and allows for local updates in sub-logarithmic time on a
pointer machine.
