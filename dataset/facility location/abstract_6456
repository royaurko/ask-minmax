Friedrich's proofs for the global existence results of de Sitter-like
space-times and of semi-global existence of Minkowski-like space-times [Comm.
Math. Phys. \textbf{107}, 587 (1986)] are re-examined and discussed, making use
of the extended conformal field equations and a gauge based on conformal
geodesics. In this gauge the location of the conformal boundary of the
space-times is known \emph{a priori} once the initial data has been prescribed.
Thus it provides an analysis which is conceptually and calculationally simpler.
