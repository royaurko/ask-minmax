This note suggests that near earth objects and Central Force Optimization
have something in common, that NEO theory may hold the key to solving some
vexing problems in deterministic optimization: local trapping and proof of
convergence. CFO analogizes Newton's laws to locate the global maxima of a
function. The NEO-CFO nexus is the striking similarity between CFO's Davg and
an NEO's Delta-V curves. Both exhibit oscillatory plateau-like regions
connected by jumps, suggesting that CFO's metaphorical "gravity" indeed behaves
like real gravity, thereby connecting NEOs and CFO and being the basis for
speculating that NEO theory may address difficult issues in optimization.
