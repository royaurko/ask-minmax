The scattering and transformation of the waves propagating in magnetized
plasma on a heavy stationary charged particle located at a plane plasma-vacuum
boundary is considered. The scattering (transformation) occurs due to the
nonlinear coupling of the incident wave with the polarization (shielding) cloud
surrounding the particle. It is shown that the problem is reduced to the
determination of the nonlinear (three index) dielectric tensor of magnetized
plasma. The angular distribution and the cross section for scattering
(transformation) of high-frequency ordinary and extraordinary waves and
low-frequency upper-hybrid, low-hybrid, and magnetosonic waves are investigated
within a cold plasma (hydrodynamic) model.
