We present new radio continuum and HI images towards the supernova remnants
(SNRs) G114.3+0.3, G116.5+1.1, and G116.9+0.2 (CTB 1) taken from the Canadian
Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS). We discuss the dynamics of their HI environment
and a possible relationship of these SNRs with each other. We discovered
patches of HI emission surrounding G114.3+0.3 indicating a location in the
Local arm at a distance of about 700 pc in contrast to previous publications
which proposed a Perseus arm location. The other two SNRs have radial
velocities of -17 km/s (G116.5+1.1) and -27 km/s (CTB 1) according to related
HI. However, the structure of the HI and its dynamics in velocity space suggest
a possible relation between them, placing both remnants at a distance of about
1.6 kpc. CTB 1 appears to be embedded in an HI feature which is moving as a
whole towards us with a velocity of about 10 km/s. Furthermore, the
off-centered location of CTB 1 in a large HI bubble indicates that the
so-called breakout region of the remnant is in fact due to its expansion
towards the low density interior of this bubble. We believe that the progenitor
star of CTB 1 was an early B or O-type star shaping its environment with a
strong stellar wind in which case it exploded in a Ib or Ic event.
