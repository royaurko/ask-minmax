We consider the problem of computing form factors of the massless XXZ
Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain in a magnetic field in the (thermodynamic) limit
where the size M of the chain becomes large. For that purpose, we take the
particular example of the matrix element of the third component of spin between
the ground state and an excited state with one particle and one hole located at
the opposite ends of the Fermi interval (umklapp-type term). We exhibit its
power-law decrease in terms of the size of the chain M, and compute the
corresponding exponent and amplitude. As a consequence, we show that this form
factor is directly related to the amplitude of the leading oscillating term in
the long-distance asymptotic expansion of the two-point correlation function of
the third component of spin.
