In the present work, we study and analyze an efficient iterative coupling
method for a dimensionally heterogeneous problem . We consider the case of 2-D
Laplace equation with non symmetric boundary conditions with a corresponding
1-D Laplace equation. We will first show how to obtain the 1-D model from the
2-D one by integration along one direction, by analogy with the link between
shallow water equations and the Navier-Stokes system. Then, we will focus on
the design of an Schwarz-like iterative coupling method. We will discuss the
choice of boundary conditions at coupling interfaces. We will prove the
convergence of such algorithms and give some theoretical results related to the
choice of the location of the coupling interface, and the control of the
difference between a global 2-D reference solution and the 2-D coupled one.
These theoretical results will be illustrated numerically.
