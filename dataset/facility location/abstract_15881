We have explored a sample of suspected A-type binaries in a systematic way,
both spectroscopically and photometrically. Due to their location in the H-R
diagram, indications of pulsation and/or chemical peculiarities among these
suspected binary (or multiple) systems may be found. High-resolution
spectroscopy obtained with the ELODIE and MUSICOS spectrographs was used in
combination with a few nights of differential CCD photometry in order to search
for pulsation(s). Of the 32 investigated targets, eight are spectroscopic
binaries, one of which is a close binary also showing eclipses, and three have
been identified as Delta Scuti pulsators with rapid line-profile variations.
Among the latter stars, HD 217860 reveals interesting multiperiodic photometric
and spectroscopic variations, with up to eight frequencies common to two large
photometric data sets. We suggest that at least one radial overtone mode is
excited among the two most dominant frequencies. We furthermore found evidence
for a strong modulation of the amplitude(s) and/or the (radial) frequency
content of this intriguing Delta Scuti star.
