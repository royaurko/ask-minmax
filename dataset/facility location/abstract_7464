We report spectroscopic measurements of discrete two-level systems (TLSs)
coupled to a dc SQUID phase qubit with a 16 \mu\m2 area Al/AlOx/Al junction.
Applying microwaves in the 10 GHz to 11 GHz range, we found eight avoided level
crossings with splitting sizes from 10 MHz to 200 MHz and spectroscopic
lifetimes from 4 ns to 160 ns. Assuming the transitions are from the ground
state of the composite system to an excited state of the qubit or an excited
state of one of the TLS states, we fit the location and spectral width to get
the energy levels, splitting sizes and spectroscopic coherence times of the
phase qubit and TLSs. The distribution of splittings is consistent with
non-interacting individual charged ions tunneling between random locations in
the tunnel barrier and the distribution of lifetimes is consistent with the
AlOx in the junction barrier having a frequency-independent loss tangent. To
check that the charge of each TLS couples independently to the voltage across
the junction, we also measured the spectrum in the 20-22 GHz range and found
tilted avoided level crossings due to the second excited state of the junction
and states in which both the junction and a TLS were excited.
