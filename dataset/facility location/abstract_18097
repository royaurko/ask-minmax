In a magnetization vs. temperature (M vs. T) experiment, the blocking region
of a magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) assembly is the interval of T values were the
system begins to respond to an applied magnetic field H when heating the sample
from the lower reachable temperature. The location of this region is determined
by the anisotropy energy barrier depending on the applied field H, the volume
V, the magnetic anisotropy constant K of the MNPs and the observing time of the
technique. In the general case of a polysized sample, a representative blocking
temperature value $T_B$ can be estimated from ZFC-FC experiments as a way to
determine the effective anisotropy constant.
  In this work, a numerical solved Stoner-Wolfharth two level model with
thermal agitation is used to simulate ZFC-FC curves of monosized and polysized
samples and to determine the best method for obtaining a representative $T_B$
value of polysized samples. The results corroborate a technique based on the T
derivative of the difference between ZFC and FC curves proposed by Micha et
al(the good) and demonstrate its relation with two alternative methods: the ZFC
maximum (the bad) and inflection point (the ugly). The derivative method is
then applied to experimental data, obtaining the $T_B$ distribution of a
polysized $Fe_3O_4$ MNP sample suspended in hexane with an excellent agreement
with TEM characterization.
