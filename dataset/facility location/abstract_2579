A preliminary data analysis of the stellar light curves obtained by the
robotic telescopes of the TAOS project is presented. We selected a data run
relative to one of the stellar fields observed by three of the four TAOS
telescopes, and we investigate the common trend and the correlation between the
light curves. We propose two ways to remove these trends and show the
preliminary results. A project aimed at flagging interesting behaviors, such as
stellar variability, and to set up an automated follow-up with the San Pedro
M\'artir Facilities is on the way.
