We present 3.6 to 70 {\mu}m Spitzer photometry of 154 weak-line T Tauri stars
(WTTS) in the Chamaeleon, Lupus, Ophiuchus and Taurus star formation regions,
all of which are within 200 pc of the Sun. For a comparative study, we also
include 33 classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) which are located in the same star
forming regions. Spitzer sensitivities allow us to robustly detect the
photosphere in the IRAC bands (3.6 to 8 {\mu}m) and the 24 {\mu}m MIPS band. In
the 70 {\mu}m MIPS band, we are able to detect dust emission brighter than
roughly 40 times the photosphere. These observations represent the most
sensitive WTTS survey in the mid to far infrared to date, and reveal the
frequency of outer disks (r = 3-50 AU) around WTTS. The 70 {\mu}m photometry
for half the c2d WTTS sample (the on-cloud objects), which were not included in
the earlier papers in this series, Padgett et al. (2006) and Cieza et al.
(2007), are presented here for the first time. We find a disk frequency of 19%
for on-cloud WTTS, but just 5% for off- cloud WTTS, similar to the value
reported in the earlier works. WTTS exhibit spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) that are quite diverse, spanning the range from optically thick to
optically thin disks. Most disks become more tenuous than Ldisk/L* = 2 x 10^-3
in 2 Myr, and more tenuous than Ldisk/L* = 5 x 10^-4 in 4 Myr.
