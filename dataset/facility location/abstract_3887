Developed at the Observatoire de la C\^ote d'Azur (OCA) within the framework
of the PICARD space mission (Thuillier et al., 2006) and with support from the
french spatial agency (CNES), MISOLFA (Moniteur d'Images Solaires
Franco-Alg\'erien) is a new generation of daytime turbulence monitor. Its
objective is to measure both the spatial and temporal turbulence parameters in
order to quantify their effects on the solar diameter measurements that will be
made from ground using the qualification model of the SODISM (SOlar Diameter
Imager and Surface Mapper) instrument onboard PICARD. The comparison of
simultaneous images from ground and space should allow us, with the help of the
solar monitor, to find the best procedure possible to measure solar diameter
variations from ground on the long term. MISOLFA is now installed at the Calern
facility of OCA and PICARD is scheduled to be launched in 2010. We present here
the principles of the instrument and the first results obtained on the
characteristics of the turbulence observed at Calern observatory using this
monitor while waiting for the launch of the space mission.
