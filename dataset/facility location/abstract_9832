A transfer matrix technique is used to model phase coherent spin transport in
the weakly disordered quasi one-dimensional channel of a gate-controlled
electron spin interferometer [Datta and Das, Appl. Phys. Lett., 56, 665
(1990)]. It includes the effects of an axial magnetic field in the channel of
the interferometer (caused by the ferromagnetic contacts), a Rashba spin-orbit
interaction, and elastic (non-magnetic) impurity scattering. We show that in
the presence of the axial magnetic field, non-magnetic impurities can cause
spin relaxation in a manner similar to the Elliott-Yafet mechanism. The
amplitudes and phases of the conductance oscillations of the interferometer,
and the degree of spin-conductance polarization, are found to be quite
sensitive to the height of the interface barrier at the contact, as well as the
strength, locations and nature (attractive or repulsive) of just a few elastic
non-magnetic impurities in the channel. This can seriously hinder practical
applications of spin interferometers.
