The standard approach to initial data for both analytic and numerical
computations of black hole collisions has been to use conformally-flat initial
geometry. Among other advantages, this choice allows the simple superposition
of holes with arbitrary mass, location and spin. The conformally flat
restriction, however, is inappropriate to the study of Kerr holes, for which
the standard constant-time slice is not conformally flat. Here we point out
that for axisymmetric arrangements of rotating holes, a nonconformally flat
form of the 3-geometry can be chosen which allows fairly simple superposition
of Kerr holes with arbitrary mass and spin. We present initial data solutions
representing locally Kerr holes at large separation, and representing rotating
holes close enough so that outside a common horizon the spacetime geometry is a
perturbation of a single Kerr hole.
