We have developed a general method for finding apparent horizons in 3D
numerical relativity. Instead of solving for the partial differential equation
describing the location of the apparent horizons, we expand the closed 2D
surfaces in terms of symmetric trace--free tensors and solve for the expansion
coefficients using a minimization procedure. Our method is applied to a number
of different spacetimes, including numerically constructed spacetimes
containing highly distorted axisymmetric black holes in spherical coordinates,
and 3D rotating, and colliding black holes in Cartesian coordinates.
