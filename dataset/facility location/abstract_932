In this article I present some special astronomical scripts created for
Google Earth, Google Sky and Twitter. These 'hacks' are examples of the ways in
which such tools can be used either alone, in on conjunction with online
services. The result of a combination of multiple, online services to form a
new facility is called a mash-up. Some of what follows falls into that
definition. As we move into an era of online data and tools, it is the network
as a whole that becomes important. Tools emerging from this network can be
capable of more than the sum of their parts.
