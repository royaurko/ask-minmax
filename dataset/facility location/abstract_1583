This paper makes a comparison between x-ray absorption (XAS) and resonant
inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) in the rare earths. Atomic calculations are
given for 2p -> 4f and 2p -> 5d XAS. The latter calculation includes the
contraction and expansion of the 5d orbitals resulting from the complete
exchange interaction with the 4f electrons. The radiative decay of the XAS
final states is described for the situations where the core hole created in the
absorption process is filled by a valence electron or by an electron from a
shallower core level. RIXS spectra, 4f^n -> _{3d} 4f^{n+1} -> 4f^n,integrated
over the outgoing photon energy (fluorescence yield) are compared with 3d -> 4f
XAS. Sum rules related to XAS and RIXS and their applicability are discussed.
