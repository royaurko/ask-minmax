To give a georeference means to give a reference as existing in the physical
space of Earth. This procedure is widely used for the location of
archaeological, historical and other sites when geographic information systems
(GIS) are used. Here we are proposing to georeference the lives of famous
people (in the paper, Newton and Schiaparelli) for teaching purposes, to
increase the appeal of some scientific disciplines.
