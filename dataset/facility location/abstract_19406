Parametric photon creation via the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) is
evaluated numerically, in a three-dimensional rectangular resonant cavity
bisected by a semiconductor diaphragm (SD), which is irradiated by a pulsed
laser with frequency of GHz order. The aim of this paper is to determine some
of the optimum conditions required to detect DCE photons relevant to a novel
experimental detection system. We expand upon the thin plasma sheet model
[Crocce et al., Phys. Rev. A 70 033811 (2004)] to estimate the number of
photons for both TE and TM modes at any given SD position. Numerical
calculations are performed considering up to 51 inter-mode couplings by varying
the SD location, driving period and laser power without any perturbations. It
is found that the number of photons created for TE modes strongly depends on SD
position, where the strongest enhancement occurs at the midpoint (not near the
cavity wall); while TM modes have weak dependence on SD position. Another
important finding is the fact that significant photon production for TM$_{111}$
modes still takes place at the midpoint even for a low laser power of 0.01
micro J/pulse, although the number of TE$_{111}$ photons decreases almost
proportionately with laser power. We also find a relatively wide tuning range
for both TE and TM modes that is correlated with the frequency variation of the
instantaneous mode functions caused by the interaction between the cavity
photons and conduction electrons in the SD excited by a pulsed laser.
