The present contributor has kept observation for concentrations of atmospheric
radon, radon progeny and thoron progeny for several years at the campus of
Fukushima Medical University. Accidentally, in the midst of an observation
term, i.e., February 2005, the facility management group of the university
changed a strategy for the manner of ventilation, probably because of a
recession: (I) tidy everyday ventilation of 7:30-24:00 into (II) shortened
weekday ventilation of 8:00-21:00 with weekend halts. This change of
ventilation manner brought a clear alteration for the concentrations of
radon-related natural radioactivity in indoor air. The present paper concerns
an investigation of the effect of the ventilation strategy on the
indoor-atmospheric radon-related radioactivity.
