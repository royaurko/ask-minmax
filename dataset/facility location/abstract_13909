The ALICE Collaboration measures the production of low-mass dielectrons in
pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. The main detectors used in the
analyses are the Inner Tracking System, Time Projection Chamber and
Time-Of-Flight detector, all located around mid-rapidity. The production of
virtual photons relative to the inclusive yield in pp collisions is determined
by analyzing the dielectron excess with respect to the expected hadronic
sources. The direct photon cross section is then calculated and found to be in
agreement with NLO pQCD calculations. Results from the invariant mass analysis
in p-Pb collisions show an overall agreement between data and hadronic
cocktail. In Pb-Pb collisions, uncorrected background-subtracted yields have
been extracted in two centrality classes. A feasibility study for LHC run 3
after the ALICE upgrade indicates the possibility for a future measurement of
the early effective temperature.
