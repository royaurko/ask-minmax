An asymptotically exact solution is presented for the two-impurity Kondo
model for a finite region of the parameter space surrounding the critical
point. This region is located in the most interesting intermediate regime where
RKKY interaction is comparable to the Kondo temperature.
  After several exact simplifications involving reduction to one dimension and
abelian bosonization, the critical point is explicitly identified, making clear
its physical origin. By using controlled low energy projection, an effective
Hamiltonian is mapped out for the finite region in the phase diagram around the
critical point. The completeness of the effective Hamiltonian is rigorously
proved from general symmetry considerations. The effective Hamiltonian is
solved exactly not only at the critical point but also for the surrounding
Fermi-liquid phase. Analytic crossover functions from the critical to
Fermi-liquid behavior are derived for the specific heat and staggered
susceptibility. It is shown that applying a uniform magnetic field has
negligible effect on the critical behavior.
