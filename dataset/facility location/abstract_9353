High angular resolution images of IRC +10216 taken at various bandpasses
within the near-infrared h, k & l bands are presented. The maps have the
highest angular resolution yet recovered, and were reconstructed from
interferometric measurements obtained at the Keck 1 telescope in 1997 December
and 1998 April, forming a subset of a 7-epoch monitoring program presented
earlier [paper 1]. Systematic changes with observing wavelength are found and
discussed in context of present geometrical models for the circumstellar
envelope. With these new high-resolution, multi-wavelength data and
contemporaneous photometry, we also re-visit the hypothesis that the bright
compact Core of the nebula (component `A') marks the location of the central
carbon star. We find that directly measured properties of the Core (angular
size, flux density, color temperature) are consistent with a reddened carbon
star photosphere (line-of-sight tau=5.3).
