Subpixel event repositioning (SER) techniques have been demonstrated to
significantly improve the already unprecedented spatial resolution of Chandra
X-ray imaging with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS). Chandra CCD
SER techniques are based on the premise that the impact position of events can
be refined, based on the distribution of charge among affected CCD pixels. ACIS
SER models proposed thus far are restricted to corner split (3- and 4-pixel)
events, and assume that such events take place at the split pixel corners. To
improve the event counting statistics, we modified the ACIS SER algorithms to
include 2-pixel split events and single pixel events, using refined estimates
for photon impact locations. Furthermore, simulations that make use of a
high-fidelity backside illuminated (BI) CCD model demonstrate that mean photon
impact positions for split events are energy dependent leading to further
modification of subpixel event locations according to event type and energy,
for BI ACIS devices. Testing on Chandra CCD X-ray observations of the Orion
Nebula Cluster indicates that these modified SER algorithms further improve the
spatial resolution of Chandra/ACIS, to the extent that the spreading in the
spatial distribution of photons is dominated by the High Resolution Mirror
Assembly, rather than by ACIS pixelization.
