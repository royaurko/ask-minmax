Multifrequency polarimetric observations made with the Very Long Baseline
Array of the quasar 3C216 reveal the presence of Faraday rotation measures
(RMs) in excess of 2000 rad/m**2 in the source rest frame, in the arc of
emission located at ~ 140 mas from the core. Rotation measures in the range
-300 - +300 rad/m**2 are detected in the inner 5 mas (~30 parsecs). while the
rotation measures near the core can be explained as due to a magnetic field in
the narrow line region, we favor the interpretation for the high RM in the arc
as due to a ``local'' Faraday screen, produced in a shock where the jet is
deflected by the interstellar medium of the host galaxy. Our results indicate
that a galacit magnetic field of the order of 50 microGauss on a scale greater
than 100 pc must be present in the galactic medium.
