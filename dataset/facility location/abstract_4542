We have used angular resolved photoemission to measure the angular dependence
of the superconducting gap in highly overdoped Bi2212 (Tc=65K). While the node
at 45 degrees is conserved, we find substantial deviation from a first order
d-wave dependence away from the node. The pairing susceptibility is peaked at
special regions on the Fermi surface. Comparing these results with a detailed
mapping of the Fermi surface we performed, we could measure the extension and
location of these hot regions. We find the hot regions to be evenly spread
about the nominal locations of hot spots. The decrease of the gap amplitude
away from these hot regions follows very closely theoretical calculations
within the spin fluctuation approach. These results strongly suggest that the
pairing susceptibility is peaked at Q=(Pi,Pi).
