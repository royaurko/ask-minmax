The production of X-ray radiation with a high degree of circular polarization
constitutes an important goal at XFEL facilities. A simple scheme to obtain
circular polarization control with crossed undulators has been proposed so far.
In its simplest configuration the crossed undulators consist of pair of short
planar undulators in crossed position separated by an electromagnetic phase
shifter. An advantage of this configuration is a fast helicity switching. A
drawback is that a high degree of circular polarization (over 90%) can only be
achieved for lengths of the insertion devices significantly shorter than the
gain length, i.e. at output power significantly lower than the saturation power
level. The obvious and technically possible extension considered in this paper,
is to use a setup with two or more crossed undulators separated by phase
shifters. This cascade crossed undulator scheme is distinguished, in
performance, by a fast helicity switching, a high degree of circular
polarization (over 95%) and a high output power level, comparable with the
saturation power level in the baseline undulator at fundamental wavelength. We
present feasibility study and exemplifications for the LCLS baseline in the
soft X-ray regime.
