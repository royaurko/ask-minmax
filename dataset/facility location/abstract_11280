The anomalous chemical abundances and the structure of the Edgewood-Kuiper
belt observed in the solar system constrain the initial mass and radius of the
star cluster in which the sun was born to $M\simeq500$ to 3000 \msun and
$R\simeq 1$ to 3 pc. When the cluster dissolved the siblings of the sun
dispersed through the galaxy, but they remained on a similar orbit around the
Galactic center. Today these stars hide among the field stars, but 10 to 60 of
them are still present within a distance of $\sim 100$ pc. These siblings of
the sun can be identified by accurate measurements of their chemical
abundances, positions and their velocities. Finding even a few will strongly
constrain the parameters of the parental star cluster and the location in the
Galaxy where we were born.
