Cells of the immune system, as well as cancer cells, migrating in confined
environment of tissues undergo frequent shape changes (described as amoeboid
motion) that enable them to move forward through these porous media without the
assistance of adhesion sites. In other words, they perform amoeboid swimming
(AS) while using extracellular matrices and cells of tissues as support. We
introduce a simple model of AS in a confined geometry solved by means of 2D
numerical simulations. We find that confinement promotes AS, unless being so
strong that it restricts shape change amplitude. A straight AS trajectory in
the channel is found to be unstable, and ample lateral excursions of the
swimmer prevail. For weak confinement, these excursions are symmetric, while
they become asymmetric at stronger confinement, whereby the swimmer is located
closer to one of the two walls. This is a spontaneous symmetry-breaking
bifurcation. We find that there exists an optimal confinement for migration. We
provide numerical results as well as scaling laws. This study raises the
question of the relevance of these scenarios to complex situations encountered
in vivo.
