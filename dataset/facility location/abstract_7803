We discuss how to locate critical points in the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) universality class by means of
gap-scaling analyses. While accurately determining such points using gap
extrapolation procedures is usually challenging and inaccurate due to the
exponentially small value of the gap in the vicinity of the critical point, we
show that a generic gap-scaling analysis, including the effects of logarithmic
corrections, provides very accurate estimates of BKT transition points in a
variety of spin and fermionic models. As a first example, we show how the
scaling procedure, combined with density-matrix-renormalization-group
simulations, performs extremely well in a non-integrable spin-$3/2$ XXZ model,
which is known to exhibit strong finite-size effects. We then analyze the
extended Hubbard model, whose BKT transition has been debated, finding results
that are consistent with previous studies based on the scaling of the
Luttinger-liquid parameter. Finally, we investigate an anisotropic extended
Hubbard model, for which we present the first estimates of the BKT transition
line based on large-scale density-matrix-renormalization-group simulations. Our
work demonstrates how gap-scaling analyses can help to locate accurately and
efficiently BKT critical points, without relying on model-dependent scaling
assumptions.
