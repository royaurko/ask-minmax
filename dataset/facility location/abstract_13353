An analysis of the influences of a high frequency (30 kHz) alternating
current on the uniformity of the magnetic field (B) in an electromagnetic
casting (EMC) mould is investigated by means of parametric numerical
simulations where the induction current (Js) varies in the range of [1 to 10000
A]. The results show that values of the magnetic flux density along the casting
direction (Bz) near the square mould corners are small, compared to those at
the other locations where Js < 10000 A, and that the magnitude of Bz increases
with an increased induction current (Js). However, it is shown that, for the
EMC mould structure investigated in this paper, the variations of Js have no
significant influences on the uniformity of the magnetic field, especially for
the regions near molten steel level. Moreover, the effective acting region
(Rbz) for the critical magnetic field (Bzc) is first introduced in this paper,
which opens an interesting topic for future research.
