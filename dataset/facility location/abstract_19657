As part of the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey we have
investigated the rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) properties of a sample of more
than 4800 Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) in the Great Observatories Origins Deep
Survey North field. Most LBGs are not detected individually, but we do detect a
sub-sample of 12 objects at 0.7 < z < 1.6 and one object at z ~ 2.0.
  The ones detected by Herschel SPIRE have redder observed NUV-U and U-R colors
than the others, while the undetected ones have colors consistent with average
LBGs at z > 2.5. The UV-to-FIR spectral energy distributions of the objects
detected in the rest-frame FIR are investigated using the code CIGALE to
estimate physical parameters. We find that LBGs detected by SPIRE are high
mass, luminous infrared galaxies.
  It appears that LBGs are located in a triangle-shaped region in the A_FUV vs.
Log L_FUV diagram limited by A_FUV=0 at the bottom and by a diagonal following
the temporal evolution of the most massive galaxies from the bottom-right to
the top-left of the diagram. This upper envelop can be used as upper limits for
the UV dust attenuation as a function of L_FUV}. The limits of this region are
well explained using a closed-box model, where the chemical evolution of
galaxies produces metals, which in turn lead to higher dust attenuation when
the galaxies age.
