A method for the calculation of the luminosity for the proton-nucleus
collisions based on the quasi-free proton-proton scattering is presented. As an
example of application the integrated luminosity for the scattering of protons
off the deuteron target is determined for the experiment of the quasi-free pn
--> pneta reaction performed by means of the COSY-11 facility.
