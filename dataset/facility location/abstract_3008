We bound the location of roots of polynomials that have nonnegative
coefficients with respect to a fixed but arbitrary basis of the vector space of
polynomials of degree at most $d$. For this, we interpret the basis polynomials
as vector fields in the real plane, and at each point in the plane analyze the
combinatorics of the Gale dual vector configuration. This approach permits us
to incorporate arbitrary linear equations and inequalities among the
coefficients in a unified manner to obtain more precise bounds on the location
of roots. We apply our technique to bound the location of roots of Ehrhart and
chromatic polynomials. Finally, we give an explanation for the clustering seen
in plots of roots of random polynomials.
