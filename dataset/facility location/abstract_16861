We give efficient data-oblivious algorithms for several fundamental geometric
problems that are relevant to geographic information systems, including planar
convex hulls and all-nearest neighbors. Our methods are "data-oblivious" in
that they don't perform any data-dependent operations, with the exception of
operations performed inside low-level blackbox circuits having a constant
number of inputs and outputs. Thus, an adversary who observes the control flow
of one of our algorithms, but who cannot see the inputs and outputs to the
blackbox circuits, cannot learn anything about the input or output. This
behavior makes our methods applicable to secure multiparty computation (SMC)
protocols for geographic data used in location-based services. In SMC
protocols, multiple parties wish to perform a computation on their combined
data without revealing individual data to the other parties. For instance, our
methods can be used to solve a problem posed by Du and Atallah, where Alice has
a set, A, of m private points in the plane, Bob has another set, B, of n
private points in the plane, and Alice and Bob want to jointly compute the
convex hull of A u B without disclosing any more information than what can be
derived from the answer. In particular, neither Alice nor Bob want to reveal
any of their respective points that are in the interior of the convex hull of A
u B.
