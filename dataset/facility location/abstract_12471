This volume contains the proceedings of ACL2 2011, the International Workshop
on the ACL2 Theorem Prover and its Applications. The workshop was held in
Austin, Texas, USA, on November 3-4 2011. ACL2 2011 is the tenth in a series of
workshops on the ACL2 Theorem Prover and its Applications. The workshop was
co-located with the eleventh Conference on Formal Methods in Computer Aided
Design (FMCAD'11). The ACL2 Workshop series provide a major technical forum for
researchers to present and discuss improvements and extensions to the theorem
prover, comparisons of ACL2 with other systems, and applications of ACL2 in
formal verification or formalized mathematics. Workshops have been held at
approxiamately 18 month intervals since 1999. ACL2 is the most recent
incarnation of the Boyer-Moore family of theorem provers, for which, Robert
Boyer, Matt Kaufmann and J Strother Moore received the 2005 ACM Software System
Award. It is state-of-the-art automated reasoning system that has been
successfully used in academia, government and industry for specification and
verification of computing systems. More details can be found in the proceedings
and on the workshop web page (www.cs.ru.nl/~julien/acl2-11/).
