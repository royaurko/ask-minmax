The main goal of the GEOMIR2K9 project is to create a software program that
is able to find similar scenic images clustered by geographical location and
sorted by similarity based only on their visual content. The user should be
able to input a query image, based on this given query image the program should
find relevant visual content and present this to the user in a meaningful way.
Technically the goal for the GEOMIR2K9 project is twofold. The first of these
two goals is to create a basic low level visual information retrieval system.
This includes feature extraction, post processing of the feature data and
classification/ clustering based on similarity with a strong focus on scenic
images. The second goal of this project is to provide the user with a novel and
suitable interface and visualization method so that the user may interact with
the retrieved images in a natural and meaningful way.
