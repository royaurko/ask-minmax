The parameters for a 30 GeV test beam are outlined for use with an undulator
in the FFTB tunnel where the LCLS will eventually be housed. It is proposed to
use the SLAC linac and damping rings in their present mode of operation for PEP
II injection, where 30 GeV beams are also delivered at 10 Hz to the FFTB. High
peak currents are obtained with the addition of a second bunch compressor in
the linac. In order to minimize the synchrotron radiation induced emittance
growth in the bunch compressor it is necessary to locate the new bunch
compressor at the low-energy end of the linac, just after the damping rings.
The bunch compressor is a duplicate of the LCLS chicane-style bunch compressor.
This test beam would provide an exciting possibility to test LCLS undulator
sections and provide a unique high-brightness source of incoherent X-rays and
begin developing the LCLS experimental station. The facility will also act as a
much needed accelerator test bed for the production, diagnostics and tuning of
very short bunches in preparation for the LCLS after the photo injector is
commissioned.
