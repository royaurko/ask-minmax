We present the results from an analysis of Hubble Space Telescope High
Resolution Camera data for the Large Magellanic Cloud microlensing event
MACHO-LMC-5. By determining the parallax and proper motion of this object we
find that the lens is an M dwarf star at a distance of 578(+65/-53)pc with a
proper motion of 21.39 +/- 0.04 mas/yr. Based on the kinematics and location of
this star it more likely to be part of the Galactic thick disk than thin disk
population. We confirm that the microlensing event LMC-5 is a jerk-parallax
event.
