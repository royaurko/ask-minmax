The vertical absolute fluxes of atmospheric muons and muon charge ratio have
been measured precisely at different geomagnetic locations by using the BESS
spectrometer. The observations had been performed at sea level (30 m above sea
level) in Tsukuba, Japan, and at 360 m above sea level in Lynn Lake, Canada.
The vertical cutoff rigidities in Tsukuba (36.2 N, 140.1 E) and in Lynn Lake
(56.5 N, 101.0 W) are 11.4 GV and 0.4 GV, respectively. We have obtained
vertical fluxes of positive and negative muons in a momentum range from 0.6 to
20 GeV/c with systematic errors less than 3 % in both measurements. By
comparing the data collected at two different geomagnetic latitudes, we have
seen an effect of cutoff rigidity. The dependence on the atmospheric pressure
and temperature, and the solar modulation effect have been also clearly
observed. We also clearly observed the decrease of charge ratio of muons at low
momentum side with at higher cutoff rigidity region.
