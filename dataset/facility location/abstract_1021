Using the Crystal Barrel(CB)/TAPS detector system at the ELSA accelerator
facility in Bonn the \eta' photoproduction off nuclei (C, Ca, Nb and Pb) was
studied via the hadronic decay channel \eta' -> \pi^0\pi^0\eta . Recent results
on the in-medium properties of the \eta'-meson, derived from the transparency
ratio measurements, are presented. The absorption of the \eta'-meson in nuclear
matter is compared to the properties of other mesons (\eta, \omega).
