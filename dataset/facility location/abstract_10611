We describe a virtual response method and device. It consists of an
analog-to-digital converter, a digital-to-analog converter, and a computer and
utilizes a searchable response table (RT) pre-stored in the computer to respond
to electronic signals. The RT is constructed by measuring the input-output
relationship of a real response machine followed by sorting it per input data.
To respond, incoming signal is converted to digital data whose position in the
RT is then located. The response signal is determined by localized numerical
calculation around that position. This method has many advantages: cheap, fast,
universal, stable with less noises and errors.
