In the high field region at the head of a discharge streamer, the electron
energy distribution develops a long tail. In negative streamers, these
electrons can run away and contribute to energetic processes such as
terrestrial gamma-ray and electron flashes. Moreover, electron density
fluctuations can accelerate streamer branching. To track energies and locations
of single electrons in relevant regions, we have developed a 3D hybrid model
that couples a particle model in the region of high fields and low electron
densities with a fluid model in the rest of the domain. Here we validate our 3D
hybrid model on a 3D (super-)particle model for negative streamers in
overvolted gaps, and we show that it almost reaches the computational
efficiency of a 3D fluid model. We also show that the extended fluid model
approximates the particle and the hybrid model well until stochastic
fluctuations become important, while the classical fluid model underestimates
velocities and ionization densities. We compare density fluctuations and the
onset of branching between the models, and we compare the front velocities with
an analytical approximation.
