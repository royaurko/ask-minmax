CCD BVRI photometry is presented for type Ia supernova 2008gy. The light
curves match the template curves for fast-declining SN Ia, but the colors
appear redder than average, and the SN may also be slightly subluminous. SN
2008gy is found to be located far outside the boundaries of three nearest
galaxies, each of them has nearly equal probability to be the host galaxy.
