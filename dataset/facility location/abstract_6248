Cold fermionic atoms are known to enter the universal strongly coupled regime
as their scattering length $a$ gets large compared to the inter-particle
distances. Recent experimental data provide important critical parameters of
such system. We argue that quarks may enter the same regime due to marginal
binding of diquarks, and if so one can use its universality in order to deduce
such properties as the slope of the critical line of color superconductivity,
 $dT_c/d\mu$. We further discuss limitations on the critical temperature itself
and conclude that it is limited by $T_c<70\, MeV$.
