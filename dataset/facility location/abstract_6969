Using data from STEREO and SOHO spacecraft, we show that temporal
organization of energy release events in the quiet solar corona is close to
random, in contrast to the clustered behavior of flaring times in solar active
regions. The locations of the quiet-Sun events follow the meso- and
supergranulation pattern of the underling photosphere. Together with earlier
reports of the scale-free event size statistics, our findings suggest that
quiet solar regions responsible for bulk coronal heating operate in a driven
self-organized critical state, possibly involving long-range Alfv\'{e}nic
interactions.
