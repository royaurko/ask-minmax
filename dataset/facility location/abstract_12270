We announce the first discovery of a bent double lobe radio source (DLRS) in
a known cluster filament. The bent DLRS is found at a distance of 3.4 Mpc from
the center of the rich galaxy cluster, Abell~1763. We derive a bend angle
alpha=25deg, and infer that the source is most likely seen at a viewing angle
of Phi=10deg. From measuring the flux in the jet between the core and further
lobe and assuming a spectral index of 1, we calculate the minimum pressure in
the jet, (8.0+-3.2)x10^-13 dyn/cm^2, and derive constraints on the
intra-filament medium (IFM) assuming the bend of the jet is due to ram
pressure. We constrain the IFM to be between (1-20)x10^-29 gm/cm^3. This is
consistent with recent direct probes of the IFM and theoretical models. These
observations justify future searches for bent double lobe radio sources located
several Mpc from cluster cores, as they may be good markers of super cluster
filaments.
