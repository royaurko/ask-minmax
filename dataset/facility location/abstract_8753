We have searched for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in the BATSE DISCLA data over a
time period of 5.9 years. We employ a trigger requiring an excess of at least 5
sigma over background for at least two modules in the 50-300 keV range. After
excluding certain geographic locations of the satellite, we are left with 4485
triggers. Based on sky positions, we exclude triggers close to the sun, to Cyg
X-1, to Nova Persei 1992 and the repeater SGR 1806-20, while these sources were
active. We accept 1013 triggers that correspond to GRBs in the BATSE catalog,
and after visual inspection of the time profiles classify 378 triggers as
cosmic GRBs. We denote the 1391 GRBs so selected as the "BD2 sample". The BD2
sample effectively represents 2.003 years of full sky coverage for a rate of
694 GRBs per year. Euclidean V/Vmax values have been derived through
simulations in which each GRB is removed in distance until the detection
algorithm does not produce a trigger. The BD2 sample produces a mean value
<V/Vmax> = 0.334 +- 0.008.
