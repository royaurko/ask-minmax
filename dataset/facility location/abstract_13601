By combining density functional theory and nonequilibrium Green's function,
we study the electronic and transport properties of monolayer black phosphorus
nanoribbons (PNRs). First, we investigate the band-gap of PNRs and its
modulation by the ribbon width and an external transverse electric feld. Our
calculations indicate a giant Stark effect in PNRs, which can switch on
transport channels of semiconducting PNRs under low bias, inducing an
insulator-metal-transition. Next, we study the transport channels in PNRs via
the calculations of the current density and local electron transmission
pathway. In contrast to graphene and MoS_2 nanoribbons, the carrier transport
channels under low bias are mainly located in the interior of both armchair and
zigzag PNRs, and immune to a small amount of edge defects. Lastly, a device of
the PNR-based dual-gate feld-effect-transistor, with high on/off?ratio of 10^3,
is proposed based on the giant electric feld tuning effect.
