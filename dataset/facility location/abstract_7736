This research proposes a computation approach to address the evaluation of
end product machining accuracy in elliptical surfaced helical pipe bending
using 6dof parallel manipulator as a pipe bender. The target end product is
wearable metal muscle supporters used in build-to-order welfare product
manufacturing. This paper proposes a product testing model that mainly corrects
the surface direction estimation errors of existing least squares ellipse
fittings, followed by arc length and central angle evaluations. This
post-machining modelling requires combination of reverse rotations and
translations to a specific location before accuracy evaluation takes place,
i.e. the reverse comparing to pre-machining product modelling. This specific
location not only allows us to compute surface direction but also the amount of
excessive surface twisting as a rotation angle about a specified axis, i.e.
quantification of surface torsion. At first we experimented three ellipse
fitting methods such as, two least-squares fitting methods with Bookstein
constraint and Trace constraint, and one non- linear least squares method using
Gauss-Newton algorithm. From fitting results, we found that using Trace
constraint is more reliable and designed a correction filter for surface
torsion observation. Finally we apply 2D total least squares line fitting
method with a rectification filter for surface direction detection.
