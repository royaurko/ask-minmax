Both ghost imaging (GI) and ghost imaging via compressive sampling (GICS) can
nonlocally image an object. We report the influence of spatial transverse
coherence property of a thermal source on GI and GICS and show that, using the
same acquisition numbers, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of images recovered
by GI will be reduced while the quality of reconstructed images will be
enhanced for GICS as the spatial transverse coherence lengths located on the
object plane are decreased. Differences between GI and GICS, methods to further
improve the quality and image extraction efficiency of GICS, and its potential
applications are also discussed.
