We present the first results of a large spectroscopic survey of candidate
globular clusters located in the extreme outskirts of the nearby M31 galaxy. We
obtained low resolution spectra of 48 targets selected from the XSC of 2MASS,
as in Galleti et al. (2005). The observed candidates have been robustly
classified according to their radial velocity and by verifying their
extended/point-source nature from ground-based optical images. Among the 48
observed candidates clusters we found 5 genuine remote globular clusters. One
of them has been already identified independently by Mackey et al. (2007),
their GC1; the other four are completely new discoveries: B516, B517, B518,
B519. The newly discovered clusters lie at projected distance 40 kpc<~R_p<~100
kpc from the center of M31, and have absolute integrated magnitude
-9.5<M_V<-7.5. For all the observed clusters we have measured the strongest
Lick indices and we have obtained spectroscopic metallicity estimates.
Mackey-GC1, Martin-GC1, B517 and B518 have spectra typical of old and metal
poor globular clusters ([Fe/H]<~ -1.3); B519 appears old but quite metal-rich
([Fe/H]~-0.5); B516 presents very strong Balmer absorption lines: if this is
indeed a cluster it should have a relatively young age (likely <2 Gyr). The
present analysis nearly doubles the number of M31 globulars at R_p> 40 kpc. At
odds with the Milky Way, M31 appears to have a significant population of very
bright globular clusters in its extreme outskirts.
