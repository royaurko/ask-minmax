We apply a simple analytical criterion for locating critical temperatures to
Potts models on square and triangular lattices. In the self-dual case, i.e. on
the square lattice we reproduce known exact values of the critical temperature
and derive the internal energy of the model at the critical point. For the
Potts model on the triangular lattice we obtain very good numerical estimate of
the critical temperature and also of the internal energy at the critical point.
