Our landscape has been shaped by man throughout the millennia. It still
contains many clues to how it was used in the past giving us insights into
ancient cultures and their everyday life. Our summer school uses archaeology
and astronomy as a focus for effective out-of-classroom learning experiences.
It demonstrates how a field trip can be used to its full potential by utilising
ancient monuments as outdoor classrooms. This article shows how such a summer
school can be embedded into the secondary curriculum; giving advice, example
activities, locations to visit, and outlines the impact this work has had.
