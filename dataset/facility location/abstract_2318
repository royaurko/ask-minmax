In the recently commissioned superconducting RF cavity test facility at
Fermilab (SCTF), a 325 MHz, {\beta}=0.22 superconducting single-spoke resonator
(SSR1) has been tested for the first time with its input power coupler.
Previously, this cavity had been tested CW with a low power, high Qext test
coupler; first as a bare cavity in the Fermilab Vertical Test Stand and then
fully dressed in the SCTF. For the tests described here, the design input
coupler with Qext ~ 106 was used. Pulsed power was provided by a Toshiba E3740A
2.5 MW klystron.
