We present new arcminute resolution radio images of the low surface
brightness radio source PKS B1400-33 that is located in the poor cluster Abell
S753. The observations consist of 330 MHz VLA, 843 MHz MOST and 1398 and 2378
MHz ATCA data. These new images, with higher surface brightness sensitivity
than previous observations, reveal that the large scale structure consists of
extended filamentary emission bounded by edge-brightened rims. The source is
offset on one side of symmetrically distributed X-ray emission that is centered
on the dominant cluster galaxy NGC 5419. PKS B1400-33 is a rare example of a
relic in a poor cluster with radio properties unlike those of most relics and
halos observed in cluster environments.
  The diffuse source appears to have had an unusual origin and we discuss
possible mechanisms. We examine whether the source could be re-energized relic
radio plasma or a buoyant synchrotron bubble that is a relic of activity in NGC
5419. The more exciting prospect is that the source is relic plasma preserved
in the cluster gaseous environment following the chance injection of a radio
lobe into the ICM as a result of activity in a galaxy at the periphery of the
cluster.
