On 4 January 2007 the contributor published the article Wireless Transfer of
Electricity in Outer Space in http://arxiv.org wherein he offered and
researched a new revolutionary method of transferring electric energy in space.
In that same article, he offered a new engine which produces a large thrust
without throwing away large amounts of reaction mass (unlike the conventional
rocket engine).
  In the current article, the contributor develops the theory of this kind of
impulse engine and computes a sample project which shows the big possibilities
opened by this new AB-Space Engine. The AB-Space Engine gets the energy from
ground-mounted power; a planet electric station can transfer electricity up to
1000 millions (and more) of kilometers by plasma wires. Author shows that
AB-Space Engine can produce thrust of 10 tons (and more). That can accelerate a
space ship to some thousands of kilometers/second. AB-Space Engine has a
staggering specific impulse owing to the very small mass expended. The AB-Space
Engine reacts not by expulsion of its own mass (unlike rocket engine) but
against the mass of its planet of origin (located perhaps a thousand of
millions of kilometers away) through the magnetic field of its plasma cable.
For creating this plasma cable the AB-Space Engine spends only some kg of
hydrogen.
