We study the electronic transport in a graphene-based
superconductor-normal(graphene)-superconductor (SNS) junction by use of the
Dirac-Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. We consider the properties of tunneling
conductance through an undoped strip of graphene with heavily doped
superconducting electrodes in the dirty limit. We find that spectrum of Andreev
bound states are modified in the presence of single localized defect in the
bulk. The minimum tunneling conductance remains the same and this result
doesn't depend on the actual location of the imperfection.
