We present intermediate dispersion optical spectroscopy for seven very
low-mass stars in the alpha Per open cluster with spectral types between M3 and
M6, including the brown dwarf candidate of Rebolo et al. (1992). Our radial
velocity measurements are found to be generally consistent with the mean
cluster velocity to within the measurement errors. Halpha equivalent widths
have been measured and compared to previous published data for other known
members of the cluster. A turnover in chromospheric activity around spectral
type M3-M4 is observed. The brown dwarf candidate, located in the cool side of
the turnover, is confirmed to exhibit a strong Halpha variability. It is the
coolest alpha Per candidate member for which spectra are available and for
which chromospheric activity has been measured. Using the LiI doublet at lambda
6707.8 angstroms, we derive upper limits to the atmospheric Li abundance in the
sample and discuss them in the context of the most recent stellar evolutionary
tracks. The non-detection of the LiI line in the spectrum of the brown dwarf
candidate implies a mass greater than 0.08 solar masses, and therefore it is
not a substellar object. However, its position in the HR diagram implies that
this star is indeed very close to the substellar limit.
