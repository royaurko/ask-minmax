We carried out white-light observations of the total solar eclipse on 13
November 2012 at two sites, where the totality occurred 35 minutes apart. We
caught an ongoing coronal mass ejection (CME) and a pre-CME loop structure just
before the eruption in the height range between 1-2 R_sun. The source region of
CMEs was revealed to be in this height range, where the material and the
magnetic field of CMEs were located before the eruption. This height range
includes the gap between the extreme ultraviolet observations of the low corona
and the spaceborne white-light observations of the high corona, but the eclipse
observation shows that this height range is essentially important to study the
CME initiation. The eclipse observation is basically just a snapshot of CMEs,
but it indicates that future continuous observations of CMEs within this height
range are promising.
