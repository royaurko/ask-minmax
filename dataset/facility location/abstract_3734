The Accurate fission data for nuclear safety (AlFONS) project aims at high
precision measurements of fission yields, using the renewed IGISOL mass
separator facility in combination with a new high current light ion cyclotron
at the University of Jyvaskyla. The 30 MeV proton beam will be used to create
fast and thermal neutron spectra for the study of neutron induced fission
yields. Thanks to a series of mass separating elements, culminating with the
JYFLTRAP Penning trap, it is possible to achieve a mass resolving power in the
order of a few hundred thousands.
  In this paper we present the experimental setup and the design of a neutron
converter target for IGISOL. The goal is to have a flexible design. For studies
of exotic nuclei far from stability a high neutron flux (10^12 neutrons/s) at
energies 1 - 30 MeV is desired while for reactor applications neutron spectra
that resembles those of thermal and fast nuclear reactors are preferred. It is
also desirable to be able to produce (semi-)monoenergetic neutrons for
benchmarking and to study the energy dependence of fission yields.
  The scientific program is extensive and is planed to start in 2013 with a
measurement of isomeric yield ratios of proton induced fission in uranium. This
will be followed by studies of independent yields of thermal and fast neutron
induced fission of various actinides.
