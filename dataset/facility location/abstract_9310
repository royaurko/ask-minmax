Microquasars are promising candidates to emit high-energy gamma-rays.
Moreover, statistical studies show that variable EGRET sources at low galactic
latitudes could be associated with the inner spiral arms. The variable nature
and the location in the Galaxy of the high-mass microquasars, concentrated in
the galactic plane and within 55 degrees from the galactic center, give to
these objects the status of likely counterparts of the variable low-latitude
EGRET sources. We consider in this work the two most variable EGRET sources at
low-latitudes: 3EG J1828+0142 and 3EG J1735-1500, proposing a microquasar model
to explain the EGRET data in consistency with the observations at lower
energies (from radio frequencies to soft gamma-rays) within the EGRET error
box.
