The TAC (Turkish Accelerator Center) IR FEL Oscillator facility, which has
been supported by Turkish State Planning Organization (SPO) since 2006, will be
based on a 15-40 MeV electron linac accompanying two different undulators with
2.5 cm and 9 cm periods in order to obtain IR FEL ranging between 2-250
microns. The electron linac will consist of two sequenced modules, each housing
two 9-cell superconducting TESLA cavities for cw operation. It is planned that
the TAC IR FEL facility will be completed in 2012 at Golbasi campus of Ankara
University. This facility will give an opportunity to the scientists and
industry to use FEL in research and development in Turkey and our region. In
this study, the results of optimization studies and present plans about
construction process of the facility are presented.
