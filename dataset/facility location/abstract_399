Based on the concept of self-decomposable random variables we discuss the
application of a model for a pair of dependent Poisson processes to energy
facilities. Due to the resulting structure of the jump events we can see the
self-decomposability as a form of cointegration among jumps. In the context of
energy facilities, the application of our approach to model power or gas
dynamics and to evaluate transportation assets seen as spread options is
straightforward. We study the applicability of our methodology first assuming a
Merton market model with two underlying assets; in a second step we consider
price dynamics driven by an exponential mean-reverting Geometric
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck plus compound Poisson that are commonly used in the energy
field. In this specific case we propose a price spot dynamics for each
underlying that has the advantage of being treatable to find non-arbitrage
conditions. In particular we can find close-form formulas for vanilla options
so that the price and the Greeks of spread options can be calculated in close
form using the Margrabe formula (if the strike is zero) or some other well
known approximation.
