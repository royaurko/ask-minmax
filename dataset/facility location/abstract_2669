Data science is an emerging interdisciplinary field that combines elements of
mathematics, statistics, computer science, and knowledge in a particular
application domain for the purpose of extracting meaningful information from
the increasingly sophisticated array of data available in many settings. These
data tend to be non-traditional, in the sense that they are often live, large,
complex, and/or messy. A first course in statistics at the undergraduate level
typically introduces students with a variety of techniques to analyze small,
neat, and clean data sets. However, whether they pursue more formal training in
statistics or not, many of these students will end up working with data that is
considerably more complex, and will need facility with statistical computing
techniques. More importantly, these students require a framework for thinking
structurally about data. We describe an undergraduate course in a liberal arts
environment that provides students with the tools necessary to apply data
science. The course emphasizes modern, practical, and useful skills that cover
the full data analysis spectrum, from asking an interesting question to
acquiring, managing, manipulating, processing, querying, analyzing, and
visualizing data, as well communicating findings in written, graphical, and
oral forms.
