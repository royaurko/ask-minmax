Gross chromosomal rearrangements have the potential to be evolutionarily
advantageous to an adapting organism. The generation of a hybrid species
increases opportunity for recombination by bringing together two homologous
genomes. We sought to define the location of genomic rearrangements in three
strains of Saccharomyces pastorianus, a natural lager-brewing yeast hybrid of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces eubayanus, using whole genome
shotgun sequencing. Each strain of S. pastorianus has lost species-specific
portions of its genome and has undergone extensive recombination, producing
chimeric chromosomes. We predicted 30 breakpoints that we confirmed at the
single nucleotide level by designing species-specific primers that flank each
breakpoint, and then sequencing the PCR product. These rearrangements are the
result of recombination between areas of homology between the two subgenomes,
rather than repetitive elements such as transposons or tRNAs. Interestingly,
28/30 S. cerevisiae- S. eubayanus recombination breakpoints are located within
genic regions, generating chimeric genes. Furthermore we show evidence for the
reuse of two breakpoints, located in HSP82 and KEM1, in strains of proposed
independent origin.
