An extremely soft X-ray excess throughout galaxy clusters has been claimed as
a new feature of these sytems, with important physical implications. We have
reexamined this feature in the five clusters for which it has been discussed,
using the most recent X-ray absorption cross sections, X-ray data processing
techniques, and a consistent set of HI data. For the Virgocluster, we find that
the spectrum can be fit with a single-temperature thermal plasma and with an
X-ray absorption column that is not significantly different than the Galactic
HI column. The result for Abell 1367, Abell 1656 (Coma), Abell 1795, and Abell
2199 is similar in that the difference betweenthe X-ray absorption column and
the Galactic HI column is less than 3-sigma for He/H = 0.09, and for He/H =
0.10 only one cluster location leads to a Galactic HI column more than 3-sigma
above the X-ray absorption column (Coma, with one location with a 3.6-sigma
difference). We conclude that there is no strong evidence for the extremely
soft X-ray excess in galaxy clusters.
