Powered operation of Cryomodule 1 (CM-1) at the Fermilab SRF Beam Test
Facility began in late 2010. Since then a series of tests first on the eight
individual cavities and then the full cryomodule have been performed. We report
on the results of these tests and lessons learned which will have an impact on
future module testing at Fermilab.
