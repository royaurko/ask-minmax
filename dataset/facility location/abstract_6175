A number of recent papers have applied the AdS/CFT correspondence to a
strong-coupling calculation of the medium-induced radiative parton energy loss
in nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC. The predicted value of the "jet
quenching parameter" q, however, is rather small compared to the experimental
results. For hot N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, certain marginal
deformations can have the effect of enhancing q. This result is highly
sensitive to the location of the fundamental string's endpoints in the internal
space.
