H-index, proposed by Hirsch is a good indicator of the impact of a
scientist's research. When evaluating departments, institutions or labs, the
importance of h-index can be further enhanced when properly calibrated for
size. Particularly acute is the issue of federally funded facilities whose
number of actively publishing scientists frequently dwarfs that of academic
departments. Recently Molinari and Molinari developed a methodology that shows
the h-index has a universal growth rate for large numbers of papers, allowing
for meaningful comparisons between institutions.
  An additional challenge when comparing large institutions is that fields have
distinct internal cultures, with different typical rates of publication and
citation; biology is more highly cited than physics, which is more highly cited
than engineering. For this reason, this study has focused on the physical
sciences, engineering, and technology, and has excluded bio-medical research.
Comparisons between individual disciplines are reported here to provide
contextual framework. Generally, it was found that the universal growth rate of
Molinari and Molinari holds well across all the categories considered,
testifying to the robustness of both their growth law and our results.
  The overall goal here is to set the highest standard of comparison for
federal investment in science; comparisons are made with the nations preeminent
private and public institutions. We find that many among the national
facilities compare favorably in research impact with the nations leading
universities.
