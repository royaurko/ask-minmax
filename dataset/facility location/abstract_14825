B and V photometry has been obtained for variable stars in the northeast arm
of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Periods and lightcurves have been
determined for 237 periodic variables, including 201 Cepheids, 68 of which are
newly discovered. Fundamental mode Cepheids and first overtone mode Cepheids
are generally well separated in the B,V color-magnitude diagram, with the
latter having bluer mean colors than the former. The Cepheid period-color
relationship for this outlying SMC field is indistinguishable from that seen in
more centrally located SMC fields, and is bluer than theoretical predictions.
The red edge to the populated portion of the instability strip shifts to bluer
colors for fainter Cepheids. There is support from our sample for a previously
reported steepening in the slope of the period-luminosity relation for
fundamental mode Cepheids near a period of 2 days. The Cepheids of the
northeast arm may be closer to us than are those of the main body of the SMC,
but the difference is smaller than or equal to about 4 kpc, comparable to the
tidal radius of the SMC.
