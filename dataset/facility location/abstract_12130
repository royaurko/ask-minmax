BATATA is a hodoscope comprising three X-Y planes of plastic scintillation
detectors. This system of buried counters is complemented by an array of 3
water-Cherenkov detectors, located at the vertices of an equilateral triangle
with 200 m sides. This small surface array is triggered by extensive air
showers. The BATATA detector will be installed at the centre of the AMIGA
array, where it will be used to quantify the electromagnetic contamination of
the muon signal as a function of depth, and so to validate, in situ, the
numerical estimates made of the optimal depth for the AMIGA muon detectors.
BATATA will also serves as a prototype to aid the design of these detectors.
