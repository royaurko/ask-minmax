Diluted mean-field models are graphical models in which the geometry of
interactions is determined by a sparse random graph or hypergraph. Based on a
non-rigorous but analytic approach called the "cavity method", physicists have
predicted that in many diluted mean-field models a phase transition occurs as
the inverse temperature grows from $0$ to $\infty$. In this paper we establish
the existence and asymptotic location of this so-called condensation phase
transition in the random hypergraph $2$-coloring problem.
