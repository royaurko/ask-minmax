We detected recent star formation in nearby early-type galaxies located in
low density environments, with GALEX Ultraviolet (UV) imaging. Signatures of
star formation may be present in the nucleus and in outer rings/arm like
structures. Our study suggests that such star formation may be induced by
different triggering mechanisms, such as the inner secular evolution driven by
bars, and minor accretion phenomena. We investigate the nature of the (FUV-NUV)
color vs. Mg2 correlation, and suggest that it relates to "downsizing" in
galaxy formation.
