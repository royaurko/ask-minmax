The FRIB (Facility for Rare Isotope Beams) Theory Users Group participated in
the Joint ATLAS-HRIBF-NSCL-FRIB SuperUsers Meeting, hosted by Michigan State
University August 18-20, 2011. Prior to the meeting a survey of the FRIB Theory
Users Group was conducted to assess the health of the low-energy nuclear theory
community and to identify perceived areas of need, in anticipation of the new
demands on theory that will accompany FRIB. Meeting discussions focused on
survey results and on possible responses. These discussions are summarized
here.
