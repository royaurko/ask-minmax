An analysis of recently reported results of XMM-Newton observations of AE Aqr
within a hypothesis that the detected X-ray source is located inside the Roche
lobe of the white dwarf is presented. I show this hypothesis to be inconsistent
with the currently adopted model of mass-transfer in the system. Possible
solutions of this problem are briefly discussed.
