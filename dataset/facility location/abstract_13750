In this work we analyze the architecture of real urban mobility networks from
the multiplex perspective. In particular, based on empirical data about the
mobility patterns in the cities of Bogot\'a and Medell\'{\i}n, each city is
represented by six multiplex networks, each one representing the
origin-destination trips performed by a subset of the population corresponding
to a particular socioeconomic status. The nodes of each multiplex are the
different urban locations whereas links represent the existence of a trip from
one node (origin) to another (destination). On the other hand, the different
layers of each multiplex correspond to the different existing transportation
modes. By exploiting the characterization of multiplex transportation networks
combining different transportation modes, we aim at characterizing the mobility
patterns of each subset of the population. Our results show that the
socioeconomic characteristics of the population have an extraordinary impact in
the layer organization of these multiplex systems.
