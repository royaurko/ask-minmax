It is estimated that a star brighter than visual magnitude 17 is undergoing a
detectable gravitational microlensing event, somewhere on the sky, at any given
time. It is assumed that both lenses and sources are normal stars drawn from a
standard Bahcall-Soneira model of our Galaxy. Furthermore, over the time scale
of a year, a star 15th magnitude or brighter should undergo a detectable
gravitational lens amplification. Detecting and studying the microlensing event
rate among the brightest 10$^8$ stars could yield a better understanding of
Galactic stellar and dark matter distributions. Diligent tracking of bright
microlensing events with even small telescopes might detect planets orbiting
these stellar lenses.
