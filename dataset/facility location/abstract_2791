We propose an exact method for locating the zeros of the Jost function for
analytic potentials in the complex momentum--plane. We further extend the
method to the complex angular--momentum plane to provide the Regge
trajectories. It is shown, by using several examples, that highly accurate
results for extremely wide as well as for extremely narrow resonances with or
without the presence of the Coulomb interaction can be obtained.
