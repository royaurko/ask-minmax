Specialized Monte Carlo methods are nowadays routinely employed, in
combination with thermodynamic integration (TI), to locate phase boundaries of
classical many-particle systems. This is especially useful for the fluid-solid
transition, where a critical point does not exist and both phases may
notoriously go deeply metastable. Using the Lennard-Jones model for
demonstration, we hereby investigate on the alternate possibility of tracing
reasonably accurate transition lines directly by integrating the pressure
equation of state computed in a canonical-ensemble simulation with local moves.
The recourse to this method would become a necessity when the stable crystal
structure is not known. We show that, rather counterintuitively, metastability
problems can be alleviated by reducing (rather than increasing) the size of the
system. In particular, the location of liquid-vapor coexistence can exactly be
predicted by just TI. On the contrary, TI badly fails in the solid-liquid
region, where a better assessment (to within 10\% accuracy) of the coexistence
pressure can be made by following the expansion, until melting, of the
defective solid which has previously emerged from the decay of the metastable
liquid.
