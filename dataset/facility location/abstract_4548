The Yang-Lee zeros of the Q-state Potts model on recursive lattices are
studied for non-integer values of Q. Considering 1D lattice as a Bethe lattice
with coordination number equal to two, the location of Yang-Lee zeros of 1D
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Potts models is completely analyzed in
terms of neutral periodical points. Three different regimes for Yang-Lee zeros
are found for Q>1 and 0<Q<1. An exact analytical formula for the equation of
phase transition points is derived for the 1D case. It is shown that Yang-Lee
zeros of the Q-state Potts model on a Bethe lattice are located on arcs of
circles with the radius depending on Q and temperature for Q>1. Complex
magnetic field metastability regions are studied for the Q>1 and 0<Q<1 cases.
The Yang-Lee edge singularity exponents are calculated for both 1D and Bethe
lattice Potts models. The dynamics of metastability regions for different
values of Q is studied numerically.
