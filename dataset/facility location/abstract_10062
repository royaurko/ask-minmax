We present the gravitational action and Hamiltonian for a spatially bounded
region of an eternal black hole. The Hamiltonian is of the general form
$H=H_{+} - H_{-}$, where $H_{+}$ and $H_{-}$ are respectively the Hamiltonians
for the regions $M_+$ and $M_-$ located in the left and right wedges of the
spacetime. We construct explicitly the quasilocal energy for the system and
discuss its dependence on the time direction induced at the boundaries of the
manifold. This paper extends the analysis of Ref.~[1] to spacetimes possesing a
bifurcation surface and two timelike boundaries. The construction suggests that
an interpretation of black hole thermodynamics based on thermofield dynamics
ideas can be generalized beyond perturbations to the gravitational field itself
of a bounded spacetime region (based on the talk presented by E.A. Martinez at
the Lake Louise Winter School on Particle Physics and Cosmology, February
20-26, 1994.)
