The need for Emergency Management continually grows as the population and
exposure to catastrophic failures increase. The ability to offer appropriate
services at these emergency situations can be tackled through group
communication mechanisms. The entities involved in the group communication
include people, organizations, events, locations and essential services. Cloud
computing is a "as a service" style of computing that enables on-demand network
access to a shared pool of resources. So this work focuses on proposing a
social cloud constituting group communication entities using an open source
platform, Eucalyptus. The services are exposed as semantic web services, since
the availability of machine-readable metadata (Ontology) will enable the access
of these services more intelligently. The objective of this paper is to propose
an Ontology-based Emergency Management System in a social cloud and demonstrate
the same using emergency healthcare domain.
