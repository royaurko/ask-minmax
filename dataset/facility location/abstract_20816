Approaches proposed in the literature for the Capacitated Plant Location Problem are compared. The comparison is based on new theoretical and computational results. The main emphasis is on relaxations. In particular, dominance relations among the various relaxations found in the literature are identified. In the computational study, the relaxations are compared as a function of various characteristics of the test problems. Several of these relaxations can be used to generate heuristic feasible solutions that are better than the classical greedy or interchange heuristics, both in computing time and in the quality of the solutions found.
