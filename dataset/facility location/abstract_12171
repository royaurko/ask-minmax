VERITAS is a ground-based gamma-ray observatory that uses the imaging
atmospheric Cherenkov technique and operates in the very high-energy (VHE)
region of the gamma- ray spectrum from 100 GeV to 50 TeV. The observatory
consists of an array of four 12m-diameter imaging atmospheric Cherenkov
telescopes located in southern Arizona, USA. The four-telescope array has been
fully operational since September 2007, and over the last two years, VERITAS
has been operating with high reliability and sensitivity. It is currently one
of the most sensitive VHE observatories. This paper summarizes the status of
VERITAS as of October, 2009, and describes the detection of several new VHE
gamma-ray sources.
