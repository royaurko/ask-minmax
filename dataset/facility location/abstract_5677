We report on two observations of a soft bursting source in 1997 June, whose
time histories and energy spectra are consistent with those of the soft gamma
repeaters. The source can only be localized to an ~3.8 degree long error box in
the direction of the Galactic center, whose area is ~ 80 sq. arcmin. The
location of the source, while not consistent with that of any of the four known
soft repeaters, is consistent with those of several known and possible
supernova remnants.
