We study a sample of 62 Baade's Window (1,-4) K giants that have published
proper motions, radial velocity and metallicity. We construct the velocity
ellipsoids for the metal rich stars and metal poor stars. We find a vertex
deviation characteristic of a non-axisymmetric system. The long axes of the
velocity ellipsoids of two samples point to two nearly perpendicular directions
(lv,bv)=(-65+-9,+14+-9) and (25+-14,-11+-14) respectively. The vertex
deviations of the velocity ellipsoids cannot be consistently explained by ANY
oblate model. We populate orbits in a realistic bar potential with a Gaussian
velocity distribution, allowing us to simulate and interpret observations. We
conclude that the data are consistent with a triaxial bulge pointing towards
(l,b) with l<0 and b=0 as suggested by earlier work. We also predict that low
latitude abs(b)<4 deg bulge fields should show the vertex deviation more
strongly and would therefore be the best locations for future proper motion
studies. The metal rich and metal poor stars appear to occupy the direct boxy
and retrograde loop orbits. The correlations between the metallicity and the
orbit families can develop if the Bulge forms dissipatively on a sufficiently
long time scale. However, it is difficult to reconcile the existence of such
correlations with a violent history for the potential of the inner Galaxy.
