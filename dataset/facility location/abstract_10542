We find power-law behaviors of grain velocity in both propagation and
backscattering in a gravitationally compacted granular chain with nonlinear
contact force. We focus on the leading peak of the velocity signal which
decreases in a power-law $d^{-\alpha}$, where $d$ is the location of the peak,
as the signal goes down. The ratio of backscattered to incident leading
velocity also follows a power-law $d_i^{-\beta}$, where $d_i$ is the depth of
impurity. The up-going backscattered signal is nearly solitary. Therefore, the
overall change of the leading velocity peak is given by the power-law
$d_i^{-(\alpha+\beta)}$. We find $\alpha=0.250$ and $\beta=0.167$ for the
Hertzian contact force.
