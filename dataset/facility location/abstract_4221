The combined effect of the magnetic field background in the form of a
singular vortex and the Dirichlet boundary condition at the location of the
vortex on the vacuum of quantized scalar field is studied. We find the induced
vacuum energy density and current to be periodic functions of the vortex flux
and holomorphic functions of the space dimension.
