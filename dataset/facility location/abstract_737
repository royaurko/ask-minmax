Wavefront Coding has been applied as a means to increase the effective depth
of focus of optical systems. In this note I discuss the potential for this
technique to increase the depth of focus of the LSST and the resulting
advantages for the construction and operation of the facility, as well as
possible drawbacks. It may be possible to apply Wavefront Coding without
changing the current LSST design, in which case Wavefront Coding might merit
further study as a risk mitigation strategy.
