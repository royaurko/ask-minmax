We present a new approach to the analysis of time symmetry in light curves,
such as those in the x-ray at the center of the Scorpius X-1 occultation
debate. Our method uses a new parameterization for such events (the bilogistic
event profile) and provides a clear, physically relevant characterization of
each event's key features. We also demonstrate a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
algorithm to carry out this analysis, including a novel independence chain
configuration for the estimation of each event's location in the light curve.
These tools are applied to the Scorpius X-1 light curves presented in Chang et
al. (2007), providing additional evidence based on the time series that the
events detected thus far are most likely not occultations by TNOs.
