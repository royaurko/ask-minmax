The recent released results of 153.62 ton year exposure of solar neutrino
data in Borexino are here discussed. Borexino is a multi-purpose detector with
large volume liquid scintillator, located in the underground halls of the
Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. The experiment is running since
2007. The first realtime 7Be solar neutrino measurement has been released in
2008. Thanks to the precise detector calibration in 2009, the 7Be flux
measurement has been reached with an accuracy better than 5%. The result
related to the day/night effect in the $^7$Be energy region is also discussed.
These results validate the MSW-LMA model for solar neutrino oscillation.
