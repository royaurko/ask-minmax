Deep underground muon events recorded by the Soudan 2 detector, located at a
depth of 2100 meters of water equivalent, have been used to infer the nuclear
composition of cosmic rays in the "knee" region of the cosmic ray energy
spectrum. The observed muon multiplicity distribution favors a composition
model with a substantial proton content in the energy region 800,000 -
13,000,000 GeV/nucleus.
