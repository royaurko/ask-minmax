It is argued that the strong energy dependence of the $p\, d \rightarrow
\,^{3\!}H\!e\, \eta$ cross section near threshold is due to a final state
interaction between the $\eta$ meson and the $^3$He nucleus. The large
scattering length that this implies is in accord with optical potential
predictions and is evidence for a nearby virtual `$\!$`bound'$\!$' state in the
$\eta^3$He system. This model suggests that sharp structures should also be
seen close to production thresholds on other light nuclei.
