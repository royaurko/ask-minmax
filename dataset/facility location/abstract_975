We analyze the optical spring characteristics of a double pumped Fabry-Perot
cavity. A double-resonance optical spring occurs when the optical spring
frequency and the detuning frequency of the cavity coincide. We formulate a
simple criterion for the stability of an optical spring and apply it to the
double resonance regime. Double resonance configurations are very promising for
future gravitational wave detectors as they allow us to surpass the Standard
Quantum Limit. We show that stable double resonance can be demonstrated in
middle scale prototype interferometers such as the Glasgow 10m-Prototype,
Gingin High Optical Power Test Facility or the AEI 10m Prototype Interferometer
before being implemented in future gravitational wave detectors.
