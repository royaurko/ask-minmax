Here we present the preliminary results of the analysis of VIMOS observations
of the central 4.5 kpc of the double-barred galaxy NGC 5850. We use optical
diagnostic diagrams to study the main ionization mecahnism across the field of
view confirming the LINER nature in the continuum peak location. Also a
star-forming (SF) region is found close to it (0.46 kpc), a second SF region is
located east of the center (1.6 kpc). Further the data reveals a complex
nuclear gas kinematics which is likely to be dominated by the secondary bar.
