A new experiment is proposed with the aim to study eta-mesic nuclei and
low-energy interactions of eta with nuclei. Two decay modes of eta produced by
a photon beam inside a nucleus will be observed, namely a collisional decay
\eta N \to \pi N inside the nucleus and the radiative decay \eta \to \gamma
\gamma outside. In addition, a collisional decay of stopped S_{11}(1535)
resonance inside the nucleus, S_{11}(1535) N \to N N, will be studied. The
experiment can be performed using the tagged photon beam at ESRF with the
end-point energy 1000 MeV and the GRAAL detector which includes a
high-resolution BGO calorimeter and a large acceptance lead-scintillator
time-of-flight wall. Some results of simulation and estimates of yields are
given.
