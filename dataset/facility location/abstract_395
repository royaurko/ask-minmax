The low repetition rates and possible shot-to-shot variations in laser-plasma
studies place a high value on single-shot diagnostics. For example, white-beam
scattering methods based on broadband backlighter x-ray sources are used to
determine changes in the structure of laser-shocked crystalline materials by
the evolution of coincidences of reciprocal lattice vectors and
kinematically-allowed momentum transfers. Here, we demonstrate that white-beam
techniques can be extended to strongly-disordered dense plasma and warm dense
matter (WDM) systems where reciprocal space is only weakly structured and
spectroscopic detection is consequently needed to determine the static
structure factor and thus the ion-ion radial distribution function.
Specifically, we report a photometric study of energy-dispersive diffraction
(ED-XRD) for structural measurement of high energy density systems at
large-scale laser facilities such as OMEGA and the National Ignition Facility.
We find that structural information can be obtained in single-shot ED-XRD
experiments using established backlighter and spectrometer technologies.
