CTA 1 (G119.5+10.2) is a composite supernova remnant (SNR) with a shell-type
structure, visible in the radio band, surrounding a smaller pulsar wind nebula.
Fermi detected a radio-quiet pulsar PSR J0007+7303 within the radio shell. 26.5
hours of VERITAS observation revealed extended TeV emission from CTA 1. The
centroid of the TeV emission is located near the Fermi pulsar. The integral
flux of the emission was ~4% of the Crab Nebula flux (>1TeV). We present an
update on the source analysis with additional exposure and possible
interpretations.
