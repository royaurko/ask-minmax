We have summed up our investigations performed in 1970--1993. The main task
of this paper is clearly to show processes of formation of spectral lines as
well as their distinction by validity and by location. For 503 photospheric
lines of various chemical elements in the wavelength range 300--1000 nm we list
in Table the average formation depths of the line depression and the line
emission for the line centre and on the half-width of the line, the average
formation depths of the continuum emission as well as the effective widths of
the layer of the line depression formation. Dependence of average depths of
line depression formation on excitation potential, equivalent widths, and
central line depth are demonstrated by iron lines.
