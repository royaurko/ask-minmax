A facility to test the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) for the solar neutrino
detector Borexino was built at the Gran Sasso laboratory. Using the facility
2200 PMTs with optimal characteristics were selected from the 2350 delivered
from the manufacturer.
  The details of the hardware used are presented.
