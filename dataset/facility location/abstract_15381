Massive clusters are more often found in actively star forming galaxies than
in quiescent ones, similar to the Milky Way. We have carried out an extensive
survey of obscured Milky Way clusters to determine whether our Galaxy is still
forming such objects. Near-infrared spectral classification of some probable
cluster members was used to derive the distances to the cluster candidates.
Isochrone analysis of deep near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams allowed us to
obtain age and mass estimates. We report the physical parameters of three
cluster candidates:
  RCW87 is approx. 25 Myr old, located at a distance of D=7.6 Kpc in the
general direction of the Galactic center. Adding the mass of the suspected
cluster members we obtain an estimated total cluster mass of approx. 10300
solar masses. The mid-infrared photometry indicates that some next-generation
star formation is on-going in the associated HII region, probably triggered by
supernovae or stellar wind from the older stars in RCW87.
  The brightest member of [BDSB2003]164 is an O5V type star, based on our
spectroscopy. This limits the cluster age to less than a few million years. The
estimated total mass is approx. 1760 solar masses and the distance is D=3.2
Kpc.
  [DBSB2003]172 lacks central concentration and most likely this is not a
cluster but an extended star forming region.
  The high mass of RCW87 -- if confirmed -- puts this object in line with
Arches and Quintuplet, among the most young massive clusters in the Galaxy.
Further study is necessary to confirm this important result.
