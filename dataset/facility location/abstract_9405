We report the discovery of a young pulsar associated with the supernova
remnant G21.5-0.9, using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) located
near Pune, India. Discovered at a frequency of 610 MHz, J1833-1034 has a period
of 61.86 ms and a period derivative of $2.0 \times 10^{-13}$, making it similar
to other known young pulsars. The characteristic age of the pulsar is $\approx
4900$ yr, somewhat higher than estimates for the age of the remnant, but not
incompatible with it. The pulsar has a spin-down luminosity of $3.3 \times
10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is the second highest amongst all the known
Galactic pulsars.
