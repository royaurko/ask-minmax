Excited Si^+ and Fe^+ species are routinely observed in the host environment
of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, but are not commonly seen in other
extragalactic locations. Their presence signals unusual properties in the
gaseous environment of these GRB hosts that arise either as a result of the
intense ionizing radiation of the afterglow or through collision excitation in
a dense cloud. In particular, the photon pumping scenario has explicit
expectations for temporal variation in the strength of the excited lines, owing
to the decline in the ionizing flux of the GRB afterglow. We analyze afterglow
spectra of GRB 020813 obtained in two epochs of ~16 hours apart, and examine
transitions from the first excited state of Fe^+ at J=7/2 in these two sets of
data. We report a significant decline by at least a factor of five in the
equivalent width of the FeII 2396 transition, the strongest from the J=7/2
state. We perform a Monte-Carlo analysis and determine that this temporal
variation is present at more than 3sigma level of significance. This
observation represents the first detection in the temporal variation of the
excited Fe+ states in the GRB host ISM, a direct influence of the burst itself
on its environment. We further estimate that the Fe^+ gas resides in 50-100 pc
from the afterglow, based on the afterglow lightcurve and the presence and
absence of the excited FeII 2396 in the two-epoch observations.
