In this work we use morphostructural zonation and pattern recognition
techniques to identify a potential seismic source located inland very near
Venice, and then we evaluate how a tsunami wave generated from this source can
affect the MoSE gates if they are standing up (closed) during the tsunami
event. From our simulation we get both peaks and troughs as first arrivals: the
behavior of the barriers in these two situations could be a very important
design matter.
