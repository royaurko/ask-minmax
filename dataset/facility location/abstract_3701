We assess when electron trapping nonlinearity is expected to be important in
Langmuir waves. The basic criterion is that the inverse of the detrapping rate
nu_d of electrons in the trapping region of velocity space must exceed the
bounce period of deeply-trapped electrons, tau_B = (n_e/delta n)^{1/2}
2pi/omega_pe. A unitless figure of merit, the "bounce number" N_B = 1/(nu_d
tau_B), encapsulates this condition and defines a trapping threshold amplitude
for which N_B=1. The detrapping rate is found for convective loss (transverse
and longitudinal) out of a spatially finite Langmuir wave. Simulations of
driven waves with a finite transverse profile, using the 2D-2V Vlasov code
Loki, show trapping nonlinearity increases continuously with N_B for transverse
loss, and is significant for N_B ~ 1. The detrapping rate due to Coulomb
collisions (both electron-electron and electron-ion) is also found, with
pitch-angle scattering and parallel drag and diffusion treated in a unified
manner. A simple way to combine convective and collisional detrapping is given.
Application to underdense plasma conditions in inertial confinement fusion
targets is presented. The results show that convective transverse loss is
usually the most potent detrapping process in a single f/8 laser speckle. For
typical plasma and laser conditions on the inner laser cones of the National
Ignition Facility, local reflectivities ~3% are estimated to produce
significant trapping effects.
