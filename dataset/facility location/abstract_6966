An area of interest in the modern age is the human migration from rural areas
to cities. Cities are characterized by a dense concentration of buildings and
key infrastructures. However, what has been lacking is a pervasive sensor
technology that can monitor the performance of these structures. Partly, this
is due to the fact that the information collected from sensors cannot be easily
transported from the embedded location to an external data hub. Examples of
health monitoring in structures include monitoring corrosion, fracture stress,
and material delamination. The scenario examples include: pipelines, tunnel
networks, and some industrial and medical areas such as hospitals (minimise
electromagnetic interference), and turbines.
