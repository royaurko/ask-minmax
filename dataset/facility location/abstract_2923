We study the question of determining locations of base stations that may
belong to the same or to competing service providers. We take into account the
impact of these decisions on the behavior of intelligent mobile terminals who
can connect to the base station that offers the best utility. The signal to
interference and noise ratio is used as the quantity that determines the
association. We first study the SINR association-game: we determine the cells
corresponding to each base stations, i.e., the locations at which mobile
terminals prefer to connect to a given base station than to others. We make
some surprising observations: (i) displacing a base station a little in one
direction may result in a displacement of the boundary of the corresponding
cell to the opposite direction; (ii) A cell corresponding to a BS may be the
union of disconnected sub-cells. We then study the hierarchical equilibrium in
the combined BS location and mobile association problem: we determine where to
locate the BSs so as to maximize the revenues obtained at the induced SINR
mobile association game. We consider the cases of single frequency band and two
frequency bands of operation. Finally, we also consider hierarchical equilibria
in two frequency systems with successive interference cancellation.
