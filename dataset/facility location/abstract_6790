Recently, Tang and Cohen (Science 332, 333, 2011) have demonstrated a scheme
to enhance the chiral response of molecules, which relies on the use of
circularly polarized light in a standing wave configuration. Here we show a new
type of light which possesses orbital angular momentum and enhanced chiral
response. Unexpectedly, in the locations where the beams show enhanced optical
chirality, only the longitudinal components of the electric and magnetic fields
survive, showing a new way to yield optical chirality different from the usual.
