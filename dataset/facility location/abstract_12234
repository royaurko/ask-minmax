We have investigated the electronic structures of recently discovered
superconductor FeSe by soft-x-ray and hard-x-ray photoemission spectroscopy
with high bulk sensitivity. The large Fe 3d spectral weight is located in the
vicinity of the Fermi level (EF), which is demonstrated to be a coherent
quasi-particle peak. Compared with the results of the band structure
calculation with local-density approximation, Fe 3d band narrowing and the
energy shift of the band toward EF are found, suggesting an importance of the
electron correlation effect in FeSe. The self energy correction provides the
larger mass enhancement value (Z^-1=3.6) than in Fe-As superconductors and
enables us to separate a incoherent part from the spectrum. These features are
quite consistent with the results of recent dynamical mean-field calculations,
in which the incoherent part is attributed to the lower Hubbard band.
