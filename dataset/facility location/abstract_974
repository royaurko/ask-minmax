VST--Tube is a new software package designed to process optical astronomical
images. It is an automated pipeline to go from the raw exposures to fully
calibrated co-added images, and to extract catalogs with aperture and PSF
photometry. A set of tools allow the data administration and the quality check
of the intermediate and final products. VST-Tube comes with a Graphical User
Interface to facilitate the interaction between data and user. We outline here
the VST--Tube architecture and show some applications enlightening some of the
characteristics of the pipeline.
