We have investigated the elastic properties of the cubic dense Kondo compound
Ce0.75La0.25B6 by means of ultrasonic measurements. We have obtained magnetic
fields vs temperatures (H-T) phase diagrams under magnetic fields along the
crystallographic [001], [110] and [111] axes. An ordered phase IV showing the
elastic softening of c44 locates in low temperature region between 1.6 and 1.1
K below 0.7 T in all field directions. The phase IV shows an isotropic nature
with regard to the field directions, while the antiferro-magnetic phase III
shows an anisotropic character. A remarkable softening of c44 and a spontaneous
trigonal distortion &#949;yz+&#949;zx+&#949;xy recently reported by Akatsu et
al. [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 72 (2003) 205] in the phase IV favor a ferro-quadrupole
(FQ) moment of Oyz+Ozx+Oxy induced by an octupole ordering.
