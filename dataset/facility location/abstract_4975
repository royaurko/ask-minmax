In this work, it has been shown that the time dependent Xe-135 inventory in
the TRIGA Mark II reactor in Vienna, Austria can be measured via gamma
spectrometry even in the presence of strong background radiation. It is
focussing on the measurement of (but not limited to) the nuclide Xe-135.
  The time dependent Xe-135 inventory of the TRIGA Mark II reactor Vienna has
been measured using a temporary beam line between one fuel element of the core
placed onto the thermal column after shutdown and a detector system located
just above the water surface of the reactor tank. For the duration of one week,
multiple gamma ray spectra were recorded automatically, starting each afternoon
after reactor shutdown until the next morning. One measurement series has been
recorded over the weekend.
  The Xe-135 peaks were extracted from a total of 1227 recorded spectra using
an automated peak search algorithm and analyzed for their time-dependent
properties. Although the background gamma radiation present in the core after
shutdown was large especially in the lower energy range, the Xe-135 peak
located at 249.8 keV could be extracted from the most spectra where present and
could be compared to theoretical calculations.
