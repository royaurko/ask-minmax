We study the electric potential and field produced by disordered
distributions of charge to see why clumps of charge do not produce large
potentials or fields. The question is answered by evaluating the probability
distribution of the electric potential and field in a totally disordered system
that is overall electroneutral. An infinite system of point charges is called
totally disordered if the locations of the points and the values of the charges
are random. It is called electroneutral if the mean charge is zero. In one
dimension, we show that the electric field is always small, of the order of the
field of a single charge, and the spatial variations in potential are what can
be produced by a single charge. In two and three dimensions, the electric field
in similarly disordered electroneutral systems is usually small, with small
variations. Interestingly, in two and three dimensional systems, the electric
potential is usually very large, even though the electric field is not: large
amounts of energy are needed to put together a typical disordered configuration
of charges in two and three dimensions, but not in one dimension. If the system
is locally electroneutral--as well as globally electroneutral--the potential is
usually small in all dimensions. The properties considered here arise from the
superposition of electric fields of quasi-static distributions of charge, as in
nonmetallic solids or ionic solutions. These properties are found in
distributions of charge far from equilibrium.
