A two-dimensional saddle point in the electronic band dispersion of a
material causes a logarithmic divergence in the density-of-states (DOS) called
van Hove singularity (VHS). Electronic properties are usually expected to vary
drastically as a VHS approaches the Fermi level (EF). Here we report the direct
observation by scanning tunneling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy of a VHS just a few meV below EF of superconducting KFe2As2, which
locates in the middle of the principle axes of the first Brillouin zone. The
majority of the DOS at E_F, mainly contributed from the VHS, is non-gapped in
the superconducting state. Our observation of nodal VHS points, while providing
consistent explanations to many exotic behaviors previously observed in this
material, suggests possible additional exotic pairing states.
