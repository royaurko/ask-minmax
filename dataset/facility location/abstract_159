The next generation of radioactive ion beam facilities, which will give
experimental access to many exotic nuclei, are presently being developed. At
the same time the next generation of high resolution gamma-ray spectrometers,
based on gamma-ray tracking, for studying the structure of these exotic nuclei
are being developed. One of the main differences in tracking of $\gamma$ rays
versus charged particles is that the gamma rays do not deposit their energy
"continuously" in the detector, but in a few discrete steps. Also, in the field
of nuclear spectroscopy, the location of the source is mostly well known while
the exact interaction position in the detector is the unknown quantity. This
makes the challenges of gamma-ray tracking in germanium somewhat different
compared to vertexing in silicon detectors. In these proceedings we present the
methods for determining the 3D interaction positions in the detector and how
these are used to reconstruct the gamma-ray tracks in the AGATA detector array.
We also present preliminary simulation results of a proposed in-beam method to
measure the interaction position resolution in the germanium detectors.
