Some studies suggested that a correlation between locations of BL Lacertae
objects (BL Lacs) and the arrival directions of the ultrahigh energy cosmic
rays (UHECRs) exists. Especially by assuming the primary particles charged +1
and using a galactic magnetic field (GMF) model to calculate the deflections of
the UHECRs, the significance of correlation is improved. We construct a new GMF
model by incorporating all progresses in the GMF measurements in recent years.
Based on a thorough study of the deflections of the UHECRs measured by the
AGASA experiment, we study the GFM model dependence of the correlation between
the UHECRs and the selected BL Lacs using the new model together with others.
It turns out that only specific one of those GMF models makes the correlation
significant, even if neither GMF models themselves nor deflections of the
UHECRs are not significantly different. It suggests that the significance of
the correlation, calculated using a method suggested in those studies, is
intensively depending on the GMF model. Great improvement in statistics may
help to suppress the sensitivity to the GMF models.
