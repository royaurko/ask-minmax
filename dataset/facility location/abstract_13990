We study the phase diagram of mass- and spin-imbalanced unitary Fermi gases,
in search for the emergence of spatially inhomogeneous phases. To account for
fluctuation effects beyond the mean-field approximation, we employ
renormalization group techniques. We thus obtain estimates for critical values
of the temperature, mass and spin imbalance, above which the system is in the
normal phase. In the unpolarized, equal-mass limit, our result for the critical
temperature is in accordance with state-of-the-art Monte Carlo calculations. In
addition, we estimate the location of regions in the phase diagram where
inhomogeneous phases are likely to exist. We show that an intriguing relation
exists between the general structure of the many-body phase diagram and the
binding energies of the underlying two-body bound-state problem, which further
supports our findings. Our results suggest that inhomogeneous condensates form
for mass ratios of the spin-down and spin-up fermions greater than three. The
extent of the inhomogeneous phase in parameter space increases with increasing
mass imbalance.
