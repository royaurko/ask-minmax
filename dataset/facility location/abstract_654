In this paper we describe the physical processes that lead to the generation
of Giant Electro- Magnetic Pulses (GEMP) on powerful laser facilities. Our
study is based on experimental mea- surements of both the charging of a solid
target irradiated by an ultra-short, ultra-intense laser and the detection of
the electromagnetic emission in the GHz domain. An unambiguous correlation
between the neutralisation current in the target holder and the electromagnetic
emission shows that the source of the GEMP is the remaining positive charge
inside the target after the escape of fast electrons accelerated by the
ultra-intense laser. A simple model for calculating this charge in the thick
target case is presented. From this model and knowing the geometry of the
target holder, it becomes possible to estimate the intensity and the dominant
frequencies of the GEMP on any facility.
