Re-entrance is a novel feature where the phase boundaries of a system exhibit
a succession of transitions between two phases A and B, like A-B-A-B, when just
one parameter is varied monotonically. This type of re-entrance is displayed by
the 1D Bose Hubbard model between its Mott insulator (MI) and superfluid phase
as the hopping amplitude is increased from zero. Here we analyse this
counter-intuitive phenomenon directly in the thermodynamic limit by utilizing
the infinite time-evolving block decimation algorithm to variationally minimize
an infinite matrix product state (MPS) parameterized by a matrix size chi.
Exploiting the direct restriction on the half-chain entanglement imposed by
fixing chi, we determined that re-entrance in the MI lobes only emerges in this
approximate when chi >= 8. This entanglement threshold is found to be
coincident with the ability an infinite MPS to be simultaneously
particle-number symmetric and capture the kinetic energy carried by
particle-hole excitations above the MI. Focussing on the tip of the MI lobe we
then applied, for the first time, a general finite-entanglement scaling
analysis of the infinite order Kosterlitz-Thouless critical point located
there. By analysing chi's up to a very moderate chi = 70 we obtained an
estimate of the KT transition as t_KT = 0.30 +/- 0.01, demonstrating the how a
finite-entanglement approach can provide not only qualitative insight but also
quantitatively accurate predictions.
