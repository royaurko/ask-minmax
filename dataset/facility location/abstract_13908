Fracture initiation in glassy polymers with no notch is studied together with
the evolution at zero stress in the glassy state. Confocal microscopy
observations and auto-correlation methods are used to characterize specimens of
polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) loaded at room temperature and subsequently
unloaded. The evolution of the morphology and the location of the cracking
submitted to elongation rate up to 8% are reported and analyzed during the
zero-stress relaxation. The crackling (longitudinal crack, transverse crack and
crazes) takes place mainly within a 10micron thickness layer from the surface
and does not extend in the bulk. It is shown that the strain field continues to
evolve without stress, and that it can be described by an intermittent
retraction of the displacement field. Correlatively the number of crazes or of
micro-cavities is increasing in the post-loading state at zero-stress
relaxation. The timescales involved in the retraction are of the order of
several days reporting thus on so far unknown very slow relaxation timescales.
