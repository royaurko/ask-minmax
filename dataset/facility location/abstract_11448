We present results of a multi-wavelength study of episodic plasma injection
into the corona of AR 10942. We exploit long-exposure images of the Hinode and
Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) spacecraft to study the
properties of faint, episodic, "blobs" of plasma that are propelled upward
along coronal loops that are rooted in the AR plage. We find that the source
location and characteristic velocities of these episodic upflow events match
those expected from recent spectroscopic observations of faint coronal upflows
that are associated with upper chromospheric activity, in the form of highly
dynamic spicules. The analysis presented ties together observations from
coronal and chromospheric spectrographs and imagers, providing more evidence of
the connection of discrete coronal mass heating and injection events with their
source, dynamic spicules, in the chromosphere.
