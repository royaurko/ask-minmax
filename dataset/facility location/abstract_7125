We improved the stochastic 2-D galaxy disk models (Mineikis & Vansevi\v{c}ius
2014a) by introducing enriched gas outflows from galaxies and synthetic
color-magnitude diagrams of stellar populations. To test the models, we use the
HST/ACS stellar photometry data in four fields located along the major axis of
the galaxy M33 (Williams et al. 2009) and demonstrate the potential of the
models to derive 2-D star formation histories in the resolved disk galaxies.
