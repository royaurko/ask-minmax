We analyze new high-resolution Chandra X-ray images of the Wolf-Rayet binary
system WR147. This system contains a WN8 star with an early-type companion
located 0.6'' to its north, and is the only known early-type binary with a
separation on the sky large enough for the wind-wind collision between the
stars to currently be resolved at X-ray energies. The 5 ksec Chandra HRC-I
image provides the first direct evidence for spatially extended X-ray emission
in an early-type binary system. The X-ray emission peaks close to the position
of the radio bow shock and north of the WN8 star. A deeper X-ray image is
needed to accurately determine the degree of spatial extension, to exactly
align the X-ray and optical/radio frames, and to determine whether part of the
detected X-ray emission arises in the individual stellar winds. Simulated X-ray
images of the wind-wind collision have a FWHM consistent with the data, and
maximum likelihood fits suggest that a deeper observation may also constrain
the inclination and wind momentum ratio of this system. However, as the WR wind
dominates the colliding wind X-ray emission it appears unlikely that the
mass-loss rate and the terminal velocity of the companion wind can be
separately determined from X-ray observations. We also note an inconsistency
between numerical and analytical estimates of the X-ray luminosity ratio of the
stronger and weaker wind components, and conclude that the analytical results
are in error.
