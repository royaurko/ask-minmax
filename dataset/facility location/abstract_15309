We use new and archival Chandra and ROSAT data to study the time variability
of the X-ray emission from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by PSR B1509-58
on timescales of one week to twelve years. There is variability in the size,
number, and brightness of compact knots appearing within 20" of the pulsar,
with at least one knot showing a possible outflow velocity of ~0.6c (assuming a
distance to the source of 5.2 kpc). The transient nature of these knots may
indicate that they are produced by turbulence in the flows surrounding the
pulsar. A previously identified prominent jet extending 12 pc to the southeast
of the pulsar increased in brightness by 30% over 9 years; apparent outflow of
material along this jet is observed with a velocity of ~0.5c. However, outflow
alone cannot account for the changes in the jet on such short timescales.
Magnetohydrodynamic sausage or kink instabilities are feasible explanations for
the jet variability with timescale of ~1.3-2 years. An arc structure, located
30"-45" north of the pulsar, shows transverse structural variations and appears
to have moved inward with a velocity of ~0.03c over three years. The overall
structure and brightness of the diffuse PWN exterior to this arc and excluding
the jet has remained the same over the twelve year span. The photon indices of
the diffuse PWN and possibly the jet steepen with increasing radius, likely
indicating synchrotron cooling at X-ray energies.
