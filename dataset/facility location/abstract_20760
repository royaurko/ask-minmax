The region around the supernova remnant (SNR) W41 contains several TeV
sources and has prompted the H.E.S.S. Collaboration to perform deep
observations of this field of view. This resulted in the discovery of the new
very high energy (VHE) source HESS J1832-093, at the position $\rm RA=18^h 32^m
50^s \pm 3^s_{stat} \pm 2^s_{syst}, \rm Dec=-9^\circ 22' 36'' \pm 32''_{stat}
\pm 20''_{syst} (J2000)$, spatially coincident with a part of the radio shell
of the neighboring remnant G22.7-0.2. The photon spectrum is well described by
a power-law of index $\Gamma = 2.6 \pm 0.3_{\rm stat} \pm 0.1_{\rm syst}$ and a
normalization at 1 TeV of $\Phi_0=(4.8 \pm 0.8_{\rm stat}\pm 1.0_{\rm
syst})\,\times\,10^{-13}\,\rm{cm} ^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,TeV^{-1}$. The location of the
gamma-ray emission on the edge of the SNR rim first suggested a signature of
escaping cosmic-rays illuminating a nearby molecular cloud. Then a dedicated
XMM-Newton observation led to the discovery of a new X-ray point source
spatially coincident with the TeV excess. Two other scenarios were hence
proposed to identify the nature of HESS J1832-093. Gamma-rays from inverse
Compton radiation in the framework of a pulsar wind nebula scenario or the
possibility of gamma-ray production within a binary system are therefore also
considered. Deeper multi-wavelength observations will help to shed new light on
this intriguing VHE source.
