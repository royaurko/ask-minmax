The airborne traffic monitoring system forms a novel technology of detecting
vehicle motion. An optical digital camera located on an airborne platform
produces a series of images which then are processed to recognized the fixed
vehicles. In this way the video data are converted into the time sequence of
frames containing the vehicle coordinates. In the present work a three-frame
algorithm is developed to identify the succeeding vehicle positions. It is
based on finding the neighboring points in the frame sequence characterized by
minimal acceleration. To verify and optimize the developed algorithm a
``Virtual Road'' simulator was created. Finally available empirical data are
analyzed using the created algorithm.
