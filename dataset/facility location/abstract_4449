Boomerang measured the first peak in CMBR to be at location of $l_D=196\pm
6$, which excites our strong interesting in it. A widely cited formula is
$l_D\simeq 200\Omega_T^{-0.50}$ to estimate the cosmic total density. Weinberg
shows it is not correct and should be $l_D\propto \Omega_T^{-1.58}$ near the
interest point $(\Omega_m,\Omega_\Lambda)=(0.3,0.7)$. We show further that it
should be $l_D\propto \Omega_T^{-1.43}\Omega_m^{-0.147}$ or
$\Omega_T^{-1.92}\Omega_\Lambda^{0.343}$ near the same point in the more
veracious sense if we consider the effect from the sound horizon. We draw a
contour graph for the peak location, show that the recent data favor to a
closed universe with about $\Omega_T\simeq 1.03$. If we insist on obtaining a
flat universe, a point $(0.36,0.64)$, i.e., more matter and less vacuum energy,
is still possible, which has a more right-side first peak $l_D=208$ in CMBR and
a smaller acceleration parameter $-q_0=0.10$ for the $z=0.4$ redshift SNIa.
