The calculated values of Earth's inclinations during the cold events in the
500 kyr climate record of Devils Hole show a correlation: they cluster in the
regions around 1 and 2 degrees. The Devils Hole record has been chosen, since
it was dated by absolute methods. Other climate records covering the same
period also have a reduced number of cold events between the two regions. The
correlation lends support to the proposal of R. A. Muller and G.J. MacDonald
that the observed 100 kyr climate cycle is due to the varying inclination of
Earth's orbit and to material located near the invariant plane which shields
off the solar radiation.
