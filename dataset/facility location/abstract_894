Spatially resolved photocurrent measurements on carbon nanotube field-effect
transistors (CNFETs) operated in various transport regimes are reported. It is
demonstrated that the photocurrents measured at different biasing conditions
provide access to the electronic band structure profile of the nanotube
channel. A comparison of the profiles with the device switched into n- or
p-type states clearly evidences the impact of chemical doping from the ambient.
Moreover, we show that scanning photocurrent microscopy constitutes an
effective and facile technique for the quantitative determination of the
Schottky barrier height in such devices.
