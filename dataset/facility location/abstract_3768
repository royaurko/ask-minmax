Cloud Computing is a set of IT Services that are provided to a customer over
a network and these services are delivered by third party provider who owns the
infrastructure and reduce the burden at user's end. Nowadays researchers
devoted their work access control method to enhance the security on Cloud. RBAC
is attractive access model because the number of roles is significantly less
hence users can be easily classified according to their roles. The Role-based
Access Control (RBAC) model provides efficient way to manage access to
information while reducing the cost of security administration and complexity
in large networked applications. This paper specify various policies in RBAC on
clouds such as migration policy which helps the user to migrate the database
schema and roles easily to the Cloud using XML with more security. Restriction
policy provide the security enhancement in Role Based Access Model by
restricting the number of transaction per user and if the number of
transactions will increase the admin will come to know through its monitoring
system that uncontributorized access has been made and it would be easier to take
action against such happening. This paper proposes backup and restoration
policy in Role Based Access Model in which if the main cloud is crashed or not
working properly then the backup and restoration facility will be available to
avoid the lost of important data. In this case chances of loss of data are very
less so enhance more security on Cloud Computing.
