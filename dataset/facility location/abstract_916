We calculate the radiative decay width of the $\psi(3770)$ into the
dynamically generated scalar resonance X(3700) which is predicted in a previous
paper. The results show that it is possible that the upgraded BEPC-II facility
will generate enough statistics in order to observe this decay and thus confirm
the existence of the X(3700).
