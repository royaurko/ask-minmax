Due to rapid data growth, statistical analysis of massive datasets often has
to be carried out in a distributed fashion, either because several datasets
stored in separate physical locations are all relevant to a given problem, or
simply to achieve faster (parallel) computation through a divide-and-conquer
scheme. In both cases, the challenge is to obtain valid inference based on all
data without having to move the datasets to a central computing node. We show
that for a very widely used class of spatial low-rank models, which can be
written as a linear combination of spatial basis functions plus a
fine-scale-variation component, parallel spatial inference and prediction for
massive distributed data can be carried out exactly, meaning that the results
are the same as for a traditional, non-distributed analysis. The computational
cost of our distributed algorithms is linear in the number of data points,
while the communication cost does not depend on the data sizes at all. After
extending our results to the spatio-temporal case, we illustrate our
methodology by carrying out distributed spatio-temporal particle filtering
inference on total precipitable water measured by three different satellite
sensor systems.
