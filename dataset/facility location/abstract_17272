We present Herschel PACS spectroscopy of the [OI] 63 micron gas-line for
three circumstellar disk systems showing signs of significant disk evolution
and/or planet formation: HR 8799, HD 377 and RX J1852.3-3700. [OI] is
undetected toward HR 8799 and HD 377 with 3 sigma upper limits of 6.8 x 10^-18
W m^-2 and 9.9 x 10^-18 W m^-2 respectively. We find an [OI] detection for RX
J1852.3-3700 at 12.3 +- 1.8 x 10^-18 W m^-2. We use thermo-chemical disk models
to model the gas emission, using constraints on the [OI] 63 micron, and
ancillary data to derive gas mass upper limits and constrain gas-to-dust
ratios. For HD 377 and HR 8799, we find 3 sigma upper limits on the gas mass of
0.1-20 Mearth. For RX J1852.3-3700, we find two distinct disk scenarios that
could explain the detection of [OI] 63 micron and CO(2-1) upper limits reported
from the literature: (i) a large disk with gas co-located with the dust (16-500
AU), resulting in a large tenuous disk with ~16 Mearth of gas, or (ii) an
optically thick gas disk, truncated at ~70 AU, with a gas mass of 150 Mearth.
We discuss the implications of these results for the formation and evolution of
planets in these three systems.
