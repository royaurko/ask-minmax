We discuss the importance and potential contribution of Athena+ to the
science questions related to gamma-ray bursts, tidal disruption events and
supernova shock break-out. Athena+ will allow breakthrough observations
involving high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic observations of high-z gamma-ray
bursts, observations of tidal disruption events tailored to determine the mass
and potentially the spin of the black hole responsible for the tidal disruption
and observations of X-rays from the supernova shock breakout providing a
measure of the radius of the exploding star or of the companion in the case of
type Ia supernovae. We briefly discuss survey facilities that will provide
triggers to these events envisaged to be operational around 2028.
