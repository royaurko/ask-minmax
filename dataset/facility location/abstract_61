In this paper, we develop estimation and control methods for quickly reacting
to collisions between omnidirectional mobile platforms and their environment.
To enable the full-body detection of external forces, we use torque sensors
located in the robot's drivetrain. Using model based techniques we estimate,
with good precision, the location, direction, and magnitude of collision
forces, and we develop an admittance controller that achieves a low effective
mass in reaction to them. For experimental testing, we use a facility
containing a calibrated collision dummy and our holonomic mobile platform. We
subsequently explore collisions with the dummy colliding against a stationary
base and the base colliding against a stationary dummy. Overall, we accomplish
fast reaction times and a reduction of impact forces. A proof of concept
experiment presents various parts of the mobile platform, including the wheels,
colliding safely with humans.
