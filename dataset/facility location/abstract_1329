Location privacy is one of the major security problems in a Wireless Body
Area Networks (WBANs). An eavesdropper can keep track of the place and time
devices are communicating. To make things even worse, the attacker does not
have to be physically close to the communicating devices, he can use a device
with a stronger antenna. The unique hardware address of a mobile device can
often be linked to the identity of the user operating the device. This
represents a violation of the user's privacy. The user should decide when
his/her location is revealed and when not. In this paper, we first categorize
the type of eavesdroppers for WBANs, and then we propose a new scheme to
provide the location privacy in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs).
