This paper presents a new method for a quick similarity-based search through
long unlabeled audio streams to detect and locate audio clips provided by
users. The method involves feature-dimension reduction based on a piecewise
linear representation of a sequential feature trajectory extracted from a long
audio stream. Two techniques enable us to obtain a piecewise linear
representation: the dynamic segmentation of feature trajectories and the
segment-based Karhunen-L\'{o}eve (KL) transform. The proposed search method
guarantees the same search results as the search method without the proposed
feature-dimension reduction method in principle. Experiment results indicate
significant improvements in search speed. For example the proposed method
reduced the total search time to approximately 1/12 that of previous methods
and detected queries in approximately 0.3 seconds from a 200-hour audio
database.
