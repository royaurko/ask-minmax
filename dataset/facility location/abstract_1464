The process of data taking, reduction and calibration of near-infrared
imaging polarimetry data taken with the ESO Adaptive Optics System ADONIS is
described. The ADONIS polarimetric facility is provided by a rotating wire grid
polarizer. Images were taken at increments of 22.5 degrees of polarizer
rotation from 0 to 180 degrees, over-sampling the polarization curve but
allowing the effects of photometric variations to be assessed. Several
strategies to remove the detector signature are described. The instrumental
polarization was determined, by observations of stars of negligible
polarization, to be 1.7% at J, H and K bands. The lack of availability of
unpolarized standard stars in the IR, in particular which are not too bright as
to saturate current IR detectors, is highlighted. The process of making
polarization maps is described. Experiments at restoring polarimetry data, in
order to reach diffraction limited polarization, are outlined, with particular
reference to data on the Homunculus reflection nebula around Eta Carinae.
