We have monitored the AGN 3C390.3 between 1995 and 2000.Two large amplitude
outbursts, of different duration, in continuum and H beta light were observed
ie.: in October 1994 a brighter flare that lasted about 1000 days and in July
1997 another one that lasted about 700 days were detected. The flux in the H
beta wings and line core vary simultaneously, a behavior indicative of
predominantly circular motions in the BLR.Important changes of the Hbeta
emission profiles were detected: at times, we found profiles with prominent
asymmetric wings, as those normaly seen in Sy1s, while at other times, we
observe profiles with weak almost symmetrical wings, similar to those seen in
Sy1.8s. We found that the radial velocity difference between the red and blue
bumps is anticorrelated with the light curves of H beta and continuum
radiation.e found that the radial velocity difference between the red and blue
bumps is anticorrelated with the light curves of H-beta and continuum
radiation. Theoretical H-beta profiles were computed for an accretion disk, the
observed profiles are best reproduced by an inclined disk (25 deg) whose region
of maximum emission is located roughly at 200 Rg. The mass of the black hole in
3C 390.3, estimated from the reverberation analysis is Mrev = 2.1 x 10^9 Msun,
ie. 5 times larger than previous estimates
