We present high-resolution VLT spectra of a new DO white dwarf and a new
PG1159 star, which we identified in the ESO SPY survey. The PG1159 star is a
low-gravity, extremely hot (Teff=160,000 K, log g=6) star, having a C/He
dominated atmosphere with considerable amounts of O and Ne (He=38%, C=54%,
O=6%, Ne=2% by mass). It is located within the planetary nebula nuclei
instability strip and pulsations have been discovered. The DO is a unique
object. From HeI/HeII line strengths we found Teff about 60,000 K, however, the
HeII lines are extraordinarily strong and cannot be fitted by any model.
