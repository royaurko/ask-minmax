The density matrix of the 2D system of spinless electrons confined to the
lowest Landau level is expressed using both basis of states parametrized by
electron locations and basis of states parametrized by hole locations. In this
representation, the electron-electron repulsion can be viewed as an
electron-hole attraction. Electron-hole pairs stabilized by this attraction
provide a new formulation for Composite Fermions which fully respects
particle-hole symmetry. This representation also allows a particularly simple
formulation of the composite Boson approach of generic n =p/q incompressible
states: The n =p/q state corresponds to the formation of clusters made up on p
electrons and q-p holes and fractionally charged excitations correspond to the
breaking of such clusters.
