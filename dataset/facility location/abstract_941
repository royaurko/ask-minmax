In this article we report the release of a new program for batch processing
and visualization of powder diffraction data. The program, which is
free-of-charge for non-commercial use and can be obtained with its detailed
documentation from our website www.scienceware.net, is currently in use by a
number of researchers in University College London, University of Manchester,
Utrecht University in the Netherland, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility
(ESRF), and Diamond Light Source. The software is designed for the treatment of
large volume of powder diffraction data, especially those obtained from the new
generation of synchrotron detectors. The program has a great potential for
future development to be a workbench for powder diffraction work.
