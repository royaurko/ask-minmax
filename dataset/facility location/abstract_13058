This paper presents a method for obtaining an analytic expression for the
density function of observables in multifield models of inflation with
sum-separable potentials. The most striking result is that the density function
in general possesses a sharp peak and the location of this peak is only mildly
sensitive to the distribution of initial conditions. A simple argument is given
for why this result holds for a more general class of models than just those
with sum-separable potentials and why for such models, it is possible to obtain
robust predictions for observable quantities. As an example, the joint density
function of the spectral index and running in double quadratic inflation is
computed. For scales leaving the horizon 55 e-folds before the end of
inflation, the density function peaks at n_{s}=0.967 and \alpha=0.0006 for the
spectral index and running respectively.
