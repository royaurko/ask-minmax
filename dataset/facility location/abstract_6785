Wireless Body Area Sensor Networks (WBASN) is an emerging technology which
uses wireless sensors to implement real-time wearable health monitoring of
patients to enhance independent living. In this paper we propose a prototype of
cloud mobile health monitoring system. The system uses WBASN and Smartphone
application that uses cloud computing, location data and a neural network to
determine the state of patients.
