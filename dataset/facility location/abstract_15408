We report observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory of a field in the
gamma$-Cygni supernova remnant (SNR78.2+2.1) centered on the cataloged location
of the unidentified, bright gamma-ray source 3EG J2020+4017. In this search for
an X-ray counterpart to the gamma-ray source, we detected 30 X-ray sources. Of
these, we found 17 strong-candidate counterparts in optical (visible through
near-infrared) cataloged and an additional 3 through our optical observations.
Based upon colors and (for several objects) optical spectra, nearly all the
optically identified objects appear to be reddened main-sequence stars. None of
the X-ray sources with an optical counterpart is a plausible X-ray counterpart
to 3EG J2020+4017 --if that gamma-ray source is a spin-powered pulsar. Many of
the 10 X-ray sources lacking optical counterparts are likely (extragalactic)
active galactic nuclei, based upon the sky density of such sources. Although
one of the 10 optically unidentified X-ray sources could be the gamma-ray
source, there is no auxiliary evidence supporting such an identification.
