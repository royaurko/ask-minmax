We present the first blind interferometric detection and imaging of a
millisecond radio transient with an observation of transient pulsar J0628+0909.
We developed a special observing mode of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array
(VLA) to produce correlated data products (i.e., visibilities and images) on a
time scale of 10 ms. Correlated data effectively produce thousands of beams on
the sky that can localize sources anywhere over a wide field of view. We used
this new observing mode to find and image pulses from the rotating radio
transient (RRAT) J0628+0909, improving its localization by two orders of
magnitude. Since the location of the RRAT was only approximately known when
first observed, we searched for transients using a wide-field detection
algorithm based on the bispectrum, an interferometric closure quantity. Over 16
minutes of observing, this algorithm detected one transient offset roughly 1'
from its nominal location; this allowed us to image the RRAT to localize it
with an accuracy of 1.6". With a priori knowledge of the RRAT location, a
traditional beamforming search of the same data found two, lower significance
pulses. The refined RRAT position excludes all potential multiwavelength
counterparts, limiting its optical luminosity to L_i'<1.1x10^31 erg/s and
excluding its association with a young, luminous neutron star.
