The Atomic Spectroscopy and Collisions Using Slow Antiprotons (ASACUSA)
experiment at the Antiproton Decelerator (AD) facility of CERN constructed
segmented scintillators to detect and track the charged pions which emerge from
antiproton annihilations in a future superconducting radiofrequency Paul trap
for antiprotons. A system of 541 cast and extruded scintillator bars were
arranged in 11 detector modules which provided a spatial resolution of 17 mm.
Green wavelength-shifting fibers were embedded in the scintillators, and read
out by silicon photomultipliers which had a sensitive area of 1 x 1 mm^2. The
photoelectron yields of various scintillator configurations were measured using
a negative pion beam of momentum p ~ 1 GeV/c. Various fibers and silicon
photomultipliers, fiber end terminations, and couplings between the fibers and
scintillators were compared. The detectors were also tested using the
antiproton beam of the AD. Nonlinear effects due to the saturation of the
silicon photomultiplier were seen at high annihilation rates of the
antiprotons.
