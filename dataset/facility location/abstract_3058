Earthquakes are a complex spatiotemporal phenomenon, the underlying mechanism
for which is still not fully understood despite decades of research and
analysis. We propose and develop a network approach to earthquake events. In
this network, a node represents a spatial location while a link between two
nodes represents similar activity patterns in the two different locations. The
strength of a link is proportional to the strength of the cross-correlation in
activities of two nodes joined by the link. We apply our network approach to a
Japanese earthquake catalog spanning the 14-year period 1985-1998. We find
strong links representing large correlations between patterns in locations
separated by more than 1000 km, corroborating prior observations that
earthquake interactions have no characteristic length scale. We find network
characteristics not attributable to chance alone, including a large number of
network links, high node assortativity, and strong stability over time.
