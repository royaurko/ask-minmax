Suggestions have been made for a 80-100 km circumference Future Circular
Collider (FCC) that could ultimately contain a circular e+e- ring collider
operating as a Higgs Factory as well as a 100 TeV hadron collider. Those
suggestions have motivated us to propose an approach in which the project is
sited at the location at the SSC tunnel, which has the lowest tunnel cost ever.
The low tunnel cost would make it cost-effective to locate the 100 TeV Hadron
Collider in a 270 km circumference tunne, using 4.5 Tesla superconducting
magnets. The SSC tunnel itself would be used to house the Higgs Factory and the
injector for the Hadron Collider. The injector for the Higgs Factory would be
also used as a driver for an X-ray Free Electron Laser with unique capabilities
for protein crystallography. The location of the project at a location with
favorable geotechnology for minimum-cost tunneling, and low-cost/low-risk
technology for the SRF and superconducting magnets, open the possibility to
build the proposed laboratory within a decade.
