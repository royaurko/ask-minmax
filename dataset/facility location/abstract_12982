This work is to study the dynamics of coronal mass ejections and to
investigate possible correlation between CME productivity and subsurface
structure. Two CMEs and six active regions are selected for the study. The CMEs
are examined by comparing observations and theoretical models, and the
subsurface structures are probed by local helioseismic inversions. The analysis
of the CMEs shows that the eruptive flux-rope model is in good agreement with
both events. However, some discrepancies with the observation are also found,
indicating that the model can be further improved. The helioseismic
investigation results indicate a consistent correlation between the CME
productivity and the subsurface temperature structure. The inferred subsurface
magnetic structure reveals that the source regions of the two studied CMEs may
share similar subsurface structures. Not found in the other CME productive
regions selected for consideration, however, the similarity in the subsurface
features may indicate the presence of a subsurface structural connection
betweenthe two closely located and CME-productive regions.
