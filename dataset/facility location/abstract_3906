We analyze 3 epochs of ultraviolet (UV), optical and near-infrared (NIR)
observations of the Taurus transitional disk GM Aur using the Hubble Space
Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX
spectrograph. Observations were separated by one week and 3 months in order to
study variability over multiple timescales. We calculate accretion rates for
each epoch of observations using the STIS spectra and find that those separated
by one week had similar accretion rates (~1E-8 solar masses/yr) while the epoch
obtained 3 months later had a substantially lower accretion rate (~4E-9 solar
masses/yr). We find that the decline in accretion rate is caused by lower
densities of material in the accretion flows, as opposed to a lower surface
coverage of the accretion columns. During the low accretion rate epoch we also
observe lower fluxes at both far UV (FUV) and IR wavelengths, which trace
molecular gas and dust in the disk, respectively. We find that this can be
explained by a lower dust and gas mass in the inner disk. We attribute the
observed variability to inhomogeneities in the inner disk, near the corotation
radius, where gas and dust may co-exist near the footprints of the
magnetospheric flows. These FUV--NIR data offer a new perspective on the
structure of the inner disk, the stellar magnetosphere, and their interaction.
