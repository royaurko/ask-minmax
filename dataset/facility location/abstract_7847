Ellerman bombs are transient brightenings of the extended wings of the solar
Balmer lines in emerging active regions. We describe their properties in the
ultraviolet lines sampled by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS),
using simultaneous imaging spectroscopy in H$\alpha$ with the Swedish 1-m Solar
Telescope (SST) and ultraviolet images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory for
Ellerman bomb detection and identification. We select multiple co-observed
Ellerman bombs for detailed analysis. The IRIS spectra strengthen the view that
Ellerman bombs mark reconnection between bipolar kilogauss fluxtubes with the
reconnection and the resulting bi-directional jet located within the solar
photosphere and shielded by overlying chromospheric fibrils in the cores of
strong lines. The spectra suggest that the reconnecting photospheric gas
underneath is heated sufficiently to momentarily reach stages of ionization
normally assigned to the transition region and the corona. We also analyze
similar outburst phenomena that we classify as small flaring arch filaments and
ascribe to higher-located reconnection. They have different morphology and
produce hot arches in million-Kelvin diagnostics.
