Aims. Expanding HII regions and propagating shocks are common in the
environment of young high-mass star-forming complexes. They can compress a
pre-existing molecular cloud and trigger the formation of dense cores. We
investigate whether these phenomena can explain the formation of high-mass
protostars within an infrared dark cloud located at the position of G327.3-0.6
in the Galactic plane, in between two large infrared bubbles and two HII
regions. Methods: The region of G327.3-0.6 was imaged at 450 ? m with the CEA
P-ArT\'eMiS bolometer array on the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment telescope in
Chile. APEX/LABOCA and APEX-2A, and Spitzer/IRAC and MIPS archives data were
used in this study. Results: Ten massive cores were detected in the P-ArT\'eMiS
image, embedded within the infrared dark cloud seen in absorption at both 8 and
24 ?m. Their luminosities and masses indicate that they form high-mass stars.
The kinematical study of the region suggests that the infrared bubbles expand
toward the infrared dark cloud. Conclusions: Under the influence of expanding
bubbles, star formation occurs in the infrared dark areas at the border of HII
regions and infrared bubbles.
