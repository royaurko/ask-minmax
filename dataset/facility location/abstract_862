Results are presented for the elastic scattering of electrons and protons
from the exotic He and Li isotopes. Comparison with scattering results from the
stable He and Li nuclei allows for an investigation into the effects that the
extensive neutron distributions have on the charge density. For comparison we
also consider the proton halo nucleus 8B. The consequences and possible
suggestions for proposed electron scattering facilities for exotic nuclei are
discussed.
