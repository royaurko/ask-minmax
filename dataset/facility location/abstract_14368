Real life problems such as scheduling meeting between people at different
locations can be modelled as distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problems
(CSPs). Suitable and satisfactory solutions can then be found using constraint
satisfaction algorithms which can be exhaustive (backtracking) or otherwise
(local search). However, most research in this area tested their algorithms by
simulation on a single PC with a single program entry point. The main
contribution of our work is the design and implementation of a truly
distributed constraint solver based on a local search algorithm using Java
Agent DEvelopment framework (JADE) to enable communication between agents on
different machines. Particularly, we discuss design and implementation issues
related to truly distributed constraint solver which might not be critical when
simulated on a single machine. Evaluation results indicate that our truly
distributed constraint solver works well within the observed limitations when
tested with various distributed CSPs. Our application can also incorporate any
constraint solving algorithm with little modifications.
