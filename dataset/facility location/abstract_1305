We argue that a variety of solar data suggest that the activity-cycle
timescale variability of the total irradiance, is produced by structural
adjustments of the solar interior. Assuming these adjustments are induced by
variations of internal magnetic fields, we use measurements of the total
irradiance and effective temperature over the period from 1978 to 1992, to
infer the magnitude and location of the magnetic field. Using an updated
stellar evolution model, which includes magnetic fields, we find that the
observations can be explained by fields whose peak values range from 120k to
2.3k gauss, located in the convection zone between $0.959R_{\sun}$ and
$0.997R_{\sun}$, respectively. The corresponding maximal radius changes, are 17
km when the magnetic field is located at $0.959R_{\sun}$ and 3 km when it is
located at $0.997R_{\sun}$. At these depths, the $W$ parameter(defined by
$\Delta \ln R / \Delta \ln L$, where $R$ and $L$ are the radius and luminosity)
ranges from 0.02 to 0.006. All these predictions are consistent with
helioseismology and recent measurements carried out by the MDI experiment on
SOHO.
