We introduce a new method to construct solutions to the constraint equations
of general relativity describing binary black holes in quasicircular orbit.
Black hole pairs with arbitrary momenta can be constructed with a simple method
recently suggested by Brandt and Bruegmann, and quasicircular orbits can then
be found by locating a minimum in the binding energy along sequences of
constant horizon area. This approach produces binary black holes in a
"three-sheeted" manifold structure, as opposed to the "two-sheeted" structure
in the conformal-imaging approach adopted earlier by Cook. We focus on locating
the innermost stable circular orbit and compare with earlier calculations. Our
results confirm those of Cook and imply that the underlying manifold structure
has a very small effect on the location of the innermost stable circular orbit.
