The spectrum of the self-adjoint Schr\"odinger operator associated with the
Kronig-Penney model on the half-line has a band-gap structure: its absolutely
continuous spectrum consists of intervals (bands) separated by gaps. We show
that if one changes strengths of interactions or locations of interaction
centers by adding an oscillating and slowly decaying sequence which resembles
the classical Wigner-von Neumann potential, then this structure of the
absolutely continuous spectrum is preserved. At the same time in each spectral
band precisely two critical points appear. At these points "instable" embedded
eigenvalues may exist. We obtain locations of the critical points and discuss
for each of them the possibility of an embedded eigenvalue to appear. We also
show that the spectrum in gaps remains discrete.
