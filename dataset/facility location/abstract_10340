We discuss a class of 4-dimensional non-homogeneous quaternionic spaces,
which become the two known homogeneous spaces (EAdS_4$ and SU(2,1)/U(2)) in
certain limits. These moduli spaces have two regions where the metric is
positive definite, separated by a non-physical region where the metric has
timelike directions and which contains a curvature singularity. They admit four
isometries and we consider their general Abelian gauging. The critical points
of the resulting superpotential and hence the possible domain wall solutions
differ significantly in the two regions. On one side one can construct only
singular walls, whereas in the other we found a smooth domain wall
interpolating between two infra-red critical points located exactly on the
boundary of the physical allowed parameter region.
