The top quark has been discovered in 1995 at the CDF and DO experiments
located in the Tevatron ring at the Fermilab laboratory. After more than a
decade the Tevatron collider, with its center-of-mass energy collisions of 1.96
TeV, is still the only machine capable of producing such exceptionally heavy
particle. Here I present a selection of the most recent CDF and DO measurements
performed analyzing ~ 1 fb-1 of integrated luminosity.
