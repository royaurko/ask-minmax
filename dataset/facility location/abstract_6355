Ultra-wideband (UWB) communication is an emerging wireless technology that
promises high data rates over short distances and precise locationing. The
large available bandwidth and the constraint of a maximum power spectral
density drives a unique set of system challenges. This paper addresses these
challenges using two UWB transceivers and a discrete prototype platform.
