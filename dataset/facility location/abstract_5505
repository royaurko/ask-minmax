Measurements of neutron-induced fission cross sections and light-ion
production are planned in the energy range 1-40 MeV at the upcoming Neutrons
For Science (NFS) facility. In order to prepare our detector setup for the
neutron beam with continuous energy spectrum, a simulation software was written
using the Geant4 toolkit for both measurement situations. The neutron energy
range around 20 MeV is troublesome when it comes to the cross sections used by
Geant4 since data-driven cross sections are only available below 20 MeV but not
above, where they are based on semi-empirical models. Several customisations
were made to the standard classes in Geant4 in order to produce consistent
results over the whole simulated energy range.
  Expected uncertainties are reported for both types of measurements. The
simulations have shown that a simultaneous precision measurement of the three
standard cross sections H(n,n), $^{235}$U(n,f) and $^{238}$U(n,f) relative to
each other is feasible using a triple layered target. As high resolution timing
detectors for fission fragments we plan to use Parallel Plate Avalanche
Counters (PPACs). The simulation results have put some restrictions on the
design of these detectors as well as on the target design. This study suggests
a fissile target no thicker than 2 micrometers (1.7 mg/cm$^2$) and a PPAC foil
thickness preferably less than 1 micrometer. We also comment on the usability
of Geant4 for simulation studies of neutron reactions in this energy range.
