The Global mm-VLBI Array (GMVA) is a network of 14 3\,mm and 7\,mm capable
telescopes spanning Europe and the United States, with planned extensions to
Asia. The array is capable of sensitive maps with angular resolution often
exceeding 50\,$\mu$as. Using the GMVA, a large sample of prominent $\gamma$-ray
blazars have been observed approximately 6 monthly from later 2008 until now.
Combining 3\,mm maps from the GMVA with near-in-time 7\,mm maps from the
VLBA-BU-BLAZAR program and 2\,cm maps from the MOJAVE program, we determine the
sub-pc morphology and high frequency spectral structure of $\gamma$-ray
blazars. The magnetic field strength can be estimated at different locations
along the jet under the assumption of equipartition between magnetic field and
relativistic particle energies. Making assumptions on the jet magnetic field
configuration (e.g. poloidal or toroidal), we can estimate the separation of
the mm-wave "core" and the jet base, and estimate the strength of the magnetic
field there. The results of this analysis show that on average, the magnetic
field strength decreases with a power-law $B \propto r^{-n}$, $n=0.3 \pm 0.2$.
This suggests that on average, the mm-wave "core" is $\sim 1-3$\,pc downstream
of the de-projected jet apex and that the magnetic field strength is of the
order $B_{\rm{apex}} \sim 5-20$\,kG, broadly consistent with the predictions of
magnetic jet launching (e.g. via magnetically arrested disks (MAD)).
