Infrared images of the dark cloud core B59 were obtained with the Spitzer
Space Telescope as part of the "Cores to Disks" Legacy Science project.
Photometry from 3.6-70 microns indicates at least 20 candidate low-mass young
stars near the core, more than doubling the previously known population. Out of
this group, 13 are located within about 0.1 pc in projection of the molecular
gas peak, where a new embedded source is detected. Spectral energy
distributions span the range from small excesses above photospheric levels to
rising in the mid-infrared. One other embedded object, probably associated with
the millimeter source B59-MMS1, with a bolometric luminosity L(bol) roughly 2
L(sun), has extended structure at 3.6 and 4.5 microns, possibly tracing the
edges of an outflow cavity. The measured extinction through the central part of
the core is A(V) greater than of order 45 mag. The B59 core is producing young
stars with a high efficiency.
