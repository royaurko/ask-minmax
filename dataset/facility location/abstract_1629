A novel technique for longitudinal segmentation of shashlik calorimeters has
been tested in the CERN West Area beam facility. A 25 tower very fine samplings
e.m. calorimeter has been built with vacuum photodiodes inserted in the first 8
radiation lengths to sample the initial development of the shower. Results
concerning energy resolution, impact point reconstruction and electron/pion
separation are reported.
