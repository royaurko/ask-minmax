The equation of state and the phase diagram in two-flavor QCD are
investigated by the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model
with an entanglement vertex between the chiral condensate and the
Polyakov-loop. The entanglement-PNJL (EPNJL) model reproduces LQCD data at zero
and finite chemical potential better than the PNJL model. Hadronic degrees of
freedom are taken into account by the free-hadron-gas (FHG) model with the
volume-exclusion effect due to the hadron generation. The EPNJL+FHG model
improves agreement of the EPNJL model with LQCD data particularly at small
temperature. The quarkyonic phase survives, even if the correlation between the
chiral condensate and the Polyakov loop is strong and hadron degrees of freedom
are taken into account. However, the location of the quarkyonic phase is
sensitive to the strength of the volume exclusion.
