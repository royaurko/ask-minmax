A putative powerlaw range of the probability density of velocity gradient in
high-Reynolds-number forced Burgers turbulence is studied. In the absence of
information about shock locations, elementary conservation and stationarity
relations imply that the exponent $-\alpha$ in this range satisfies
$\alpha\ge3$, if dissipation within the powerlaw range is due to isolated
shocks. A generalized model of shock birth and growth implies $\alpha=7/2$ if
initial data and forcing are spatially homogeneous and obey Gaussian
statistics. Arbitrary values $\alpha\ge3$ can be realized by suitably
constructed homogeneous, non-Gaussian initial data and forcing.
