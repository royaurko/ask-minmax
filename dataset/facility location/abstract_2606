The identification of single clusters in the electronic signals produced by
ionizing particles within a drift chamber is expected to significantly improve
the performances of this kind of detectors in terms of particle identification
capabilities and space resolution. In order to develop refined cluster
recognition algorithms, it is essential to measure the response of the chamber
and its electronics to single ionization clusters. This can be done by
irradiating the chamber with X-rays. We report here on the studies performed on
a drift chamber prototype for the MEG-II experiment at the X-ray facility of
the INFN Frascati's National Laboratories "XLab Frascati". The prototype is
operated with a helium-isobutane mixture and instrumented with high bandwidth
custom pre-amplifiers. The results of this study have been used to develop an
innovative method for cluster recognition, based on the Wiener filter
technique. As a side measurement, we also performed a study of the gas gain in
a configuration which is similar to that of the MEG-II experiment.
