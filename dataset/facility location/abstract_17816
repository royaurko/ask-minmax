We report on total-energy electronic structure calculations in the
density-functional theory performed for the ultra-thin atomic layers of Si on
Ag(111) surfaces. We find several distinct stable silicene structures:
$\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$, $3\times3$, $\sqrt{7}\times\sqrt{7}$ with the
thickness of Si increasing from monolayer to quad-layer. The structural
bistability and tristability of the multilayer silicene structures on Ag
surfaces are obtained, where the calculated transition barriers infer the
occurrence of the flip-flop motion at low temperature. The calculated STM
images agree well with the experimental observations. We also find the stable
existence of $2\times1$ $\pi$-bonded chain and $7\times7$ dimer-adatom-stacking
fault Si(111)-surface structures on Ag(111), which clearly shows the crossover
of silicene-silicon structures for the multilayer Si on Ag surfaces. We further
find the absence of the Dirac states for multilayer silicene on Ag(111) due to
the covalent interactions of silicene-Ag interface and Si-Si interlayer.
Instead, we find a new state near Fermi level composed of $\pi$ orbitals
locating on the surface layer of $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ multilayer silicene,
which satisfies the hexagonal symmetry and exhibits the linear energy
dispersion. By examining the electronic properties of $2\times1$ $\pi$-bonded
chain structures, we find that the surface-related $\pi$ states of multilayer
Si structures are robust on Ag surfaces.
