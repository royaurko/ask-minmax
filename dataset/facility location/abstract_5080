We propose a framework for inferring the latent attitudes or preferences of
users by performing probabilistic first-order logical reasoning over the social
network graph. Our method answers questions about Twitter users like {\em Does
this user like sushi?} or {\em Is this user a New York Knicks fan?} by building
a probabilistic model that reasons over user attributes (the user's location or
gender) and the social network (the user's friends and spouse), via inferences
like homophily (I am more likely to like sushi if spouse or friends like sushi,
I am more likely to like the Knicks if I live in New York). The algorithm uses
distant supervision, semi-supervised data harvesting and vector space models to
extract user attributes (e.g. spouse, education, location) and preferences
(likes and dislikes) from text. The extracted propositions are then fed into a
probabilistic reasoner (we investigate both Markov Logic and Probabilistic Soft
Logic). Our experiments show that probabilistic logical reasoning significantly
improves the performance on attribute and relation extraction, and also
achieves an F-score of 0.791 at predicting a users likes or dislikes,
significantly better than two strong baselines.
