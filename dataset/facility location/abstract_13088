Stellar spectroscopic surveys may bring useful statistical information on the
links between Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs) and interstellar environment.
DIB databases can also be used as a complementary tool for locating
interstellar (IS) clouds. Our goal is to develop fully automated methods of DIB
measurements to be applied to extensive data from stellar surveys. We present a
method appropriate for early-type nearby stars, its application to
high-resolution spectra of 130 targets recorded with ESO FEROS spectrograph,
and comparisons with other determinations. Using a DIB average profile deduced
from the most reddened stars, we performed an automated fitting of a
combination of a smooth stellar continuum, the DIB profile, and, when
necessary, a synthetic telluric transmission. Measurements are presented for 16
DIBs in the optical domain that could be extracted automatically: 4726.8,
4762.6, 4963.9, 5780.4, 5797.1, 5849.8, 6089.8, 6196.0, 6203.0-6204.5, 6269.8,
6283.8, 6379.3, 6445.3, 6613.6, 6660.7, and 6699.3 {\AA}.
