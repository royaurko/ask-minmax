We report on experimental evidence of universality in ultracold 7Li atoms'
three-body recombination loss in the vicinity of a Feshbach resonance. We
observe a recombination minimum and an Efimov resonance in regions of positive
and negative scattering lengths, respectively, which are connected through the
pole of the Feshbach resonance. Both observed features lie deeply within the
range of validity of the universal theory and we find that the relations
between their properties, i.e. widths and locations, are in an excellent
agreement with the theoretical predictions.
