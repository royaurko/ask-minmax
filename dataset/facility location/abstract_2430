We report on measurements performed at The Svedberg Laboratory (TSL) to
characterize a proton-neutron converter for independent fission yield studies
at the IGISOL-JYFLTRAP facility (Jyv\"askyl\"a, Finland). A 30 MeV proton beam
impinged on a 5 mm water-cooled Beryllium target. Two independent experimental
techniques have been used to measure the neutron spectrum: a Time of Flight
(TOF) system used to estimate the high-energy contribution, and a Bonner Sphere
Spectrometer able to provide precise results from thermal energies up to 20
MeV. An overlap between the energy regions covered by the two systems will
permit a cross-check of the results from the different techniques. In this
paper, the measurement and analysis techniques will be presented together with
some preliminary results.
