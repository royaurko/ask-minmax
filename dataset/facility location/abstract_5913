We present a pedagogical account of the Lee-Yang theory of equilibrium phase
transitions and review recent advances in applying this theory to
nonequilibrium systems. Through both general considerations and explicit
studies of specific models, we show that the Lee-Yang approach can be used to
locate and classify phase transitions in nonequilibrium steady states.
