The first results from Double Chooz with 100 days of data measured
$\sin^2(2\theta_{13}) = 0.086 \pm 0.051$. Backgrounds contribute significantly
to the systematic uncertainty budget. Using the incoming neutrino
directionality we will attempt to further separate the inverse beta decay
signal from backgrounds. The CHOOZ experiment completed a similar analysis and
found that the neutrino source can be located to within a cone of half-aperture
of 18 degrees at the 68% C.L. We study the possible improvement of this result
by Double Chooz.
