We investigate gauge coupling unification in higher dimensional GUT models
with split supersymmetry. We focus on 5d and 6d orbifold GUTs, which permit a
simple solution to several problems of 4D GUTs as well as control over GUT
scale threshold corrections. In orbifold GUTs, calculable threshold corrections
can raise or lower the prediction for $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ in a way that depends on
the location of Higgs fields. On the other hand, split supersymmetry lowers the
prediction for $\alpha_s(M_Z)$. Consequently, split supersymmetry changes the
preferred location of the Higgs fields in orbifold GUTs. In the simplest
models, we find that gauge coupling unification favors higgs doublets that live
on the orbifold fixed points instead of in the bulk. In addition, relatively
high scales of supersymmetry breaking of $10^{10\pm 2}$ GeV are generically
favored.
