We present experimental results for Rayleigh-Benard convection patterns in a
cylindrical container with static side-wall forcing induced by a heater. This
forcing stabilized a pattern of concentric rolls (a target pattern) with the
central roll (the umbilicus) at the center of the cell after a jump from the
conduction to the convection state. A quasi-static increase of the control
parameter (epsilon) beyond 0.8 caused the umbilicus of the pattern to move off
center. As observed by others, a further quasi-static increase of epsilon up to
15.6 caused a sequence of transitions. Each transition began with the
displacement of the umbilicus and then proceeded with the loss of one
convection roll at the umbilicus and the return of the umbilicus to a location
near the center of the cell. Alternatively, with decreasing epsilon new rolls
formed at the umbilicus but large umbilicus displacements did not occur. In
addition to quantitative measurements of the umbilicus displacement, we
determined and analyzed the entire wave-director field of each image. The wave
numbers varied in the axial direction, with minima at the umbilicus and at the
cell wall and a maximum at a radial position close to 2/3 Gamma. The wave
numbers at the maximum showed hysteretic jumps at the transitions, but on
average agreed well with the theoretical predictions for the wave numbers
selected in the far field of an infinitely extended target pattern.
