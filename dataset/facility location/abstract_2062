Graphene nanoribbons have attracted attention for their novel electronic and
spin transport properties1-6, and because nanoribbons less than 10 nm wide have
a band gap that can be used to make field effect transistors. However,
producing nanoribbons of very high quality, or in high volumes, remains a
challenge. Here, we show that pristine few-layer nanoribbons can be produced by
unzipping mildly gas-phase oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotube using
mechanical sonication in an organic solvent. The nanoribbons exhibit very high
quality, with smooth edges (as seen by high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy), low ratios of disorder to graphitic Raman bands, and the highest
electrical conductance and mobility reported to date (up to 5e2/h and 1500
cm2/Vs for ribbons 10-20 nm in width). Further, at low temperature, the
nanoribbons exhibit phase coherent transport and Fabry-Perot interference,
suggesting minimal defects and edge roughness. The yield of nanoribbons was ~2%
of the starting raw nanotube soot material, which was significantly higher than
previous methods capable of producing high quality narrow nanoribbons1. The
relatively high yield synthesis of pristine graphene nanoribbons will make
these materials easily accessible for a wide range of fundamental and practical
applications.
