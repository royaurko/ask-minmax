Redshifts of a supernova (SN) and gamma-ray burst (GRB) samples are compared
with the pixel temperatures of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)
seven-years data, the pixels locations corresponding to the SN and GRB sky
coordinates. We have found a statistically significant correlation of the SN
redshifts with the WMAP data, the average temperature deviation being +29.9
+-4.4 microK for the redshifts z ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 and +8.6 +-1.3 microK
for z within the range (0.0,0.4). The latter value accords with the theoretical
estimates for the distortion of the cosmic microwave background due to the
integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, whereas the larger anomaly for higher redshifts
should be studied in more detail in the future.
