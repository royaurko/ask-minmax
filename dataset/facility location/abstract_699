The growing popularity of location-based systems, allowing unknown/untrusted
servers to easily collect huge amounts of information regarding users'
location, has recently started raising serious privacy concerns. In this paper
we study geo-indistinguishability, a formal notion of privacy for
location-based systems that protects the user's exact location, while allowing
approximate information - typically needed to obtain a certain desired service
- to be released. Our privacy definition formalizes the intuitive notion of
protecting the user's location within a radius r with a level of privacy that
depends on r, and corresponds to a generalized version of the well-known
concept of differential privacy. Furthermore, we present a perturbation
technique for achieving geo-indistinguishability by adding controlled random
noise to the user's location. We demonstrate the applicability of our technique
on a LBS application. Finally, we compare our mechanism with other ones in the
literature. It turns our that our mechanism offers the best privacy guarantees,
for the same utility, among all those which do not depend on the prior.
