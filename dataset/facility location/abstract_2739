We present Cepheids located in the close neighborhood of star clusters from
the Magellanic Clouds. 204 and 132 such stars were found in the LMC and SMC,
respectively. The lists of objects were constructed based on catalogs of
Cepheids and star clusters, recently published by the OGLE-II collaboration.
Location of selected Cepheids on the sky indicates that many of them are very
likely cluster members. Photometric data of Cepheids and clusters are available
from the OGLE archive.
