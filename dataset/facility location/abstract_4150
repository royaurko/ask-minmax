We present results from 43 GHz (VLBA, six epochs from 2012.2 to 2013.2) and
86 GHz (GMVA, one epoch in 2012.4) observations toward the basis of the jet in
the TeV Blazar Mrk 501. The 43-GHz data analysis reveals a new feature located
northeast of the radio core, with a flux density of several tens of mJy,
perpendicularly to the jet axis. The 86-GHz image shows the jet feature located
0.75 mas southeast of the radio core, which is consistent with the previous
result. The location of Gaussian model for 0.75 mas feature does not coincide
with those for the jets in the 43-GHz image, however, a distribution of
emission is found. We also discuss the spectral indices of the core, the
northeast feature, and the jet feature between 43 GHz and 86 GHz, which show
flat-to-steep, steep, and flat-to-invert, respectively.
