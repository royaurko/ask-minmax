Rather than anonymizing social graphs by generalizing them to super
nodes/edges or adding/removing nodes and edges to satisfy given privacy
parameters, recent methods exploit the semantics of uncertain graphs to achieve
privacy protection of participating entities and their relationship. These
techniques anonymize a deterministic graph by converting it into an uncertain
form. In this paper, we propose a generalized obfuscation model based on
uncertain adjacency matrices that keep expected node degrees equal to those in
the unanonymized graph. We analyze two recently proposed schemes and show their
fitting into the model. We also point out disadvantages in each method and
present several elegant techniques to fill the gap between them. Finally, to
support fair comparisons, we develop a new tradeoff quantifying framework by
leveraging the concept of incorrectness in location privacy research.
Experiments on large social graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our
schemes.
