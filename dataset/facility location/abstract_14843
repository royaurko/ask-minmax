High resolution simulations are used to map out the detailed structure of two
long-lived stable belts of asteroid orbits in the inner Solar system. The
Vulcanoid belt extends from 0.09 to 0.20 astronomical units (au), though with a
gaps at 0.15 and 0.18 au corresponding to de-stabilising mean motion resonances
with Mercury and Venus. As collisional evolution proceeds slower at larger
heliocentric distances, kilometre-sized or larger Vulcanoids are most likely to
be found in the region between 0.16 and 0.18 au. The optimum location in which
to search for Vulcanoids is at geocentric ecliptic longitudes roughly between 9
and 10 degrees. Dynamically speaking, the Earth-Mars belt between 1.08-1.28 au
is an extremely stable repository for asteroids on nearly circular orbits. It
is interrupted at 1.21 au due to the 3:4 commensurability with the Earth, while
secular resonances with Saturn are troublesome beyond 1.17 au. These detailed
maps of the fine structure of the belts can be used to plan search
methodologies. Strategies for detecting members of the belts are discussed,
including the use of infrared wide-field imaging with VISTA, and forthcoming
European Space Agency satellite missions like GAIA and BepiColombo.
