In this paper we present the Privacy Dashboard -- a tool designed to inform
and empower the people using mobile devices, by introducing features such as
Remote Privacy Protection, Backup, Adjustable Location Accuracy, Permission
Control and Secondary-User Mode. We have implemented our solution on FirefoxOS
and conducted user studies to verify the usefulness and usability of our tool.
The paper starts with a discussion of different aspects of mobile privacy, how
users perceive it and how much they are willing to give up for better
usability. Then we describe the tool in detail, presenting what incentives
drove us to certain design decisions. During our studies we tried to understand
how users interact with the system and what are their priorities. We have
verified our hypothesis, and the impact of the educational aspects on the
decisions about the privacy settings. We show that by taking a user-centric
development of privacy extensions we can reduce the gap between protection and
usability.
