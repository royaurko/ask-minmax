The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer has uncovered a population of young
stellar objects in the Western Circinus molecular cloud. Images show the YSOs
to be clustered into two main groups that are coincident with dark filamentary
structure in the nebulosity. Analysis of photometry shows numerous Class I and
II objects. The locations of several of these objects are found to correspond
to known dense cores and CO outflows. Class I objects tend to be concentrated
in dense aggregates, and Class II objects more evenly distributed throughout
the region.
