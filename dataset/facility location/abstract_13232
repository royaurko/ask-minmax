The strength functions of giant dipole resonance (GDR) in oxygen $^{18 -
24}$O, calcium $^{50 - 60}$Ca, and tin $^{120 - 130}$Sn isotopes are calculated
within the phonon damping model under three approximations: without superfluid
pairing, including BCS pairing, and exact pairing gaps. The analysis of the
numerical results shows that exact pairing decreases the two-neutron separation
energy in light nuclei, but increases it in heavy nuclei as compared to that
obtained within the BCS theory. In neutron-rich medium and heavy nuclei, exact
pairing significantly enhances the strength located at the low-energy tail of
the GDR, which is usually associated with the pygmy dipole resonance. The line
shape of the GDR changes significantly with increasing the neutron number
within an isotopic chain if the model parameter is kept fixed at the value
determined for the stable isotope.
