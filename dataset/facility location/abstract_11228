We investigated the viscoelastic properties of colloid-polymer mixtures at
intermediate colloid volume fraction and varying polymer concentrations,
thereby tuning the attractive interactions. Within the examined range of
polymer concentrations, the samples ranged from fluids to gels. Already in the
liquid phase the viscoelastic properties significantly changed when approaching
the gelation boundary, indicating the formation of clusters and transient
networks. This is supported by an increasing correlation length of the density
fluctuations, observed by static light scattering and microscopy. At the same
time, the correlation function determined by dynamic light scattering
completely decays, indicating the absence of dynamical arrest. Upon increasing
the polymer concentration beyond the gelation boundary, the rheological
properties changed qualitatively again, now they are consistent with the
formation of colloidal gels. Our experimental results, namely the location of
the gelation boundary as well as the elastic (storage) and viscous (loss)
moduli, are compared to different theoretical models. These include
consideration of the escape time as well as predictions for the viscoelastic
moduli based on scaling relations and Mode Coupling Theories (MCT).
