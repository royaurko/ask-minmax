The first four naked high purity Germanium detectors were installed
successfully in liquid nitrogen in the GENIUS-Test-Facility (GENIUS-TF) in the
GRAN SASSO Underground Laboratory on May 5, 2003. This is the first time ever
that this novel technique aiming at extreme background reduction in search for
rare decays is going to be tested underground. First operational parameters are
presented.
