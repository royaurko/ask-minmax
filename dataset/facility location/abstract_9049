We present two BeppoSAX observations of BL Lacertae as part of a
multiwavelength radio-to-TeV campaign. During the first observation we observe
a faint Compton spectrum, while during the second, we detect a synchrotron
spectrum with the highest [2-10] keV flux ever measured; above 10 keV an
inverse Compton component begin to dominate. The synchrotron flux is very
variable with time scales of 1 hr. We describe four different SED shifting the
synchrotron peak both in frequency and flux intensity and we sketch a scenario
in which a blob moves along a jet and can be located in or outside the BLR.
This implies different radiative mechanism at work, SSC or external Compton,
producing different high energy spectra.
