We numerically investigate the radial dependence of the velocity and
temperature fluctuations and of the time-averaged heat flux $\bar{j}(r)$ in a
cylindrical Rayleigh-B\'enard cell with aspect ratio \Gamma=1 for Rayleigh
numbers Ra between $2 \times 10^6$ and $2\times 10^{9}$ at a fixed Prandtl
number Pr = 5.2. The numerical results reveal that the heat flux close to the
sidewall is larger than in the center and that, just as the global heat
transport, it has an effective power law dependence on the Rayleigh number,
$\bar{j}(r)\propto Ra^{\gamma_j(r)}$. The scaling exponent $\gamma_j(r)$
decreases monotonically from 0.43 near the axis ($r \approx 0$) to 0.29 close
to the side walls ($r \approx D/2$). The effective exponents near the axis and
the side wall agree well with the measurements of Shang et al. (Phys.\ Rev.\
Lett.\ \textbf{100}, 244503, 2008) and the predictions of Grossmann and Lohse
(Phys.\ Fluids \textbf{16}, 1070, 2004). Extrapolating our results to large
Rayleigh number would imply a crossover at $Ra\approx 10^{15}$, where the heat
flux near the axis would begin to dominate. In addition, we find that the local
heat flux is more than twice as high at the location where warm or cold plumes
go up or down, than in the plume depleted regions.
