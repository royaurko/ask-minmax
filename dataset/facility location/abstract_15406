The planets capture model for the eruption of V838 Mon is discussed. We used
three methods to estimate the location where the planets were consumed. There
is a nice consistency for the results of the three different methods, and we
find that the typical stopping / slowing radius for the planets is about 1Ro.
The three peaks in the optical light curve of V838 Mon are either explained by
the swallowing of three planets at different radii or by three steps in the
slowing down process of a single planet. We discuss the other models offered
for the outburst of V838 Mon, and conclude that the binary merger model and the
planet/s scenario seem to be the most promising. These two models have several
similarities, and the main differences are the stellar evolutionary stage, and
the mass of the accreted material. We show that the energy emitted in the V838
Mon event is consistent with the planets scenario. We suggest a few
explanations for the trigger for the outburst and for the double structure of
the optical peaks in the light curve of V838 Mon.
