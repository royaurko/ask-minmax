The supergiant fast X-ray transient IGR J08408-4503 was discovered by
INTEGRAL on May 15, 2006, during a bright flare. The source shows sporadic
recurrent short bright flares, reaching a peak luminosity of 10^36 erg s^-1
within less than one hour. The companion star is HD 74194, an Ob5Ib(f)
supergiant star located at 3 kpc in the Vela region. We report the light curves
and broad-band spectra (0.1-200 keV) of all the three flares of IGR J08408-4503
detected up to now based on INTEGRAL and Swift data. The flare spectra are well
described by a power-law model with a high energy cut-off at ~15 keV. The
absorption column density during the flares was found to be ~10^21 cm^-2,
indicating a very low matter density around the compact object. Using the
supergiant donor star parameters, the wind accretion conditions imply an
orbital period of the order of one year, a spin period of the order of hours
and a magnetic field of the order of 10^13 G.
