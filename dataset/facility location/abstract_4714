The present design of the main accelerating structure for CLIC is based on
heavy damping (WDS) with a Q of ~10. The wakefield suppression in this case
entails locating the damping materials in relatively close proximity to the
accelerating cells. Herein we present an alternate design for the main
accelerating structures. We detune the lowest dipole band by prescribing a
Gaussian distribution to the cell parameters and consider moderate damping
Q~500 to prevent the recoherence of the modes; in this case the damping
materials can be located at an extended distance from the accelerating
structure. The procedure to achieve a well-damped wakefield is described.
Results are presented elucidating the various designs including the current one
which is being developed to incorporate r.f. breakdown, pulse surface heating
and beam dynamics constraints.
