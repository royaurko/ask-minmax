We present Australia Telescope Compact Array observations of the supernova
remnant (SNR) G309.2-00.6. In a 1.3-GHz continuum image the remnant appears as
a near-circular shell, but with two brightened and distorted arcs of emission
on opposite sides. HI absorption against the SNR yields a distance in the range
5.4 to 14.1 kpc, corresponding to an age (1-20)x10^3 yr. On the basis of the
SNR's morphology we argue that it is a younger analogue of the W50/SS433
system, and that its unusual appearance is a result of opposed jets or outflows
from a central source. A jet-like feature and breaks in the shell can both be
seen along the axis of proposed outflow, providing further support for this
interpretation; the central source itself is not detected. The SNR may be
interacting with the adjacent HII region RCW 80 through an extension of the
proposed outflow beyond its shell. This would put the SNR at the lower limit of
its distance range and would imply an age <4000 yr. We consider other SNRs
similar to G309.2-00.6, and propose remnants whose shells are affected by jets
as one of several classes of SNR from which the presence of a central source
can be inferred.
