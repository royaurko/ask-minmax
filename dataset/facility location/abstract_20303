The explosive fate of massive stripped Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars is a key open
question in stellar physics. An appealing option is that hydrogen-deficient W-R
stars are the progenitors of some H-poor supernova (SN) explosions of Types
IIb, Ib, and Ic. A blue object, having luminosity and colors consistent with
those of some W-R stars, has been recently identified at the location of a
SN~Ib in pre-explosion images but has not yet been conclusively determined to
have been the progenitor. Similar previous works have so far only resulted in
nondetections. Comparison of early photometric observations of Type Ic
supernovae with theoretical models suggests that the progenitor stars had radii
<10^12 cm, as expected for some W-R stars. However, the hallmark signature of
W-R stars, their emission-line spectra, cannot be probed by such studies. Here,
we report the detection of strong emission lines in an early-time spectrum of
SN 2013cu (iPTF13ast; Type IIb) obtained ~15.5 hr after explosion ("flash
spectroscopy"). We identify W-R-like wind signatures suggesting a progenitor of
the WN(h) subclass. The extent of this dense wind may indicate increased mass
loss from the progenitor shortly prior to its explosion, consistent with recent
theoretical predictions.
