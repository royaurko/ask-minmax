We present a new staggered discretization of the Dirac operator. In
comparison with standard staggered fermions, real and imaginary parts are
located in different nodes. Doubling gives only a doublet of Dirac fermions
which we propose to interpret as a physical (lepton or quark) doublet. Contrary
to usual staggered fermions, we have no exact chiral symmetry but obtain a
generalization of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation.
