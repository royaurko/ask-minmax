Global localization of a mobile robot using planar surface segments extracted
from depth images is considered. The robot's environment is represented by a
topological map consisting of local models, each representing a particular
location modeled by a set of planar surface segments. The discussed
localization approach segments a depth image acquired by a 3D camera into
planar surface segments which are then matched to model surface segments. The
robot pose is estimated by the Extended Kalman Filter using surface segment
pairs as measurements. The reliability and accuracy of the considered approach
are experimentally evaluated using a mobile robot equipped by a Microsoft
Kinect sensor.
