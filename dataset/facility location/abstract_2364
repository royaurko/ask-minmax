The eta-mesic nuclei in which the {\eta} meson is bound with nucleus via
strong interaction was postulated already in 1986, however till now no
experiment confirmed empirically its existence. The discovery of this new kind
of an exotic nuclear matter would be very important for better understanding of
the {\eta} meson structure and its interaction with nucleons. The search for
{\eta}-mesic helium is carried out with high statistic and high acceptance with
the WASA-at-COSY detection setup in the Research Center Juelich. The search is
conducted via the measurement of the excitation function for the chosen decay
channels of the 4He-{\eta} system. Till now two reactions dd -->
(4He-{\eta})_bs --> 3Hep\pi- and dd --> (4He-{\eta})_bs --> 3 Hen{\pi}0 were
measured with the beam momentum ramped around the eta production threshold.
This report includes the description of experimental method and status of the
analysis.
