The purpose of our study is to develop a new, 3-dimensional dosimetry system
to verify the accuracy of dose deliveries in Leksell Gamma Knife-Perfexion TM
(LGKP) (Elekta, Norcross, GA, USA). The instrument consists of a moving head
phantom, an embedded thin active layer and a CCD camera system and was designed
to be mounted to LGKP. As an active material concentrically located in the
hemispheric head phantom, we choose Gafchromic EBT3 films and Gd2O2S;Tb
phosphor sheets for dosimetric measurements. Also, to compensate the lack of
backscatter, we located a 1 cm thick PMMA plate downstream of the active layer.
The PMMA plate was transparent for scintillation lights to reach the CCD with
1200x1200 pixels by a 5.2 um pitch. Using this system, three hundred images by
a 0.2 mm slice gap were acquired under each of three collimator setups, i.e. 4
mm, 8 mm, and 16 mm, respectively. The 2D projected images taken by CCD camera
were compared with the dose distributions measured by EBT3 films in the same
conditions. All 2D distributions were normalized by the maximum values derived
by fitting peaks for each collimator setup. The FWHM differences of 2D profiles
between of CCD images and of film doses were measured to be less than 0.3 mm.
The scanning task for whole peak regions took less than three minutes with the
new instrument. It could be utilized as a QA tool for the Gamma Knife
radiosurgery system instead of film dosimetry, the use of which requires much
more time and resources.
