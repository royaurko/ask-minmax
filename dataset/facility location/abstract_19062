We present observations of the afterglow of GRB 080319B at optical, mm and
radio frequencies from a few hours to 67 days after the burst. Present
observations along with other published multi-wavelength data have been used to
study the light-curves and spectral energy distributions of the burst
afterglow. The nature of this brightest cosmic explosion has been explored
based on the observed properties and it's comparison with the afterglow models.
Our results show that the observed features of the afterglow fits equally good
with the Inter Stellar Matter and the Stellar Wind density profiles of the
circum-burst medium. In case of both density profiles, location of the maximum
synchrotron frequency $\nu_m$ is below optical and the value of cooling break
frequency $\nu_c$ is below $X-$rays, $\sim 10^{4}$s after the burst. Also, the
derived value of the Lorentz factor at the time of naked eye brightness is
$\sim 300$ with the corresponding blast wave size of $\sim 10^{18}$ cm. The
numerical fit to the multi-wavelength afterglow data constraints the values of
physical parameters and the emission mechanism of the burst.
