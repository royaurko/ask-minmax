We conducted a 4 epoch 3 month VLBA proper motion study of H$_2$O masers
toward an intermediate-mass class 0 source IRAS 20050+2720 MMS1 (d=700 pc).
  From milli-arcsecond (mas) resolution VLBA images, we found two groups of H2O
maser spots at the center of the submillimeter core of MMS1. One group consists
of more than $\sim 50$ intense maser spots; the other group consisting of
several weaker maser spots is located at 18 AU south-west of the intense group.
Distribution of the maser spots in the intense group shows an arc-shaped
structure which includes the maser spots that showed a clear velocity gradient.
The spatial and velocity structures of the maser spots in the arc-shape did not
significantly change through the 4 epochs. Furthermore, we found a relative
proper motion between the two groups. Their projected separation increased by
1.13+/-0.11 mas over the 4 epochs along a line connecting them. The spatial and
velocity structures of the intense group and the relative proper motions
strongly suggest that the maser emission is associated with a protostellar jet.
Comparing the observed LSR velocities with calculated radial velocities from a
simple biconical jet model, we conclude that the most of the maser emission are
likely to be associated with an accelerating biconical jet which has large
opening angle. The large opening angle of the jet traced by the masers would
support the hypothesis that poor jet collimation is an inherent property of
luminous (proto)stars.
