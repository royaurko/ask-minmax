We have imaged the 880 micron continuum emission from the "proplyds" in the
center of the Trapezium Cluster in Orion using the Submillimeter Array with a
beam size 1.5'' FWHM and an rms of 2.7 mJy. Five sources are detected with
fluxes in the range 18 to 38 mJy, which includes dust emission from four
proplyds and ionized gas from theta1 Ori G. The total masses of the detected
proplyds derived from their dust emission range from 0.013 to 0.024 Msun
assuming a dust temperature of 20 K and mass opacity of 0.03 cm^2/g. The
eighteen other proplyds within the field-of-view were not formally detected
individually, but by combining the fluxes measured at their locations, an
average flux of 1.1mJy was determined for them on a statistical basis,
corresponding to a mass of 8e-4 Msun. The four detected proplyds have
sufficient disk mass bound to their central stars to form planetary systems on
the scale of our Solar System.
