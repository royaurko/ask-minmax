FUSE and IUE observations of Sk -69 246, a WN 6 star to the north of 30 Dor,
reveal the existence of LMC interstellar gas in at least 3 velocity
components.In one of these components FUSE spectra show strong absorption by
molecular hydrogen with a column density of log N(H_2)=19.6. We investigate the
physical conditions in this cloud, which is probably located near the H II
region surrounding Sk -69 246. HD and CO with column densities of about 13.9
and 13.0 dex, respectively, are detected. The N(CO)-to-N(H_2) ratio is
consistent with values found in the Galaxy. From the population of the
rotational levels of H_2 we derive a gas temperature of 72 K and a radiation
field U=3*10^-15 erg/(s*cm^3) at 1000 nm. The fractional abundance
f=2N(H_2)/[N(H I)+2N(H_2)] is approximately 0.07, rather high for an
E(B-V)<0.1.
