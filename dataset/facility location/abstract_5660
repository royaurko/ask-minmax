A mosaic of 5 \ros~PSPC pointed observations in the Galactic plane
($l\sim25^{\circ}$) reveals X-ray shadows in the $0.5-2.0$ keV band cast by
distant molecular clouds. The observed on-cloud and off-cloud X-ray fluxes
indicate that $\sim15$% and $\sim37$% of the diffuse X-ray background in this
direction in the \tq~keV and 1.5 keV bands, respectively, originates behind the
molecular gas which is located at $\sim$3 kpc from the Sun. The implication of
the derived background X-ray flux beyond the absorbing molecular cloud is
consistent with, and lends further support to recent observations of a Galactic
X-ray bulge.
