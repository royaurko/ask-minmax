We compute locations of sonic points and standing shock waves in a thin,
axisymmetric, adiabatic flow around a Schwarzschild black hole. We use
completely analytical method to achieve our goal. Our results are compared with
those obtained numerically and a good agreement is seen. Our results positively
prove the existence of shocks in centrifugal pressure dominated flows. We
indicate how our results could be used to obtain spectral properties and
frequencies of shock oscillations which may be directly related to the
quasi-periodic oscillations of hard X-rays.
