The observed SEDs of a sample of 60 OH/IR stars are fitted using a radiative
transfer model of a dusty envelope. Among the whole sample, 21 stars have
reliable phase-lag distances while the others have less accurate distances.
L*-P,Mlr-P and Mlr-L* relations have been plotted for these stars. It is found
that type E (with emission feature at 10um and type A (with absorption feature
at 10um) OH/IR stars have different L*-P and Mlr-L* relations while both of
them follow a single Mlr-P relation. The type E stars are proven to be located
in the area without large scale dense interstellar medium while the type A
stars are located probably in dense interstellar medium. It is argued here that
this may indicate the two types of OH/IR stars have different chemical
composition or zero age main sequence mass and so evolve in different ways.
This conclusion has reinforced the argument by Chen et al.(2001) who reached a
similar conclusion from the galactic distribution of about 1000 OH/IR stars
with the IRAS low-resolution spectra (LRS).
