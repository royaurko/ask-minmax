I present a matched-wave asymptotic analysis of the driving of solar
oscillations by a general localised source. The analysis provides a simple
mathematical description of the asymmetric peaks in the power spectrum in terms
of the relative locations of eigenmodes and troughs in the spectral response.
It is suggested that the difference in measured phase function between the
modes and the troughs in the spectrum will provide a key diagnostic of the
source of the oscillations. I also suggest a form for the asymmetric line
profiles to be used in the fitting of solar power spectra.
  Finally I present a comparison between the numerical and asymptotic
descriptions of the oscillations. The numerical results bear out the
qualitative features suggested by the asymptotic analysis but suggest that
numerical calculations of the locations of the troughs will be necessary for a
quantitative comparison with the observations.
