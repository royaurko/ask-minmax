New subarcsecond FUV observations of T Tau with HST/STIS show spatially
resolved structures in the 2"x2" area around the star. The structures show in
multiline emission of fluorescent H_2 pumped by Lyman alpha. One emission
structure follows the cavity walls observed around T Tau N in scattered light
in the optical. A temperature greater or equal to 1000K is required to have
enough population in the H_2 to produce the observed fluorescent lines; in the
cool environment of the T Tau system, shock heating is required to achieve this
temperature at distances of a few tens of AU. Fluorescent H_2 along the cavity
wall represents the best evidence to date for the action of low-density,
wide-opening-angle outflows driving cavities into the molecular medium at
scales smaller than 100 AU. A southern region of emission consists of two arcs,
with shape and orientation similar to the arcs of H_2 2.12 microns and
forbidden line emission crossing the outflow associated with the embedded
system T Tau S. This region is located near the centroid of forbidden line
emission at the blueshifted lobe of the N-S outflow.
