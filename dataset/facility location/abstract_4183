Compton scattering of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons on galaxy
cluster electrons produces a linear polarization, which contains some
information on the local quadrupole at the cluster location. We use N-body
simulations to create, for the first time, maps of this polarization signal. We
then look at the different properties of the polarization with respect to the
cluster position and redshift.
