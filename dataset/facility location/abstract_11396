The Cygnus region of the Galactic plane contains many known supernova
remnants, pulsars, X-ray and GeV gamma-ray emitters which make it a prime
candidate for a Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray survey in the Northern
Hemisphere. The VERITAS observatory, an array of four atmospheric Cherenkov
telescopes located at the base of Mt. Hopkins in southern Arizona, USA, has
carried out an extensive survey of the Cygnus region between 67 and 82 degrees
in galactic longitude and between -1 and 4 degrees in galactic latitude. The
survey, comprising more than 140 hours of observations, reaches an average VHE
flux sensitivity of better than 4% of the Crab Nebula at energies above 200
GeV. Here we report on the preliminary results from this survey.
