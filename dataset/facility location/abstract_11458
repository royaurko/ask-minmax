Under certain circumstances, three or more interacting particles may form
bound states. While the general few-body problem is not analytically solvable,
the so-called Efimov trimers appear for a system of three particles with
resonant two-body interactions. The binding energies of these trimers are
predicted to be universally connected to each other, independent of the
microscopic details of the interaction. By exploiting a Feshbach resonance to
widely tune the interactions between trapped ultracold lithium atoms, we find
evidence for two universally connected Efimov trimers and their associated
four-body bound states. A total of eleven precisely determined three- and
four-body features are found in the inelastic loss spectrum. Their relative
locations on either side of the resonance agree well with universal theory,
while a systematic deviation from universality is found when comparing features
across the resonance.
