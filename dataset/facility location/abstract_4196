A metastable state, characterized by a low degree of mass localization is
identified using Density Functional Theory. This free energy minimum, located
through the proper evaluation of the competing terms in the free energy
functional, is independent of the specific form of the DFT used. Computer
simulation results on particle motion indicate that this heterogeneous state
corresponds to the supercooled state.
