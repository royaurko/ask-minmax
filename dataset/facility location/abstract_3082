First principles band-structure calculations for large supercells of
Ba$_{2}$CuO$_{4-\delta}$ and La$_{2}$CuO$_{4-\delta}$ with different
distributions and concentrations of oxygen vacancies show that the effective
doping on copper sites strongly depends on where the vacancy is located. A
vacancy within the Cu layer produces a weak doping effect while a vacancy
located at an apical oxygen site acts as a stronger electron dopant on the
copper layers and gradually brings the electronic structure close to that of
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_{4}$. These effects are robust and only depend marginally
on lattice distortions. Our results show that deoxygenation can reduce the
effect of traditional La/Sr or La/Nd substitutions. Our study clearly
identifies location of the dopant in the crystal structure as an important
factor in doping of the cuprate planes.
