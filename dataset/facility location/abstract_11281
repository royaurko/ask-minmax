In this paper we report on observations of the CoRoT LRa1 field with the
Berlin Exoplanet Search Telescope (BEST). The current paper is part of the
series of papers describing the results of our stellar variability survey. BEST
is a small aperture telescope with a wide field-of-view (FOV). It is dedicated
to search for stellar variability within the target fields of the CoRoT space
mission to aid in minimizing false-alarm rates and identify potential targets
for additional science. The LRa1 field is CoRoT's third observed field and the
second long run field located in the galactic anticenter direction. We observed
the LRa1 stellar field on 23 nights between November and March 2005/2006. From
6099 stars marked as variable, 39 were classified as periodic variable stars
and 27 of them are within the CoRoT FOV. We also confirmed the variability for
4 stars listed in GCVS catalog.
