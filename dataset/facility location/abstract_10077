Exact particle-like static, spherically and/or cylindrically symmetric
solutions to the equations of interacting scalar and electromagnetic field
system have been obtained within the scope of general relativity. In
particular, we considered Freedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) space-time as an
external homogenous and isotropic gravitational field whereas the inhomogenous
and isotropic Universe is given by the G$\ddot o$del model. The solutions
obtained have been thoroughly studied for different types of interaction term.
It has been shown that in FRW space-time equations with different interaction
terms may have stable solutions while within the scope of G$\ddot o$del model
only the droplet-like configurations may be stable, if they are located in the
region where $g^{00}>0$.
