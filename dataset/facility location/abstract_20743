We report the discovery of PSR J1906+0722, a gamma-ray pulsar detected as
part of a blind survey of unidentified Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) sources
being carried out on the volunteer distributed computing system, Einstein@Home.
This newly discovered pulsar previously appeared as the most significant
remaining unidentified gamma-ray source without a known association in the
second Fermi-LAT source catalog (2FGL) and was among the top ten most
significant unassociated sources in the recent third catalog (3FGL). PSR
J1906+0722 is a young, energetic, isolated pulsar, with a spin frequency of
$8.9$ Hz, a characteristic age of $49$ kyr, and spin-down power $1.0 \times
10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. In 2009 August it suffered one of the largest glitches
detected from a gamma-ray pulsar ($\Delta f / f \approx 4.5\times10^{-6}$).
Remaining undetected in dedicated radio follow-up observations, the pulsar is
likely radio-quiet. An off-pulse analysis of the gamma-ray flux from the
location of PSR J1906+0722 revealed the presence of an additional nearby
source, which may be emission from the interaction between a neighboring
supernova remnant and a molecular cloud. We discuss possible effects which may
have hindered the detection of PSR J1906+0722 in previous searches and describe
the methods by which these effects were mitigated in this survey. We also
demonstrate the use of advanced timing methods for estimating the positional,
spin and glitch parameters of difficult-to-time pulsars such as this.
