Current progresses in home automation and service robotic environment have
highlighted the need to develop interoperability mechanisms that allow a
standard communication between the two systems. During the development of the
DHCompliant protocol, the problem of locating mobile devices in an indoor
environment has been investigated. The communication of the device with the
location service has been carried out to study the time delay that web services
offer in front of the sockets. The importance of obtaining data from real-time
location systems portends that a basic tool for interoperability, such as web
services, can be ineffective in this scenario because of the delays added in
the invocation of services. This paper is focused on introducing a web service
to resolve a coordinates request without any significant delay in comparison
with the sockets.
