Minor planets 887 Alinda and 2062 Aten are typical near Earth asteroids
(NEA). Our previous researches show their possible origin in catastrophic
collision near Earth orbit. It is determine the target of present research --
to investigate interactions between these objects in more details. Orbits m.p.
887 and 2062 are crossed near pericenter and apocenter accordingly. So possible
interval of the interaction of these objects is repeated through the
significant time interval and has relatively small duration. On the strength of
several reasons, orbits of fragments of the disastrous collision can have no an
exact intersection. Besides, when integrating on the greater gap in the past
increases a role of the uncertainty of initial values of elements of orbits.
These factors determine a probabilistic nature of the result as well as need of
modeling of the disastrous process. However, on the strength of the specific
spatial location of orbits, result has highly determined numeric expression -
in the suggestion on the possible interaction m. p. 887 and 2062, this event
has occurred about 1400 years ago. The possible participation some other near
Earth minor objects, include Quadrantides meteoric stream, in described
disastrous event is discussed.
