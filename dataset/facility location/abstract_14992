Results are presented from a multi-wavelength study of the giant pillars
within the Carina Nebula. Using near-IR data from 2MASS, mid-IR data from MSX,
843MHz radio continuum maps from the MOST, and molecular line and continuum
observations from the SEST, we investigate the nature of the pillars and search
for evidence of ongoing star formation within them. Photodissociation regions
(PDRs) exist across the whole nebula and trace the giant pillars, as well as
many ridges, filaments, and condensations (Av > 7 mag). Morphological
similarities between emission features at 21um and 843MHz adjacent to the PDRs,
suggests that the molecular material has been carved by the intense stellar
winds and UV radiation from the nearby massive stars. In addition, star forming
cores are found at the tips of several of the pillars. Using a stellar density
distribution, several candidate embedded clusters are also found. One is
clearly seen in the 2MASS images and is located within a dense core
(G287.84-0.82). A search for massive young stellar objects and compact HII
regions using mid-IR colour criteria, reveal twelve candidates across the
complex. Grey-body fits to SEDs for four of these objects are suggestive of
OB-stars. We find that massive star formation in the Carina Nebula is occurring
across the whole complex and confirm it has been continuous over the past 3
Myrs.
