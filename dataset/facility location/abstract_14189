We investigated electronic band structure and transport properties of
periodically alternating mono-and bi-layer graphene superlattices (MBLG SLs).
In such MBLG SLs, there exists the zero-averaged wave vector
(zero-$\overline{k}$)) gap, which is insensitive to lattice constant but
sensitive to both the ratio of potentials' width and interlayer coupling
coefficient. Moreover, locations of extra Dirac points are presented
analytically. Furthermore, energy gap ($E_{g}$) of first two bands in MBLG SLs
is investigated, and it is found that the border of propagating and evanescent
wave modes (associate with $E_{g}$) is tunable by the interlayer coupling and
the widths' ratio of the periodic mono- and bi-layer graphene.
