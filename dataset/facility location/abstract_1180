The National Ignition Facility (NIF) requires that pulses from each of the
192 laser beams be positioned on target with an accuracy of 50 um rms. Beam
quality must be sufficient to focus a total of 1.8 MJ of 0.351-um light into a
600-um-diameter volume. An optimally flat beam wavefront can achieve this
pointing and focusing accuracy. The control system corrects wavefront
aberrations by performing closed-loop compensation during laser alignment to
correct for gas density variations. Static compensation of flashlamp-induced
thermal distortion is established just prior to the laser shot. The control
system compensates each laser beam at 10 Hz by measuring the wavefront with a
77-lenslet Hartmann sensor and applying corrections with a 39-actuator
deformable mirror. The distributed architecture utilizes SPARC AXi computers
running Solaris to perform real-time image processing of sensor data and
PowerPC-based computers running VxWorks to compute mirror commands. A single
pair of SPARC and PowerPC processors accomplishes wavefront control for a group
of eight beams. The software design uses proven adaptive optic control
algorithms that are implemented in a multi-tasking environment to economically
control the beam wavefronts in parallel. Prototype tests have achieved a
closed-loop residual error of 0.03 waves rms.
