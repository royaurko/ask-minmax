We first review the definition of the angle between subspaces and how it is
computed using matrix algebra. Then we introduce the Grassmann and Clifford
algebra description of subspaces. The geometric product of two subspaces yields
the full relative angular information in an explicit manner. We explain and
interpret the result of the geometric product of subspaces gaining thus full
practical access to the relative orientation information.
