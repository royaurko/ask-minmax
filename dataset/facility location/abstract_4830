In this paper, we analyse the joint impact of pathloss, shadowing and fast
fading on wireless networks. Taking into account the pathloss and the
shadowing, we first express the SINR distribution of a mobile located at a
given distance from its serving base-station (BS). The moments of this
distribution are easily computed, using the Fenton-Wilkinson method, and a
fluid model that considers the cellular network as a continuum of BS. Then
considering the joint impact of pathloss, shadowing and fast fading, we derive
an easily computable outage probability formula, for a mobile located at any
distance from its serving BS. We validate our approach by comparing all results
to Monte Carlo simulations performed in a traditional hexagonal network.
Indeed, we establish that the results given by the formula are close to the
ones given by Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed framework is a powerful
tool to study performances of cellular networks e.g. OFDMA systems (WiMAX,
LTE).
