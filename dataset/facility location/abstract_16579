Using ab initio methods based on the density functional theory, we
investigate the segregation and formation energies for various dopants (Si, Be,
Zn, Sn), commonly used to obtain p- or ntype conductivity in GaAs and InAs
nanowires. The distribution of Au and O atoms, which may be unintentionally
incorporated during the wire growth, is also studied. The calculations
performed for nanowires of zinc blende and wurtzite structure show that the
distribution of most of the impurities depends on the crystal structure of the
wires. For example, it is shown that the same growth conditions can lead to
lower energy for Si substituting Ga (donor) in the wire of wurtzite structure
and substituting As (acceptor) in the wire of zinc blende structure. In
contrast, we obtain that gold and oxygen atoms always tend to stay at the
lateral surfaces of GaAs and InAs nanowires, in agreement with experimental
findings, while for beryllium the lowest energies are found when the impurities
are located in sites in the center of the wurtzite wire or along the [1; 0; 1]
axis from surface to the center of the zinc blende wire, what can explain the
recently observed diffusion of this impurity into the volume of GaAs wires.
