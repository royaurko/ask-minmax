A modified Kaluza-Klein theory is proposed in which propagation takes place
only at the speed of light. The propagation can be confined to a small volume,
forming a particle with rest mass. The usual four space-time coordinates locate
the confinement volume, and Kaluza's fifth coordinate is replaced by an
internal degree of freedom. Electromagnetism corresponds to a gauge field on
the phase of the internal motion. Self-gravity might create the confinement, as
in a geon, but the particle would have a Planck mass. This large mass could be
made closer to the masses of observed particles if gravity were allowed to
increase in strength within the confinement volume.
