The Global mm-VLBI Array (GMVA) is the highest angular resolution imaging
interferometer currently available as a common user facility. It is capable of
angular resolutions on the order of 40 microarcseconds. Currently 14 stations
in the United States and Europe participate in global 3 mm VLBI observations.
The GMVA is used for continuum and spectroscopic imaging, probing the central
regions of active galaxies and the origin of jets as these regions are
typically not observable at longer wavelengths due to synchrotron
self-absorption. In early 2012, fringes were detected to the three stations of
the Korean VLBI Network (KVN), opening the possibility of extending the
baseline coverage of the VLBI array to the East. In these proceedings, we will
present recent images from a monitoring program of gamma-ray blazars using the
GMVA, including the sources 3C454.3 and 0235+164, and an update of its current
status and abilities.
