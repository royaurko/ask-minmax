We are leading a comprehensive multi-waveband monitoring program of 34
gamma-ray bright blazars designed to locate the emission regions of blazars
from radio to gamma-ray frequencies. The "maps" are anchored by sequences of
images in both total and polarized intensity obtained with the VLBA at an
angular resolution of ~ 0.1 milliarcseconds. The time-variable linear
polarization at radio to optical wavelengths and radio to gamma-ray light
curves allow us to specify the locations of flares relative to bright
stationary features seen in the images and to infer the geometry of the
magnetic field in different regions of the jet. Our data reveal that some
flares occur simultaneously at different wavebands and others are only seen at
some of the frequencies. The flares are often triggered by a superluminal knot
passing through the stationary "core" on the VLBA images. Other flares occur
upstream or even parsecs downstream of the core.
