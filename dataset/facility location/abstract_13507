We report the discovery of a narrow stellar stream crossing the
constellations of Sculptor and Fornax in the Southern celestial hemisphere. The
portion of the stream detected in the Data Release 1 photometry of the ATLAS
survey is at least 12 degrees long, while its width is $\approx$ 0.25 deg. The
Color Magnitude Diagram of this halo sub-structure is consistent with a
metal-poor [Fe/H] $\lesssim -1.4$ stellar population located at a heliocentric
distance of 20 $\pm$ 2 kpc. There are three globular clusters that could
tentatively be associated with the stream: NGC 7006, NGC 7078 (M15) and Pyxis,
but NGC 7006 and 7078 seem to have proper motions incompatible with the stream
orbit.
