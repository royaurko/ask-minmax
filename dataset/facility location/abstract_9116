VLBA and EVN radio observations of H2O masers at 22 GHz and methanol masers
at 6.7 GHz have been used to obtain images of the maser spots in the infrared
object GL2789, which is associated with the young stellar object V645Cyg. The
position of these masers coincides with that of the optical object to within
0.2 arcsec. The maser spots are located in a line oriented north--south, and
their positions and radial velocities can be described by a model with a
Keplerian disk with maximum radius 40 AU for the H2O masers and 800 AU for the
methanol masers. The H2O and methanol masers spots are unresolved, and the
lower limits for their brightness temperatures are 2x10^{13} K and 1.4x10^9 K,
respectively. A model in which the maser radiation is formed in extended
water-methanol clouds associated with ice planets forming around the young star
is proposed.
