Mobile learning through wireless enabled laptops (say, within a university
campus) can make use of the learning management system that is already
available through internet or intranet. Without restrictions within the four
walls of computer labs or library, students can now access the learning
resources anywhere in the campus where wireless access points or hotspots are
located. We briefly investigate on the mobile learning benefits and eventually
an analysis of the student perceptions on mobile learning is presented through
a survey, to validate the m-learning benefits.
