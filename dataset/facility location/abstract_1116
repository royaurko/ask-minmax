Many have argued that statistics students need additional facility to express
statistical computations. By introducing students to commonplace tools for data
management, visualization, and reproducible analysis in data science and
applying these to real-world scenarios, we prepare them to think statistically.
In an era of increasingly big data, it is imperative that students develop
data-related capacities, beginning with the introductory course. We believe
that the integration of these precursors to data science into our
curricula-early and often-will help statisticians be part of the dialogue
regarding "Big Data" and "Big Questions".
