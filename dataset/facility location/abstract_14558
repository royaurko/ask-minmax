Deep V and I CCD images of the loosely populated Galactic globular cluster
Pal 1 and the surrounding field have been obtained with the INT. A color
magnitude diagram down to V(lim) ~ 24, and a luminosity function complete down
to V(lim) ~ 23.25 have been constructed.
  Adopting a reddening E(V-I)=0.20+/-0.04 and comparing the CMD of Pal 1 with
47 Tucanae, we obtain a distance modulus (m-M)o=15.25+/-0.25, indicating that
Pal 1 is located 3.7+/-0.4 kpc above the Galactic disc and 17.3+/-1.6 kpc from
the Galactic center.
  Comparison with 47 Tuc and M71 shows that Pal 1 must be significantly
younger. The best fitting isochrones (Bertelli et al, 1994) give an age between
6.3 and 8 Gyrs, which would make Pal 1 the youngest Galactic globular cluster
so far identified, casting some doubt on the real nature of this object.
  The luminosity function shows some evidence for mass segregation, consistent
with the very short relaxation time. The global mass function can be fitted
with a power law of slope x=-1.4+/-0.7. This mass function is anomalously flat,
suggesting either a strong dynamical evolution or an initial mass function
significantly different from most of the other halo globular clusters.
  A discussion on the possible nature of Pal 1 is presented.
