The critical behaviour of semi-infinite $d$-dimensional systems with
short-range interactions and an O(n) invariant Hamiltonian is investigated at
an $m$-axial Lifshitz point with an isotropic wave-vector instability in an
$m$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^d$ parallel to the surface. Continuum
$|\bphi|^4$ models representing the associated universality classes of surface
critical behaviour are constructed. In the boundary parts of their Hamiltonians
quadratic derivative terms (involving a dimensionless coupling constant
$\lambda$) must be included in addition to the familiar ones $\propto\phi^2$.
Beyond one-loop order the infrared-stable fixed points describing the ordinary,
special and extraordinary transitions in $d=4+\frac{m}{2}-\epsilon$ dimensions
(with $\epsilon>0$) are located at $\lambda=\lambda^*=\Or(\epsilon)$. At second
order in $\epsilon$, the surface critical exponents of both the ordinary and
the special transitions start to deviate from their $m=0$ analogues. Results to
order $\epsilon^2$ are presented for the surface critical exponent
$\beta_1^{\rm ord}$ of the ordinary transition. The scaling dimension of the
surface energy density is shown to be given exactly by $d+m (\theta-1)$, where
$\theta=\nu_{l4}/\nu_{l2}$ is the bulk anisotropy exponent.
