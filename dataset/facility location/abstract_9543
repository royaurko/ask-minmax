The space mission CoRoT (COnvection, ROtation and planetary Transits) will
offer the possibility to detect extrasolar planets by means of the transit
method. The satellite will observe about 60000 targets in the range
11.0<V<16.0, located in five fields near the equator. The parts of the
preparatory work in which the Italian community has been involved are
described, with a particular emphasis on the observations to characterize the
fields, on the effects of stellar activity and background stars and on the
outreach activities. We performed a quantitative evaluation of instrumental and
stellar effects in the planetary transit detection and a more careful
evaluation of the stellar content of some specific stellar fields. Also
considering the full spectroscopic characterisation of the targets and the
precise photometric evaluation of the stellar variability in the CoRoT fields,
the Italian researchers provided original and useful inputs to the scientific
profile to the mission.
