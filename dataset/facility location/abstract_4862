We obtain an analytical expression for the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida
(RKKY) interaction $J$ in electron or hole doped graphene for linear Dirac
bands. The results agree very well with the numerical calculations for the full
tight-binding band structure in the regime where the linear band structure is
valid. The analytical result, expressed in terms of the Meijer G-function,
consists of a product of two oscillatory terms, one coming from the
interference between the two Dirac cones and the second coming from the finite
size of the Fermi surface. For large distances, the Meijer G-function behaves
as a sinusoidal term, leading to the result $J \sim R^{-2} k_F \sin (2 k_F R)
{1 + \cos[(K-K').R]}$ for moments located on the same sublattice. The $R^{-2}$
dependence, which is the same for the standard two-dimensional electron gas, is
universal irrespective of the sublattice location and the distance direction of
the two moments except when $k_F =0$ (undoped case), where it reverts to the
$R^{-3}$ dependence. These results correct several inconsistencies found in the
literature.
