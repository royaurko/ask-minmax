We suggest that the recently observed superluminal neutrino propagation
observed by OPERA may have an environmental origin that can simultaneously
explain the DAMA/LIBRA annual modulation. Our proposal can be unambiguously
tested by the prediction that OPERA will also observe an annual modulation in
the speed of neutrinos. Experiments geographically distant from Gran Sasso will
however not be able to observe these effects. We do not rely upon any violation
of Lorentz symmetry except for spontaneous breaking of translational
invariance. We discuss implications for the CRESST experiment, also located at
Gran Sasso.
