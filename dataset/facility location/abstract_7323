The CHOOZ experiment measured the antineutrino flux at a distance of about 1
Km from two nuclear reactors in order to detect possible neutrino oscillations
with squared mass differences as low as 10**-3 eV**2 for full mixing. We show
that the data analysis of the electron antineutrino events, collected by our
liquid scintillation detector, locates the antineutrino source within a cone of
half-aperture of about 18 degrees at the 68% C.L.. We discuss the implications
of this experimental result for tracking down a supernova explosion.
