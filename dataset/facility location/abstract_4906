We study Hinode/SOT-FG observations of intensity fluctuations in Ca II H-line
and G-band image sequences and their relation to simultaneous and co-spatial
magnetic field measurements. We explore the G-band and H-line intensity
oscillation spectra both separately and comparatively via their relative phase
differences, time delays and cross-coherences. In the non-magnetic situations,
both sets of fluctuations show strong oscillatory power in the 3 - 7 mHz band
centered at 4.5 mHz, but this is suppressed as magnetic field increases. A
relative phase analysis gives a time delay of H-line after G-band of 20\pm1 s
in non-magnetic situations implying a mean effective height difference of 140
km. The maximum coherence is at 4 - 7 mHz. Under strong magnetic influence the
measured delay time shrinks to 11 s with the peak coherence near 4 mHz. A
second coherence maximum appears between 7.5 - 10 mHz. Investigation of the
locations of this doubled-frequency coherence locates it in diffuse rings
outside photospheric magnetic structures. Some possible interpretations of
these results are offered.
