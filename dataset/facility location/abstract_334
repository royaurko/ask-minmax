In the recent years, the industry of model building has been the subject of
the intense activity, especially after the measurement of a relatively large
values of the reactor angle. Special attention has been devoted to the use of
non-abelian discrete symmetries, thanks to their ability of reproducing some of
the relevant features of the neutrino mixing matrix. In this paper, we consider
two special relations between the leptonic mixing angles, arising from models
based on S4 and A4, and study whether, and to which extent, they can be
distinguished at superbeam facilities, namely T2K, NOvA and T2HK.
