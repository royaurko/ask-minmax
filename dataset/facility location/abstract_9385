Despite a general consensus in the astronomical community that all quasars
are located at the distances implied by their redshifts, a number of
observations still challenge this interpretation, possibly indicating that some
subpopulation of quasars may harbour significant redshift components not
related to the expansion of the universe. It has been suggested that these
objects may have been ejected from local galaxies and are likely to evolve into
new galaxies themselves. Here, a test of such exotic scenarios is proposed,
based on the spectral energy distribution of the galaxies hosting quasars with
suspected ejection origin. Provided that the time scales over which the ejected
objects manifest themselves as quasars is short, one would in the framework of
ejection scenarios expect to find either no quasar host galaxy, a pseudo-host
consisting of gas ionized by the quasar, or a host galaxy consisting of young
stars only. It is argued that the spectral energy distributions corresponding
to the latter two options should differ significantly from those of most quasar
host galaxies detected at low redshift so far, thus providing a potential test
of the claimed existence of ejected quasars. A minimal implementation of this
test, involving optical and near-IR broadband photometry, is suggested.
