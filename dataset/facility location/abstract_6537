Given that the free massive scalar propagator in 2 + 1 dimensional Euclidean
space is $D(x-y)=\frac{1}{4\pi \rho} 0.25cm e^{-m \rho} $ with $\rho^2=(x-y)^2$
we present the counterpart of $D(x-y)$ in curved space with a suitably modified
version of the Antonsen - Bormann method instead of the familiar Schwinger - de
Witt proper time approach, the metric being defined by the rotating solution of
Deser et al. of the Einstein field equations associated with a single massless
spinning particle located at the origin.
