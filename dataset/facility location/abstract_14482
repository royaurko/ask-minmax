We quantify the morphologies and dynamical states of 59 galaxy clusters using
the power-ratio technique of Buote & Tsai applied to ROSAT PSPC X-ray images.
The clusters exhibit a particularly strong $P_2/P_0 - P_4/P_0$ correlation in
the $1h^{-1}_{80}$ Mpc aperture which may be interpreted as an evolutionary
track; the location of a cluster on the correlation line indicates the
dynamical state of the cluster and the distribution of clusters along this
track measures the rate of formation and evolution of clusters in our sample.
The power ratios anti-correlate with the cooling-flow rate indicating a
reasonable dependence of the flow rate on cluster morphology. The relationship
of the power ratios to the optical Bautz-Morgan (BM) Type is more complex. This
is because the power ratios are sensitive to unrelaxed regions of clusters
within a specified scale, whereas BM types are sensitive to unrelaxed regions
over many scales. We discuss further astrophysical applications exploiting the
relationship between the power ratios and the evolutionary states of clusters.
