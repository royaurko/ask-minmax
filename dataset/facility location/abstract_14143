We investigate the structures of $^{9,10}$Be and $^{10}$B with the
tensor-optimized shell model (TOSM) using the effective interaction based on
the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction AV8$^\prime$. The tensor correlation is
treated in TOSM with the full optimization of 2p2h configurations including
high-momentum components. The short-range correlation is described in the
unitary correlation operator method (UCOM). It is found that the level orders
of the low-lying states of $^{9,10}$Be and $^{10}$B are entirely reproduced.
For $^9$Be, ground band states are located relatively in higher energy than the
experiments, which indicates the missing $\alpha$ clustering correlation in
these states as seen in the case of $^8$Be with TOSM. In addition, the tensor
force gives the larger attraction for $T$=1/2 states than for $T$=3/2 ones for
$^9$Be. For $^{10}$Be, the tensor contribution of $0^+_2$ shows the largest
value among the $0^+$ states. This can be related to the $\alpha$ clustering
correlation in this state. It is also found that the level order of three
nuclei depends on the tensor force in comparison with the results obtained with
the Minnesota interaction without the tensor force.
