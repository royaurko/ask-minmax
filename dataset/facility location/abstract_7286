Unified schemes of active galactic nuclei (AGN) require an obscuring dusty
torus around the central engine. The compact sizes (only a few pc) determined
in recent high-resolution observations require that the obscuring matter be
clumpy and located inside the region where the black-hole gravity dominates
over the galactic bulge. This location is in line with the scenario depicting
the torus as the region of the clumpy wind coming off the accretion disk in
which the clouds are dusty and optically thick. We study here the outflow
scenario within the framework of hydromagnetic disk winds, incorporating the
cloud properties determined from detailed modeling of the IR emission from
clumpy tori. We find that torus clouds were likely detected in recent water
maser observations of NGC 3079. In the wind scenario, the AGN main dynamic
channel for release of accreted mass seems to be switching at low luminosities
from torus outflow to radio jets. The torus disappears when the bolometric
luminosity decreases below about \E{42} erg/sec because the accretion onto the
central black hole can no longer sustain the required cloud outflow rate. This
disappearance seems to have been observed in both LINERs and radio galaxies.
With further luminosity decrease, suppression of cloud outflow spreads radially
inward from the disk's dusty, molecular region into its atomic, ionized zone,
resulting in disappearance of the broad emission line region at lower
luminosities, yet to be determined.
