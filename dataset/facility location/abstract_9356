We present K'-band (2.12 micron) imaging observations of the SGR 1806-20
field taken during its very active phase in mid 2004, which reveal brightening
of sources within the Chandra X-ray error circle when compared with earlier
images obtained in 2002. One source brightened by more than a factor of 2, and
so we consider this to be the probable infrared counterpart for SGR 1806-20.
The other two sources are located in close proximity to the probable
counterpart and show marginal brightening, which may suggest that the
high-energy photons emitted from the SGR during its active phase have induced
dust sublimation or brightening of the unresolved background around the SGR.
