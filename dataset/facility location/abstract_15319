A catalogue of astrometric (positions, proper motions) and photometric (B, V,
R, r', J) data of stars in fields with ICRF objects has been compiled at the
Observatory of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and the Kyiv
University Observatory. All fields are located in the declination zone from 0
to +30 degrees; the nominal field size is 46' (right ascension) x 24'
(declination). The observational basis of this work is 1100 CCD scans down to
V=17 mag which were obtained with the Kyiv meridian axial circle in 2001-2003.
The catalogue is presented in two versions. The version KMAC1-T contains 159
fields (104 796 stars) and was obtained with reduction to the Tycho2 catalogue.
For another 33 fields, due to a low sky density of Tycho2 stars, the reduction
was found to be unreliable. Transformation to the ICRF system in the second
version of the catalogue (KMAC1-CU) was performed using the UCAC2 and CMC13
catalogues as a reference; it contains 115 032 stars in 192 fields and is of
slightly better accuracy. The external accuracy of one catalogue position is
about 50-90 mas for V < 15 mag stars. The average error of photometry is better
than 0.1 mag for stars down to 16 mag.
