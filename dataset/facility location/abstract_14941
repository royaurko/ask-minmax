We present a detailed model of the discrete X-ray spectroscopic features
expected from steady-state, low-density photoionized plasmas. We apply the
Flexible Atomic Code (FAC) to calculate all of the necessary atomic data for
the full range of ions relevant for the X-ray regime. These calculations have
been incorporated into a simple model of a cone of ions irradiated by a point
source located at its tip (now available as the XSPEC model PHOTOION). For each
ionic species in the cone, photoionization is balanced by recombination and
ensuing radiative cascades, and photoexcitation of resonance transitions is
balanced by radiative decay. This simple model is useful for diagnosing X-ray
emission mechanisms, determining photoionization/photoexcitation/recombination
rates, fitting temperatures and ionic emission measures, and probing
geometrical properties (covering factor/column densities/radial filling
factor/velocity distributions) of absorbing/reemitting regions in photoionized
plasmas. Such plasmas have already been observed in diverse astrophysical X-ray
sources, including active galactic nuclei, X-ray binaries, cataclysmic
variables, and stellar winds of early-type stars, and may also provide a
significant contribution to the X-ray spectra of gamma-ray-burst afterglows and
the intergalactic medium.
