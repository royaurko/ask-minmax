Presently the CDMS-II collaboration's Weakly Interacting Massive Particle
(WIMP) search at the Soudan Underground Laboratory sets the most stringent
exclusion limits of any WIMP cold dark matter direct-detection experiment. To
extend our reach further, to WIMP-nucleon cross sections in the range $10^{-46}
- 10^{-44}$cm$^2$, we propose SuperCDMS, which would take advantage of a very
deep site. One promising site is the recently approved SNOLab facility in
Canada. In this paper we will present our overall plan, identify primary
issues, and set the goals that need to be met prior to embarking upon each
phase of SuperCDMS.
