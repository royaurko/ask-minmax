With the aim of locating the origin of discrepancy between experimental and
computer simulation results on bulk viscosity of liquid argon, a molecular
dynamic simulation of argon interacting via ab initio pair potential and
triple-dipole three-body potential has been undertaken. Bulk viscosity,
obtained using Green-Kubo formula, is different from the values obtained from
modeling argon using Lennard-Jones potential, the former being closer to the
experimental data. The conclusion is made that many-body inter-atomic
interaction plays a significant role in formation of bulk viscosity.
