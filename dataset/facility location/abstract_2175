An experiment to search for double beta processes in 106Cd by using cadmium
tungstate crystal scintillator enriched in 106Cd (106CdWO4) in coincidence with
the four crystals HPGe detector GeMulti is in progress at the STELLA facility
of the Gran Sasso underground laboratory of INFN (Italy). The 106CdWO4
scintillator is viewed by a low-background photomultiplier tube through a lead
tungstate crystal light-guide produced from deeply purified archaeological lead
to suppress gamma quanta from the photomultiplier tube. Here we report the
first results of the experiment after 3233 hours of the data taking. A few new
improved limits on double beta processes in 106Cd are obtained, in particular
T1/2(2nuECb+) > 8.4e20 yr at 90% C.L.
