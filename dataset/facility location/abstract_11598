Advances in the field of numerical relativity now make it possible to
calculate the final, most powerful merger phase of binary black-hole
coalescence for generic binaries. The state of the art has advanced well beyond
the equal-mass case into the unequal-mass and spinning regions of parameter
space. We present a study of the nonspinning portion of parameter space,
primarily using an analytic waveform model tuned to available numerical data,
with an emphasis on observational implications. We investigate the impact of
varied mass ratio on merger signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for several
detectors, and compare our results with expectations from the test-mass limit.
We note a striking similarity of the waveform phasing of the merger waveform
across the available mass ratios. Motivated by this, we calculate the match
between our 1:1 (equal mass) and 4:1 mass-ratio waveforms during the merger as
a function of location on the source sky, using a new formalism for the match
that accounts for higher harmonics. This is an indicator of the amount of
degeneracy in mass ratio for mergers of moderate-mass-ratio systems.
