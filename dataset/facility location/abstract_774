The CLAS collaboration in Hall B at the Thomas Jeffeson National Accelerator
Facility (Jefferson Lab) has a broad scientific program. Recent results on the
main topics are presented. These concern the electromagnetic exitation of
nucleon resonances, the measurement of inclusive spin structrure functions in
the nucleon resonance region, the first signature of the Generalized Parton
Distributions through the Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering measurement and the
deuteron photodisintegration and photoproduction of light vector mesons.
