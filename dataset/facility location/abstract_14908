Narrow-band HST WFPC2 images reveal a bow-shock-like halo around the HII
region N30B toward the B[e] supergiant Hen S22 located within the larger DEM L
106 nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud. High-dispersion spectra of N30B show
a narrow H-alpha emission component from the ionized gas; the velocity
variations indicate a gas flow of -5 to -10 km/s in the vicinity of the HII
regions, which is resultant from interactions with Hen S22's stellar wind and
responsible for the bow-shock morphology. Spectra of N30B's halo show broad
H-alpha profiles extending over >1000 km/s, similar to that of Hen S22,
indicating that the halo is a reflection nebula of Hen S22. Broad-band
morphologies of N30B's halo are also consistent with the reflection nebula
interpretation. We use dust-scattering properties and the observed brightnesses
of the reflection nebula and Hen S22 to constrain the reflection geometry. The
reflected stellar H-alpha emission and absorption vary across the reflection
nebula as a result of viewing S22's anisotropic wind across varying angles.
This reflection nebula, together with the edge-on orientation of Hen S22's
disk, provides an invaluable opportunity to study the disk and polar winds of a
B[e] supergiant.
