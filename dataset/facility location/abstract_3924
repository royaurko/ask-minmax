We study $SU(3)$ flavor-breaking corrections to the relation between the
octet baryon masses and the nucleon-meson CP-violating interactions induced by
the QCD $\bar\theta$ term. We work within the framework of $SU(3)$ chiral
perturbation theory and work through next-to-next-to-leading order in the
$SU(3)$ chiral expansion, which is $\mathcal{O}(m_q^2)$. At lowest order, the
CP-odd couplings induced by the QCD $\bar\theta$ term are determined by mass
splittings of the baryon octet, the classic result of Crewther et al. We show
that for each isospin-invariant CP-violating nucleon-meson interaction there
exists one relation which is respected by loop corrections up to the order we
work, while other leading-order relations are violated. With these relations we
extract a precise value of the pion-nucleon coupling $\bar g_0$ by using recent
lattice QCD evaluations of the proton-neutron mass splitting. In addition, we
derive semi-precise values for CP-violating coupling constants between heavier
mesons and nucleons with $\sim 30\%$ uncertainty and discuss their
phenomenological impact on electric dipole moments of nucleons and nuclei.
