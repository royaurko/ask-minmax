The observed scaling laws for large angle exclusive hadronic reactions are
successfully accounted for by the short-distance QCD quark interchange
processes. We focus on three hadronic reactions which shows evidence for a
slight oscillatory deviation from the expected scaling behaviour. Possible
explanations for these oscillations and connections to spin observables will be
mentioned. Better data from excisting facilities (or a possible future KEK
proton accelerator, JHP) can clarify the theoretical situation.
