We discuss the possibility to study the in-medium changes of the properties
of the omega meson in reactions on ordinary nuclei with elementary
electromagnetic probes. We present a tree-level calculation of the elementary
gamma p -> omega p process which is extended to describe also the
photoproduction of medium-modified omega mesons in nuclear matter. Using a
semi-classical transport approach we obtain results for e+e- and pi0 gamma
photoproduction off heavy nuclei in the invariant mass range of the rho and
omega mesons. Both reactions are also studied experimentally and are presently
being analyzed at accelerator facilities in Bonn and at Jefferson Lab. We show
that the in-medium signals expected can be as large as those obtained in
heavy-ion reactions.
