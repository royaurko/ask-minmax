In this work a review is made of the various preseismic electric signals that
have been observed before large EQs in Greece during the period of 1999 to
2012. The observed preseismic electric signals comply quite well with the
theoretical ones that are expected to be generated by a large scale
piezoelectric mechanism been activatsd at the focal area due to its excess
stress-load. Preseismic electric signals of the total piezoelectric field, its
first time derivative, its oscillation due to M1 and K1 tidal components have
been observed by single monitoring sites during the actual 1999 to 2012
experiment in Greece. Moreover, the "strange attractor like" electric
preseismic signal was detected by the simultaneously use of two distant
monitoring sites. It is demonstrated that the preseismic electric signals can
not only determine quite accurately a very short time window for the EQ
occurrence and its epicentral location but the latter can be achieved without
any prior knowledge of the geological, tectonic setting or past seismic history
of the seismogenic area. The predicted pending EQ is treated as a single
isolated destructive nature event which sends clear warning signals well before
its occurrence. Real examples are presented from the Greek territory.
  Key words: piezoelectricity, electric preseismic signals, strange attractor
like, earthquake prediction.
