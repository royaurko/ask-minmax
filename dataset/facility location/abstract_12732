In the past few years materials with protected gapless surface (edge) states
have risen to the central stage of condensed matter physics. Almost all
discussions centered around topological insulators and superconductors, which
possess full quasiparticle gaps in the bulk. In this paper we argue systems
with topological stable bulk nodes offer another class of materials with robust
gapless surface states. Moreover the location of the bulk nodes determines the
Miller index of the surfaces that show (or not show) such states. Measuring the
spectroscopic signature of these zero modes allows a phase-sensitive
determination of the nodal structures of unconventional superconductors when
other phase-sensitive techniques are not applicable. We apply this idea to
gapless iron based superconductors and show how to distinguish accidental from
symmetry dictated nodes. We shall argue the same idea leads to a method for
detecting a class of the elusive spin liquids.
