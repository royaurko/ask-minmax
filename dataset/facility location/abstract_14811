We discuss the GRB afterglow emission from a relativistic jet that is
initially in the radiative regime in which the accelerated electrons are fast
cooling. We note that such a ``semiradiative'' jet decelerates faster than an
adiabatic jet does. We also take into account the effect of strong
inverse-Compton scattering on the cooling frequency in the synchrotron
component and therefore on the light curve decay index. We find that there are
two kinds of light-curve break for the jet effect. The first is an ``adiabatic
break'' if the electrons become slow cooling before the jet enters a spreading
phase, and the second is a ``radiative break'' which appears on the contrary
case. We then show how a relativistic jet evolves dynamically and derive the
overall temporal synchrotron emission in both cases, focusing on the change in
light curve decay index around the break time. Finally, in view of our results,
we rule out two cases for relativistic jets to account for the observed light
curve breaks in a few afterglows: (i) an adiabatic jet with strong Compton
cooling (Y>1) and with the cooling frequency nu_c locating in the observed
energy range; (ii) a radiative jet with a significant fraction of total energy
occupied by electrons (epsilon_e 1).
