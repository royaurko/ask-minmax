The effects of a spin-orbit interaction on transition-metal ions of (4d)^3-
and (5d)^3 -based oxides in which three electrons occupy t_{2g} orbitals are
studied. The amplitude of the magnetic moment of d electrons on the 5d and 4d
orbitals is estimated by numerical diagonalization. It is found that the
magnetic moment is reduced by the spin-orbit interaction. It is suggested that
(4d)^3- and (5d)^3 -based oxides are located in the middle of the L-S and J-J
coupling schemes.
