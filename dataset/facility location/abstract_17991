We introduce a fiber-optic architecture for neural recording without contrast
agents, and study its properties theoretically. Our sensor design is inspired
by electrooptic modulators, which modulate the refractive index of a waveguide
by applying an electric field across an electrooptic core material, and allows
recording of the activities of individual neurons located at points along a 10
cm length of optical fiber with 20 um axial resolution, sensitivity down to 100
uV and a dynamic range of up to 1V using commercially available optical
reflectometers as readout devices. A key concept of the design is the ability
to create an "intensified" electric field inside an optical waveguide by
applying the extracellular voltage from a neural spike over a nanoscopic
distance. Implementing this concept requires the use of ultrathin
high-dielectric capacitor layers. If suitable materials can be found --
possessing favorable properties with respect to toxicity, ohmic junctions, and
surface capacitance -- then such sensing fibers could, in principle, be scaled
down to few-micron cross-sections for minimally invasive neural interfacing.
Custom-designed multi-material optical fibers, probed using a reflectometric
readout, may therefore provide a powerful platform for neural sensing.
