SICANE is a neutron scattering multidetector facility for the determination
of the quenching factor (ratio of the response to nuclear recoils and to
electrons) of cryogenic detectors used in direct WIMP searches. Well collimated
monoenergetic neutron beams are obtained with inverse (p,n) reactions. The
facility is described, and results obtained for the quenching factors of
scintillation in NaI(Tl) and of heat and ionization in Ge are presented.
