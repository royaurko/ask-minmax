DEAP-1 is a 7 kg liquid argon dark matter detector used to prototype the
tonne scale DEAP-3600 detector at SNOLAB.We present an analysis of the alpha
particle backgrounds in DEAP-1 and isolate the radiations from various 222Rn
daughters at various locations within the detector. The backgrounds will be
removed by event position reconstruction and strict controls of material
purity.
