We study the possibility of experimental verification of the spin=2 nature of
the Kaluza-Klein (KK) graviton which is predicted to exist in the
extra-dimensional Randal-Sundrum (RS) warped models. The couplings of these
gravitons to the particles located on or near the TeV brane is the strongest as
the overlap integral of their profiles in the extra-dimension is large. Among
them are unphysical Higgses ($W^{\pm}_L$ and $Z_L$) and KK excitations of the
Standard Model (SM) gauge bosons. We consider the possibility to confirm the
spin-2 nature of the first KK mode of the warped graviton ($G_1$) based on the
angular distribution of the Z bozon in the graviton rest frame in the gg$\to
G_1 \to W^{KK} (Z^{KK}) W (Z)\to WWZ$, gg$\to G_1\to ZZ$ and gg$\to G_1 \to
Z^{KK} Z\to ZZH$ decay channels. Using Wigner D-matrix properties, we derive
the relationship between the graviton spin, signal angular distribution peak
value, and other theoretically calculable quantities. We then study the LHC
signals for these decay modes and find that with 1000 fb$^{-1}$ of data, spin
of the RS graviton up to $\sim$ 2 TeV may be confirmed in the $pp \to W^{KK}
(Z^{KK}) W (Z) \to WWZ \to$ 3 leptons + jet + $\slashed{E}_T$ and $pp \to ZZ
\to$ 4 leptons decay modes.
