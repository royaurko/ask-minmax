New low-cost, high-power proton cyclotrons open the opportunity for a novel
precision search for CP violation in the neutrino sector. The accelerators can
produce decay-at-rest neutrino beams located at multiple distances from a
Gd-doped ultra-large water Cerenkov detector in order to search for CP
violation in anti-nu_mu to anti-nu_e at short baseline. This new type of search
complements presently proposed experiments, providing measurements that could
lead to a substantially better exploration of CP violation in the neutrino
sector.
