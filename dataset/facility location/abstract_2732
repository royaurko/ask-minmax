In addition to user-generated content, Open Educational Resources are
increasingly made available on the Web by several institutions and
organizations with the aim of being re-used. Nevertheless, it is still
difficult for users to find appropriate resources for specific learning
scenarios among the vast amount offered on the Web. Our goal is to give users
the opportunity to search for authentic resources from the Web and reuse them
in a learning context. The LearnWeb-OER platform enhances collaborative
searching and sharing of educational resources providing specific means and
facilities for education. In the following, we provide a description of the
functionalities that support users in collaboratively collecting, selecting,
annotating and discussing search results and learning resources.
