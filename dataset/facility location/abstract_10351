In systems of intersecting branes, we consider sets of directions in which
one type of brane is pointlike, with transverse fluctuations described by
matrix coordinates X, and the other set of branes is space-filling, with a
local symmetry associated to its worldvolume gauge field. Under this symmetry,
massless fields associated with p-p' strings should transform in the
fundamental representation, \Phi \to U(X) \Phi, but this transformation rule is
ill-defined when X is a general matrix. In this paper, we make sense of this
transformation rule for \Phi and show that imposing gauge invariance using the
resulting rule places strong constraints on the effective actions, determining
infinite series of terms in the \alpha' expansion. We describe the most general
invariant effective actions and note that these are written most simply in
terms of covariant objects built from \Phi which transform like fundamental
fields living on the whole space-filling brane. Our description leads us to
introduce several interesting structures, including Wilson lines from ordinary
points to matrix locations, pull-backs of fields from matrix geometries to
ordinary space, and delta functions which localize to matrix configurations.
