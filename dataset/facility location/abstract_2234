The timing method, using either stellar pulsations or eclipse timing of close
binaries as a clock, is proving to be an efficient way to detect planets around
stars that have evolved beyond the red giant branch. In this article we present
a short review of the recent discoveries and we investigate the potential of
the timing method using data both from ground-based facilities as well as from
the Kepler and CoRoT space missions.
