While regular archive searches can find images at a fixed location, they
cannot find images of moving targets such as asteroids. The Solar System Object
Search (SSOS) at the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre allows users to search for
images of moving objects. SSOS accepts as input either a list of observations,
an object designation, a set of orbital elements, or a user-generated ephemeris
for an object. It then searches for observations of that object over a range of
dates. The user is then presented with a list of images containing that object
from a variety of archives. Initially created to search the CFHT MegaCam
archive, SSOS has been extended to other telescope archives including Gemini,
Subaru/SuprimeCam, HST, and several ESO instruments for a total of 1.6 million
images. The SSOS tool is located on the web at:
