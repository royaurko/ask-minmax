A simple method for the preparation of PdCo@Pd core-shell nanoparticles
supported on carbon has been developed using an adsorbate-induced surface
segregation effect. The stability and electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen
reduction of PdCo@Pd nanoparticles was enhanced by a small amount of Pt,
deposited via a spontaneous displacement reaction. The facile method described
herein is suitable for large-scale lower cost production and significantly
lowers the Pt loading and thus cost. The as-prepared PdCo@Pd and Pd-decorated
PdCo@Pd nanocatalysts have higher methanol-tolerance for the ORR when compared
to Pt/C, and are promising cathode catalysts for fuel cell applications.
