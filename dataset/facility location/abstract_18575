We present a detailed study of the cluster CL 0048-2942, located at z~0.64,
based on a photometric and spectroscopic catalogue of 54 galaxies in a 5 x 5
square arcmin region centred in that cluster. Of these, 23 galaxies were found
to belong to the cluster. Based on this sample, the line-of-sight velocity
dispersion of the cluster is approximately 680 +- 140 km/s. We have performed
stellar population synthesis in the cluster members as well as in the field
galaxies of the sample and found that there are population gradients in the
cluster with central galaxies hosting mainly intermediate/old populations
whereas galaxies in the cluster outskirts show clearly an increase of younger
populations, meaning that star formation is predominantly taking place in the
outer regions of the cluster. In a general way, field galaxies seem to host
less evolved stellar populations than cluster members. In fact, in terms of
ages, young supergiant stars dominate the spectra of field galaxies whereas
cluster galaxies display a dominant number of old and intermediate age stars.
Following the work of other contributors (e.g. Dressler et al. 1999) we have
estimated the percentage of K+A galaxies in our sample and found around 13% in
the cluster and 10% in the field. These values were estimated through means of
a new method, based on stellar population synthesis results, that takes into
account all possible absorption features in the spectrum and thus makes optimal
use of the data.
