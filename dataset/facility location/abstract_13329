Astronomy arises very early in a civilization and evolves as the civilization
advances. It is therefore reasonable to assume that a vibrant knowledge of
astronomy would have been a feature of a civilization the size of the Harappan
Civilization. We suggest that structures dedicated to astronomy existed in
every major Harappan city. One such city was Dholavira, an important trading
port that was located on an island in what is now the Rann of Kutch during the
peak of the Harappan Civilization. We have analyzed an unusual structure at
Dholavira that includes two circular rooms. Upon assuming strategically-placed
holes in their ceilings we examine the internal movement of sunlight within
these rooms and suggest that the larger structure of which they formed a part
could have functioned as an astronomical observatory.
