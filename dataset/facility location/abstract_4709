We utilize observations from {\emph{Hinode}}/XRT and the Extreme ultraviolet
(EUV) imagers onboard {\emph{STEREO}} to study the relationship between coronal
jets and plumes. The data were recorded on Apr. 7-8 and Nov. 2-4, 2007.
Detailed results are presented for the Apr. campaign along with preliminary
analysis of the Nov. observations. We find that $>90%$ of the identified jets
are directly related to plumes (Apr. data). EUV data show that plume haze rose
from the same spatial location of more than 70% of the identified jets. The
remaining jets occurred in areas where plume material exists already. The
jet-plume transition is smooth in some cases and delayed by up to several
minutes in others. Short-lived, jet-like events and small transient bright
points occur at different locations within the base of pre-existing long-lived
plumes. The latter are enhanced after the manifestation of jet-like events. The
present observations suggest evidence for X-ray jets as precursors of polar
plumes and of their brightness changes.
