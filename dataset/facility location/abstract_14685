We present Keck near-infrared imaging of three binary L dwarf systems, all of
which are likely to be sub-stellar. Two are lithium dwarfs, and a third
exhibits an L7 spectral type, making it the coolest binary known to date. All
have component flux ratios near 1 and projected physical separations between 5
and 10 AU, assuming distances of 18 to 26 pc from recent measurements of
trigonometric parallax. These surprisingly similar binaries represent the sole
detections of companions in ten L dwarf systems which were analyzed in the
preliminary phase of a much larger dual-epoch imaging survey. The detection
rate prompts us to speculate that binary companions to L dwarfs are common,
that similar-mass systems predominate, and that their distribution peaks at
radial distances in accord both with M dwarf binaries and with the radial
location of Jovian planets in our own solar system. To fully establish these
conjectures against doubts raised by biases inherent in this small preliminary
survey, however, will require quantitative analysis of a larger volume-limited
sample which has been observed with high resolution and dynamic range.
