The beta-decay half-life of 26Si was measured with a relative precision of
1.4*10e3. The measurement yields a value of 2.2283(27) s which is in good
agreement with previous measurements but has a precision that is better by a
factor of 4. In the same experiment, we have also measured the non-analogue
branching ratios and could determine the super-allowed one with a precision
similar to the previously reported measurements. The experiment was done at the
Accelerator Laboratory of the University of Jyvaskyla where we used the IGISOL
technique with the JYFLTRAP facility to separate pure samples of 26Si.
