We have recently used the Hubble Space Telescope to study a pair of high
velocity clouds in the direction of Mrk 509 that have unusual ionization
properties. They exhibit strong CIV absorption with little or no low ion
absorption or HI 21cm emission. As the closest known analog to the outer
diffuse halos of damped Ly-alpha absorbers and the low N(HI) metal line
absorption systems seen in the spectra of high redshift quasars, these
"CIV-HVCs" may shed new light on the origins of some HVCs, as well as present
opportunities for comparing absorption due to intergalactic gas in the local
universe with absorption in moderate-high redshift gas clouds. The CIV-HVCs
have ionization properties consistent with photoionization by extragalactic
background radiation and a location within the Local Group. The presence of
weak HI-HVCs detected through 21cm emission within 2 degress of the sight line
suggests that the CIV-HVCs trace extended, ionized, low density regions of the
HI-HVCs. In this article we summarize the results of our study of the CIV-HVCs
and suggest additional observations that would test the hypothesis of an
intergalactic location for the clouds.
