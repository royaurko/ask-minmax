The Antarctic Submillimeter Telescope and Remote Observatory (AST/RO) is a
1.7-meter diameter offset Gregorian instrument located at the NSF
Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. This site is exceptionally dry and cold,
providing opportunities for Terahertz observations from the ground. Preliminary
analysis of recent site testing results shows that the zenith transparency of
the 1.5 THz atmospheric window at South Pole frequently exceeds 10% during the
Austral winter. Routine observations at 810 GHz have been conducted over the
past two years, resulting in large-scale maps of the Galactic Center region and
measurements of the (13)C line in molecular clouds. During the next two years,
the observatory plans to support two Terahertz instruments: 1) TREND (Terahertz
Receiver with Niobium Nitride Device--K. S. Yngvesson, University of
Massachusetts, P. I.), and 2) SPIFI (South Pole Imaging Fabry-Perot
Interferometer--G. J. Stacey, Cornell University, P. I.). AST/RO could be used
in future as an observational test bed for additional prototype Terahertz
instruments. Observing time on AST/RO is available on a proposal basis (see
http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~adair/AST_RO).
