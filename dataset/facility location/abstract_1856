Measurement of high-power proton beam-halo formation is the ongoing
scientific experiment for the Low Energy Demonstration Accelerator (LEDA)
facility. To attain this measurement goal, a 52-magnet beam line containing
several types of beam diagnostic instrumentation is being installed. The
Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) and commercial
software applications are presently being integrated to provide a real-time,
synchronous data acquisition and control system. This system is comprised of
magnet control, vacuum control, motor control, data acquisition, and data
analysis. Unique requirements led to the development and integration of
customized software and hardware. EPICS real-time databases, Interactive Data
Language (IDL) programs, LabVIEW Virtual Instruments (VI), and State Notation
Language (SNL) sequences are hosted on VXI, PC, and UNIX-based platforms which
interact using the EPICS Channel Access (CA) communication protocol.
Acquisition and control hardware technology ranges from DSP-based diagnostic
instrumentation to the PLC-controlled vacuum system. This paper describes the
control system hardware and software design, and implementation.
