In the commissioning phase of the DANCE project (Detector for Advanced
Neutron Capture Experiments) measurements have been performed with special
emphasis on the identification and suppression of possible backgrounds for the
planned (n,g) experiments. This report describes several background sources,
observed in the experiment or anticipated from simulations, which will need to
be suppressed in this and in similar detectors that are planned at other
facilities. First successes are documented in the suppression of background
from scattered neutrons captured in the detector as well as from the internal
radiation. Experimental results and simulations using the GEANT code are
compared.
