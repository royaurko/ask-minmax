Based on density functional calculations, the relationship between magnetism
or superconductivity and electronic states around Fermi level were derived, and
the location of the Fermi level in nonmagnetic "form" of Laves-phase compounds
is very sensitive to determine the presence of nonmagnetism, or ferromagnetism,
or antiferromagnetism, or superconductivity. The Fermi level at the nonbonding
and antibonding regions corresponds for the nonmagnetism and magnetism,
respectively, whereas at bonding region with responsibility for
superconductivity. This rules will be very useful and convenient to search the
new magnetic and superconductive materials.
