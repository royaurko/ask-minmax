Stripping injection is one of the crucial stages in the accumulation process
of the hadron therapy synchrotron HITFiL (Heavy Ion Therapy Facility in
Lanzhou). In order to simulate the stripping injection process of carbon ions
for HITFiL, the interactions between carbon ions and foil has been studied, and
simulated with a code developed by ourselves .The optimized parameters of the
injecting beam and the scheme of the injection system have been presented for
HITFiL.
