The meson-baryon coupled channel unitary approach with the local hidden gauge
formalism is extended to the hidden beauty sector. A few narrow $N^*$ and
$\Lambda^*$ resonances around 11 GeV are predicted as dynamically generated
states from the interactions of heavy beauty mesons and baryons. Production
cross sections of these predicted resonances in $pp$ and $ep$ collisions are
estimated as a guide for the possible experimental search at relevant
facilities.
