We consider the phenomenological consequences of a hidden Higgs sector
extending the Standard Model (SM), in which the ``shadow Higgs'' are uncharged
under the SM gauge groups. We consider a simple U(1) model with one Higgs
singlet. One mechanism which sheds light on the shadow sector is the mixing
between the neutral gauge boson of the SM and the additional U(1) gauge group.
The mixing happens through the usual mass-mixing and also kinetic-mixing, and
is the only way the ``shadow $Z$'' couples to the SM. We study in detail
modifications to the electroweak precision tests (EWPTs) that the presence of
such a shadow sector would bring, which in turn provide constraints on the
kinetic-mixing parameter, $s_\epsilon$, left free in our model. The shadow $Z$
production rate at the LHC and ILC depends on $s_\epsilon$. We find that
observable event rate at both facilities is possible for a reasonable range of
$s_\epsilon$ allowed by EWPTs.
