(Abridged) The transition probabilities describing the evolution of a
neutrino with a given energy along some ray through a turbulent supernova are
random variates unique to each ray. If the source of the neutrinos were a point
then all neutrinos of a given energy and emitted at the same time which were
detected in some far off location would have seen the same turbulent profile
therefore their transition probabilities would be exactly correlated. But if
the source has a finite size then the profiles seen by neutrinos emitted from
different points at the source will have seen different turbulence and the
correlation of the transition probabilities will be reduced. In this paper we
study the correlation of the neutrino transition probabilities through
turbulent supernova profiles as a function of the separation between the
emission points using an isotropic and an anisotropic power spectrum for the
random field used to model the turbulence. The spectral features in the high
density resonance mixing channel of the next Galactic supernova neutrino burst
may be strongly obscured by large amplitude turbulence when it enters the
signal due to the finite size of the source while the presence of features in
the low density and non resonant mixing channels may persist, the exact amount
depending upon the degree of anisotropy of the turbulence.
