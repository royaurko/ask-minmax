We use a Chandra observation of the poor cluster AWM4 to map the temperature
and abundance of the intra-cluster medium, so as to examine the influence of
the central radio galaxy on its environment. While the cluster core is
generally enriched to near-solar abundances, we find evidence of super-solar
abundances correlated with the radio jets, extending ~35 kpc from the core of
the central dominant galaxy NGC 6051 along its minor axis. We conclude that the
enriched gas has been transported out of the central galaxy through the action
of the radio source. We estimate the excess mass of iron in the entrained gas
to be ~1.4x10^6 Msol, and find that this can be produced in the core of NGC
6051 within the timescale of the AGN outburst. The energy required to transport
this gas to its current location is ~4.5x10^57 erg, a significant fraction of
the estimated total mechanical energy output of the AGN, though this estimate
is dependent on the degree of enrichment of the uplifted gas. The larger
near-solar abundance region is also compatible with enrichment by metals mixed
outward from NGC 6051 over a much longer timescale.
