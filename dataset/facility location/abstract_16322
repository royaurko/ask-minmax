We extend our theoretical computations for low-mass stars to
intermediate-mass and massive stars, for which few databases exist in the
literature. Evolutionary tracks and isochrones are computed from 2.50 to 20
solar masses for agrid of 37 chemical compositions with metal content Z between
0.0001 and 0.070 and helium content Y between 0.23 and 0.40. Synthetic TP-AGB
models allow stellar tracks and isochrones to be extended until the end of the
thermal pulses along the AGB. We provide software tools for the bidimensional
interpolation (in Y and Z) of the isochrones. We present tracks for
scaled-solar abundances and the corresponding isochrones from very old ages
down to about 10 million years. The extension of the blue loops and the
instability strip of Cepheid stars are compared and the Cepheid
mass-discrepancy is discussed. The location of red supergiants in the H-R
diagram is in good agreement with the evolutionary tracks for masses from 10 to
20 solar masses. Tracks and isochrones are available in tabular form for the
adopted grid of chemical compositions in the extended plane Z-Y in three
photometric systems. An interactive web interface allows users to obtain
isochrones of any chemical composition inside the provided Z-Y range and also
to simulate stellar populations with different Y(Z) helium-to-metal enrichment
laws.
