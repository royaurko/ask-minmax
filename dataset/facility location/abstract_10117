We consider the extension of the Majumdar-type class of static solutions for
the Einstein-Maxwell equations, proposed by Ida to include charged perfect
fluid sources. We impose the equation of state $\rho+3p=0$ and discuss
spherically symmetric solutions for the linear potential equation satisfied by
the metric. In this particular case the fluid charge density vanishes and we
locate the arising neutral perfect fluid in the intermediate region defined by
two thin shells with respective charges $Q$ and $-Q$. With its innermost flat
and external (Schwarzschild) asymptotically flat spacetime regions, the
resultant condenser-like geometries resemble solutions discussed by Cohen and
Cohen in a different context. We explore this relationship and point out an
exotic gravitational property of our neutral perfect fluid. We mention possible
continuations of this study to embrace non-spherically symmetric situations and
higher dimensional spacetimes.
