Malicious anchor nodes will constantly hinder genuine and appropriate
localization. Discovering the malicious or vulnerable anchor node is an
essential problem in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In wireless sensor
networks, anchor nodes are the nodes that know its current location.
Neighbouring nodes or non-anchor nodes calculate its location (or its location
reference) with the help of anchor nodes. Ingenuous localization is not
possible in the presence of a cheating anchor node or a cheating node.
Nowadays, it's a challenging task to identify the cheating anchor node or
cheating node in a network. Even after finding out the location of the cheating
anchor node, there is no assurance, that the identified node is legitimate or
not. This paper aims to localize the cheating anchor nodes using trilateration
algorithm and later associate it with maximum likelihood expectation technique
(MLE), and Mahalanobis distance to obtain maximum accuracy in identifying
malicious or cheating anchor nodes during localization. We were able to attain
a considerable reduction in the error achieved during localization. For
implementation purpose we simulated our scheme using ns-3 network simulator.
