The variable star V39 in the field of IC 1613 is discussed in the light of
the available photometric and new spectroscopic data. It has strong emission
Balmer lines, and the observed characteristics could be explained by a W Vir
pulsating star with a period of 14.341 d, located at more than 115 kpc, that is
in the very outer halo of our Galaxy. It should have an apparent companion, a
long period (1118d) red variable, belonging to IC 1613. The main uncertainty in
this interpretation is an emission feature at 668.4 nm, which we tentatively
identified as a He I line.
