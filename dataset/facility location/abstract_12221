Although web applications evolved to mature solutions providing sophisticated
user experience, they also became complex for the same reason. Complexity
primarily affects the server-side generation of dynamic pages as they are
aggregated from multiple sources and as there are lots of possible processing
paths depending on parameters. Browser-based tests are an adequate instrument
to detect errors within generated web pages considering the server-side process
and path complexity a black box. However, these tests do not detect the cause
of an error which has to be located manually instead. This paper proposes to
generate metadata on the paths and parts involved during server-side processing
to facilitate backtracking origins of detected errors at development time.
While there are several possible points of interest to observe for
backtracking, this paper focuses user interface components of web frameworks.
