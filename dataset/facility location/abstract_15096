We report on high-resolution interferometer observations of the 12CO(J=1-0)
emission in the central 5 kpc region of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 4501. The
observations were made using the Nobeyama Millimeter Array during a long-term
CO line survey of Virgo spirals. The major features are: (1) a nuclear
concentration with a radius of r~5'' (390 pc), which is resolved into double
peaks, and (2) spiral arms which extend out from the nuclear region. The
nuclear component has a mass of 1.3x10^8 Mo, which corresponds to ~3.5% of the
dynamical mass, and shows a slight non-circular motion. The double peaks are
separated by ~4''.7. (370 pc), and located on the root of optical spiral arms
in a HST image. The gas arms are associated with the spiral dust lanes, and are
linked to the central double peaks. The non-circular motions along the
molecular arms indicate the fact that the gas is driven by the density wave,
rather than the stochastic processes. We calculated the gas cloud orbits in a
stellar spiral potential, and explained the observed CO spiral arms and
non-circular motions. We suggest that the central gas condensation arises from
spiral-driven gas transfer. We estimated and compared the effect of two
possible mechanisms of angular-momentum transfer: galactic shock, and
gravitational torques. We discuss that the galactic shock is dominant.
