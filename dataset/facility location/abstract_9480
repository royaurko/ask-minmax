LOPES (LOFAR Prototype Station) is an array of dipole antennas used for
detection of radio emission from air showers. It is co-located and triggered by
the KASCADE (Karlsruhe Shower Core and Array Detector) experiment, which also
provides informations about air shower properties. Even though neither LOPES
nor KASCADE are completely optimized for the detection of highly inclined
events, a significant number of showers with zenith angle larger than 50$^o$
have been detected in the radio domain, and many with very high field
strengths. Investigation of inclined showers can give deeper insight into the
nature of primary particles that initiate showers and also into the possibility
that some of detected showers are triggered by neutrinos. In this paper, we
show the example of such an event and present some of the characteristics of
highly inclined showers detected by LOPES.
