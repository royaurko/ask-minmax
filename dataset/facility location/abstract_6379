The complex magnetic field of the permanent-magnet electron cyclotron
resonance (ECR) ion source MEFISTO located at the University of Bern have been
numerically simulated. For the first time the magnetized volume qualified for
electron cyclotron resonance at 2.45 GHz and 87.5 mT has been analyzed in
highly detailed 3D simulations with unprecedented resolution. New results were
obtained from the numerical simulation of 25211 electron trajectories. The
evident characteristic ion sputtering trident of hexapole confined ECR sources
has been identified with the field and electron trajectory distribution.
Furthermore, unexpected long electron trajectory lifetimes were found.
