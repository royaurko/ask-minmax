Tunka-Rex is the radio extension of Tunka-133 located in Siberia close to
Lake Baikal. The latter is a photomultiplier array registering air-Cherenkov
light from air showers induced by cosmic-ray particles with initial energies of
approximately $10^{16}$ to $10^{18}$ eV. Tunka-Rex extends this detector with
25 antennas spread over an area of 1 km$^2$. It is triggered externally by
Tunka-133, and detects the radio emission of the same air showers. The
combination of an air-Cherenkov and a radio detector provides a facility for
hybrid measurements and cross-calibration between the two techniques. The main
goal of Tunka-Rex is to determine the precision of the reconstruction of
air-shower parameters using the radio detection technique. It started operation
in autumn 2012. We present the overall concept of Tunka-Rex, the current status
of the array and first analysis results.
