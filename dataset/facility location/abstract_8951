A514 contains six extended and polarized radio sources located at various
projected distances from the cluster center. Here we present a detailed study
of these six radio sources in total intensity and polarization using the Very
Large Array at 3.6 and 6 cm. Since the radio sources sample different lines of
sight across the cluster, an analysis of the Faraday Rotation Measures (RMs)
provides information on the strength and the structure of the cluster magnetic
field. These sources show a decreasing Faraday Rotation Measure with increasing
distance from the cluster center. We estimate the strength of the magnetic
field to be ~3-7 uG in the cluster center. From the RM structure across the
stronger and more extended sources we estimate the coherence length of the
magnetic field to be about 9 kpc at the cluster center.
