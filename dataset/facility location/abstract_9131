The ARGO-YBJ experiment is currently under construction at the Yangbajing
Cosmic Ray Laboratory (4300 m a.s.l.). The detector will cover 74 X 78 m^2 with
a single layer of Resistive Plate Counters (RPCs), surrounded by a partially
instrumented guard ring. Signals from each RPC are picked-up with 80 read out
strips 6 cm wide and 62 cm long. These strips allow one to count the particle
number of small size air showers. In this paper we discuss the digital response
of the detector for showers with core located in a small fiducial area inside
the carpet. The results enable us to assess the sensitivity of the strip size
spectrum measurement to discriminate between different models of the Primary
Cosmic Ray composition in the energy range 10 - 500 TeV.
