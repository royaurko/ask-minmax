We design and evaluate algorithms for efficient user-mobility driven
macro-cell planning in cellular networks. As cellular networks embrace
heterogeneous technologies (including long range 3G/4G and short range WiFi,
Femto-cells, etc.), most traffic generated by static users gets absorbed by the
short-range technologies, thereby increasingly leaving mobile user traffic to
macro-cells. To this end, we consider a novel approach that factors in the
trajectories of mobile users as well as the impact of city geographies and
their associated road networks for macro-cell planning. Given a budget k of
base-stations that can be upgraded, our approach selects a deployment that
impacts the most number of user trajectories. The generic formulation
incorporates the notion of quality of service of a user trajectory as a
parameter to allow different application-specific requirements, and operator
choices.We show that the proposed trajectory utility maximization problem is
NP-hard, and design multiple heuristics. We evaluate our algorithms with real
and synthetic data sets emulating different city geographies to demonstrate
their efficacy. For instance, with an upgrade budget k of 20%, our algorithms
perform 3-8 times better in improving the user quality of service on
trajectories in different city geographies when compared to greedy
location-based base-station upgrades.
