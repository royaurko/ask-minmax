We address the synthesis of distributed control policies to enable a swarm of
homogeneous mobile sensors to maintain a desired spatial distribution in a
geophysical flow environment, or workspace. In this article, we assume the
mobile sensors (or robots) have a "map" of the environment denoting the
locations of the Lagrangian coherent structures or LCS boundaries. Based on
this information, we design agent-level hybrid control policies that leverage
the surrounding fluid dynamics and inherent environmental noise to enable the
team to maintain a desired distribution in the workspace. We establish the
stability properties of the ensemble dynamics of the distributed control
policies. Since realistic quasi-geostrophic ocean models predict double-gyre
flow solutions, we use a wind-driven multi-gyre flow model to verify the
feasibility of the proposed distributed control strategy and compare the
proposed control strategy with a baseline deterministic allocation strategy.
Lastly, we validate the control strategy using actual flow data obtained by our
coherent structure experimental testbed.
