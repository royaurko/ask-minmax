The J-PARC E56 experiment aims to search for sterile neutrinos at the J-PARC
Materials and Life Science Experimental Facility (MLF). In order to examine the
feasibility of the experiment, we measured the background rates of different
detector candidate sites, which are located at the third floor of the MLF,
using a detector consisting of plastic scintillators with a fiducial mass of
500 kg. The result of the measurements is described in this article. The gammas
and neutrons induced by the beam as well as the backgrounds from the cosmic
rays were measured.
