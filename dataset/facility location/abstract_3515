The neutron-rich isotopes 65,67Fe and 65Co have been produced at the LISOL
facility, Louvain-La-Neuve, in the proton-induced fission of 238U. Beams of
these isotopes have been extracted with high selectivity by means of resonant
laser ionization combined with mass separation. Yrast and near-yrast levels of
65Co have also been populated in the 64Ni+238U reaction at Argonne National
Laboratory. The level structure of 65Co could be investigated by combining all
the information from both the 65Fe and 65Co beta decay and the deep-inelastic
reaction. The 65Fe, 65Co and 67Fe decay schemes and the 65Co yrast structure
are fully established. The 65,67Co level structures can be interpreted as
resulting from the coexistence of core-coupled states with levels based on a
low-energy proton-intruder configuration.
