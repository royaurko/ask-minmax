The effect of an in-plane magnetic field on resonant tunneling in a symmetric
GaAs/AlYGa1-YAs triple-barrier resonant tunneling TBRT structure is presented.
The splitting of the resonant lines (and hence the coupling energy vs. magnetic
induction) for the ground and the first excited resonant doublet shifts up in
energy by increasing the magnetic induction. Each of branches in the resonant
dispersion relations shows a parabolic behavior with the location of the
cyclotron orbit center. It is expected that, at very high fields, the
interaction with confined phonons be enhanced, due to phonon coupling between
electron states in the ground quasibound doublet.
