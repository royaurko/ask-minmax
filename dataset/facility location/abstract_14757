The afterglow emission from a spreading jet expanding in a circumstellar
cloud is discussed. Prompt X-ray radiation and a strong UV flash from the
reverse shock produced by the interaction of the jet with the cloud may destroy
and clear the dust out to about 30 pc within the initial solid angle of the
jet. As the sideways expansion of the jet becomes significant, most of the
optical radiation from the high-latitude part of the jet may be absorbed by the
dust outside the initial solid angle of the jet, but only the radiation from
the part within the initial solid angle can be observed. We analytically show
that the flux of the observational radiation decays as $\propto t^{-(p+1)}$
(where $p$ is the power-law index of the electron distribution) in the
relativistic phase. This preliminary result motivates us to perform numerical
calculations. Our results show that one break in the optical afterglow ligh
curve extends over a factor of $\sim 3$ in time rather than one decade in time
in the previous jet model. These results may provide a way to judge whether
GRBs locate in dense clouds or not. Finally, we carry out a detailed modelling
for the R-band afterglow of GRB 000926.
