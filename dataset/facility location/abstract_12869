The Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) is a new multi-fiber spectrograph on
Subaru telescope. PFS will cover around 1.4 degree diameter field with ~2400
fibers. To ensure precise positioning of the fibers, a metrology camera is
designed to provide the fiber position information within 5 {\mu}m error. The
final positioning accuracy of PFS is targeted to be better than 10 {\mu}m. The
metrology camera will locate at the Cassegrain focus of Subaru telescope to
cover the whole focal plane. The PFS metrology camera will also serve for the
existing multi-fiber infrared spectrograph FMOS.
