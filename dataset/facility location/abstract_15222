We present the results of optical spectroscopy of 139 stars obtained with the
Hydra multi-object spectrograph. The objects extend over a 1.3 square degree
area surrounding the main cloud of the rho Oph complex. The objects were
selected from narrowband images to have H alpha in emission. Using the presence
of strong H alpha emission, lithium absorption, location in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, or previously reported x-ray emission, we were
able to identify 88 objects as young stars associated with the cloud. Strong H
alpha emission was confirmed in 39 objects with line widths consistent with
their origin in magnetospheric accretion columns. Two of the strongest
emission-line objects are young, x-ray emitting brown dwarf candidates with M8
spectral types. Comparisons of the bolometric luminosities and effective
temperatures with theoretical models suggest a medianage for this population of
2.1 Myr which is signifcantly older than the ages derived for objects in the
cloud core. It appears that these stars formed contemporaneously with low mass
stars in the Upper Scorpius subgroup, likely triggered by massive stars in the
Upper-Centaurus subgroup.
