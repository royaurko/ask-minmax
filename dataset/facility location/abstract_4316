In this work, we study superconvergence properties for some high-order
orthogonal polynomial interpolations.The results are two-folds: When
interpolating function values, we identify those points where the first and
second derivatives of the interpolant converge faster;When interpolating the
first derivative,we locate those points where the function value of the
interpolant superconverges. For the earlier case, we use various Chebyshev
polynomials; and for the later case,we also include the counterpart Legendre
polynomials.
