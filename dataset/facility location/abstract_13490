We show that quasi localized low-frequency modes in the vibrational spectrum
can be used to construct soft spots, or regions vulnerable to rearrangement,
which serve as a universal tool for the identification of flow defects in
solids. We show that soft spots not only encode spatial information, via their
location, but also directional information, via directors for particles within
each soft spot. Single crystals with isolated dislocations exhibit
low-frequency phonon modes that localize at the core, and their polarization
pattern predicts the motion of atoms during elementary dislocation glide in
exquisite detail. Even in polycrystals and disordered solids, we find that the
directors associated with particles in soft spots are highly correlated with
the direction of particle displacements in rearrangements.
