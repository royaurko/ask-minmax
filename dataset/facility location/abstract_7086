The Fisher-KPP equation is a model for population dynamics that has generated
a huge amount of interest since its introduction in 1937. The speed with which
a population spreads has been computed quite precisely when the initial data
decays exponentially. More recently, though, the case when the initial data
decays more slowly has been studied. Building on the results of Hamel and
Roques '10, in this paper we improve their precision for a broader class of
initial data and for a broader class of equations. In particular, our approach
yields the explicit highest order term in the location of the level sets. In
addition, we characterize the profile of the inhomogeneous problem for large
times.
