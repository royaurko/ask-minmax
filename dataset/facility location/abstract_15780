Let G be a real, connected, noncompact, semisimple Lie group, let K be a
maximal compact subgroup of G, and let g=k+p be the corresponding Cartan
decomposition of the complexified Lie algebra of G. Sequences of strongly
orthogonal noncompact weights are constructed and classified for each real
noncompact simple Lie group of classical type. We show that for each partial
subsequence there is a corresponding family of K_C-orbits, ordered by inclusion
and such that the representation of K on the ring of regular functions on the
closure of the orbit is multiplicity-free. The K-types of regular functions on
the orbits and the regular functions on their closures are both explicitly
identified and demonstrated to coincide, with one exception in the Hermitian
symmetric case. The classification presented also includes the specification of
a base point for each orbit and exhibits a corresponding system of restricted
roots with multiplicities. A formula for the leading term of the Hilbert
polynomials corresponding to these orbits is given. This formula, together with
the restricted root data, allows the determination of the dimensions of these
orbits and the algebraic-geometric degree of their closures. In an appendix,
the location of these orbits within D. King's classification of spherical
nilpotent orbits in complex symmetric spaces is depicted via signed partitions
and Hasse diagrams.
