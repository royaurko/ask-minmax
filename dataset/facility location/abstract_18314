The velocity field of the nearly face-on galaxy NGC 3631, derived from
observations in the H alpha line and the HI radio line, is analysed to study
perturbations related to the spiral structure of the galaxy. We confirm our
previous conclusion that the line-of-sight velocity field gives evidence of the
wave nature of the observed two-armed spiral structure. Fourier analysis of the
observed velocity field is used to determine the location of corotation of the
spiral structure of this galaxy, and the radius of corotation R_c is found to
be about 42 arcsec, or 3.2 kpc. The vector velocity field of the gas in the
plane of the disc is restored, and taking into account that we previously
investigated vertical motions, we now have a full 3D gaseous velocity field of
the galaxy. We show clear evidence of the existence of two anticyclonic and
four cyclonic vortices near corotation in a frame of reference rotating with
the spiral pattern. The centres of the anticyclones lie between the observed
spiral arms. The cyclones lie close to the observed spirals, but their centres
are shifted from the maxima in brightness.
