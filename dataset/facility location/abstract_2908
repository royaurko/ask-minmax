We have used the SHARC II camera at Caltech Submillimeter Observatory to make
350 and 450 micron images of the Vega dust disk at spatial resolutions (FWHM)
of 9.7" and 11.1", respectively. The images show a ring-like morphology (radius
\~ 100 AU) with inhomogeneous structure that is qualitatively different from
that previously reported at 850 microns and longer wavelengths. We attribute
the 350/450 micron emission to a grain population whose characteristic size (~
1 mm) is intermediate between that of the cm-sized grains responsible for
emission longward of 850 microns and the much smaller grains (< 18 microns) in
the extensive halo, visible at 70 microns, discussed by Su et al. (2005). We
have combined our submillimeter images with Spitzer data at 70 microns to
produce 2-d maps of line-of-sight optical depth (relative column density).
These "tau maps" suggest that the mm-sized grains are located preferentially in
three symmetrically-located concentrations. If so, then this structure could be
understood in terms of the Wyatt (2003) model in which planetesimals are
trapped in the mean motion resonances of a Neptune-mass planet at 65 AU,
provided allowance is made for the spatial distribution of dust grains to
differ from that of the parent planetesimals. The peaks of the tau maps are, in
fact, located near the expected positions corresponding to the 4:3 resonance.
If this identification is confirmed by future observations, it would resolve an
ambiguity with regard to the location of the planet.
