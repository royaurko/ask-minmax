A group of 72 members of the astrochemistry and spectroscopy communities
assembled at Emory University in October, 2012, to discuss the state-of-the art
in molecular laboratory spectroscopic techniques used to study molecules of
astrophysical interest, and highlight recent successes in laboratory efforts
that complement new astronomical observations. The format of the meeting
facilitated detailed discussion of the needs for collecting and interpreting
molecular spectroscopic information to support observational astrophysics in
the era of Far-IR astronomy. We present the findings and recommendations from
this workshop in this report. The participants in this workshop identified the
development of new laboratory capabilities that offer rapid, broadband,
high-resolution, high-sensitivity measurements of molecular spectra in the
frequency ranges that overlap with new observational facilities as the top
priority for far-infrared laboratory astrophysics initiatives over the next
5-10 years. An additional major need is the development of suitable analysis
tools for broadband molecular spectra from both the laboratory and space;
though such efforts should be conducted within the framework of larger
collaborative funding structures, rather than through single-PI efforts, so as
to provide tools that are generally applicable rather than highly specialized.
Additional efforts in theory, computation, and modeling that support these
goals are also important for advancing this field.
