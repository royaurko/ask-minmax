A successive continuation method for locating connecting orbits in
parametrized systems of autonomous ODEs was considered in [9]. In this paper we
present an improved algorithm for locating and continuing connecting orbits,
which includes a new algorithm for the continuation of invariant subspaces. The
latter algorithm is of independent interest, and can be used in different
contexts than the present one.
