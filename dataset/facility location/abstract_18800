We have all read that: (1) organized medicine was laughing at the germ theory
and refused to wash its hands in the late 1800's while women died of childbed
fever and other patients of wound sepsis (scientists in general, including
physicists, were among those who died); and (2) during the 1900's, and still
today, organized medicine is laughing at the essential nutrient theory. We now
hear the medical quality assurance boards enforce MANY MISTAKEN VIEWS and DO
NOT recognize that: "xenobiotics can't be substituted for essential nutrients;
ascorbic acid is NOT a vitamin and hence, is needed in multi-gram (not minute
amounts) for optimum health; there is great harm in a diet deriving half its
calories from refined carbohydrates as is common in the US today; dietary
correction is possible at a stage when surgery is contemplated for a cardiac
patient; mercury dental fillings and even the high-copper variety most widely
used are extremely unsafe;" etc. The purpose of this manuscript is to elicit
coordinated collective effort of physicists, other scientists and the Union of
Concerned Scientists to educate the public and end this tyranny of organized
medicine whose methods are reported to cause much M&M (over a million
unnecessary US deaths at a cost of many billion dollars annually). The
biochemistry of these errors would be trivial to understand for physicists and
other scientists (who are all still going innocently to slaughter among those
dying needlessly, even today).
