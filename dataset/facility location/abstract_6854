This paper examines some methods and ideas underlying the contributor's successful
probabilistic learning systems(PLS), which have proven uniquely effective and
efficient in generalization learning or induction. While the emerging
principles are generally applicable, this paper illustrates them in heuristic
search, which demands noise management and incremental learning. In our
approach, both task performance and learning are guided by probability.
Probabilities are incrementally normalized and revised, and their errors are
located and corrected.
