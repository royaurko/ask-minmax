This paper describes an architecture for a distributing processing system
that would allow remote procedure calls to invoke other services as messages
are passed between clients and servers. It proposes that an additional class of
data processing objects be located in the software communications channel. The
objects in this channel would then be used to enforce protocols on
client-server applications without any additional effort by the application
programmers. For example, services such as key-management, time-stamping,
sequencing and encryption can be implemented at different levels of the
software communications stack to provide a complete authentication service. A
distributing processing environment could be used to control broadband network
data delivery. Architectures and invocation semantics are discussed, Example
classes and interfaces for channel objects are given in the Java programming
language.
