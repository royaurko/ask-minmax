MAGIC is a system of two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes located on
the Canary island of La Palma, Spain. During summer 2011 and 2012 it underwent
a major upgrade. The main subsystems upgraded were the MAGIC-I camera and its
trigger system and the readout system of both telescopes. We use observations
of the Crab Nebula taken at low and medium zenith angles to assess the key
performance parameters of the MAGIC stereo system. For low zenith angle
observations, the standard trigger threshold of the MAGIC telescopes is about
50 GeV. The integral sensitivity for point-like sources with Crab Nebula-like
spectra above 220 GeV is (0.66 +/- 0.03)% of Crab Nebula flux in 50 h of
observations. The angular resolution, defined as the sigma of a 2-dimensional
Gaussian distribution, at energies of a few hundred GeV is below 0.07degree,
while the energy resolution is around 16%. We investigate the effect of the
systematic uncertainty on the data taken with the MAGIC telescopes after the
upgrade. We estimate that the systematic uncertainties can be divided in the
following components: < 15% in energy scale, 11 - 18% in flux normalization and
+/-0.15 for the slope of the energy spectrum.
