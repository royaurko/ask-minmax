We report the discovery of a wide (approximately 400 AU projected
separation), common proper motion companion to the nearby M dwarf LHS 2803 (PSO
J207.0300-13.7422). This object was discovered during our census of the local T
dwarf population using Pan-STARRS1 and 2MASS data. Using IRTF/SpeX
near-infrared spectroscopy, we classify the secondary to be spectral type T5.5.
University of Hawai`i 2.2m/SNIFS optical spectroscopy indicates the primary has
a spectral type of M4.5, with approximately solar metallicity and no measurable
H_alpha emission. We use this lack of activity to set a lower age limit for the
system of 3.5 Gyr. Using a comparison with chance alignments of brown dwarfs
and nearby stars, we conclude that the two objects are unlikely to be a chance
association. The primary's photometric distance of 21 pc and its proper motion
implies thin disk kinematics. Based on these kinematics and its metallicity, we
set an upper age limit for the system of 10 Gyr. Evolutionary model
calculations suggest the secondary has a mass of 72^+4_-7 M_Jup, temperature of
1120+-80 K, and log g=5.4+-0.1 dex. Model atmosphere fitting to the near-IR
spectrum gives similar physical parameters of 1100 K and log g=5.0.
