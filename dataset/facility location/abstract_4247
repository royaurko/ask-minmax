Considering that the rays in the Michelson-Morley interferometer perform the
radar detection of its mirrors, we use a relativistic diagram that displays, at
a convenient scale, their location and the path of the rays. This approach
convinces us that the rays that come from the two arms interfere with zero
phase difference without using the usual ingredient, length contraction.
