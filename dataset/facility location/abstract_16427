The burst-only Swift J1749.4-2807 source was discovered in a high
X-ray-active state, while during an {INTEGRAL observations of the Galactic
bulge on 2010 April 10. Pulsations at 518 Hz were discovered in the RXTE data,
confirming previous suggestions of possible associations between burst-only
sources and accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars. The subsequent discovery of
X-ray eclipses made Swift J1749.4$-$2807 the first eclipsing accreting
millisecond X-ray pulsar. We obtain additional information on Swift
J1749.4-2807 and other burst-only sources. We report on the results of a
monitoring campaign on the source, carried out for about two weeks with the
Swift, INTEGRAL, and RXTE satellites.
  The observations showed that the X-ray spectrum (energy range 0.5-40 keV) of
Swift J1749.4-2807 during the entire event was accurately modeled by an
absorbed power-law model (N_H~3e2 cm^-2, Gamma~1.7). X-ray eclipses were also
detected in the Swift data and provides a clear evidence of a dust-scattering
halo located along the line of sight to the source. Only one type-I X-ray burst
was observed throughout the two-weeks long monitoring. The X-ray flux of Swift
J1749.4-2807 decayed below the detection threshold of Swift/XRT about 11 days
after the discovery, in a exponential fashion (e-folding time of tau=12^+7_-3
days). We compare the properties of the outburst observed from Swift
J1749.4-2807 with those of the previously known millisecond X-ray pulsars and
other transient low mass X-ray binaries.
