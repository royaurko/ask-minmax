This paper presents the coupling of a building thermal simulation code with
genetic algorithms (GAs). GAs are randomized search algorithms that are based
on the mechanisms of natural selection and genetics. We show that this coupling
allows the location of defective sub-models of a building thermal model i.e.
parts of model that are responsible for the disagreements between measurements
and model predictions. The method first of all is checked and validated on the
basis of a numerical model of a building taken as reference. It is then applied
to a real building case. The results show that the method could constitute an
efficient tool when checking the model validity.
