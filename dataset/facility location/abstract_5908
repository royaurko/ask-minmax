Putative global minima have been located for clusters interacting with an
aluminium glue potential for N<190. Virtually all the clusters have
polytetrahedral structures, which for larger sizes involve an ordered array of
disclinations that are similar to those in the Z, H and sigma Frank-Kasper
phases. Comparisons of sequences of larger clusters suggest that the majority
of the global minima will adopt the bulk face-centred-cubic structure beyond
N=500.
