The potential of combining Adaptive Optics (AO) and Lucky Imaging (LI) to
achieve high precision astrometry and differential photometry in the optical is
investigated by conducting observations of the close 0\farcs1 brown dwarf
binary GJ569Bab. We took 50000 $I$-band images with our LI instrument FastCam
attached to NAOMI, the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope (WHT) AO facility. In
order to extract the most of the astrometry and photometry of the GJ569Bab
system we have resorted to a PSF fitting technique using the primary star
GJ569A as a suitable PSF reference which exhibits an $I$-band magnitude of
$7.78\pm0.03$. The AO+LI observations at WHT were able to resolve the binary
system GJ569Bab located at $4\farcs 92 \pm 0\farcs05$ from GJ569A. We measure a
separation of $98.4 \pm 1.1$ mas and $I$-band magnitudes of $13.86 \pm 0.03$
and $14.48 \pm 0.03$ and $I-J$ colors of 2.72$\pm$0.08 and 2.83$\pm$0.08 for
the Ba and Bb components, respectively. Our study rules out the presence of any
other companion to GJ569A down to magnitude I$\sim$ 17 at distances larger than
1\arcsec. The $I-J$ colors measured are consistent with M8.5-M9 spectral types
for the Ba and Bb components. The available dynamical, photometric and
spectroscopic data are consistent with a binary system with Ba being slightly
(10-20%) more massive than Bb. We obtain new orbital parameters which are in
good agreement with those in the literature.
