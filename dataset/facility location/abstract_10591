During the second land campaign (LC-II) organised by ISRO-GBP, extensive
ground-based measurements of aerosol characteristics were carried out over
Manora Peak (29.4oN; 79.5oE; 1951 metres above mean sea level), Nainital (a
high altitude station located in the Shivalik ranges of Central Himalayas)
during the dry, winter season (December) of 2004. These measurements included
the spectral aerosol optical depths (AOD), columnar water vapour content (W),
Total Columnar Ozone (TCO), total number concentration (NT) of near surface
aerosols, mass concentration of black carbon (MB), aerosol mass loading (MT),
and Global Solar Radiation. Based on these measured parameters, we present the
results on the near-surface and columnar properties of atmospheric aerosols at
Nainital.
