Interactions between the radio jet and the optical emission of the
narrow-line region (NLR) are a well known phenomenon in Seyfert galaxies. Here,
we present the study of possible jet-NLR interactions in five radio-quiet PG
quasars with double or triple radio structure. High spatial and spectral
resolution observations were carried out in the Hbeta-[OIII]5007 wavelength
range. In all cases, there is evidence for [OIII] profile substructure
(shoulders, subpeaks, blueshifted ''broad'' components) with different clarity.
To measure the velocity, line width, intensity, and location of these [OIII]
components, several Gaussians were fitted. Often, the substructures are more
pronounced close to the radio lobes, suggestive of jet-NLR interactions. Our
observations support the unification scheme in which radio-quiet quasars are
assumed to be the luminous cousins of Seyfert galaxies.
