In this talk we show how the errors on solar and atmospheric parameters
affect the measurement of the unknown PMNS parameters $\theta_{13}$ and
$\delta$ at future LBL facilities. Performing three parameters fits in
$\theta_{13}$, $\delta$ and, in turn, one of the atmospheric or solar
parameters, we show that present uncertainties on $\theta_{23}$ and $\Delta
m^2_{23}$ worsen significantly the precision on ($\theta_{13}$,$\delta$)
whereas the solar sector does not introduce further uncertainties. A precision
on the atmospheric parameters similar to what expected at T2K-I is necessary to
improve the sensitivities to $\theta_{13}$ and $\delta$.
