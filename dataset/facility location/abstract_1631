A Forward Plug Calorimeter (FPC) for the ZEUS detector at HERA has been built
as a shashlik lead-scintillator calorimeter with wave length shifter fiber
readout. Before installation it was tested and calibrated using the X5 test
beam facility of the SPS accelerator at CERN. Electron, muon and pion beams in
the momentum range of 10 to 100 GeV/c were used. Results of these measurements
are presented as well as a calibration monitoring system based on a $^{60}$Co
source.
