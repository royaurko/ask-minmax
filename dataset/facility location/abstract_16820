Constructing a surface that is an integral part of the function of
tribosystems (deterministic surface) is an intriguing goal. Inspirations for
such surfaces come from studying natural systems and deducing design rules. The
major attraction is that natural systems, while functionally complex, are, in
general, of optimized shape and performance. It is further believed that
functional complexity of natural systems is what affords natural species to
morph continuously to adapt with the operating environment. One bio-species
that is of interest is the Ball Python. This is because such a species
continuously slides against various surfaces, many of which are deemed
tribologically hostile, without sustaining much damage. Much of the success of
that species in adapting to its environment is attributed to surface design
features. In that respect, studying these features and how do they contribute
to the control of friction and wear is very attractive. This paper is a step in
this direction. In this work we apply a multi scale surface characterization
approach to study surface design features of the Python Regius. The focus is on
those features that are typically used to assess the performance of high
quality lubricating surfaces. To this end, topographical features are studied
by SEM and through White Light Interferrometery (WLI). We probe the roughness
of the surface on multi scale and as a function of location within the body. In
addition we draw a comparison of these features to those of human skin.
