The vibrational modes of handbells exist in nearly-degenerate pairs which
have been split by nonuniformities in the bell. The possibility of
intentionally re-combining a pair into pseudo-degeneracy was explored by adding
mass to various locations on a C4 handbell. Depending on the location and mass
added to the bell, the modes can be shifted in position and frequency as
observed by a real-time holographic interferometry system. By moving and
varying the added mass, one pair of modes was successfully brought into a
pseudo-degeneracy.
