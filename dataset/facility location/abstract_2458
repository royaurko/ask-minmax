The summation amplitude of coincident pulses (SACP) method which is optimal
solution to reduce compton scatter phenomenon and pairs phenomenon in the gamma
spectra of nuclei decay gamma cascades was used. In the 1982, in comparision
with original method [1], it was improved such as the interfacing techniques,
and data analysis with aid of computer [2]. In order to get better, the
fast/slow coincidence spectroscopy system was developed into a fast coincidence
spectroscopy. It is advantageous and easy operation. The off-line measure
results with radioactive source 60-Co and on-line measure results with 35-Cl
target on the tangential channel of Dalat Research Reactor were showed the good
abilities of this spectroscopy system.
