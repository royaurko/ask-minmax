Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S) measurements in the
superconducting dichalcogenide 2H-NbS2 show a peculiar superconducting density
of states with two well defined features at 0.97 meV and 0.53 meV, located
respectively above and below the value for the superconducting gap expected
from single band s-wave BCS model (D=1.76kBTc=0.9 meV). Both features have a
continuous temperature evolution and disappear at Tc = 5.7 K. Moreover, we
observe the hexagonal vortex lattice with radially symmetric vortices and a
well developed localized state at the vortex cores. The sixfold star shape
characteristic of the vortex lattice of the compound 2H-NbSe2 is, together with
the charge density wave order (CDW), absent in 2H-NbS2.
