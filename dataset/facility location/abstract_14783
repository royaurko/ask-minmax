We investigate the role of ram pressure stripping in the Virgo cluster using
N-body simulations. Radial orbits within the Virgo cluster's gravitational
potential are modeled and analyzed with respect to ram pressure stripping. The
N-body model consists of 10000 gas cloud complexes which can have inelastic
collisions. Ram pressure is modeled as an additional acceleration on the clouds
located at the surface of the gas distribution in the direction of the galaxy's
motion within the cluster. We made several simulations changing the orbital
parameters in order to recover different stripping scenarios using realistic
temporal ram pressure profiles. We investigate systematically the influence of
the inclination angle between the disk and the orbital plane of the galaxy on
the gas dynamics. We show that ram pressure can lead to a temporary increase of
the central gas surface density. In some cases a considerable part of the total
atomic gas mass (several 10^8 M_solar) can fall back onto the galactic disk
after the stripping event. A quantitative relation between the orbit parameters
and the resulting HI deficiency is derived containing explicitly the
inclination angle between the disk and the orbital plane. The comparison
between existing HI observations and the results of our simulations shows that
the HI deficiency depends strongly on galaxy orbits. It is concluded that the
scenario where ram pressure stripping is responsible for the observed HI
deficiency is consistent with all HI 21cm observations in the Virgo cluster.
