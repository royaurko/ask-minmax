It is shown that the origin of the striking left-right asymmetries observed
in single-spin inclusive hadron production processes in high energy
hadron-hadron collisions can be traced by performing suitable experiments.
Several new experiments are proposed. The possible outcomes are summarized
together with those of other relevant experiments which have already been
suggested. It is pointed out that the results of such a set of experiments will
not only be able to differentiate between existing theoretical models, but also
be helpful in locating the source(s) of the observed asymmetries.
