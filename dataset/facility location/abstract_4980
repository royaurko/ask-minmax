It is widely accepted that Bragg reflection from linearly chirped Bragg
gratings (LCBGs) can compensate for a chromatic dispersion by reflecting
different wavelengths at different location along the axis of the gratings for
ultra-short pulses. In this paper, we studied the possibility of making use of
such a dispersion-compensating property to construct a white light cavity
(WLC). A pair of LCBGs is suggested as the reflectors of the cavity. The
analytical and numerical analysis shows that the reflection by a LCBG does not
solely occur at the position where Bragg condition is reached. The accumulated
effect of multiple scatterings at different locations inside the LCBG produces
a positive group delay, preventing the WLC to be realized with simple LCBG.
