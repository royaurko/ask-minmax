We present a new method to estimate the absolute ages of stellar systems.
This method is based on the difference in magnitude between the main sequence
turn-off (MSTO) and a well defined knee located along the lower main sequence
(MSK). This feature is caused by the collisionally induced absorption of
molecular hydrogen and it can be easily identified in near-infrared (NIR) and
in optical-NIR color-magnitude diagrams of stellar systems. We took advantage
of deep and accurate NIR images collected with the Multi-Conjugate Adaptive
Optics Demonstrator temporarily available on the Very Large Telescope and of
optical images collected with the Advanced Camera for Surveys Wide Field Camera
on the Hubble Space Telescope and with ground-based telescopes to estimate the
absolute age of the globular NGC3201 using both the MSTO and the
Delta(MSTO-MSK). We have adopted a new set of cluster isochrones and we found
that the absolute ages based on the two methods agree to within one sigma.
However, the errors of the ages based on the Delta(MSTO-MSK) method are
potentially more than a factor of two smaller, since they are not affected by
uncertainties in cluster distance or reddening.Current isochrones appear to
predict slightly bluer (~0.05mag) NIR and optical-NIR colors than observed for
magnitudes fainter than the MSK.
