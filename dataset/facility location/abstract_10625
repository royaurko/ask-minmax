Faraday's and Furry's formulas for the electromagnetic momentum of static
charge distributions combined with steady electric current distributions are
generalised in order to obtain full agreement with Poynting's formula in the
case where all fields are of class C^1, i.e., continuous and continuously
differentiable, and the integration volume is of finite or infinite extent.
  These three formulas are further generalised to the case where singularities
are allowed to exist at isolated points in the fields, and at surfaces
separating domains in which the distributions are of class C^1.
  Applications are made to electric and magnetic, point-like and finite dipolar
systems, with an emphasis on the impact of singularities on the magnitude and
location of the electromagnetic momentum.
