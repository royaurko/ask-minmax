Core-collapse supernovae produce an intense burst of electron antineutrinos
in the few-tens-of-MeV range. Several Large Liquid Scintillator-based Detectors
(LLSD) are currently operated worldwide, being very effective for low energy
antineutrino detection through the Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) process. In this
article, we develop a procedure for the prompt extraction of the supernova
location by revisiting the details of IBD kinematics over the broad energy
range of supernova neutrinos. Combining all current scintillator-based
detector, we show that one can locate a canonical supernova at 10 kpc with an
accuracy of 45 degrees (68% C.L.). After the addition of the next generation of
scintillator-based detectors, the accuracy could reach 12 degrees (68% C.L.),
therefore reaching the performances of the large water Cerenkov neutrino
detectors. We also discuss a possible improvement of the SuperNova Early
Warning System (SNEWS) inter-experiment network with the implementation of a
directionality information in each experiment. Finally, we discuss the
possibility to constrain the neutrino energy spectrum as well as the mass of
the newly born neutron star with the LLSD data
