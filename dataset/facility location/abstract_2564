The Gemini Planet Imager is a newly commissioned facility instrument designed
to measure the near-infrared spectra of young extrasolar planets in the solar
neighborhood and obtain imaging polarimetry of circumstellar disks. GPI's
science instrument is an integral field spectrograph that utilizes a HAWAII-2RG
detector with a SIDECAR ASIC readout system. This paper describes the detector
characterization and calibrations performed by the GPI Data Reduction Pipeline
to compensate for effects including bad/hot/cold pixels, persistence,
non-linearity, vibration induced microphonics and correlated read noise.
