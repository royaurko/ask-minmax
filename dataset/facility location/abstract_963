Due to their long lifetimes, the $\omega$ and $\phi$ mesons are the ideal
candidates for the study of possible modifications of the in-medium
meson-nucleon interaction through their absorption inside the nucleus. During
the E01-112 experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility,
the mesons were photoproduced from $^{2}$H, C, Ti, Fe, and Pb targets. This
paper reports the first measurement of the ratio of nuclear transparencies for
the $e^{+}e^{-}$ channel. The ratios indicate larger in-medium widths compared
with what have been reported in other reaction channels.
