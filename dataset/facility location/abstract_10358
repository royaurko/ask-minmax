A thermodynamic argument is presented suggesting that near-extremal spinning
D1-D5-P black strings become unstable when their angular momentum exceeds
$J_{crit} = {3Q_1Q_5}/2\sqrt{2}$. In contrast, the dimensionally reduced black
holes are thermodynamically stable. The proposed instability involves a phase
in which the spin angular momentum above $J_{crit}$ is transferred to gyration
of the string in space; i.e., to orbital angular momentum of parts of the
string about the mean location in space. Thus the string becomes a rotating
helical coil. We note that an instability of this form would yield a
counter-example to the Gubser-Mitra conjecture, which proposes a particular
link between dynamic black string instabilities and the thermodynamics of black
strings. There may also be other instabilities associated with radiation modes
of various fields. Our arguments also apply to the D-brane bound states
associated with these black strings in weakly coupled string theory.
