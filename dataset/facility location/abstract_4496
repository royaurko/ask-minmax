We present near-infrared and millimetre-line observations of the Tornado
nebula (G357.7-0.1). We detected 2.12 micron_m H2 1-0 S(1) line emission
towards the suspected site of interaction with a molecular cloud revealed by
the presence of an OH(1720 MHz) maser. The distribution of the H2 emission is
well correlated with the nonthermal radio continuum emission from the Tornado,
and the velocity of the H2 emission spans over 100 km/s, which both imply that
the H2 emission is shock excited. We also detected millimetre-lines from 12CO
and 13CO transitions at the velocity of the maser, and mapped the distribution
of the molecular cloud in a 2 x 2 arcmin^2 region around the maser. The peak of
the molecular cloud aligns well with an indentation in the nebula's radio
continuum distribution, suggesting that the nebula's shock is being decelerated
at this location, which is consistent with the presence of the OH(1720 MHz)
maser and shocked H2 emission at that location.
