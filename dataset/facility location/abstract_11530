We recently (Optics Express 17, 19969 (2009)) introduced an all-optical
method for grafting onto the apex of an optical tip a single 20 nm nanodiamond
with single color-center occupancy and used the resulting single-photon tip in
scanning near-field imaging at room temperature, thereby achieving a genuine
scanning single-photon microscopy working in ambient conditions. A variant of
this method is described that allows for attaching several nanodiamonds onto
the tip apex, releasing them all at once and finally recapturing them one by
one by the scanning tip. This underlines the flexibility and powerfulness of
our method and its variant that could be used in applications where a fixed
number of selected optically active nano-objects requires positioning, or
repositioning, at well defined locations with nanometer accuracy.
