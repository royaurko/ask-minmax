We extensively investigated the critical behavior of mixtures of colloids and
polymers via the two-component Asakura-Oosawa model and its reduction to a
one-component colloidal fluid using accurate theoretical and simulation
techniques. In particular the theoretical approach, hierarchical reference
theory [Adv. Phys. 44, 211 (1995)], incorporates realistically the effects of
long-range fluctuations on phase separation giving exponents which differ
strongly from their mean-field values, and are in good agreement with those of
the three-dimensional Ising model. Computer simulations combined with
finite-size scaling analysis confirm the Ising universality and the accuracy of
the theory, although some discrepancy in the location of the critical point
between one-component and full-mixture description remains. To assess the limit
of the pair-interaction description, we compare one-component and two-component
results.
