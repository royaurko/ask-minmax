We present kinematic and photometric evidence for the presence of seven
candidate tidal dwarf galaxies in Stephan's quintet. The central regions of the
two most probable parent galaxies, N7319 and N7318B, contain little or no gas
whereas the intragroup medium, and particularly the optical tails that seem to
be associated with N7318B are rich in cold and ionized gas.
  Two tidal-dwarf candidates may be located at the edge of a tidal tail, one
within a tail and for four others there is no obvious stellar/gaseous bridge
between them and the parent galaxy. Two of the candidates are associated with
HI clouds, one of which is, in addition, associated with a CO cloud. All seven
regions have low continuum fluxes and high H$\alpha$ luminosity densities
(F(H$\alpha$) = 1 -- 60 $\times$ 10$^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$). Their
magnitudes (M$_B =$ --16.1 to --12.6), sizes ($\sim$ 3.5 h$_{75}^{-1}$ kpc),
colors (typically $B-R = 0.7$) and gas velocity gradients ($\sim$ 8 -- 26
h$_{75}$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$) are typical for tidal dwarf galaxies. In
addition the ratios between their star formation rates determined from
H$\alpha$ and from the B band luminosity are typical of other tidal dwarf
galaxies. The masses of the tidal dwarf galaxies in Stephan's quintet range
from $\sim$ 2 $\times$ 10$^8$ to 10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$ and the median value for
their inferred mass-to-light ratios is 7 M$_\odot$/L$_\odot$.
