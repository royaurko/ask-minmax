The ANTARES Neutrino Telescope was completed in May 2008 and is the first
operational Neutrino Telescope in the Mediterranean Sea. The main purpose of
the detector is to perform neutrino astronomy and the apparatus also offers
facilities for marine and Earth sciences. This paper describes the design, the
construction and the installation of the telescope in the deep sea, offshore
from Toulon in France. An illustration of the detector performance is given.
