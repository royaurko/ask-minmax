The high energy peaked BL Lac (HBL) object 1ES 0414+009 (z=0.287) is a
distant very high-energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) blazars with well-determined
redshift. This source was detected with the High Energy Stereoscopic System
(H.E.S.S.) between October 2005 and September 2009. It was also detected with
the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) in 21 months of data. The combined high
energy (HE) and VHE spectra, once corrected for gamma-gamma absorption on the
extragalactic background light (EBL), indicate a Compton peak located above few
TeV, among the highest in the BL Lac class.
