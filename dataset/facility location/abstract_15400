We report the detection of six discrete, low-luminosity (Lx < 10^33 erg/s)
X-ray sources, located within 12 arcsec of the center of the collapsed-core
globular cluster M30 (NGC 7099), and a total of 13 sources within the half-mass
radius, from a 50 ksec Chandra ACIS-S exposure. Three sources lie within the
very small upper limit of 1.9 arcsec on the core radius. The brightest of the
three core sources has a luminosity of Lx (0.5-6 keV) = 6x10^32 erg/s and a
blackbody-like soft X-ray spectrum, which are both consistent with it being a
quiescent low-mass X-ray binary (qLMXB). We have identified optical
counterparts to four of the six central sources and a number of the outlying
sources, using deep Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based imaging. While the
two proposed counterparts that lie within the core may represent chance
superpositions, the two identified central sources that lie outside of the core
have X-ray and optical properties consistent with being CVs. Two additional
sources outside of the core have possible active binary counterparts. We
discuss the X-ray source population of M30 in light of its collapsed-core
status.
