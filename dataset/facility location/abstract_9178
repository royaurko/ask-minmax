We present a 74 MHz survey of a 165 square degree region located near the
north galactic pole. This survey has an unprecedented combination of both
resolution (25'' FWHM) and sensitivity (RMS noise as low as 24 mJy/beam). We
detect 949 sources at the 5-sigma level in this region, enough to begin
exploring the nature of the 74 MHz source population. We present differential
source counts, spectral index measurements and the size distribution as
determined from counterparts in the high resolution FIRST 1.4 GHz survey. We
find a trend of steeper spectral indices for the brighter sources. Further,
there is a clear correlation between spectral index and median source size,
with the flat spectrum sources being much smaller on average. Ultra-steep
spectrum objects (alpha < -1.2) are identified, and we present high resolution
VLA follow-up observations of these sources which, identified at such a low
frequency, are excellent candidates for high redshift radio galaxies.
