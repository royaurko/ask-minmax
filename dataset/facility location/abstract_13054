In the common linear regression model the problem of determining optimal
designs for least squares estimation is considered in the case where the
observations are correlated. A necessary condition for the optimality of a
given design is provided, which extends the classical equivalence theory for
optimal designs in models with uncorrelated errors to the case of dependent
data. If the regression functions are eigenfunctions of an integral operator
defined by the covariance kernel, it is shown that the corresponding measure
defines a universally optimal design. For several models universally optimal
designs can be identified explicitly. In particular, it is proved that the
uniform distribution is universally optimal for a class of trigonometric
regression models with a broad class of covariance kernels and that the arcsine
distribution is universally optimal for the polynomial regression model with
correlation structure defined by the logarithmic potential. To the best
knowledge of the contributors these findings provide the first explicit results on
optimal designs for regression models with correlated observations, which are
not restricted to the location scale model.
