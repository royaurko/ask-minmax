Invariant coordinate selection (ICS) and projection pursuit (PP) are two
methods that can be used to detect clustering directions in multivariate data
by optimizing criteria sensitive to non-normality. In particular, ICS finds
clustering directions using a relative eigen-decomposition of two scatter
matrices with different levels of robustness; PP is a one-dimensional variant
of ICS. Each of the two scatter matrices includes an implicit or explicit
choice of location. However, when different measures of location are used, ICS
and PP can behave counter-intuitively. In this paper we explore this behavior
in a variety of examples and propose a simple and natural solution: use the
same measure of location for both scatter matrices.
