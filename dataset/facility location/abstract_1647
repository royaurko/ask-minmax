The pp->pp phi reaction has been studied at the Cooler Synchrotron
COSY-Juelich, using the internal beam and ANKE facility. Total cross sections
have been determined at three excess energies epsilon near the production
threshold. The differential cross section closest to threshold at epsilon=18.5
MeV exhibits a clear S-wave dominance as well as a noticeable effect due to the
proton-proton final state interaction. Taken together with data for pp
omega-production, a significant enhancement of the phi/omega ratio of a factor
8 is found compared to predictions based on the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule.
