This paper introduces a novel motion planning algorithm for stochastic
scenarios. We extend the concept of a navigation function to such scenarios.
Our main idea is to consider both the Gaussian distribution probabilities of
the players' locations and disc (or star sets) geometry of the objects
operating in the work space. We do so by formulating a probability density
function that encloses both. We use the PDF to de?ne a metric between the
robot, the obstacles and the con?guration space boundary. In order to de?ne the
navigation function we formulate a safe probability value for collision. By
analytically investigating the PDF we ?nd a convenient approximation for a safe
distance in the sense of that metric. We prove that the resulting map is a
navigation function and demonstrate our algorithm for various scenarios.
