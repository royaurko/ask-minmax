Various parameters describing the dynamics of G-band bright points (GBPs)
were derived from G-band images, acquired by the Dutch Open Telescope (DOT), of
a quiet region close to the disk center. Our study is based on four commonly
used diagnostics (effective velocity, change in the effective velocity, change
in the direction angle, and centrifugal acceleration) and two new ones (rate of
motion and time lag between recurrence of GBPs). The results concerning the
commonly used parameters are in agreement with previous studies for a
comparable spatial and temporal resolution of the used data.To broaden our
understanding of the dynamics of GBPs, two new parameters were defined: the
real displacement between their appearance and disappearance (rate of motion)
and the frequency of their recurrence at the same locations (time lag). Results
for both new parameters indicate that the locations of different dynamical
types of GBPs (stable/farther traveling or with short/long lifetimes) are bound
to the locations of more stable and long-living magnetic field concentrations.
Thus, the disappearance/reappearance of the tracked GBPs cannot be perceived as
the disappearance/reappearance of their corresponding magnetic field
concentrations.
