A new parallel computing framework has been developed to use with
general-purpose radiation transport codes. The framework was implemented as a
C++ module that uses MPI for message passing. The module is significantly
independent of radiation transport codes it can be used with, and is connected
to the codes by means of a number of interface functions. The frame work was
integrated with the MARS15 code, and an effort is under way to deploy it in
PHITS. Besides the parallel computing functionality, the framework offers a
checkpoint facility that allows restarting calculations with a saved checkpoint
file. The checkpoint facility can be used in single process calculations as
well as in the parallel regime. Several checkpoint files can be merged into one
thus combining results of several calculations. The framework also corrects
some of the known problems with the sch eduling and load balancing found in the
original implementations of the parallel computing functionality in MARS15 and
PHITS. The framework can be used efficiently on homogeneous systems and
networks of workstations, where the interference from the other users is
possible.
