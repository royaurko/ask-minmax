We show that the conductance of Spin Field Effect Transistors (SPINFET)
[Datta and Das, Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 56, 665 (1990)] is affected by a single
(non-magnetic) impurity in the transistor's channel. The extreme sensitivity of
the amplitude and phase of the transistor's conductance oscillations to the
location of a single impurity in the channel is reminiscent of the phenomenon
of universal conductance fluctuations in mesoscopic samples and is extremely
problematic as far as device implementation is concerned.
