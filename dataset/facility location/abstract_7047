We report a method for accelerated nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance
imaging by detecting several signals in parallel. Our technique relies on phase
multiplexing, where the signals from different nuclear spin ensembles are
encoded in the phase of an ultrasensitive magnetic detector. We demonstrate
this technique by simultaneously acquiring statistically polarized spin signals
from two different nuclear species (1H, 19F) and from up to six spatial
locations in a nanowire test sample using a magnetic resonance force
microscope. We obtain one-dimensional imaging resolution better than 5 nm, and
subnanometer positional accuracy.
