The Australian Astronomical Observatory operates the Anglo-Australian
Telescope and the United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope in Australia, as well as
coordinating access for the Australian community to the Gemini, Magellan, and
other international telescope facilities. We review here the processes involved
within the AAO related to allocating observing time on these facilities, as
well as the impact on telescope use of both the Large Program projects and the
AAO's instrument program.
