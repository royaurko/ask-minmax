CODALEMA is one of the pioneer experiments dedicated to the recent field of
cosmic ray radio detection. It is located at the radio observatory of Nancay
(France). The detector setup combined until recently a ground particle detector
and an array of active dipole antennas covering a total area of 0.25 km^2. The
experiment is now going through a major upgrade with the deployment around the
existing apparatus of a Standalone Antenna Array, which consists of 60
standalone new generation radio-detection stations and which will cover an area
of 1.5 km^2 (33 stations deployed over the spring of 2011 and 27 stations to be
deployed in late 2011). This new setup is intended to tackle the remaining
unknowns of extensive air shower radio detection so as to make this technique a
reliable and mature tool for Ultra High Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) physics. The
latest results from the original CODALEMA array are discussed together with the
first results of the Standalone Antenna Array.
