We review infrared observations of classical and recurrent novae, at
wavelengths >3microns, including both broad-band and spectroscopic
observations. In recent years infrared spectroscopy in particular has
revolutionised our understanding of the nova phenomenon, by revealing
fine-structure and coronal lines, and the mineralogy of nova dust. Infrared
spectroscopic facilities that are, or will be, becoming available in the next
10 - 20 years have the potential for a comprehensive study of nova line
emission and dust mineralogy, and for an unbiassed assessment of the
extragalactic nova populations.
