We analyze properties of non-hermitian matrices of size M constructed as
square submatrices of unitary (orthogonal) random matrices of size N>M,
distributed according to the Haar measure. In this way we define ensembles of
random matrices and study the statistical properties of the spectrum located
inside the unit circle. In the limit of large matrices, this ensemble is
characterized by the ratio M/N. For the truncated CUE we derive analytically
the joint density of eigenvalues from which easily all correlation functions
are obtained. For N-M fixed and N--> infinity the universal resonance-width
distribution with N-M open channels is recovered.
