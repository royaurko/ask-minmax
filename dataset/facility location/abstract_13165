Anomalous and spin Hall effects are investigated theoretically for a magnetic
tunnel junction where the applied voltage produces a Rashba spin-or bit
coupling within the tunneling barrier layer. The ferromagnetic electrodes are
the source of the spin-polarized current. The tunneling electrons experience a
spin-orbit coupling inside the barrier due to the applied electrical field.
Charge and spin Hall currents are calculated as functions of the position
inside the barrier and the angle between the magnetizations of the electrodes.
We find that both charge and spin Hall currents are located inside the barrier
near the in terfaces. The dependence of the currents on magnetic configuration
of the magnetic tunnel junction makes possible the manipulation by the Hall
currents via rotation of the magnetization of the electrodes.
