The interest in homomorphic encryption/decryption is increasing due to its
excellent security properties and operating facilities. It allows operating on
data without revealing its content. In this work, we suggest using homomorphism
for Hardware Trojan protection. We implement two partial homomorphic designs
based on ElGamal encryption/decryption scheme. The first design is a
multiplicative homomorphic, whereas the second one is an additive homomorphic.
We implement the proposed designs on a low-cost Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. Area
utilization, delay, and power consumption are reported for both designs.
Furthermore, we introduce a dual-circuit design that combines the two earlier
designs using resource sharing in order to have minimum area cost. Experimental
results show that our dual-circuit design saves 35% of the logic resources
compared to a regular design without resource sharing. The saving in power
consumption is 20%, whereas the number of cycles needed remains almost the same
