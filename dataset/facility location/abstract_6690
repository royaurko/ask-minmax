We study localized modes on a single Ablowitz-Ladik impurity embedded in the
bulk or at the surface of a one-dimensional linear lattice. Exact expressions
are obtained for the bound state profile and energy. Dynamical excitation of
the localized mode reveals exponentially-high amplitude oscillations of the
spatial profile at the impurity location. The presence of a surface increases
the minimum nonlinearity to effect a dynamical selftrapping.
