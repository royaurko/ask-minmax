We present the results of the first analysis of high dispersion spectra of
four red HB stars in the metal rich globular cluster NGC 6528, located in
Baade's Window. We find that the mean [Fe/H] for NGC 6528 is +0.07+-0.01 dex
(error of the mean), with a star-to-star scatter of sigma = 0.02 dex (4 stars),
although the total error is likely to be larger (~0.1 dex) due to systematic
errors related to the effective temperature scale and to model atmospheres.
This metallicity is somewhat larger than both the mean abundance in the
galactic bulge found by McWilliam & Rich (1994) and that found in our previous
paper for NGC 6553. However, we find that the spectra of clump stars in NGC
6528 and NGC 6553 are very similar each other, the slightly different metal
abundances found being possibly due to the different atmospheric parameters
adopted in the two analyses. For NGC 6528 we find excesses for the
alpha-process elements Si and Ca ([Si/Fe]=+0.4 and [Ca/Fe]=+0.2), whereas Mn is
found to be underabundant ([Mn/Fe]=-0.4). We find a solar abundance of O;
however this is somewhat uncertain due to the dependence of the O abundance on
the adopted atmospheric parameters and to coupling between C and O abundances
in these cool, metal-rich stars. Finally, we find large Na excesses ([Na/Fe]~
+0.4) in all stars examined. Since the present analysis is based on higher
quality material, we propose to revise our previous published metal abundance
for NGC 6553 to [Fe/H]=$0.06+-0.15.
