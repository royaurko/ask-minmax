Grid cells in the brain respond when an animal occupies a periodic lattice of
"grid fields" during spatial navigation. The grid scale varies along the
dorso-ventral axis of the entorhinal cortex. We propose that the grid system
minimizes the number of neurons required to encode location with a given
resolution. We derive several predictions that match recent experiments: (i)
grid scales follow a geometric progression, (ii) the ratio between adjacent
grid scales is the square root of e for idealized neurons, and robustly lies in
the range 1.4-1.7 for realistic neurons, (iii) the scale ratio varies modestly
within and between animals, (iv) the ratio between grid scale and individual
grid field widths at that scale also lies in this range, (v) grid fields lie on
a triangular lattice. The theory also predicts the optimal grids in one and
three dimensions, and the total number of discrete scales.
