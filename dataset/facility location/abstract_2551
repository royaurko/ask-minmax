In previous studies, it proved difficult to realize periodic graphene ripples
with wavelengths of few nanometers. Here we show that one-dimensional periodic
graphene ripples with wavelengths from 2 nm to tens of nanometers can be
implemented in the intrinsic areas of a continuous mosaic, locally N-doped,
graphene monolayer by simultaneously using both the thermal strain engineering
and the anisotropic surface stress of Cu substrate. Our result indicates that
the constraint imposed at the boundaries between the intrinsic and the N-doped
regions play a vital role in creating these 1D ripples. We also demonstrate
that the observed rippling modes are beyond the descriptions of continuum
mechanics due to the decoupling of graphene bending and tensional deformations.
Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements indicate that the nanorippling
generates a periodic electronic superlattice and opens a zero-energy gap of
about 130 meV in graphene. This result may pave a facile way for tailoring the
structures and electronic properties of graphene.
