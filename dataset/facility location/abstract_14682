During a BeppoSAX observation of the X-ray source X1746-371 located in the
globular cluster NGC6441 a type I X-ray burst, parts of 4 intensity dips, and
energy dependent flaring were detected. The dips repeat every 5.8 +0.3 -0.9 hr
and show no obvious energy dependence. If the dips are due to electron
scattering this energy independence implies an abundance >130 times less than
solar, confirming an earlier measurement. Since the overall cluster abundance
is close to solar this low abundance is unexpected. Photoionization of the
absorbing material, obscuration of an extended source, and variations in
multiple components that combine to produce an apparent energy independence are
all excluded. Thus, the nature of the dips remains uncertain. The best-fit
model to the overall 0.3-30 keV spectrum is a disk-blackbody with a temperature
of 2.82 +/- 0.04 keV, together with a cutoff power-law with a photon index of
-0.32 +/- 0.80 and a cutoff energy of 0.90 +/- 0.26 keV. Absorption, consistent
with the optical extinction to NGC6441 of (0.28 +/- 0.04) 10^22 atom/cm2 is
required. All previous best-fit spectral models for this source are excluded at
high confidence. The spectrum is dominated by the blackbody-like component,
with the cutoff power-law only contributing an average of 12% of the 1-10 keV
flux. During flaring intervals the contribution of this component decreases to
\~6% with variations in the intensity of the blackbody-like component being
responsible for most of the flaring activity.
