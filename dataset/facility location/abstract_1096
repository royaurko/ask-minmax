The use of Smith-Purcell radiation to measure electrons longitudinal profiles
has been demonstrated at several facilities in the picosecond and
sub-picosecond range. There is a strong interest for the development of non
intercepting longitudinal profile diagnostics for high current proton beams. We
present here results of simulations on the expected yield of longitudinal
profile monitors using Smith-Purcell radiation for such proton beams.
