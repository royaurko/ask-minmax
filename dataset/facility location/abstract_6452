We study discrete surface breathers in two-dimensional lattices of
inductively-coupled split-ring resonators with capacitive nonlinearity. We
consider both Hamiltonian and dissipative systems and analyze the properties of
the modes localized in space and periodic in time (discrete breathers) located
in the corners and at the edges of the lattice. We find that surface breathers
in the Hamiltonian systems have lower energy than their bulk counterparts, and
they are generally more stable.
