Mixing dependency lengths from sequences of different length is a common
practice in language research. However, the empirical distribution of
dependency lengths of sentences of the same length differs from that of
sentences of varying length and the distribution of dependency lengths depends
on sentence length for real sentences and also under the null hypothesis that
dependencies connect vertices located in random positions of the sequence. This
suggests that certain results, such as the distribution of syntactic dependency
lengths mixing dependencies from sentences of varying length, could be a mere
consequence of that mixing. Furthermore, differences in the global averages of
dependency length (mixing lengths from sentences of varying length) for two
different languages do not simply imply a priori that one language optimizes
dependency lengths better than the other because those differences could be due
to differences in the distribution of sentence lengths and other factors.
