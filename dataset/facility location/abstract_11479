We report on the current status of CLIO (Cryogenic Laser Interferometer
Observatory), which is a prototype interferometer for LCGT (Large Scale
Cryogenic Gravitational-Wave Telescope). LCGT is a Japanese next-generation
interferometric gravitational wave detector featuring the use of cryogenic
mirrors and a quiet underground site. The main purpose of CLIO is to
demonstrate a reduction of the mirror thermal noise by cooling the sapphire
mirrors. CLIO is located in an underground site of the Kamioka mine, 1000 m
deep from the mountain top, to verify its advantages. After a few years of
commissioning work, we have achieved a thermal-noise-limited sensitivity at
room temperature. One of the main results of noise hunting was the elimination
of thermal noise caused by a conductive coil-holder coupled with a pendulum
through magnets.
