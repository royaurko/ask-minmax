We consider particles with low free or proper eccentricity that are orbiting
near planets on eccentric orbits. Via collisionless particle integration we
numerically find the location of the boundary of the chaotic zone in the
planet's corotation region. We find that the distance in semi-major axis
between the planet and boundary depends on the planet mass to the 2/7 power and
is independent of the planet eccentricity, at least for planet eccentricities
below 0.3. Our integrations reveal a similarity between the dynamics of
particles at zero eccentricity near a planet in a circular orbit and with zero
free eccentricity particles near an eccentric planet. The 2/7 law has been
previously explained by estimating the semi-major at which the first order mean
motion resonances are large enough to overlap. Orbital dynamics near an
eccentric planet could differ due to first order corotation resonances that
have strength proportional to the planet's eccentricity. However, we find the
corotation resonance width at low free eccentricity is small. Also the first
order resonance width at zero free eccentricity is the same as that for a zero
eccentricity particle near a planet in a circular orbit. This accounts for
insensitivity of the chaotic zone width to planet eccentricity. Particles at
zero free eccentricity near an eccentric planet have similar dynamics to those
at zero eccentricity near a planet in a circular orbit.
