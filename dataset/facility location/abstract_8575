We report on optical searches in the error circles of 93 ROSAT survey sources
located at low galactic latitudes (|b| < 20 deg). These sources were extracted
from the ROSAT Galactic Plane Survey using various selection criteria on
hardness ratio, X-ray and optical brightness and integrated galactic absorption
in the direction of the source. We find optical identifications in 76 cases,
among which are 25 new AGN, 6 new CVs and a new Be/X-ray binary. In order to
illustrate the relevance of the source selections applied here, we
cross-correlated the ROSAT all-sky survey bright source list with SIMBAD.
Different classes of X-ray emitters populate distinct regions of a multi
dimensional parameter space involving flux ratios, galactic latitude and Nh.
This relatively good segregation offers the possibility to build source samples
with enhanced probability of identification with a given class. Complete
optical identification of such subsamples could eventually be used to compute
meaningful probabilities of identification for all sources using as basis a
restricted set of multi-wavelength information.
