The dynamical systems of planet-belt interaction are studied by the
fixed-point analysis and the bifurcation of solutions on the parameter space is
discussed. For most cases, our analytical and numerical results show that the
locations of fixed points are determined by the parameters and these fixed
points are either structurally stable or unstable. In addition to that, there
are two special fixed points: the one on the inner edge of the belt is
asymptotically stable and the one on the outer edge of the belt is unstable.
This is consistent with the observational picture of Asteroid Belt between the
Mars and Jupiter: the Mars is moving stablely close to the inner edge but the
Jupiter is quite far from the outer edge.
