The properties of the saddle point on the critical line is examined to
establish the behavior of the zero level curves of the Xi function. These
properties are used to locate both the real and imaginary zero level curves. It
is shown that a pair of zeros off the critical line is not consistent with
these properties, thus validating the Riemann hypothesis.
