The design for the proto type of the Shanghai Laser Electron Gamma Source
(SLEGS) at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) is introduced.
Some detailed descriptions for design of related instruments are provided. The
proto type can produce X-ray with energy of 10 keV order. A description of the
kinematics of Compton backscattering mechanism and the related simulation
results are presented and discussed. The backgrounds from dipole magnet and
bremsstrahlung are estimated and the signal-noise ratio is also given.
