We investigate the phase structure of QCD at finite temperature and
light-quark chemical potential. We improve upon earlier results for N_f=2+1
dynamical quark flavors and investigate the effects of charm quarks in an
extension to N_f=2+1+1. We determine the quark condensate and the Polyakov loop
potential using solutions of a coupled set of (truncated) Dyson-Schwinger
equations for the quark and gluon propagators of Landau gauge QCD. At zero
chemical potential we find excellent agreement with results from lattice-QCD.
With input fixed from physical observables we find only a very small influence
of the charm quark on the resulting phase diagram at finite chemical potential.
We discuss the location of the emerging critical end-point and compare with
expectations from lattice gauge theory.
