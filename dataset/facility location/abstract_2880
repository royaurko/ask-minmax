Recent work has shown that density profiles in the outskirts of dark matter
halos can become extremely steep over a narrow range of radius. This behavior
is produced by splashback material on its first apocentric passage after
accretion. We show that the location of this splashback feature may be
understood quite simply, from first principles. We present a simple model,
based on spherical collapse, that accurately predicts the location of
splashback without any free parameters. The important quantities that determine
the splashback radius are accretion rate and redshift.
