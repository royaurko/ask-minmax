This paper studies the spatial coalescent on $\Z^2$. In our setting, the
partition elements are located at the sites of $\Z^2$ and undergo local delayed
coalescence and migration. That is, pairs of partition elements located at the
same site coalesce into one partition element after exponential waiting times.
In addition, the partition elements perform independent random walks. The
system starts in either locally finite configurations or in configurations
containing countably many partition elements per site. These two situations are
relevant if the coalescent is used to study the scaling limits for genealogies
in Moran models respectively interacting Fisher-Wright diffusions (or
Fleming-Viot processes), which is the key application of the present work.
  Our goal is to determine the longtime behavior with an initial population of
countably many individuals per site restricted to a box $[-t^{\alpha/2},
t^{\alpha/2}]^2 \cap \Z^2$ and observed at time $t^\beta$ with $1 \geq \beta
\geq \alpha\ge 0$. We study both asymptotics, as $t\to\infty$, for a fixed
value of $\alpha$ as the parameter $\beta\in[\alpha,1]$ varies, and for a fixed
$\beta$, as the parameter $\alpha\in [0,\beta]$ varies. This exhibits the
genealogical structure of the mono-type clusters arising in 2-dimensional Moran
and Fisher-Wright systems.
