We present results of our $R-$band polarimetry of a cometary globule, LBN 437
(Gal96-15, $\ell$ $=$ 96$\degree$, \textit{b} $=-15\degree$), to study magnetic
field geometry of the cloud. We estimated a distance of $360\pm65$ pc to LBN
437 (also one additional cloud, CB 238) using near-IR photometric method.
Foreground contribution to the observed polarisation values was subtracted by
making polarimetric observations of stars that are located in the direction of
the cloud and with known distances from the Hipparcos parallax measurements.
The magnetic field geometry of LBN 437 is found to follow the curved shape of
the globule head. This could be due to the drag that the magnetic field lines
could have experienced because of the ionisation radiation from the same
exciting source that caused the cometary shape of the cloud. The orientation of
the outflow from the Herbig A4e star, LkH$\alpha$ 233 (or V375 Lac), located at
the head of LBN 437, is found to be parallel to both the initial (prior to the
ionising source was turned on) ambient magnetic field (inferred from a star HD
214243 located just in front of the cloud) and the Galactic plane.
