Studies of single spin asymmetries for pion electroproduction in
semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering are presented using the polarized
\sim6 GeV electrons from at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility
(JLab) and the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) Large
Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) with the Inner Calorimeter. The cross section
versus the azimuthal angle {\phi}_h of the produced neutral pion has a
substantial sin {\phi}_h amplitude. The dependence of this amplitude on Bjorken
x_B and on the pion transverse momentum is extracted and compared with
published data.
