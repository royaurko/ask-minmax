We propose a composite optical transformation to design an illusion device
which can move the image of a target from one place to another place. Enclosed
by such an illusion device, an arbitrary object located at one place appears to
be at another place virtually. Different from the published shifted-position
cloak which is composed of the left-handed materials with simultaneously
negative permittivity and permeability, the illusion device proposed in this
letter has positive permittivity and permeability. Hence proposed illusion
device could be realized by artificial metamaterials.
