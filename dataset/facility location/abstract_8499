We present observations of OY Car, obtained with the Anglo-Australian
Telescope, during a normal outburst in August 1991. Two sinusoidal components
are resolved in the H$\beta$ trailed spectra and we determine the location of
the narrow component to be on the secondary star with a maximum contributed
flux of ~2.5 per cent to the total flux. Imaging of the line distribution
reveals that the other emission component is associated with the gas stream.
This follows a velocity close to the ballistic one from the red star to a
distance of ~0.5 R$_{L_{1}}$ from the white dwarf. This emission penetrates the
accretion disc (from 0.5--0.1 R$_{L_{1}}$), with a velocity now closer (but
lower) to the keplerian velocities along the path of the gas stream. We finally
discuss the implications of having observed simultaneously line emission from
the gas stream and the red star during outburst.
