A new particle identification device for Jlab 12 GeV program is proposed. It
is based on the measurement of time information obtained by means of a new
photon detector and time measuring concept. The expected time measurement
precision for the Cherenkov time-of-flight detector is about or less than 10
picosecond for Cherenkov radiators with lengths less than 50 cm.
