In this paper, a recently developed analytical equation of state (EOS) is
used to investigate the bulk modulus of compressed liquid cesium and to locate
common compression factor and the bulk modulus quiescence point(s). This EOS is
applied quick well to Na and Rb far from Tc. Bulk modulus of liquid cesium have
two quiescence points, a sharp one in the range 1100k-1500k and a diffused one
in the range 1600k-1900k. Therefore, two types of liquid cesium metal may be
identified with characteristic structure and interaction potential energy. It
is a constant independent of temperature, however, some residual change is seen
due to the change in the values of integral of pair correlation function as
temperature is increased. Furthermore, it is related to the shape of the unit
cell and the atomic size at equilibrium. Observation of distinct liquid in the
metal-nonmetal transition range is compared with NMR studies and molecular
dynamic results.
