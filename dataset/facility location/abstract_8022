We have carried out a study of the neutral hydrogen in the direction of the
X-ray source 1E 161348-5055, a compact central object (CCO) located in the
interior of the supernova remnant (SNR) RCW 103. The HI 21 cm line observations
were carried out using the Australia Telescope Compact Array, complemented with
single dish data from the Parkes radio telescope to recover information at all
spatial scales. We derive a distance to RCW 103 of 3.3 kpc, in agreement with
previous distance measurements. We have also detected a small hole in the HI
emission which is positionally and kinematically coincident with the location
of the CCO which confirms the association between the SNR and the CCO. This is
the third case of a depression in HI emission seemingly associated with CCOs in
SNRs. The characteristic parameters of the holes such as their size,
eccentricity and evacuated mass are similar in all three cases. We estimate the
absorbing HI column density towards 1E 161348-5055 to be ~6 x 10^{21} cm^{-2},
a value compatible with a blackbody solution for the CCO X-ray emission.
However, the implied brightness temperature is very high comparedto most
neutron stars. Moreover, the strong long-term variability in X-rays favours the
hypothesis that 1E 161348-5055 is an accreting binary sourcerather than an
isolated, cooling neutron star. An analysis of the continuum image obtained at
1.4 GHz from these observations shows no trace of a pulsar wind nebula around
1E 161348-5055, in spite of it being a young object.
