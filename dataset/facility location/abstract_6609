We perform two-dimensional Langevin dynamics simulations of electric-field
driven polymer translocation through an attractive nanopore. We investigate the
effect of the location of the attractive region using different pore patterns.
This is found to have an impact on both the translocation time as a function of
the chain length and on the polymer entry frequency. We qualitatively compare
our results to available experimental data.
