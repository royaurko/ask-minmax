Insoluble surfactant monolayers at the air/water interface undergo a phase
transition from a high-temperature homogeneous state to a low-temperature
demixed state, where dilute and dense phases coexist. Alternatively, the
transition from a dilute phase to a dense one may be induced by compressing the
monolayer at constant temperature. We consider the case where the insoluble
surfactant monolayer interacts with a semi-dilute polymer solution solubilized
in the water subphase. The phase diagrams of the mixed surfactant/polymer
system are investigated within the framework of mean field theory. The polymer
enhances the fluctuations of the monolayer and induces an upward shift of the
critical temperature. The critical concentration is increased if the monomers
are more attracted (or at least less repelled) by the surfactant molecules than
by the bare water/air interface. In the case where the monomers are repelled by
the bare interface but attracted by the surfactant molecules (or vice versa),
the phase diagram may have a triple point. The location of the polymer special
transition line appears to have a big effect on the phase diagram of the
surfactant monolayer.
