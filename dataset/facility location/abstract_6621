We have investigated the Cr-doping effect of Nd0.375Sr0.625MnO3 near the
phase boundary between the x2-y2 and 3z2-r2 orbital ordered states, where a
ferromagnetic correlation and concomitant large magnetoresistance are observed
owing to orbital fluctuation. Cr-doping steeply suppresses the ferromagnetic
correlation and magnetoresistance in Nd0.375Sr0.625Mn1-yCryO3 with 0 < y <
0.05, while they reappear in 0.05 < y < 0.10. Such a reentrant behavior implies
that a phase boundary is located at y = 0.05, or a phase crossover occurs
across y = 0.05.
