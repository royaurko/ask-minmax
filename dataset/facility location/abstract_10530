We study two different physical scenarios of thermonuclear reactions in
stellar plasmas proceeding through a narrow resonance at low energy or through
the low energy wing of a wide resonance at high energy. Correspondingly, we
derive two approximate analytical formulae in order to calculate thermonuclear
resonant reaction rates inside very coupled and non ideal astrophysical plasmas
in which non-extensive effects are likely to arise. Our results are presented
as simple first order corrective factors that generalize the well known
classical rates obtained in the framework of Maxwell-Boltzmann statistical
mechanics. As a possible application of our results, we calculate the
dependence of the total corrective factor with respect to the energy at which
the resonance is located, in an extremely dense and non ideal carbon plasma.
