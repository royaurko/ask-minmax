Aims. We report new VLBA polarimetric observations of the compact
steep-spectrum (CSS) quasar 3C147 (B0538+498) at 5 and 8.4GHz.
  Methods. By using multifrequency VLBA observations, we derived
milliarcsecond-resolution images of the total intensity, polarisation, and
rotation measure distributions, by combining our new observations with archival
data.
  Results. The source shows a one-sided structure, with a compact region, and a
component extending about 200 mas to the south-west. The compact region is
resolved into two main components with polarised emission, a complex rotation
measure distribution, and a magnetic field dominated by components
perpendicular to the source axis.
  Conclusions. By considering all the available data, we examine the possible
location of the core component, and discuss two possible interpretations of the
observed structure of this source: core-jet and lobe-hot spot. Further
observations to unambiguously determine the location of the core would help
distinguish between the two possibilities discussed here.
