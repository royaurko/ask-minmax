An-energy dependent variation of the X-ray emission from the archetypical
"Compton-thick'' Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC1068 has been observed between two
BeppoSAX observations, performed one year apart. This variation (at the 2.6
sigma level) is highest in the 3--10 keV band and declines towards lower and
higher energies. The most straightforward explanation is a variation of the
primary nuclear continuum, which is scattered along our line of sight by an
electron plasma. If this is indeed the case, this evidence allows us to obtain
the first direct estimate of the location of the scattering medium, at ~1 pc
from the nucleus.
