The masses of very neutron-deficient nuclides close to the astrophysical rp-
and nu p-process paths have been determined with the Penning trap facilities
JYFLTRAP at JYFL/Jyv\"askyl\"a and SHIPTRAP at GSI/Darmstadt. Isotopes from
yttrium (Z = 39) to palladium (Z = 46) have been produced in heavy-ion
fusion-evaporation reactions. In total 21 nuclides were studied and almost half
of the mass values were experimentally determined for the first time: 88Tc,
90-92Ru, 92-94Rh, and 94,95Pd. For the 95Pdm, (21/2^+) high-spin state, a first
direct mass determination was performed. Relative mass uncertainties of
typically $\delta m / m = 5 \times 10^{-8}$ were obtained. The impact of the
new mass values has been studied in nu p-process nucleosynthesis calculations.
The resulting reaction flow and the final abundances are compared to those
obtained with the data of the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2003.
