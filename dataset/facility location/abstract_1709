We study the complementarity between dark matter experiments (direct
detection and indirect detections) and accelerator facilities (the CERN LHC and
a $\sqrt{s}= 1$ TeV $e^+e^-$ Linear Collider) in the framework of the
constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We show how
non--universality in the scalar and gaugino sectors can affect the experimental
prospects to discover the supersymmetric particles. The future experiments will
cover a large part of the parameter space of the MSSM favored by WMAP
constraint on the relic density, but there still exist some regions beyond
reach for some extreme (fine tuned) values of the supersymmetric parameters.
Whereas the Focus Point region characterized by heavy scalars will be easily
probed by experiments searching for dark matter, the regions with heavy
gauginos and light sfermions will be accessible more easily by collider
experiments. More informations on both supersymmetry and astrophysics
parameters can be thus obtained by correlating the different signals.
