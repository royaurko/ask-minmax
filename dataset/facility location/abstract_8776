We have obtained low resolution (~20 Angstrom FWHM) slit spectra of 10 quasar
candidates located within one degree of the z = 2.181 quasar Q0122-380 with the
objective of searching for signs of large scale structure matching the
intervening rich absorption complexes seen over the redshift range 1.81<z<1.97
toward this object. Of the 8 confirmed quasars, 4 turn out to have redshifts z
< 1.8, placing them well in front of the redshift range of interest. Two of the
three confirmed quasars at redshift z > 1.8 show no obvious absorption matching
that of Q0122-380 at our spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. The
third object at a redshift of z = 1.868 displays strong z_{abs} \sim z_{em}
absorption systems at z = 1.84 and z = 1.86 and a possibly BAL-like trough at z
= 1.76. If not intrinsic in nature, the former two systems could potentially be
related to the absorption seen in Q0122-380, albeit over a distance of 50.2
arcmin (D_\perp \simeq 15 h^{-1} Mpc at z = 1.9).
