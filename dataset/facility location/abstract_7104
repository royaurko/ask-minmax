We propose an accurate tight-binding parametrization for the band structure
of MoS$_2$ monolayers near the main energy gap. We introduce a generic and
straightforward derivation for the band energies equations that could be
employed for other monolayer dichalcogenides. A parametrization that includes
spin-orbit coupling is also provided. The proposed set of model parameters
reproduce both the correct orbital compositions and location of valence and
conductance band in comparison with ab initio calculations. The model gives a
suitable starting point for realistic large-scale atomistic electronic
transport calculations.
