Two planetary nebulae are shown to belong to the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy, on
the basis of their radial velocities. This is only the second dwarf spheroidal
galaxy, after Fornax, found to contain planetary nebulae. Their existence
confirms that this galaxy is at least as massive as the Fornax dwarf spheroidal
which has a single planetary nebula, and suggests a mass of a few times 10**7
solar masses. The two planetary nebulae are located along the major axis of the
galaxy, near the base of the tidal tail. There is a further candidate, situated
at a very large distance along the direction of the tidal tail, for which no
velocity measurement is available. The location of the planetary nebulae and
globular clusters of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy suggests that a significant
fraction of its mass is contained within the tidal tail.
