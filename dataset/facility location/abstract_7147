In this paper we address the issue of the origin of some observational
properties of the galactic globular cluster system. After a preliminary study
of some general properties of the main evolutionary processes, we investigate
the evolution of systems of globular clusters located in a model of the Milky
Way starting from different initial conditions. We study the role of the
evolutionary processes in changing the spatial distribution and mass function
of the cluster system, in establishing and/or preserving some of the observed
correlations and trends between internal properties of globular clusters and
between internal properties and location inside the host galaxy and we provide
an estimate for the rates of core collapse and disruption of globular clusters.
The initial mass function and spatial distribution of the cluster system evolve
quite significantly in one Hubble time and the evolution is toward a final
state similar to the observed one. If the mass function is initially taken to
be a log-normal distribution similar to the one currently observed in our
galaxy, its shape is not significantly altered during the entire simulation
even though a significant number of clusters are disrupted before one Hubble
time, which suggests that the present mass function might represent a sort of
'quasi-equilibrium' distribution.
