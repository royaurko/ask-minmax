The well-studied X-ray/Optical/Radio supernova remnant DDB 1-15 (CXOM31
J004327.8+411829; r3-63) in M31 has been investigated with archival XMM-Newton
and Chandra observations. The timing data from XMM-Newton reveals a power
density spectrum (PDS) characteristic of accreting compact objects in X-ray
binaries (XRBs). The PDS shows features typical of Roche lobe overflow
accretion, hinting that the XRB is low-mass. The Chandra observations resolve
the SNR into a shell and show a variable count rate at the 94% confidence level
in the northwest quadrant. Together, these XMM-Newton and Chandra data suggest
that there is an XRB in the SNR r3-63 and that the XRB is located in the
northwestern portion of the SNR. The currently-available X-ray and optical data
show no evidence that the XRB is high-mass. If the XRB is low-mass, r3-63 would
be the first SNR found to contain a low-mass X-ray binary.
