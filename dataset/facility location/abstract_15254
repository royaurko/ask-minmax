We detect angular galaxy-QSO cross-correlations between the APM Galaxy
Catalogue and a preliminary release (consisting of roughly half of the
anticipated final catalogue) of the Hamburg-ESO Catalogue of Bright QSOs as a
function of source QSO redshift using multiple cross-correlation estimators.
Each of the estimators yield very similar results, implying that the APM
catalogue and the Hamburg-ESO survey are both fair samples of the respective
true galaxy and QSO populations. Though the signal matches the expectations of
gravitational lensing qualitatively, the strength of the measured
cross-correlation signal is significantly greater than the CDM models of
lensing by large scale structure would suggest. This same disagreement between
models and observation has been found in several earlier studies. We estimate
our confidence in the correlation detections versus redshift by generating 1000
random realizations of the Hamburg-ESO QSO survey: We detect physical
associations between galaxies and low-redshift QSOs at 99% confidence and
detect lensing associations at roughly 95% confidence for QSOs with redshifts
between 0.6 and 1. Control cross-correlations between Galactic stars and QSOs
show no signal. Finally, the overdensities (underdensities) of galaxies near
QSO positions relative to those lying roughly 135 - 150 arcmin away are
uncorrelated with differences in Galactic extinction between the two regions,
implying that Galactic dust is not significantly affecting the QSO sample.
