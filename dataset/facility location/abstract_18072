On 2010 October 13, the Apollo type 20-meter asteroid 2010 TB54 passed within
6.1 lunar distances from the Earth. On the same date, but 11.4 hours earlier,
exactly at 02:52:32 UT, the sky over central Poland was illuminated by -8.6
magnitude PF131010 Ciechanow fireball. The trajectory and orbit of the fireball
was computed using multi-station data of Polish Fireball Network (PFN). The
results indicate that the orbit of the meteoroid which caused the PF131010
fireball is similar to the orbit of 2010 TB54 asteroid and both bodies may be
related. Moreover, two days before appearance of Ciechanow fireball another
small asteroid denoted as 2010 SX11 passed close to the Earth-Moon system. Its
orbit is even more similar to the orbit of Ciechanow fireball parent body than
in case of 2010 TB54.
  The PF131010 Ciechanow entered Earth's atmosphere with the velocity of 12.9
+\- 0.2 km/s and started to shine at height of 82.5 +\- 0.3 km. Clear
deceleration started after first three seconds of flight, and the terminal
velocity of the meteor was only 5.8 +\- 0.2 km/s at height of 29.3 +\- 0.1 km.
Such a low value of terminal velocity indicates that fragments with total mass
of around 2 kg could survive the atmospheric passage and cause fall of the
meteorites. The predicted area of possible meteorite impact is computed and it
is located near Grabowo village south of Ostroleka city.
