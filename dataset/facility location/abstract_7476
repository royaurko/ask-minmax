The NGC 1999 reflection nebula features a dark patch with a size of ~10,000
AU, which has been interpreted as a small, dense foreground globule and
possible site of imminent star formation. We present Herschel PACS far-infrared
70 and 160mum maps, which reveal a flux deficit at the location of the globule.
We estimate the globule mass needed to produce such an absorption feature to be
a few tenths to a few Msun. Inspired by this Herschel observation, we obtained
APEX LABOCA and SABOCA submillimeter continuum maps, and Magellan PANIC
near-infrared images of the region. We do not detect a submillimer source at
the location of the Herschel flux decrement; furthermore our observations place
an upper limit on the mass of the globule of ~2.4x10^-2 Msun. Indeed, the
submillimeter maps appear to show a flux depression as well. Furthermore, the
near-infrared images detect faint background stars that are less affected by
extinction inside the dark patch than in its surroundings. We suggest that the
dark patch is in fact a hole or cavity in the material producing the NGC 1999
reflection nebula, excavated by protostellar jets from the V 380 Ori multiple
system.
