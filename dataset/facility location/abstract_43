We present results from the first exposure of a liquid Ar time projection
chamber to a neutrino beam. The data have been collected in 1997 with a 50
liter ICARUS-like chamber located between the CHORUS and NOMAD experiment at
the CERN West Area Neutrino Facility. We focus on the analysis of quasi-elastic
interactions; despite the limited size of the detector, nuclear effects beyond
Fermi motion and Pauli blocking have been observed as perturbations to the pure
quasi-elastic kinematics.
