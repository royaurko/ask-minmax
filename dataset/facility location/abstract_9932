A new theoretical model is presented to study the nanoscale electronic
inhomogeneity in high-$T_c$ cuprates. In this model, we argue that the randomly
distributed out-of-plane interstitial oxygen dopants induces locally the
off-diagonal (i.e., hopping integral) disorder. This disorder modulates the
superexchange interaction resulting from a large-$U$ Hubbard model, which in
turns changes the local pairing interaction. The microscopic self-consistent
calculations shows that the large gap regions are registered to the locations
of dopants. Large gap regions exhibit small and broader coherence peaks. These
results are qualitatively consistent with recent STM observations on optimally
doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$.
