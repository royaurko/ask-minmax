A multi-hit capacity setup was used to study the decay of the dripline
nucleus 31Ar, produced at the ISOLDE facility at CERN. A spectroscopic analysis
of the beta-delayed three-proton decay of 31Ar is presented for the first time
together with a quantitative analysis of the beta-delayed
two-proton-gamma-decay. A new method for determination of the spin of low-lying
levels in the beta-proton-daughter 30S using proton-proton angular correlations
is presented and used for the level at 5.2 MeV, which is found to be either a
3+ or 4+ level, with the data pointing towards the 3+. The half-life of 31Ar is
found to be 15.1(3) ms. An improved analysis of the Fermi beta-strength gives a
total measured branching for the beta-3p-decay of 3.60(44) %, which is lower
than the theoretical value found to be 4.24(43) %. Finally the strongest
gamma-transitions in the decay of 33Ar are shown including a line at 4734(3)
keV associated to the decay of the IAS, which has not previously been
identified.
