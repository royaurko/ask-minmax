Copy number variants (CNVs) account for more polymorphic base pairs in the
human genome than do single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). CNVs encompass
genes as well as noncoding DNA, making these polymorphisms good candidates for
functional variation. Consequently, most modern genome-wide association studies
test CNVs along with SNPs, after inferring copy number status from the data
generated by high-throughput genotyping platforms. Here we give an overview of
CNV genomics in humans, highlighting patterns that inform methods for
identifying CNVs. We describe how genotyping signals are used to identify CNVs
and provide an overview of existing statistical models and methods used to
infer location and carrier status from such data, especially the most commonly
used methods exploring hybridization intensity. We compare the power of such
methods with the alternative method of using tag SNPs to identify CNV carriers.
As such methods are only powerful when applied to common CNVs, we describe two
alternative approaches that can be informative for identifying rare CNVs
contributing to disease risk. We focus particularly on methods identifying de
novo CNVs and show that such methods can be more powerful than case-control
designs. Finally we present some recommendations for identifying CNVs
contributing to common complex disorders.
