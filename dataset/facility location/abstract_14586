RXTE has been operating for nearly 2 years and is planning the third. The
spacecraft performance has been good and the three instruments are operating
well. Observations have been made of the range of targets suitable for RXTE,
including such different objects as accreting neutron stars and black holes,
stellar flares, and supernova remnants. The goals of studying high time
resolution and broad energy range and optimizing multi-wavelength participation
are yielding important results. Oscillations found from low-mass X-ray binaries
probably are signatures of the spin of the neutron stars and of the shortest
orbital periods around the neutron stars. These are constraining neutron star
parameters. Oscillation and spectral results from black hole candidates bring
into the realm of possibility the possibilities of measuring the spins of the
black holes and using X-ray data to test predictions of gravitation theory.
Multi-wavelength observations are leading to identification of the locations of
the X-ray emission regions and, in the case of the micro-quasars, to
understanding of the mechanisms for jet formation. Recently faster observing
response than originally planned has made possible some RXTE contributions to
identification of gamma-ray bursts.
