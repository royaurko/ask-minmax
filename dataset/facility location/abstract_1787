The recoil proton polarization was measured in the d(epol,e' ppol)n reaction
in Hall A of the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab). The
electron kinematics were centered on the quasielastic peak (x_{Bj}~1) and
included three values of the squared four-momentum transfer, Q^2=0.43, 1.00 and
1.61 (GeV/c)^2. For Q^2=0.43 and 1.61 (GeV/c)^2, the missing momentum, p_m, was
centered at zero while for Q^2=1.00 (GeV/c)^2 two values of p_m were chosen: 0
and 174 MeV/c. At low p_m, the Q^2 dependence of the longitudinal polarization,
P_z', is not well described by a state-of-the-art calculation. Further, at
higher p_m, a 3.5 sigma discrepancy was observed in the transverse
polarization, P_x'. Understanding the origin of these discrepancies is
important in order to confidently extract the neutron electric form factor from
the analogous d(epol,e' npol)p experiment.
