An instrument of central importance for the strangeness photo- and
electroproduction at the 1.5-GeV electron beam of the MAMI accelerator at the
Institut f\"ur Kernphysik in Mainz, Germany, is the newly installed magnetic
spectrometer Kaos that is operated by the A1 collaboration in $(e,e'K)$
reactions on the proton or light nuclei. Its compact design and its capability
to detect negative and positive charged particles simultaneously complements
the existing spectrometers. The strangeness program performed with Kaos in
2008-9 is addressing some important issues in the field of elementary kaon
photo- and electroproduction reactions. Although recent measurements have been
performed at Jefferson Lab, there are still a number of open problems in the
interpretation of the data and the description of the elementary process using
phenomenological models. With the identification of $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^0$
hyperons in the missing mass spectra from kaon production off a liquid hydrogen
target it is demonstrated that the extended facility at MAMI is capable to
perform strangeness electroproduction spectroscopy at low momentum transfers
$Q^2$ < 0.5 (GeV/c)$^2$. The covered kinematics and systematic uncertainties in
the cross-section extraction from the data are discussed.
