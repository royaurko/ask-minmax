We generate equilibrium configurations for the three and four dimensional
Ising spin glass with Gaussian distributed couplings at temperatures well below
the transition temperature T_c. These states are analyzed by a recently
proposed method using clustering. The analysis reveals a hierarchical state
space structure. At each level of the hierarchy states are labeled by the
orientations of a set of correlated macroscopic spin domains. Our picture of
the low temperature phase of short range spin glasses is that of a State
Hierarchy Induced by Correlated Spin domains (SHICS). The complexity of the low
temperature phase is manifest in the fact that the composition of such a spin
domain (i.e. its constituent spins), as well as its identifying label, are
defined and determined by the ``location'' in the state hierarchy at which it
appears. Mapping out the phase space structure by means of the orientations
assumed by these domains enhances our ability to investigate the overlap
distribution, which we find to be non-trivial. Evidence is also presented that
these states may have a non-ultrametric structure.
