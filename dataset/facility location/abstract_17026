We report on the uptake, toxicity and degradation of magnetic nanowires by
NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Magnetic nanowires of diameters 200 nm and lengths
comprised between 1 {\mu}m and 40 {\mu}m are fabricated by controlled assembly
of iron oxide ({\gamma}-Fe2O3) nanoparticles. Using optical and electron
microscopy, we show that after 24 h incubation the wires are internalized by
the cells and located either in membrane-bound compartments or dispersed in the
cytosol. Using fluorescence microscopy, the membrane-bound compartments were
identified as late endosomal/lysosomal endosomes labeled with lysosomal
associated membrane protein (Lamp1). Toxicity assays evaluating the
mitochondrial activity, cell proliferation and production of reactive oxygen
species show that the wires do not display acute short-term (< 100 h) toxicity
towards the cells. Interestingly, the cells are able to degrade the wires and
to transform them into smaller aggregates, even in short time periods (days).
This degradation is likely to occur as a consequence of the internal structure
of the wires, which is that of a non-covalently bound aggregate. We anticipate
that this degradation should prevent long-term asbestos-like toxicity effects
related to high aspect ratio morphologies and that these wires represent a
promising class of nanomaterials for cell manipulation and microrheology.
