Mean motion resonances (MMRs) can lead either to chaotic or regular motion.
We report on a numerical experiment showing that even in one of the most
chaotic regions of the Solar System - the region of the giant planets, there
are numerous bands where MMRs can stabilize orbits of small bodies in a time
span comparable to their lifetimes. Two types of temporary stabilization were
observed: short period ($\sim10^{4}$ years) when a body was in a MMR with only
one planet and long period (over $10^{5}$ years) when a body is located in
overlapping MMRs with two or three planets.
  The experiment showed that the Main Belt region can be enriched by cometary
material in its pre-active state due to temporary resonant interactions between
small bodies and giant planets.
