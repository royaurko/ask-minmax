The main goal of the FIRST-APM QSO Survey (FAQS) survey is to compile the
most complete sample of Bright QSOs, located in the well optically investigated
area of the sky covered by the Second Byurakan Survey (SBS). We do that through
the combination of both radio and optical surveys, down to the magnitude limit
B<18.5. We report here the first results of our ongoing study, that is based
upon the cross-identification of the FIRST radio catalog and the Automated
Plate Measuring Machine (APM) optical catalog. The overlapping sky area between
the FIRST and the SBS surveys is about 700 sq. deg. Our compiled list of
sources for this overlapping region contains ~400 quasar candidates brighter
than B=18.5. Of which, about 90 objects are already spectroscopically
classified. These objects have been discovered maynly by the SBS survey. During
1999, we have carried out spectroscopic observations for more than 100 FAQS
objects with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro Astrophysical Observatory
(GHO). So far, in the studied subsample, we have found 33 new QSOs, 2 Seyfert
Galaxies, 15 emission line galaxies, 1 BL Lac, and 45 high galactic latitude
stars. Amongst the 33 QSOs, we have found two broad absorption line (BAL) QSOs,
namely, FAQS 151113.7+490557 and FAQS 161744.4+515054. These two BAL QSOs are
radio-loud, and have radio-to-optical flux ratios (log R) with values of 1.1
and 2.5 respectively. The last object being the brightest radio-loud BAL QSO
known, with a flux density of 99.8 mJy at 1.4 Ghz.
