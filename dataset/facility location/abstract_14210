This paper proposes a simple and efficient method for the reconstruction and
extraction of geometric parameters from 3D tubular objects. Our method
constructs an image that accumulates surface normal information, then peaks
within this image are located by tracking. Finally, the positions of these are
optimized to lie precisely on the tubular shape centerline. This method is very
versatile, and is able to process various input data types like full or partial
mesh acquired from 3D laser scans, 3D height map or discrete volumetric images.
The proposed algorithm is simple to implement, contains few parameters and can
be computed in linear time with respect to the number of surface faces. Since
the extracted tube centerline is accurate, we are able to decompose the tube
into rectilinear parts and torus-like parts. This is done with a new linear
time 3D torus detection algorithm, which follows the same principle of a
previous work on 2D arc circle recognition. Detailed experiments show the
versatility, accuracy and robustness of our new method.
