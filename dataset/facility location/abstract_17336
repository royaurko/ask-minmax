We consider the problem of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging and motion
estimation of complex scenes. By complex we mean scenes with multiple targets,
stationary and in motion. We use the usual setup with one moving antenna
emitting and receiving signals. We address two challenges: (1) the detection of
moving targets in the complex scene and (2) the separation of the echoes from
the stationary targets and those from the moving targets. Such separation
allows high resolution imaging of the stationary scene and motion estimation
with the echoes from the moving targets alone. We show that the robust
principal component analysis (PCA) method which decomposes a matrix in two
parts, one low rank and one sparse, can be used for motion detection and data
separation. The matrix that is decomposed is the pulse and range compressed SAR
data indexed by two discrete time variables: the slow time, which parametrizes
the location of the antenna, and the fast time, which parametrizes the echoes
received between successive emissions from the antenna. We present an analysis
of the rank of the data matrix to motivate the use of the robust PCA method. We
also show with numerical simulations that successful data separation with
robust PCA requires proper data windowing. Results of motion estimation and
imaging with the separated data are presented, as well.
