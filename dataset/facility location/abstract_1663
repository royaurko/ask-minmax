In view of the discovery potential associated with the future experiments
of high-luminosity fixed target facilities, B-meson factories and \tau-charm
factories, we highlight some typical signals of D^0-\bar{D}^0 mixing and CP
violation which are likely to show up in neutral D-meson decays to the
semileptonic final states, the hadronic CP eigenstates, the hadronic non-CP
eigenstates and the CP-forbidden states. Both time-dependent and
time-integrated measurements are discussed, and particular interest is paid
to D^0/\bar{D}^0 \to K_{S,L}+\pi^0 and D^0/\bar{D}^0\to K^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}
transitions.
