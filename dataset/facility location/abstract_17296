The Daya Bay experiment measures sin^2 2{\theta}_13 using functionally
identical antineutrino detectors located at distances of 300 to 2000 meters
from the Daya Bay nuclear power complex. Each detector consists of three nested
fluid volumes surrounded by photomultiplier tubes. These volumes are coupled to
overflow tanks on top of the detector to allow for thermal expansion of the
liquid. Antineutrinos are detected through the inverse beta decay reaction on
the proton-rich scintillator target. A precise and continuous measurement of
the detector's central target mass is achieved by monitoring the the fluid
level in the overflow tanks with cameras and ultrasonic and capacitive sensors.
In addition, the monitoring system records detector temperature and levelness
at multiple positions. This monitoring information allows the precise
determination of the detectors' effective number of target protons during data
taking. We present the design, calibration, installation and in-situ tests of
the Daya Bay real-time antineutrino detector monitoring sensors and readout
electronics.
