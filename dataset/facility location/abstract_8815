Based on a model of globular cluster self-enrichment published in a previous
paper, we present an explanation for the metallicity gradient observed
throughout the galactic Old Halo. Our self-enrichment model is based on the
ability of globular cluster progenitor clouds to retain the ejecta of a first
generation of Type II Supernovae. The key point is that this ability depends on
the pressure exerted on the progenitor cloud by the surrounding protogalactic
medium and therefore on the location of the cloud in the protoGalaxy. Since
there is no significant (if any) metallicity gradient in the whole halo, we
also present a review in favour of a galactic halo partly build via accretions
and mergers of satellite systems. Some of them bear their own globular clusters
and therefore ``contaminate'' the system of globular clusters formed ``in
situ'', namely within the original potential well of the Galaxy. Therefore, the
comparison between our self-enrichment model and the observational data should
be limited to the genuine galactic globular clusters, the so-called Old Halo
group.
