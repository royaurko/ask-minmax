We have searched for TeV gamma-rays from Centaurus A and surrounding region
out to +/- 1.0 deg using the CANGAROO 3.8m telescope. No evidence for TeV
gamma-ray emission was observed from the search region, which includes a number
of interesting features located away from the tracking centre of our data. The
3 sigma upper limit to the flux of gamma-rays above 1.5 TeV from an extended
source of radius 14' centred on Centaurus A is 1.28e-11 photons cm^-2 s^-1.
