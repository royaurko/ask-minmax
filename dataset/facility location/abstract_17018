The global properties of all known Galactic globular clusters are examined.
The relationship between the luminosities and the metallicities of Galactic
globular clusters is found to be complex. Among luminous clusters there is a
correlation in the sense that the oldest clusters are slightly more metal
deficient than are younger clusters. However, no such clear-cut relationship is
found among the faintest globular clusters. The central concentration index C
of globular clusters is seen to be independent of metallicity. The dependence
of the half-light radii of globular clusters on their Galactocentric distances
can be approximated by the relation $R_h \alpha R^{2/3}_{gc}$. Clusters with
collapsed cores are mostly situated close to the Galactic nucleus. For $R_{gc}
< 10$ kpc the luminosities and the radii of clusters appear to be uncorrelated.
The Galaxy differs from the LMC and the SMC in that it appears to lack highly
flattened luminous clusters. Galactic globular clusters with ages $\geq$ 13.0
Gyr are all of Oosterhoff type II, whereas almost all of those with ages $<$
13.0 Gyr have been assigned to Oosterhoff type I. Globular clusters with ages
$<$11.5 Gyr are all located in the outer Galactic halo, have below-average
luminosities and above-average radii. On the other hand the very old globular
cluster NGC 6522 is situated close to the Galactic nucleus.
