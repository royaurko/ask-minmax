We present a long BeppoSAX observation of Abell 754 that reports a nonthermal
excess with respect to the thermal emission at energies greater than ~45 keV. A
VLA radio observation at 1.4 GHz definitely confirms the existence of diffuse
radio emission in the central region of the cluster, previously suggested by
images at 74 and 330 MHz (Kassim et al 2001), and reports additional features.
Besides, our observation determines a steeper radio halo spectrum in the
330-1400 MHz frequency range with respect to the spectrum detected at lower
frequencies, indicating the presence of a spectral cutoff. The presence of a
radio halo in A754, considered the prototype of a merging cluster, reinforces
the link between formation of Mpc-scale radio regions and very recent or
current merger processes. The radio results combined with the hard X-ray excess
detected by BeppoSAX give information on the origin of the electron population
responsible for nonthermal phenomena in galaxy clusters. We discuss also the
possibility that 26W20, a tailed radio galaxy with BL Lac characteristics
located in the field of view of the PDS, could be responsible for the observed
nonthermal hard X-ray emission.
