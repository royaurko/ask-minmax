We explore the nature of the small-scale solar dynamo by tracking magnetic
features. We investigate two previously-explored categories of the small-scale
solar dynamo: shallow and deep. Recent modeling work on the shallow dynamo has
produced a number of scenarios for how a strong network concentration can
influence the formation and polarity of nearby small-scale magnetic features.
These scenarios have measurable signatures, which we test for here using
magnetograms from the Narrowband Filter Imager (NFI) on Hinode. We find no
statistical tendency for newly-formed magnetic features to cluster around or
away from network concentrations, nor do we find any statistical relationship
between their polarities. We conclude that there is no shallow or "surface"
dynamo on the spatial scales observable by Hinode/NFI. In light of these
results, we offer a scenario in which the sub-surface field in a deep solar
dynamo is stretched and distorted via turbulence, allowing the field to emerge
at random locations on the photosphere.
