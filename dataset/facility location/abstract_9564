It is now generally accepted that long gamma-ray bursts are associated with
the final evolutionary stages of massive stars. As a consequence, their jets
must propagate through the stellar progenitor and break out on their surface,
before they can reach the photospheric radius and produce the gamma-ray
photons. We investigate the role of the progenitor star in shaping the jet
properties. We show that even a jet powered by a steady engine can develop a
rich phenomenology at the stellar surface. We present special-relativistic
simulations and compare the results to analytic considerations. We show that
the jet is complex in the time as well as in the angular domain, so that
observers located along different lines of sight detect significantly different
bursts.
