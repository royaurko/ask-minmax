The AMANDA (Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array) detector, located at
the South Pole station, Antarctica, was recently expanded with the addition of
six new strings, completing the phase referred to as AMANDA-II. This detector
has been calibrated and in operation since January 2000. The first data
analyses are currently underway. In this report we present an update on the
results from the AMANDA-B10 detector, which operated during the austral winter
1997.
