Sco X-1, the brightest low mass X-ray binary, is likely to be a source for
gravitational wave emission. In one mechanism, emission of a gravitational wave
arrests the increase in spin frequency due to the accretion torque in a low
mass X-ray binary. Since the gravitational waveform is unknown, a detection
method assuming no apriori knowledge of the signal is preferable. In this
paper, we propose to search for a gravitational wave from Sco X-1 using a {{\it
source tracking}} method based on a coherent network analysis. In the method,
we combine data from several interferometric gravitational wave detectors
taking into account of the direction to Sco X-1, and reconstruct two
polarization waveforms at the location of Sco X-1 in the sky as Sco X-1 is
moving. The source tracking method opens up the possibility of searching for a
wide variety of signals. We perform Monte Carlo simulations and show results
for bursts, modeled, short duration periodic sources using a simple excess
power and a matched filter method on the reconstructed signals.
