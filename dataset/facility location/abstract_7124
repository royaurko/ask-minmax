The di-neutron correlation is a spatial correlation with which two valence
neutrons are located at a similar position inside a nucleus. We discuss
possible experimental probes for the di-neutron correlation. This includes the
Coulomb breakup and the pair transfer reactions of neutron-rich nuclei, and the
direct two-neutron decays of nuclei beyond the neutron drip-line.
