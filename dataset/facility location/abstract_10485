We present a method of control which is able to create barriers to magnetic
field line diffusion by a small modification of the magnetic perturbation. This
method of control is based on a localized control of chaos in Hamiltonian
systems. The aim is to modify the perturbation locally by a small control term
which creates invariant tori acting as barriers to diffusion for Hamiltonian
systems with two degrees of freedom. The location of the invariant torus is
enforced in the vicinity of the chosen target. Given the importance of
confinement in magnetic fusion devices, the method is applied to two examples
with a loss of magnetic confinement. In the case of locked tearing modes, an
invariant torus can be restored that aims at showing the current quench and
therefore the generation of runaway electrons. In the second case, the method
is applied to the control of stochastic boundaries allowing one to define a
transport barrier within the stochastic boundary and therefore to monitor the
volume of closed field lines.
