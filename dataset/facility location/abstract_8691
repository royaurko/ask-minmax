The connection between the arrival directions of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays
by using the EAS array data and point galactic sources of radio-and
gamma-radiations, pulsars,is sought. At the mean particle energy of 10^{19} eV
the correlation between the particle arrival directions and pulsars located
along the magnetic field lines has been found. According to our estimations the
chance probability is equal to 2.10^{-4}. The observed particle flux from 16
pulsars inside a circle of radius <6^{\circ} exceeds the background by
6.3\sigma (p < 10^{-10}), from PSR 2351+61 - 5\sigma. A group of 9 pulsars has
been found from the direction of which the particle flux in the region
10^{\circ}\times60^{\circ} is in excess of the expected one by 4.4\sigma. The
obtained results are discussed.
