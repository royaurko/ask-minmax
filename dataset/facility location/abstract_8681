We present the discovery of a giant molecular complex (r=350 pc, M_ vir=10^7
M_sun) in the tidal arms south-east of NGC 3077, a member of the M 81 triplet.
The complex is clearly detected in the 12CO (J=1-0) transition at five
independent positions. The position relative to NGC 3077, the systemic velocity
(v_hel=14km/s) and the cloud averaged line width (15km/s) indicate that the
object is not related to Galactic cirrus but is extragalactic. The tidal HI arm
where the molecular complex is located has an total HI mass of M_HI=3x10^8
M_sun. This tidal material was presumably stripped off the outer parts of NGC
3077 during the closest encounter with M 81, about 3x10^8 years ago. After the
complex detected along a torn-out spiral arm of M 81 by Brouillet et al., it is
the second of its kind reported so far. Based on published optical
observations, we have no evidence for on--going star formation in the newly
detected molecular complex. Since the system has all the ingredients to form
stars in the future, we speculate that it might eventually resemble the young
dwarf galaxies in the M 81 group.
