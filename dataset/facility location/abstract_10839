We derive some new structural results for the transfer matrix of
square-lattice Potts models with free and cylindrical boundary conditions. In
particular, we obtain explicit closed-form expressions for the dominant (at
large |q|) diagonal entry in the transfer matrix, for arbitrary widths m, as
the solution of a special one-dimensional polymer model. We also obtain the
large-q expansion of the bulk and surface (resp. corner) free energies for the
zero-temperature antiferromagnet (= chromatic polynomial) through order q^{-47}
(resp. q^{-46}). Finally, we compute chromatic roots for strips of widths 9 <=
m <= 12 with free boundary conditions and locate roughly the limiting curves.
