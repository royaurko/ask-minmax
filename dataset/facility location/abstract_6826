Bifurcation cascades in conservative systems are shown to exhibit a
generalized diagram, which contains all relevant informations regarding the
location of periodic orbits (resonances), their width (island size), irrational
tori and the infinite higher-order resonances, showing the intricate way they
are born. Contraction rates for islands sizes, along period-doubling
bifurcations, are estimated to be $\alpha_I\sim 3.9$. Results are demonstrated
for the standard map and for the continuous H\'enon-Heiles potential. The
methods used here are very suitable to find periodic orbits in conservative
systems, and to characterize the regular, mixed or chaotic dynamics as the
nonlinear parameter is varied.
