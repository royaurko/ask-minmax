Alternating-sign Hopf plumbing along a tree yields fibered alternating links
whose homological monodromy is, up to a sign, conjugate to some
alternating-sign Coxeter transformation. Exploiting this tie, we obtain results
about the location of zeros of the Alexander polynomial of the fibered link
complement implying a strong case of Hoste's conjecture, the trapezoidal
conjecture, bi-orderability of the link group, and a sharp lower bound for the
homological dilatation of the monodromy of the fibration. The results extend to
more general hyperbolic fibered 3-manifolds associated to alternating-sign
Coxeter graphs.
