Aims. This study focuses on very luminous Mbol<-6.0 mag AGB stars with
J-Ks>1.5 mag and H-Ks>0.4 mag in the LMC, SMC, M31, and M33 from 2MASS data.
 Methods.The data were taken from the 2MASS All-Sky Point Source catalogue
archive. We used Virtual Observatory tools and took advantage of its
capabilities at various stages in the analysis.
 Results. It is well known that stars with the colors we selected correspond
mainly to carbon stars. Although the most luminous AGBs detected here contain a
large number of carbon stars,they are not included in existing catalogues
produced from data in the optical domain, where they are not visible since they
are dust-enshrouded. A comparison of the AGB stars detected with combined near
and mid-infrared data from MSX and 2MASS in the LMC shows that 10% of the
bright AGB stars are bright carbon stars never detected before and that the
other 50% are OH/IR oxygen rich stars, whereas the 40% that remain were not
cross-matched.
 Conclusions. The catalogues of the most luminous AGB stars compiled here are
an important complement to existing data. In the LMC, these bright AGB stars
are centrally located, whereas they are concentrated in an active
star-formation ring in M31. In the SMC and M33, there are not enough of them to
draw definite conclusions, although they tend to be centrally located. Their
luminosity functions are similar for the four galaxies we studied.
