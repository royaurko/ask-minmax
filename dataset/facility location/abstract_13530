Scans of Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) tangency radii and elevation on two
possible DEMO scenarios have been performed with two beam energies, 1.5MeV and
1.0MeV, in order to determine the most favourable options for Neutral Beam
Current Drive (NBCD) efficiency. In addition, a method using a genetic
algorithm has been used to seek optimised solutions of NBI source locations and
powers to synthesize a target total plasma driven-current profile. It is found
that certain beam trajectories may be proscribed by limitations on shinethrough
onto the vessel wall. This may affect the ability of NBCD to extend the
duration of a pulse in a scenario where it must complement the induced plasma
current. Operating at the lower beam energy reduces the restrictions due to
shinethrough and is attractive for technical reasons, but in the scenarios
examined here this results in a spatial broadening of the NBCD profile, which
may make it more challenging to achieve desired total driven-current profiles.
