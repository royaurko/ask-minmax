The reduction of integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data requires several
stages and many repetitive operations to convert raw data into, typically, a
large number of spectra. Instead there are several semiautomatic data reduction
tools and here we present this data reduction process using some of the Image
Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF) tasks devoted to reduce spectroscopic
data. After explaining the whole process, we illustrate the power of this
instrumental technique with some results obtained for the object HH202 in the
Orion Nebula (Mesa-Delgado et al., 2009).
