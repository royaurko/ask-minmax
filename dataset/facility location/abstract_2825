The MINOS experiment uses the intense NuMI beam created at Fermilab and two
magnetized tracking calorimeters, one located at Fermilab and one located 735
km away at the Soudan Mine in Minnesota, to make precise measurements of
$\nu_\mu$ disappearance oscillation parameters. We present recent results from
the first two years of NuMI beam operations, including the precise measurement
of the atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters and the search for sterile
neutrinos. Future prospects for MINOS will also be discussed, including an
improved limit on the $\theta_{13}$ mixing angle by searching for $\nu_e$
appearance in the $\nu_\mu$ beam.
