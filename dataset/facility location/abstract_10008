Discrete particle simulations are used to model segregation in granular
mixtures of three different particle species in a horizontal rotating drum.
Axial band formation is observed, with medium-size particles tending to be
located between alternating bands of big and small particles. Partial radial
segregation also appears; it precedes the axial segregation and is
characterized by an inner core region richer in small particles. Axial bands
are seen to merge during the long simulation runs, leading to a coarsening of
the band pattern; the relocation of particles involved in one such merging
event is examined. Overall, the behavior is similar to experiment and
represents a generalization of what occurs in the simpler two-component
mixture.
