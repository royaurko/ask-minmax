The data on the tensor analyzing power T20 in the dd->^3Hen and dd-> ^3Hp
reactions at 140, 200 and 270 MeV of the deuteron kinetic energy and at zero
degree obtained at RIKEN Accelerator Research Facility are presented. The
observed positive sign of T20 clearly demonstrates the sensitivity to the D/S
wave ratios in the ^3He and ^3H in the energy domain of the measurements. The
T20 data for the ^3He-n and ^3H-p channels are in agreement within experimental
accuracy.
