HESS J0632+057 has been recently identified as a new gamma-ray binary system.
The source, located in the Monoceros region and associated with the massive Be
star MWC 148, shows variability from radio to very high energy (VHE)
gamma-rays, displaying a maximum of its non-thermal emission about 100 days
after periastron passage (at orbital phases close to 0.3). We present here the
results obtained with the VERITAS and H.E.S.S Cherenkov telescopes spanning a
wide time interval from 2004 to 2012. The source is detected at TeV gamma-rays
at a high significance level at orbital phase 0.3. We also report for the first
time TeV observations belonging to orbital phases never explored so far. The
VHE gamma-ray results are discussed in a multiwavelength context, focusing on
contemporaneous observations obtained with the Swift-XRT.
