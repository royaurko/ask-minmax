Experimental results for photo- and electro-production of open strangeness
from the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility are discussed. The
results are from work completed by mid-2003 on elementary $KY$ production,
nuclear targets, and the exotic $\Theta^+$ state. It is shown how the increases
in intensity and precision of JLab experiments over earlier work have allowed
new phenomena to become measurable.
