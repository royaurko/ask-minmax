Wireless systems are getting deployed in many new environments with different
antenna heights, frequency bands and multipath conditions. This has led to an
increasing demand for more channel measurements to understand wireless
propagation in specific environments and assist deployment engineering. We
design and implement a rapid wireless channel sounding system, using the
Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) and GNU Radio software, to address
these demands. Our design measures channel propagation characteristics
simultaneously from multiple transmitter locations. The system consists of
multiple battery-powered transmitters and receivers. Therefore, we can set-up
the channel sounder rapidly at a field location and measure expeditiously by
analyzing different transmitters signals during a single walk or drive through
the environment. Our design can be used for both indoor and outdoor channel
measurements in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 6 GHz. We expect that the
proposed approach, with a few further refinements, can transform the task of
propagation measurement as a routine part of day-to-day wireless network
engineering.
