We study the ovi distribution in space and time in a representative section
of the Galactic disk by 3D adaptive mesh refinement HD and MHD simulations of
the ISM, including the disk-halo-disk circulation. The simulations describe a
supernova driven ISM on large (10 kpc) and small (1.25 pc) scales over a
sufficiently large timescale (400 Myrs) in order to establish a global
dynamical equilibrium. The Ovi column density, N(Ovi), is monitored through
lines of sight measurements at different locations in the simulated disk. One
has been deliberately chosen to be inside of a hot bubble, like our own Local
Bubble, while the other locations are random. We obtain a correlation between
N(Ovi) and distance, which is independent of the observer's vantage point in
the disk. In particular, the location of the observer inside a hot bubble does
not have any influence on the correlation, because the contribution of an
individual bubble (with a typical extension of 100 pc) is negligibly small. We
find a remarkable agreement between the Ovi column densities (as a function of
distance) and the averaged Ovi density (~1.8x10^{-8}$ cm$^{-3}$) in the disk
from our simulations and the values observed with Copernicus, and FUSE. Our
results strongly support the important r\^ole of turbulent mixing in the
distribution of Ovi clumps in the ISM. Supernova induced turbulence is quite
strong and unavoidable due to shearing motions in the ISM and operates on a
large range of scales.
