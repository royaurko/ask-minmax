We introduce a local-scaling point transformation to allow for modifying the
asymptotic properties of the deformed three-dimensional Cartesian harmonic
oscillator wave functions. The resulting single-particle bases are very well
suited for solving the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equations for deformed drip-line
nuclei. We then present results of self-consistent calculations performed for
the Mg isotopes and for light nuclei located near the two-neutron drip line.
The results suggest that for all even-even elements with $Z$=10--18 the most
weakly-bound nucleus has an oblate ground-state shape.
