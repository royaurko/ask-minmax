Location distinction is defined as determining whether or not the position of
a device has changed. We introduce methods and metrics for performing location
distinction in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless networks. Using
MIMO channel measurements from two different testbeds, we evaluate the
performance of temporal signature-based location distinction with varying
system parameters, and show that it can be applied to MIMO channels with
favorable results. In particular, a 2x2 MIMO channel with a bandwidth of 80 MHz
allows a 64-fold reduction in miss rate over the SISO channel for a fixed false
alarm rate, achieving as small as 4 x 10^-4 probability of false alarm for a
2.4 x 10^-4 probability of missed detection. The very high reliability of MIMO
location distinction enables location distinction systems to detect the change
in position of a transmitter even when using a single receiver.
