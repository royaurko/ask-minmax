We present the first study of the relationship between the column density
distribution of molecular clouds within nearby Galactic spiral arms and their
evolutionary status as measured from their stellar content. We analyze a sample
of 195 molecular clouds located at distances below 5.5 kpc, identified from the
ATLASGAL 870 micron data. We define three evolutionary classes within this
sample: starless clumps, star-forming clouds with associated young stellar
objects, and clouds associated with HII regions. We find that the N(H2)
probability density functions (N-PDFs) of these three classes of objects are
clearly different: the N-PDFs of starless clumps are narrowest and close to
log-normal in shape, while star-forming clouds and HII regions exhibit a
power-law shape over a wide range of column densities and log-normal-like
components only at low column densities. We use the N-PDFs to estimate the
evolutionary time-scales of the three classes of objects based on a simple
analytic model from literature. Finally, we show that the integral of the
N-PDFs, the dense gas mass fraction, depends on the total mass of the regions
as measured by ATLASGAL: more massive clouds contain greater relative amounts
of dense gas across all evolutionary classes.
