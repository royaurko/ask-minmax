The neoclassical transport theory is applied to calculate electron cyclotron
current drive (ECCD) efficiency in an axisymmetric tokamak in the
low-collisionality regime. The tokamak ordering is used to obtain a system of
equations that describe the dynamics of the plasma where the nonlinear
ponderomotive (PM) force due to high-power RF waves is included. The PM force
is produced around an electron cyclotron resonant surface at a specific
poloidal location. The ECCD efficiency is analyzed in the cases of first and
second harmonics (for different impinging angles of the RF waves) and it is
validated using experimental parameter values from TCV and T-10 tokamaks. The
results are in agreement with those obtained by means of Green's function
techniques.
