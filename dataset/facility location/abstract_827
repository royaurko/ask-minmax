This is a tutorial for using a new q-series Maple package. The package
includes facilities for conversion between q-series and q-products and finding
algebraic relations between q-series. Andrews found an algorithm for converting
a q-series into a product. We provide an implementation. As an application we
are able to effectively find finite q-product factorisations when they exist
thus answering a question of Andrews. We provide other applications involving
factorisations into theta functions and eta products.
