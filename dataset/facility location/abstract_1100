A feasible and convenient method has been proposed to suppress
higher-harmonics for varied-line-spacing (VLS) plane grating monochromator in
soft x-ray region. Related calculations and experiments demonstrate that
decreasing the included angle slightly by changing the parameter of exit arm
length can significantly improve light purity. This method is suitable and has
been used for experiments of detector calibration in beamline 4B7B at Beijing
Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF).
