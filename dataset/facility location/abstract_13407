The driving objective of the Fly's Eye Project is a high resolution, high
coverage time-domain survey in multiple optical passbands: our goal is to cover
the entire visible sky above the 30 deg horizontal altitude with a cadence of 3
min. Imaging is intended to perform with 19 wide-field cameras mounted on a
hexapod platform. The essence of the hexapod allows us to build an instrument
that does not require any kind of precise alignment and, in addition, the
similar mechanics can be involved independently from the geographical location
of the device. Here we summarize our early results with a single camera,
focusing on the sidereal tracking as it is performed with the hexapod built by
our group.
