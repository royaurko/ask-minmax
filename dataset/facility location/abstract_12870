The uncertainty about a possible correlation between strength and inclination
of the magnetic field and the continuum intensity of the sunspot penumbral
fine-structure has been removed by a detailed analysis of a spatially very high
resolved spectrum: the darker, lengthy penumbral lanes host a 10% stronger and
>30 deg flatter magnetic field as compared to the bright penumbral locations.
This finding does not only result from the high spatial resolution but also
from the choice of the Fe I 6842.7 line, which obtains its essential
contribution from those deep layers near the continuum intensity level where
the penumbral structure is seen. The almost perfect correlation establishes
that the penumbral structure is formed by two magnetic components mainly
differing by their field inclination. The discrepancy with results from other
Zeeman lines, as e.g. Fe I 6302.5, indicates a different field structure above
the white light penumbral layers.
