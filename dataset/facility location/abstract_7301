The phase diagrams and superconducting properties of the extended Hubbard
model with pair hopping interaction, i.e. the Penson-Kolb-Hubbard model are
studied. The analysis of the model is performed for d-dimensional hypercubic
lattices, including d=1 and d=$\infty$, by means of the (broken symmetry)
Hartree-Fock approximations and, for d=$\infty$, by the slave-boson mean-field
method. For d=1, at half-filling the phase diagram is shown to consist of nine
different phases including two superconducting states with center-of-mass
momentum q=0 and q=Q ($\eta$-pairing), site and bond-located antiferromagnetic
and charge-density wave states as well as three mixed phases with coexisting
site and bond orderings. The stability range of the bond-type orderings is
shrank with increasing lattice dimensionality d and for d=$\infty$ the
corresponding diagram consists of four phases only, involving exclusively
site-located orderings. Comparing the pair hopping model with the attractive
Hubbard model we found in the both cases gradual evolution from the BCS-like
limit to the tightly bound pairs regime and a monotonic increase of the gap in
the excitation spectrum with increasing coupling. However, the dynamics of
electron pairs in both models is qualitatively different, which results in
different dependences of condensation energies and critical temperatures on
interaction parameters as well as in different electrodynamic properties,
especially in a strong coupling regime.
