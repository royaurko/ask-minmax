We present a new submm/mm galaxy counterpart identification technique which
builds on the use of Spitzer IRAC colors as discriminators between likely
counterparts and the general IRAC galaxy population. Using 102 radio- and
SMA-confirmed counterparts to AzTEC sources across three fields (GOODS-N,
GOODS-S, and COSMOS), we develop a non-parametric IRAC color-color
characteristic density distribution (CDD), which, when combined with positional
uncertainty information via likelihood ratios, allows us to rank all potential
IRAC counterparts around SMGs and calculate the significance of each ranking
via the reliability factor. We report all robust and tentative radio
counterparts to SMGs, the first such list available for AzTEC/COSMOS, as well
as the highest ranked IRAC counterparts for all AzTEC SMGs in these fields as
determined by our technique. We demonstrate that the technique is free of radio
bias and thus applicable regardless of radio detections. For observations made
with a moderate beamsize (~18"), this technique identifies ~85 per cent of SMG
counterparts. For much larger beamsizes (>30"), we report identification rates
of 33-49 per cent. Using simulations, we demonstrate that this technique is an
improvement over using positional information alone for observations with
facilities such as AzTEC on the LMT and SCUBA-2 on JCMT.
