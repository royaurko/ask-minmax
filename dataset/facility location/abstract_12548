Here we consider the influence of the microlensing on the spectrum of a
lensed object taking into account that composite emission is coming from
different regions arranged subsequently around the central source. We assumed
that the lensed object has three regions with the black body emission; first
the innermost with the highest temperature of $10^4K$, second and third
(located around the central) with slightly lower temperatures $7.5\cdot10^3$
and $5\cdot10^3$K, respectively. Than we explore the flux anomaly in lensed
object due to microlensing. We compare U,V and B spectra of a such source. This
results show that, due to microlensing, in a spectroscopically stratified
object a flux anomaly is present.
