Many hoards found in Ireland, Scotland, Orkney Islands, and Scandinavia
demonstrate the vikings ability to fabricate beautiful arm and neck rings of
twisted silver and gold rods. Characteristic for such rings is the uniform
appearance of the twisted pattern along the length of the arm ring, as well as
from one arm ring to another, also when found at distant geographical
locations. How can the appearance of the twisted wires be so perfectly
repetitive? We demonstrate that the answer is that the vikings utilized a
self-forming motif: The pattern arises from a twisting of the wires to a
maximally rotated configuration. That is why the twist patterns in these arm
and neck rings are beautiful, repetitive, and universal.
