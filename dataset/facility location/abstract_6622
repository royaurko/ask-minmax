NEMO 3 experiment is designed to search for neutrinoless double beta decay.
It is located in the Modane Underground Laboratory (LSM) and has been taking
data since February 2003. The half- lives of two neutrino beta decay have been
measured for seven isotopes. No evidence of neutrinoless double beta decay has
been found. The limits on both the half-lives of the neutrinoless double beta
decay and the corresponding Majorana effective masses are derived
