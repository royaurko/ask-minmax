The source sky location estimate for the first detected gravitational wave
signals will likely be poor, typically spanning areas more than hundreds of
square degrees. It is an enormous task for most telescopes to search such large
sky regions for counterpart signals in the electromagnetic spectrum. To
maximise the chance of successfully observing the desired counterpart signal,
we have developed an algorithm which maximises the detection probability by
optimising the number of observing fields, and the time allocation for those
fields. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we use the algorithm to optimise
the follow-up observations of the Palomar Transient Factory for a simulated
gravitational wave event. We show that the optimal numbers for the Palomar
Transient Factory are $24$ and $68$ for observation times $1800s$ and $5400s$
respectively, with a maximum detection probability about $65\%$ for a kilonova
at $200 Mpc$.
