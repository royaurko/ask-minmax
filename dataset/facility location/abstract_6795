Neutron rich nuclei has been studied with a new phenomenological mass
formula. Predictions of different mass formulas for the location of the neutron
dripline are compared with those from the present calculation. The implications
of the new mass formula for r-process nucleosynthesis are discussed. It is
found that though the neutron drip line obtained from this formula differs
substantially from other formulas, the r-process abundance upto mass 200 are
unlikely to be significantly different. The errors inherent in the mass formula
are found to play an insignificant role beyond mass A = 80.
