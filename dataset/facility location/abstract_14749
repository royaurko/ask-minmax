In the last 10 years 20 millisecond pulsars have been discovered in the
globular cluster 47 Tucanae. Hitherto, only 3 of these had published timing
solutions. Here we improve upon these 3 and present 12 new solutions. These
measurements can be used to determine a variety of physical properties of the
pulsars and of the cluster. The 15 pulsars have positions determined with
typical uncertianties of only a few milliarcsec and they are all located within
1.2 arcmin of the cluster centre. We have also measured the proper motions of 5
of the pulsars, which are consistent with the proper motion of 47 Tuc based on
Hipparcos data. The period derivatives measured for many of the pulsars are
dominated by the dynamical effects of the cluster gravitational field, and are
used to constrain the surface mass density of the cluster. All pulsars have
characteristic ages T > 170 Myr and magnetic fields B < 2.4e9 Gauss, and the
average T > 1 Gyr. We have measured the rate of advance of periastron for the
binary pulsar J0024-7204H, implying a total system mass 1.4+-0.8 solar masses.
