Hawking effect of Dirac particles in a variable-mass Kerr space-time is
investigated by using method of the generalized tortoise coordinate
transformation. The location and the temperature of event horizon of the
non-stationary Kerr black hole are derived. It is shown that the temperature
and the shape of event horizon depend not only on the time but also on the
polar angle. However, our results demonstrate that the Fermi-Dirac spectrum
displays a new spin-rotation effect which is absent from that of Bose-Einstein
distribution.
