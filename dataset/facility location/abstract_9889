The incommensurate magnetic response of the normal-state cuprate perovskites
is interpreted based on Mori's memory function approach and the t-J model of
Cu-O planes. In agreement with experiment the calculated dispersion of the
susceptibility maxima has the shape of two parabolas with upward and downward
branches which converge at the antiferromagnetic wave vector. The maxima are
located at $({1/2},{1/2}\pm\delta)$, $({1/2}\pm\delta,{1/2})$ and at
$({1/2}\pm\delta,{1/2}\pm\delta)$, $({1/2}\pm\delta,{1/2}\mp\delta)$ in the
lower and upper parabolas, respectively. The upper parabola reflects the
dispersion of magnetic excitations of the localized Cu spins, while the lower
parabola arises due to a dip in the spin-excitation damping at the
antiferromagnetic wave vector. For moderate doping this dip stems from the
weakness of the interaction between the spin excitations and holes near the hot
spots.
