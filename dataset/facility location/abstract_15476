We present $V,I$ light curves for 12 variable stars identified in the newly
discovered satellite of the Milky Way in the Bootes constellation (Belokurov et
al. 2006).Our sample includes 11 RR Lyrae stars (5 first overtone, 5
fundamental mode and 1 double mode pulsator),and one long period variable close
to the galaxy red giant branch tip. The RR Lyrae stars trace very well the
average $V$ luminosity of the galaxy horizontal branch, leading to a true
distance modulus for the galaxy of $\mu_0$=19.11 $\pm$ 0.08 mag for an assumed
metal abundance of [Fe/H]=-2.5 (Monoz et al. 2006), and for $E(B-V)$=0.02 mag.
Average periods are <Pab>=0.69 d and <Pc>=0.37 d for {\it ab-} and {\it c-}
type RR Lyrae stars, respectively, making of Bootes the second pure Oosterhoff
type II (OoII) dSph after Ursa Minor. The location of the double mode RR Lyrae
(RRd) in the Petersen diagram is consistent with RRd stars in OoII clusters,
and corresponds to an intrinsic luminosity of $log L/logL\odot$=1.72 (for
Z=10$^{-4}$ and M=0.80 M$\odot$) according to Bono et al. (1996) pulsation
models.
