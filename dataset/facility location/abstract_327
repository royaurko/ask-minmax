The next generation of accelerators for MegaWatt proton, electron and
heavy-ion beams puts unprecedented requirements on the accuracy of particle
production predictions, the capability and reliability of the codes used in
planning new accelerator facilities and experiments, the design of machine,
target and collimation systems, detectors and radiation shielding and
minimization of their impact on environment. Recent advances in code
developments are described for the critical modules related to these
challenges. Examples are given for the most demanding areas: targets,
collimators, beam absorbers, radiation shielding, induced radioactivity and
radiation damage.
