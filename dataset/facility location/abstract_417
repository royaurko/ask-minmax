The Neutron Residual Stress Facility (NRSF) at ORNL's High Flux Isotope
Reactor (HFIR) is being significantly upgraded in conjunction with the upgrade
of the HFIR and associated neutron scattering facilities. We have rewritten the
LabVIEW-based data acquisition and control software for the NRSF to provide
much greater flexibility in operation of the new equipment and to allow remote
control over the Internet. The user interface is dynamically adapted to the
specifics of each instrument based on instrument configuration information
contained in external configuration files. Internet-based remote control is
available via three methods. First, a server at the instrument provides local
control and accepts connections via an IP socket. Second, instrument status is
available on the Web using LabVIEW's built-in web server that will transmit
JPEG images of instrument front panels. Third, complete remote control of the
data acquisition system is also available to the instrument scientist via
Timbuktu Pro, a commercial remote control program. We also support remote
scientific collaboration, not just remote instrument control. We have
participated in the development of multiple Electronic Notebooks, implemented
as a collection of web pages that are created and viewed through a web browser.
Access to the notebooks is controlled via X.509 certificates. We operate a
Certificate Authority and issue our own certificates. All access control and
session management is performed on the server via Java servlets.
