Quantitative understanding of human behaviors provides elementary
comprehension of the complexity of many human-initiated systems. In this paper,
we investigate the behavior of people on the $BBS$ forum by the statistical
analysis of the amounts of view and reply of posts. According to our
statistics, we find that the amounts of view and reply of posts follow the
power law distributions with different power exponent. Furthermore, we discover
that the amounts of view and reply of posts have nonlinear relationship. They
are related by power function and show us straight line in log-log plot. Based
on the estimation of slope and intercept of the line, we can characterize the
behaviors quantitatively and know that people of Chinese forum and those of
foreign forum have different preference towards replying to and viewing the
posts. At last, we analyze the burstiness and memory in replying time series.
They show some universal properties among different forum. All of them locate
themselves in the high-$B$, low-$M$ region.
