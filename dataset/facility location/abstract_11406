Completed in May 2008, the ANTARES neutrino telescope is located in the
Mediterranean Sea, 40 km off the coast of Toulon, at a depth of about 2500 m.
Consisting of 12 detector lines housing nearly 900 optical modules, the ANTARES
telescope is currently the largest neutrino detector in the northern
hemisphere. Utilising the Mediterranean Sea as a detecting medium, the
detection principle of ANTARES relies on the observation of Cherenkov photons
emitted by charged relativistic leptons, produced through neutrino interactions
with the surrounding water and seabed, using a 3 dimensional lattice of
photomultiplier tubes. In this paper we review the current status of the
ANTARES experiment, highlighting some of the results from it's first year of
full operation.
