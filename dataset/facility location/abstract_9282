Spherically symmetric hydrodynamical outflows accelerated thermally in the
vicinity of a compact object are studied by generalizing an equation of state
with a variable effective polytropic index, appropriate to describe
relativistic temperatures close to the central object and nonrelativistic ones
further away. Relativistic effects introduced by the Schwarzschild metric and
the presence of relativistic temperatures in the corona are compared with
previous results for a constant effective polytropic index and also with
results of the classical wind theory. By a parametric study of the polytropic
index and the location of the sonic transition it is found that space time
curvature and relativistic temperatures tend to increase the efficiency of
thermal driving in accelerating the outflow. Thus conversely to the classical
Parker wind, the outflow is accelerated even for polytropic indices higher than
3/2. The results of this simple but fully relativistic extension of the
polytropic equation of state may be useful in simulations of outflows from hot
coronae in black hole magnetospheres.
