We have investigated the effect of pressure on the electronic, magnetic, and
structural properties on a single crystal of conducting, ferromagnet
(T$_{C}$=157K) La$_{0.82}$Sr$_{0.18}$CoO$_{3}$ located near the boundary of the
metal-insulator transition. Contrary to the results reported on related
systems, we find a transition from the conducting state to an insulating state
and a decrease of T$_{C}$ with increasing pressure while the lattice structure
remains unchanged. We show that this unusual behavior is driven by a gradual
change of the spin state of Co$^{3+}$ ions from magnetic intermediate-spin
(t$_{2g}^5$e$_{g}^{1}$; S=1) to a nonmagnetic low-spin (t$_{2g}^6$e$_{g}^{0}$;
S=0) state.
