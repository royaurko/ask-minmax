Circumbinary planetary systems recently discovered by Kepler represent an
important testbed for planet formation theories. Planetesimal growth in disks
around binaries has been expected to be inhibited interior to ~10 AU by secular
excitation of high relative velocities between planetesimals, leading to their
collisional destruction (rather than agglomeration). Here we show that gravity
of the gaseous circumbinary disk in which planets form drives fast precession
of both the planetesimal and binary orbits, resulting in strong suppression of
planetesimal eccentricities beyond 2-3 AU and making possible growth of 1-100
km objects in this region. The precise location of the boundary of
accretion-friendly region depends on the size of the inner disk cavity cleared
by the binary torques and on the disk mass (even 0.01 M_Sun disk strongly
suppresses planetesimal excitation), among other things. Precession of the
orbit of the central binary, enhanced by the mass concentration naturally
present at the inner edge of a circumbinary disk, plays key role in this
suppression, which is a feature specific to the circumbinary planet formation.
