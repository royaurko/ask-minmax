We report on the discovery of two spiral galaxies located behind the southern
Milky Way, within the least explored region of the Great Attractor. They lie at
317, -0.5 deg galactic, where obscuration from Milky Way stars and dust exceeds
13 to 15 mag of visual extinction. The galaxies were the most prominent of a
set identified using mid-infrared images of the low-latitude (|b| < 1 deg)
Spitzer Legacy program GLIMPSE. Follow-up HI radio observations reveal that
both galaxies have redshifts that place them squarely in the Norma Wall of
galaxies, which appears to extend diagonally across the Galactic Plane from
Norma in the south to Centaurus & Vela in the north. We report on the
near-infrared, mid-infrared and radio properties of these newly discovered
galaxies, and discuss their context in the larger view of the Great Attractor.
The work presented here demonstrates that mid-infrared surveys open up a new
window to study galaxies in the Zone of Avoidance.
