This article extends the work of Bernabeu and Espinoza by examining the
CP-violation reach of a $^{150}$Dy electron capture beam through the variation
of the two Lorentz boosts, the number of useful electron capture decays, the
relative run time of each boost and the number of atmospheric backgrounds. The
neutrinos are assumed to be sourced at CERN with an upgraded SPS and are
directed towards a 440 kton Water Cerenkov detector located at the Canfranc
laboratory. Two large `CP-coverage' choices for the boost pairings are found; a
$\delta$-symmetrical coverage for $(\gamma_{1}, \gamma_{2})$ = (280, 160) and
an $\delta$-asymmetric coverage for $(\gamma_{1}, \gamma_{2})$ = (440,150).
With a nominal useful decay rate of $N_{\rm ions} = 10^{18}$ ions per year, the
$\delta$-symmetric setup can rule out CP-conservation down to
$\sin^{2}2\theta_{13} = 3\cdot 10^{-4}$. To reach $\sin^{2}2\theta_{13} =
1\cdot 10^{-3}$ for both $\delta < 0$ and $\delta > 0$ requires a useful decay
rate of $N_{\rm ions} = 6\cdot 10^{17}$ ions per year.
