We determine the elements of the leptonic mixing matrix, without assuming
unitarity, combining data from neutrino oscillation experiments and weak
decays. To that end, we first develop a formalism for studying neutrino
oscillations in vacuum and matter when the leptonic mixing matrix is not
unitary. To be conservative, only three light neutrino species are considered,
whose propagation is generically affected by non-unitary effects. Precision
improvements within future facilities are discussed as well.
