In this chapter a general mathematical model of Optical Coherence Tomography
(OCT) is presented on the basis of the electromagnetic theory. OCT produces
high resolution images of the inner structure of biological tissues. Images are
obtained by measuring the time delay and the intensity of the backscattered
light from the sample considering also the coherence properties of light. The
scattering problem is considered for a weakly scattering medium located far
enough from the detector. The inverse problem is to reconstruct the
susceptibility of the medium given the measurements for different positions of
the mirror. Different approaches are addressed depending on the different
assumptions made about the optical properties of the sample. This procedure is
applied to a full field OCT system and an extension to standard (time and
frequency domain) OCT is briefly presented.
