A cross slotted electronic band gap (EBG) with stacked rectangular patches
shorted with a shorting pin is proposed in this paper. The study is being done
on how the various parameters are varied by changing the probe feed location.
The design is constructed by using stacking of patches, shorting pin and cross
slotted EBG to form an optimized antenna design with antenna efficiency of
approximately 99.06%. The radiation patterns are given at 2.586 GHz which can
be used for wireless communications.
