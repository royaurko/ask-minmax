The contribution from the residuals of the foreground can have a significant
impact on the temperature maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).
Mostly, the focus has been on the galactic plane, when foreground cleaning has
taken place. However, in this paper, we will investigate the possible
foreground contamination, from sources outside the galactic plane in the CMB
maps. We will analyze the correlation between the Faraday rotation map and the
CMB temperature map. The Faraday rotation map is dependent on the galactic
magnetic field, as well as the thermal electron density, and both may
contribute to the CMB temperature. We find that the standard deviation for the
mean cross correlation deviate from that of simulations at the 99.9% level.
Additionally, a comparison between the CMB temperature extrema and the extremum
points of the Faraday rotation is also performed, showing a general overlap
between the two. Also we find that the CMB Cold Spot is located at an area of
strong negative cross correlation, meaning that it may be explained by a
galactic origin. Further, we investigate nearby supernova remnants in the
galaxy, traced by the galactic radio loops. These super nova remnants are
located at high and low galactic latitude, and thus well outside the galactic
plane. We find some correlation between the Faraday Rotation and the CMB
temperature, at select radio loops. This indicate, that the galactic
foregrounds may affect the CMB, at high galactic latitudes
