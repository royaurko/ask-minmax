We study various time series of surface layer wind velocity at different
locations and provide evidences for the intermittent nature of the wind
fluctuations in mesoscale range. By means of the magnitude covariance analysis,
which is shown to be a more efficient tool to study intermittency than
classical scaling analysis, we find that all wind series exhibit similar
features than those observed for laboratory turbulence. Our findings suggest
the existence of a "universal" cascade mechanism associated with the energy
transfer between synoptic motions and turbulent microscales in the atmospheric
boundary layer.
