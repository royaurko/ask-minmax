Virtual Compton Scattering is studied at the Thomas Jefferson National
Accelerator Facility at low Center-of-Mass energies, below pion threshold.
Following the Low Energy Theorem for the $ ep \to ep \gamma$ process, we obtain
values for the two structure functions Pll-Ptt/epsilon and Plt at four-momentum
transfer squared Q2=0.92 and 1.76 GeV2.
