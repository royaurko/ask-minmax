Nuclear alpha-clustering has been the subject of intense study since the
advent of heavy-ion accelerators. Looking back for more than 40 years we are
able today to see the connection between quasimolecular resonances in heavy-ion
collisions and extremely deformed states in light nuclei. For example
superdeformed bands have been recently discovered in light N=Z nuclei such as
$^{36}$Ar, $^{40}$Ca, $^{48}$Cr, and $^{56}$Ni by $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy.
The search for strongly deformed shapes in N=Z nuclei is also the domain of
charged-particle spectroscopy, and our experimental group at IReS Strasbourg
has studied a number of these nuclei with the charged particle multidetector
array {\sc Icare} at the {\sc Vivitron} Tandem facility in a systematical
manner. Recently the search for $\gamma$-decays in $^{24}$Mg has been
undertaken in a range of excitation energies where previously nuclear molecular
resonances were found in $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C collisions. The breakup reaction
$^{24}$Mg$+^{12}$C has been investigated at E$_{lab}$($^{24}$Mg) = 130 MeV, an
energy which corresponds to the appropriate excitation energy in $^{24}$Mg for
which the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C resonance could be related to the breakup
resonance. Very exclusive data were collected with the Binary Reaction
Spectrometer in coincidence with {\sc Euroball IV} installed at the {\sc
Vivitron}.
