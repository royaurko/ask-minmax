Using HST and the WFPC2 we have acquired very deep V- and I-band photometry
of stars in NGC 2420 and NGC 2477 to study cluster luminosity functions at
approximately solar metallicity. We have determined these cluster luminosity
functions down to $M_I$ = 10.5 (0.2 M$_{\odot}$) and find that the luminosity
function of NGC 2420 turns over at $M_I$ $\approx$ 9.0, and possibly stops
altogether by $M_I$ $\approx$ 9.5. The luminosity function of NGC 2477 may
flatten at $M_I$ $\geq$ 9.5. We compare our open cluster luminosity functions
to the solar neighborhood field star luminosity function of Kroupa, Tout \&
Gilmore (1993) and the four published HST globular cluster luminosity
functions: $\omega$ Cen (Elson {\it et al.}\ 1995), 47 Tuc (De Marchi \&
Paresce 1995b), M 15 (De Marchi \& Paresce 1995a), and NGC 6397 (Paresce, De
Marchi \& Romaniello 1995). We find a smooth relation between the location of
the luminosity function turn-over and the metallicity for all these low mass
star samples which matches the expected $M_I$ versus [Fe/H] trend for a model
star of $\approx$ 0.27 M$_{\odot}$ (Saumon 1995; Alexander {\it et al.}\ 1996).
We interpret this smooth and systematic behavior in the cluster luminosity
functions as strong evidence in favor of an invariant initial mass function and
a metallicity-dependent mass-luminosity relation.
