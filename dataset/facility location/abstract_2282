Compton scattering provides one of the most promising scheme to obtain
polarized positrons for the next generation of $e^-$ -- $e^+$ colliders.
Moreover it is an attractive method to produce monochromatic high energy
polarized gammas for nuclear applications and X-rays for compact light sources.
In this framework a four-mirror Fabry-P\'erot cavity has been installed at the
Accelerator Test Facility (ATF - KEK, Tsukuba, Japan) and is used to produce an
intense flux of polarized gamma rays by Compton scattering
\cite{ipac-mightylaser}. For electrons at the ATF energy (1.28 GeV) Compton
scattering may result in a shorter lifetime due to the limited bucket
acceptance. We have implemented the effect of Compton scattering on a 2D
tracking code with a Monte-Carlo method. This code has been used to study the
longitudinal dynamics of the electron beam at the ATF damping ring, in
particular the evolution of the energy spread and the bunch length under
Compton scattering. The results obtained are presented and discussed. Possible
methods to observe the effect of Compton scattering on the ATF beam are
proposed.
