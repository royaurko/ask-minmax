In this work we present the results of full Geant4 and FLUKA simulations and
comparison with dosimetry data of an electron LINAC of St. Maria Hospital
located in Terni, Italy. The facility is being used primarily for radiotherapy
and the goal of present study is the detailed investigation of electron beam
parameters to evaluate the possibility to use the e-LINAC (during time slots
when it is not used for radiotherapy) to test the performance of detector
systems in particular those designed to operate in space. The critical beam
parameters are electron energy, profile and flux available at the surface of
device to be tested. The present work aims to extract these parameters from
dosimetry calibration data available at the e-LINAC. The electron energy ranges
is from 4 MeV to 20 MeV. The dose measurements have been performed by using an
Advanced Markus Chamber which has a small sensitive volume.
