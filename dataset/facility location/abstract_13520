In this paper we discuss the formation of peculiar narrow emission line
components observed in the spectra of a few novae. We aim to identify the
physical source responsible for transient narrow components that present
orbital radial velocity modulations, first observed in the post-outburst
recombination lines of Nova U Sco 2010. A search for candidate novae showing
similar narrow components is presented. Photoionization simulations indicate
that the forming region cannot be restricted to the primary Roche Lobe, but
could be located around the outer Lagrangian point L3. Further analysis
disfavors an origin at the accretion disk and the companion star. In addition,
we analyze possible correlations between the presence of the narrow components,
the basic nova parameters and the spectral classification in the initial
permitted phase.
