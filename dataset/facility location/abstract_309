In an experiment at the Riga sodium dynamo facility, a slowly growing
magnetic field eigenmode has been detected over a period of about 15 seconds.
For a slightly decreased propeller rotation rate, additional measurements
showed a slow decay of this mode. The measured results correspond satisfactory
with numerical predictions for the growth rates and frequencies.
