Fighting criminal activities in our modern societies required the engagement
of intelligent information systems that can analyze crime data geographically
and enable new concepts to be deduced from it. These information systems should
be able to create visualization of such data as well as have the capability of
giving new incite of information, if data is updated whilst maintaining the
previously predicted patterns. This paper proposed the use of Formal Concept
Analysis, or Galois Lattices, a data analysis technique grounded on Lattice
Theory and Propositional Calculus, for the visualization and analysis of crime
data. This method considered the set of common and distinct attributes of
crimes in such a way that categorization are done based on related crime types,
geographical locations and the persons involved.
