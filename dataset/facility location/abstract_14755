We have studied the Globular Cluster System of the merger galaxy NGC 1316 in
Fornax, using CCD BVI photometry. A clear bimodality is not detected from the
broadband colours. However, dividing the sample into red (presumably metal-
rich) and blue (metal-poor) subpopulations at B-I=1.75, we find that they
follow strikingly different angular distributions. The red clusters show a
strong correlation with the galaxy elongation, but the blue ones are circularly
distributed. No systematic difference is seen in their radial profile and both
are equally concentrated.
  We derive an astonishingly low Specific Frequency for NGC 1316 of only
Sn=0.9, which confirms with a larger field a previous finding by Grillmair et
al. (1999). Assuming a "normal" Sn of ~4 for early-type galaxies, we use
stellar population synthesis models to estimate in 2 Gyr the age of this
galaxy, if an intermediate-age population were to explain the low Sn we
observe. This value agrees with the luminosity-weighted mean age of NGC 1316
derived by Kuntschner & Davies (1998) and Mackie & Fabbiano (1998).
  By fitting t5 functions to the Globular Cluster Luminosity Function (GCLF),
we derived the following turnover magnitudes: B=24.69 +/- 0.15, V=23.87 +/-
0.20 and I=22.72 +/- 0.14. They confirm that NGC 1316, in spite of its outlying
location, is at the same distance as the core of the Fornax cluster.
