The real, nonsingular elliptic solutions of the Korteweg-deVries equation are
studied through the time dynamics of their poles in the complex plane. The
dynamics of these poles is governed by a dynamical system with a constraint.
This constraint is shown to be solvable for any finite number of poles located
in the fundamental domain of the elliptic function, often in many different
ways. Special consideration is given to those elliptic solutions that have a
real nonsingular soliton limit.
