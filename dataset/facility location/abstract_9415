The first CCD UBV(RI) photometric study in the area of the doubtful open
cluster NGC 2129 is presented. Photometry of a field offset 15 arcmin northward
is also provided, to probe the Galactic disk population toward the cluster.
Using star counts, proper motions from the UCAC2 catalog, colour-magnitude and
colour-colour diagrams we demonstrate that NGC 2129 is a young open cluster.
The cluster radius is 2.5 arcmin, and across this region we find evidence of
significant differential reddening, although the reddening law seems to be
normal toward its direction. Updated estimates of the cluster fundamental
parameters are provided. The mean reddening is found to be E(B-V)=0.80$\pm$0.08
and the distance modulus is $(m-M)_o$= 11.70$\pm0.30$. Hence, NGC 2129 is
located at 2.2$\pm$0.2 kpc from the Sun inside the Local spiral arm. The age
derived from 37 photometrically selected members is estimated to be
approximately 10 million years. These stars are used to provide new estimates
of the cluster absolute proper motion components.
