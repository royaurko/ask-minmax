We consider the critical spread-out contact process in Z^d with d\ge1, whose
infection range is denoted by L\ge1. In this paper, we investigate the r-point
function \tau_{\vec t}^{(r)}(\vec x) for r\ge3, which is the probability that,
for all i=1,...,r-1, the individual located at x_i\in Z^d is infected at time
t_i by the individual at the origin o\in Z^d at time 0. Together with the
results of the 2-point function in [van der Hofstad and Sakai, Electron. J.
Probab. 9 (2004), 710-769; arXiv:math/0402049], on which our proofs crucially
rely, we prove that the r-point functions converge to the moment measures of
the canonical measure of super-Brownian motion above the upper-critical
dimension 4. We also prove partial results for d\le4 in a local mean-field
setting.
