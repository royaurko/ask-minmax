We present the first results of a multi-wavelength survey, incoporating
Herschel-SPIRE, Spitzer, GALEX and ATCA observations, of a 1 deg x 1 deg field
centred on Centaurus A. As well as detecting the inner lobes of the active
galactic nucleus (AGN) jet and counterjet, we have found two clouds, bright at
sub-mm wavelengths, ~15 kpc from the centre of Cen A that are co-aligned with
the jets. Flux measurements at Herschel wavelengths have proved vital in
constraining fits to the Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs). The clouds are
well fit by a single-temperature, modified blackbody spectrum (beta=2)
indicating that we are looking at two cold dust clouds on the outskirts of Cen
A. The temperature and masses of the clouds are: T_{north} = 12.6^{+1.1}_{-1.2}
K, T_{south} = 15.1^{+1.7}_{-1.6} K; log(M_{north} / M_o) = 5.8^{+0.2}_{-0.2},
log(M_{south} / M_o) = 5.6^{+0.2}_{-0.2} and the gas-dust ratio for both clouds
is ~100. The measured values for the northern dust cloud are consistent with
previous measurements from ISO while the southern cloud is a new sub-mm
detection. The two dust clouds are located at the termini of the partial HI
ring that surrounds Cen A which is also where the gas column density peaks...
