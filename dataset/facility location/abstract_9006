We conducted a study of the environment around the supernova remnant CTB109.
We found that the SNR is part of a large complex of HII regions extending over
an area of 400 pc along the Galactic plane at a distance of about 3 kpc at the
closer edge of the Perseus spiral arm. At this distance CTB109 has a diameter
of about 24 pc. We demonstrated that including spiral shocks in the distance
estimation is an ultimate requirement to determine reliable distances to
objects located in the Perseus arm. The most likely explanation for the high
concentration of HII regions and SNRs is that the star formation in this part
of the Perseus arm is triggered by the spiral shock.
