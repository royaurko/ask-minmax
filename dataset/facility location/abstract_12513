In the paper we propose an universal bridge functional for the closure of the
Ornstein-Zernike (OZ) equation for the case of infinitely diluted solutions of
Lennard-Jones shperes of different size in the Lennard-Jones fluid. Bridge
functional is paprameterized using the data of the Molecular Dynamics (MD)
simulations. We show that for all investigated systems the bridge functional
can be efficiently papameterized with the exponential function which depends
only on the ratio of sizes of the solute and solvent atoms. To check the
parameterization we solve the OZ equation with the closure which includes the
parametrized functional and with the closure without the bridge functional
(Hyper-netted chain closure). We show that introducing the bridge functional
allows to obtain radial distribution functions (RDFs), which are close to the
MD results and essentially improve predictions of the location and height of
the first peak of the RDF.
