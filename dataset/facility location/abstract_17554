The Luminous Blue Variable stars exhibit behavior ranging from light curve
`microvariations' on timescales of tens of days, to `outbursts' accompanied by
mass loss of up to 10e-03 solar masses per year, occurring decades apart, to
`giant eruptions' such as seen in Eta Carinae ejecting one or more solar masses
and recurring on timescales of centuries. Here we review the work of the Los
Alamos group since 1993 to investigate pulsations and instabilities in massive
stars using linear pulsation models and non-linear hydrodynamic models. The
models predict pulsational variability that may be associated with the
microvariations. Using a nonlinear pulsation hydrodynamics code with a
time-dependent convection treatment, we show that, in some circumstances, the
Eddington limit is exceeded periodically in the pulsation driving region of the
stellar envelope, accelerating the outer layers, and perhaps initiating mass
loss or LBV outbursts. We discuss how pulsations and mass loss may be
responsible for the location of the Humphreys-Davidson Limit in the H-R
diagram. The `giant eruptions', however, must involve much deeper regions in
the stellar core to cause such large amounts of mass to be ejected. We review
and suggest some possible explanations, including mixing from gravity modes,
secular instabilities, the epsilon mechanism, or the SASI instability as
proposed for Type II supernovae. We outline future work and required stellar
modeling capabilities to investigate these possibilities.
