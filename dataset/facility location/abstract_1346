This paper addresses deep-water gravity waves of finite amplitude generated
by an initial disturbance to the water. It is assumed that the horizontal
dimensions of the initially disturbed body of the water are much larger than
the magnitude of the free surface displacement in the origin of the waves.
Initially the free surface has not yet been displaced from its equilibrium
position, but the velocity field has already become different from zero. This
means that the water at rest initially is set in motion suddenly by an impulse.
Duration of formation of the wave origin and the maximum water elevation in the
origin are estimated using the arrival times of the waves and the maximum
wave-heights at certain locations obtained from gauge records at the locations,
and the distances between the centre of the origin and each of the locations.
For points situated at a long distance from the wave origin, forecast is made
for the travel time and wave height at the points. The forecast is based on the
data recorded by the gauges at the locations.
