Localization based on received signal strength indication (RSSI) is a low
cost and low complexity technology, and it is widely applied in distance-based
localization of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Error of existed localization
technologies is significant. This paper presents the N-times trilateral
centroid weighted localization algorithm (NTCWLA), which can reduce the error
considerably. Considering the instability of RSSI, we use the weighted average
of many RSSIs as current RSSI. To improve the accuracy we select a number of
(no less than three) reliable beacon nodes to increase the localization times.
Then we calculate the distances between reliable beacon nodes and the mobile
node using an empirical formula. The mobile node is located N times using the
trilateral centroid algorithm. Finally, we take the weighted average of the
filtered reference coordinates as the mobile node's coordinates. We conduct
experiments with the STM32W108 chip which supports IEEE 802.15.4. The results
show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the trilateral centroid
algorithm.
