We have used the publicly released Dark Energy Survey data to hunt for new
satellites of the Milky Way in the Southern hemisphere. Our search yielded a
large number of promising candidates. In this paper, we announce the discovery
of 9 new unambiguous ultra-faint objects, whose authenticity can be established
with the DES data alone. Based on the morphological properties, three of the
new satellites are dwarf galaxies, one of which is located at the very
outskirts of the Milky Way, at a distance of 380 kpc. The remaining 6 objects
have sizes and luminosities comparable to the Segue~1 satellite and can not be
classified straightforwardly without follow-up spectroscopic observations. The
satellites we have discovered cluster around the LMC and the SMC. We show that
such spatial distribution is unlikely under the assumption of isotropy, and,
therefore, conclude that at least some of the new satellites must have been
associated with the Magellanic Clouds in the past.
