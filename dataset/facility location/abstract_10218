We demonstrate on simple examples that oscillatory behaviour of moments of
multiplicity distributions P(n) observed in e^+e^- annihilations, in hadronic
pp collisions and in collisions on nuclei, p+A, is to a large extend caused
by the experimental artifact of measuring only limited range of P(n). In
particular we show that by applying a suitable universal cutt-off procedure to
the measured P(n) one gets for reactions mentioned before oscillations of
similar magnitude. The location of zeros of oscillations as a function of the
rank of moments and their shapes remain, however, distinctively different for
different types of reactions considered. This applies to some extend also to
collisions of nuclei, which otherwise follow their own pattern of behaviour.
