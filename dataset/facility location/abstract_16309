We have simulated the evolution of sexually reproducing populations composed
of individuals represented by diploid genomes. A series of eight bits formed an
allele occupying one of 128 loci of one haploid genome (chromosome). The
environment required a specific activity of each locus, this being the sum of
the activities of both alleles located at the corresponding loci on two
chromosomes. This activity is represented by the number of bits set to zero. In
a constant environment the best fitted individuals were homozygous with
alleles' activities corresponding to half of the environment requirement for a
locus (in diploid genome two alleles at corresponding loci produced a proper
activity). Changing the environment under a relatively low recombination rate
promotes generation of more polymorphic alleles. In the heterozygous loci,
alleles of different activities complement each other fulfilling the
environment requirements. Nevertheless, the genetic pool of populations evolves
in the direction of a very restricted number of complementing haplotypes and a
fast changing environment kills the population. If simulations start with all
loci heterozygous, they stay heterozygous for a long time.
