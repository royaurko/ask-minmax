The RApid Temporal Survey (RATS) is a survey to detect objects whose optical
intensity varies on timescales of less than ~70 min. In our pilot dataset taken
with the INT and the Wide Field Camera in Nov 2003 we discovered nearly 50 new
variable objects. Many of these varied on timescales much longer than 1 hr.
However, only 4 objects showed a modulation on a timescale of 1 hour or less.
This paper presents followup optical photometry and spectroscopy of these 4
objects. We find that RAT J0455+1305 is a pulsating (on a period of 374 sec)
subdwarf B (sdB) star of the EC 14026 type. We have modelled its spectrum and
determine Teff = 29,200+/- 1900K and log g = 5.2+/-0.3 which locates it on the
cool edge of the EC 14026 instability strip. It has a modulation amplitude
which is one of the highest of any known EC 14026 star. Based on their spectra,
photometric variability and their infra-red colours, we find that RAT
J0449+1756, RAT J0455+1254 and RAT J0807+1510 are likely to be SX Phe stars -
dwarf Delta Sct stars. Our results show that our observing strategy is a good
method for finding rare pulsating stars.
