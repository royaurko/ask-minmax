We report detection of strong circularly polarized emission from the
transient bursting source GCRT J1745-3009 based on new analysis of 325 MHz GMRT
observations conducted on 28 September 2003. We place 8 Solar radius as the
upper limit on the size of the emission region. The implied high brightness
temperature required for an object beyond 1 pc and the high fraction of
circular polarization firmly establish the emission as coherent. Electron
cyclotron or plasma emission from a highly subsolar magnetically dominated
dwarf located less than 4 kpc away could have given rise to the GCRT radio
emission.
