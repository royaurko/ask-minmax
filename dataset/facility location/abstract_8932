Maps of the 450 micron and 850 micron dust continuum emission from three
star-forming condensations within the Lynds 1630 molecular cloud, made with the
SCUBA bolometer array, reveal the presence of four new submillimetre sources,
each of a few solar masses, two of which are probably Class I, two Class 0, as
well as several sources whose existence was previously known. The sources are
located in filaments and appear elongated when observed at 450 microns. They
likely have dust temperatures in the range 10 to 20 K, in good agreement with
previous ammonia temperature estimates. Attempts to fit their structures with
power-law and Gaussian density distributions suggest that the central
distribution is flatter than expected for a simple singular isothermal sphere.
  Although the statistics are poor, our results suggest that the ratio of
`protostellar core' mass to total virial mass may be similar for both large and
small condensations.
