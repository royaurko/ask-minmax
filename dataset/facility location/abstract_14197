The behavior of annealed branched polymers near adsorbing surfaces plays a
fundamental role in many biological and industrial processes. Most importantly
single stranded RNA in solution tends to fold up and self-bind to form a highly
branched structure. Using a mean field theory, we both perturbatively and
numerically examine the adsorption of branched polymers on surfaces of several
different geometries in a good solvent. Independent of the geometry of the
wall, we observe that as branching density increases, surface tension
decreases. However, we find a coupling between the branching density and
curvature in that a further lowering of surface tension occurs when the wall
curves towards the polymer, but the amount of lowering of surface tension
decreases when the wall curves away from the polymer. We find that for branched
polymers confined into spherical cavities, most of branch-points are located in
the vicinity of the interior wall and the surface tension is minimized for a
critical cavity radius. For branch polymers next to sinusoidal surfaces, we
find that branch-points accumulate at the valleys while end-points on the
peaks.
