We present an analysis of interacting E/S0 galaxies location on the
Fundamental Plane. Using the NEMO package, we performed N-body simulations of
close encounters and mergers between two spherical galaxies. We followed how
structural and dynamical parameters (central density, half-mass radius and
velocity dispersion)of galaxies are changed during the encounter. We analysed
the dependence of these changes on initial mass concentration and presence of
dark halo. The results of our simulations are used to discuss the Fundamental
Plane for interacting early-type galaxies.
