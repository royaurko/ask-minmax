The path-spin entangled state of a single spin-1/2 particle is considered
which is generated by using a beam-spitter and a spin-flipper. Using this
hybrid entanglement at the level of a single particle as a resource, we
formulate a protocol for transferring of the state of an unknown qubit to a
distant location. Our scheme is implemented by a sequence of unitary operations
along with suitable spin-measurements, as well as by using classical
communication between the two spatially separated parties. This protocol, thus,
demonstrates the possibility of using intraparticle entanglement as a physical
resource for performing information theoretic tasks.
