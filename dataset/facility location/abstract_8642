We estimate the contribution of extragalactic radio sources to fluctuations
in sky temperature over the range of frequencies (10-300 GHz) used for Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy measurements. CMB anisotropy observations
at high resolution and low frequencies are especially sensitive to this
foreground. We have compiled a catalog of 2207 bright radio sources, including
758 sources with flux measurements at 90 GHz. We develop a method to
extrapolate the source spectra and predict skymaps of extragalactic radio
sources at instrument resolutions of 10 arcmin to 10 degrees FWHM. Our results
indicate that the brightest sources will dominate microwave anisotropy for a
wide range of resolutions and frequencies. Our skymaps predict the location and
flux of the brightest radio sources at each frequency, making it
straightforward to develop a template for masking the pixels containing them.
This masking should be sufficient to protect high resolution CMB anisotropy
observations from unacceptable radio source confusion.
