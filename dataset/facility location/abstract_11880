The glass transition, extensively studied in dense fluids, polymers, or
colloids, corresponds to a dramatic evolution of equilibrium transport
coefficients upon a modest change of control parameter, like temperature or
pressure. A similar phenomenology is found in many systems evolving far from
equilibrium, such as driven granular media, active and living matter. While
many theories compete to describe the glass transition at thermal equilibrium,
very little is understood far from equilibrium. Here, we solve the dynamics of
a specific, yet representative, class of glass models in the presence of
nonthermal driving forces and energy dissipation, and show that a dynamic
arrest can take place in these nonequilibrium conditions. While the location of
the transition depends on the specifics of the driving mechanisms, important
features of the glassy dynamics are insensitive to details, suggesting that an
`effective' thermal dynamics generically emerges at long time scales in
nonequilibrium systems close to dynamic arrest.
