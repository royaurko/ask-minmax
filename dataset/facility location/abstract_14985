We present results from our Parkes Multibeam HI survey of 3 loose groups of
galaxies that are analogous to the Local Group. This is a survey of groups
containing only spiral galaxies with mean separations of a few hundred kpc, and
total areas of approximately 1 sq. Mpc; groups similar to our own Local Group.
We present a census of the HI-rich objects in these groups down to an M(HI),
1-sigma sensitivity ~7x10^5 M(sun), as well as the detailed properties of these
detections from follow-up Compact Array observations. We found 7 new HI-rich
members in the 3 groups, all of which have stellar counterparts and are,
therefore, typical dwarf galaxies. The ratio of low-mass to high-mass gas-rich
galaxies in these groups is less than in the Local Group meaning that the
``missing satellite'' problem is not unique. No high-velocity cloud analogs
were found in any of the groups. If HVCs in these groups are the same as in the
Local Group, this implies that HVCs must be located within ~300-400 kpc of the
Milky Way.
