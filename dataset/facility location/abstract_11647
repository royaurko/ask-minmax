Given an observed gravitational lens mirage produced by a foreground
deflector (cf. galaxy, quasar, cluster,...), it is possible via numerical lens
inversion to retrieve the real source image, taking full advantage of the
magnifying power of the cosmic lens. This has been achieved in the past for
several remarkable gravitational lens systems. Instead, we propose here to
invert an observed multiply imaged source directly at the telescope using an
ad-hoc optical instrument which is described in the present paper. Compared to
the previous method, this should allow one to detect fainter source features as
well as to use such an optimal gravitational lens telescope to explore even
fainter objects located behind and near the lens. Laboratory and numerical
experiments illustrate this new approach.
