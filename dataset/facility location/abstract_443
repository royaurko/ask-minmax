The Adaptive Optics Facility (AOF) project envisages transforming one of the
VLT units into an adaptive telescope and providing its ESO (European Southern
Observatory) second generation instruments with turbulence corrected
wavefronts. For MUSE and HAWK-I this correction will be achieved through the
GALACSI and GRAAL AO modules working in conjunction with a 1170 actuators
Deformable Secondary Mirror (DSM) and the new Laser Guide Star Facility
(4LGSF). Multiple wavefront sensors will enable GLAO and LTAO capabilities,
whose performance can greatly benefit from a knowledge about the stratification
of the turbulence in the atmosphere. This work, totally based on end-to-end
simulations, describes the validation tests conducted on a Cn2 profiler adapted
for the AOF specifications. Because an absolute profile calibration is strongly
dependent on a reliable knowledge of turbulence parameters r0 and L0, the tests
presented here refer only to normalized output profiles. Uncertainties in the
input parameters inherent to the code are tested as well as the profiler
response to different turbulence distributions. It adopts a correction for the
unseen turbulence, critical for the GRAAL mode, and highlights the effects of
masking out parts of the corrected wavefront on the results. Simulations of
data with typical turbulence profiles from Paranal were input to the profiler,
showing that it is possible to identify reliably the input features for all the
AOF modes.
