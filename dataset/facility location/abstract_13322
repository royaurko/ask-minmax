Videos are composed of sequence of interrelated frames. There is a minute
difference among frames. Flicker is an error which is found in every video. It
is like a checker box in a video, there are several reasons behind flickers
generation, one of the main reasons is refresh rate of the monitor and second
reason is number of frames per second in a video. The main objective of this
study is to propose and develop a framework that identifies flicker location
and minimizes the flickers rate. Analysis shows that flickers can be minimize
by adjusting the persistence of pixel and higher refresh rate of CRT monitor.
Further we have compared different isotopes of phosphorous pixels and generate
its graphs. This paper highlighted the cause of flicker and its avoidance
.Statistical research proves that proposed algorithm improves the video quality
and reduce flickers ratio up to 90%.
