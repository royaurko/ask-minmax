We consider codes over fixed alphabets against worst-case symbol deletions.
For any fixed $k \ge 2$, we construct a family of codes over alphabet of size
$k$ with positive rate, which allow efficient recovery from a worst-case
deletion fraction approaching $1-\frac{2}{k+1}$. In particular, for binary
codes, we are able to recover a fraction of deletions approaching $1/3$.
Previously, even non-constructively the largest deletion fraction known to be
correctable with positive rate was $1-\Theta(1/\sqrt{k})$, and around $0.17$
for the binary case.
  Our result pins down the largest fraction of correctable deletions for
$k$-ary codes as $1-\Theta(1/k)$, since $1-1/k$ is an upper bound even for the
simpler model of erasures where the locations of the missing symbols are known.
  Closing the gap between $1/3$ and $1/2$ for the limit of worst-case deletions
correctable by binary codes remains a tantalizing open question.
