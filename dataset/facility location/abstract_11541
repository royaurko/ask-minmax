A practical method to compute the Riemann zeta function is presented. The
method can locate all zeta zeros in [T,T+T^{1/4}] using an average time of
T^{1/4+o(1)} per zero. This is the same complexity as the Odlyzko-Sch\"onhage
algorithm over that interval. Although the method far from competes with the
Odlyzko-Sch\"onhage algorithm over intervals much longer than T^{1/4}, it still
has the advantages of being elementary, simple to implement, it does not use
the fast Fourier transform or require large large amounts of storage space, and
its error terms are easy to control. The method has been implemented, and
results of timing experiments agree with its theoretical amortized complexity
of T^{1/4+o(1)}.
