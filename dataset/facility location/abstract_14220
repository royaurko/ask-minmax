A large capacity purification plant and fluid handling system has been
constructed for the SNO+ neutrino and double-beta decay experiment, located
6800 feet underground at SNOLAB, Canada. SNO+ is a refurbishment of the SNO
detector to fill the acrylic vessel with liquid scintillator based on Linear
Alkylbenzene (LAB) and 2 g/L PPO, and also has a phase to load natural
tellurium into the scintillator for a double-beta decay experiment with 130Te.
The plant includes processes multi-stage dual-stream distillation, column water
extraction, steam stripping, and functionalized silica gel adsorption columns.
The plant also includes systems for preparing the scintillator with PPO and
metal-loading the scintillator for double-beta decay exposure. We review the
basis of design, the purification principles, specifications for the plant, and
the construction and installations. The construction and commissioning status
is updated.
