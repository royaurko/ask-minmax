Fabrication of the bimorph lithium niobate cantilevers involves a micro
machining of a z-cut wafer to create a multidomain structure. After etching,
the bimorph ferroelectric cantilevers are fabricated at the locations near
interdomain walls. Cantilever vibrations are excited by rf voltage due to
piezoelectric effect in a ferroelectric chip, and optical detection is employed
to pickup the vibrations. The self-assembling layers of two different Silanes
are chemically deposited on the micro cantilevers. The layers are detected
independently by two methods including a low frequency shift of cantilever
natural vibrations, and Raman spectral lines from the Silane layers. Possible
applications include smart biosensors in a real time domain.
