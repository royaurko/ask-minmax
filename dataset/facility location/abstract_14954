We identified star clusters in archived HST/WFPC2 images of the merger and
ultra-luminous infrared galaxy NGC 6240, with the aim of investigating whether
star cluster properties (luminosity, age and mass) in such an extreme
environment differ from those of clusters in less luminous starburst galaxies.
We found 54 star clusters in all of the F450W, F547M and F814W exposures, of
which 41 are located in the main body of NGC 6240 and 13 in the galactic tails.
Given that only two colours are available to derive two independent variables
(cluster reddening and age), we adopted an ad hoc procedure to statistically
derive cluster parameters under the assumption that the cluster metallicity is
LMC-like. The colours of each cluster are fitted to STARBURST99 models of fixed
mass and variable ages and reddenings. All cluster reddening and age solutions
with Chi squared < 1 are considered to be consistent with the data. Masses are
derived by scaling the luminosity of the models with best-fit Chi squared < 1
by the observed V luminosity, after correction for reddening and distance. We
infer that the most probable age of the observed clusters is (5 - 13) Myr and
their most probable mass is about (1 - 2)e05 solar masses. Comparison with star
clusters in starburst galaxies seems to point to more massive clusters being
formed in more massive galaxies and gas-rich mergers, while the overall cluster
mass distribution might be relatively independent of the details of the
associated starburst where dense, massive clusters preferentially form.
