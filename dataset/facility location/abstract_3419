THERMINATOR is a Monte Carlo event generator designed for studying of
particle production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions performed at such
experimental facilities as the SPS, RHIC, or LHC. The program implements
thermal models of particle production with single freeze-out. It performs the
following tasks: 1) generation of stable particles and unstable resonances at
the chosen freeze-out hypersurface with the local phase-space density of
particles given by the statistical distribution factors, 2) subsequent
space-time evolution and decays of hadronic resonances in cascades, 3)
calculation of the transverse-momentum spectra and numerous other observables
related to the space-time evolution. The geometry of the freeze-out
hypersurface and the collective velocity of expansion may be chosen from two
successful models, the Cracow single-freeze-out model and the Blast-Wave model.
All particles from the Particle Data Tables are used. Experimental cuts may be
introduced in a very straightforward manner. The code is written in the
object-oriented c++ language and complies to the standards of the ROOT
environment.
