Ultra compact HII (UCHII) regions are indicators of high-mass star formation
sites and are distributed mainly in the Galactic plane. We intend to
investigate the possible contribution of the forthcoming ESA Planck mission to
the science of UCHII regions by evaluating the possibility of detecting UCHIIs
that are bright in the radio regime. We performed new 7 mm observations of a
sample of UCHII regions. For each source in our sample, the free-free radio
spectrum has been modeled. Along with far-IR measurements, our spectra allow us
to estimate the flux densities of the sources in the millimeter and
sub-millimeter bands. The possibility of Planck detecting the selected sources
can be assessed by comparing the estimated flux densities to the expected
sensitivity in each Planck channel. We conclude that, in the case of the
present sample, located close to the Galactic center, Planck will have a very
low detection rate. In contrast, assuming that our sample is representative of
the whole UCHII-region population, we derive a very high probability of
detecting this kind of source with Planck if located instead close to the
anticenter.
