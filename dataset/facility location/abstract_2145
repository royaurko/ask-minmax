Two basic motivations for an upgraded JLab facility are the needs: to
determine the essential nature of light-quark confinement and dynamical chiral
symmetry breaking (DCSB); and to understand nucleon structure and spectroscopy
in terms of QCD's elementary degrees of freedom. During the next ten years a
programme of experiment and theory will be conducted that can address these
questions. We present a Dyson-Schwinger equation perspective on this effort
with numerous illustrations, amongst them: an interpretation of
string-breaking; a symmetry-preserving truncation for mesons; the nucleon's
strangeness sigma-term; and the neutron's charge distribution.
