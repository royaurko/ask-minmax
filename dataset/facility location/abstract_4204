The gravitational field of a moving point particle is obtained in a Lorentz
covariant form for both uncharged and charged cases. It is shown that the
general relativistic proper time interval at the location of the particle is
the same as the special relativistic one and the gravitational and
electromagnetic self forces are zero.
