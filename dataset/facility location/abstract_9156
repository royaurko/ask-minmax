We report the results of an XMM-Newton observation of Sgr A East and its
surroundings. The X-ray spectrum of Sgr A East is well represented with a
two-temperature plasma model with temperatures of ~1 and ~4 keV. Only the iron
abundance shows clear spatial variation; it concentrates in the core of Sgr A
East. The derived plasma parameters suggest that Sgr A East originated in a
single supernova. Around Sgr A East, there is a broad distribution of hard
X-ray emission with a superimposed soft excess component extending away from
the location of Sgr A East both above and below the plane. We discuss the
nature of these structures as well as the close vicinity of Sgr A*.
