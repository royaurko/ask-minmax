Petaflop architectures are currently being utilized efficiently to perform
large scale computations in Atomic, Molecular and Optical Collisions. We solve
the Schroedinger or Dirac equation for the appropriate collision problem using
the R-matrix or R-matrix with pseudo-states approach. We briefly outline the
parallel methodology used and implemented for the current suite of Breit-Pauli
and DARC codes. Various examples are shown of our theoretical results compared
with those obtained from Synchrotron Radiation facilities and from Satellite
observations. We also indicate future directions and implementation of the
R-matrix codes on emerging GPU architectures.
