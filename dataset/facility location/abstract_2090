Submillimetre continuum radiation allows us to probe cold objects,
particularly the earliest, dusty phases of star formation, high-redshift
galaxies and circumstellar disks. The submillimetre window gives a unique view
of the physical and dynamical conditions in the neutral and molecular
interstellar medium. In the next decade a combination of wide-field surveys
with single-dish telescopes and targeted follow-up with ALMA and other
facilities should enable rapid progress in answering questions about the
origins of planetary systems, stars and galaxies.
