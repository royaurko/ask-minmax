BVR photometry of a recently identified RS CVn binary star HD61396, carried
out during 2001, is presented. The new photometry reveal significant evolution
in the shape and amplitude of light curve when compared with those reported
earlier by Padmakar etal (2000). The traditional two-starspot model has been
used to obtain the spot parameters from the observed light curve. Changes in
the spot area and their location on the stellar surface are discernible from
the extracted parameters from the new photometry.
