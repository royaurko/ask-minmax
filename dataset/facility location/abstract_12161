It has been shown that to calculate the parameters of the electrostatic field
of the ion crystal lattice it sufficient to take into account ions located at a
distance of 1-2 lattice spacings. More distant ions make insignificant
contribution. As a result, the electrostatic energy of the ion lattice in the
alkaline halide crystal produced by both positive and negative ions is in good
agreement with experiment when the melting temperature and the shear modulus
are calculated. For fcc and bcc metals the ion lattice electrostatic energy is
not sufficient to obtain the observed values of these parameters. It is
possible to resolve the contradiction if one assumes that the electron density
is strongly localized and has a crystal structure described by the lattice
delta - function. As a result, positive charges alternate with negative ones as
in the alkaline halide crystal. Such delta-like localization of the electron
density is known as a model of nearly free electrons.
