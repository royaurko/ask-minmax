We review results of the last two years concerning caloron solutions of unit
charge with non-trivial holonomy, revealing the constituent monopole nature of
these instantons. For SU(n) there are n such BPS constituents. New is the
presentation of the exact values for the Polyakov loop at the three constituent
locations for the SU(3) caloron with arbitrary holonomy. At these points two
eigenvalues coincide, extending earlier results for SU(2) to a situation more
generic for general SU(n).
