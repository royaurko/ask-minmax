We present the discovery of a light echo from SN 2007af, a normal Type Ia
supernova (SN Ia) in NGC 5584. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images taken three
years post explosion reveal two separate echoes; an outer echo and extended
central region, which we propose as an unresolved inner echo. Multiple images
were obtained in the F160W, F350LP, F555W, and F814W using the Wide Field
Camera 3. If the outer echo is produced by an interstellar dust sheet
perpendicular to the line of sight, it is located ~800 pc in front of the SN.
The dust for the inner echo is 0.45 pc < d < 90 pc away from the SN. The inner
echo color is consistent with typical interstellar dust wavelength-dependent
scattering cross-sections, while the outer echo color does not match the
predictions. Both dust sheets, if in the foreground, are optically thin for
scattering, with the outer echo sheet thickness consistent with the inferred
extinction from peak brightness. Whether the inner echo is from interstellar or
circumstellar dust is ambiguous. Overall, the echo characteristics are quite
similar to previously observed SN Ia echoes.
