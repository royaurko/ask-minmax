We present and discuss an algorithm to identify and characterize the long
icosahedral structures (staggered pentagonal nanowires with 1-5-1-5 atomic
structure) that appear in Molecular Dynamics simulations of metallic nanowires
of different species subjected to stretching. The use of the algorithm allows
the identification of pentagonal rings forming the icosahedral structure as
well as the determination of its number, and the maximum length of the
pentagonal nanowire. The algorithm is tested with some ideal structures to show
its ability to discriminate between pentagonal rings and other ring structures.
We applied the algorithm to Ni nanowires with temperatures ranging between 4K
and 865K, stretched along the [100] direction. We studied statistically the
formation of pentagonal nanowires obtaining the distributions of the maximum
length and number of rings as function of the temperature. The pentagonal
nanowire maximum length distribution presents a peaked shape, with peaks locate
at fixes distances whose separa-tion corresponds to the distance between two
consecutive pentagonal rings.
