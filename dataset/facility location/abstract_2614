A Neutron Time-Of-Flight (NTOF) spectrometer based on Heavy Ion Research
Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL) is developed for studies of neutron production of
proton induced spallation reactions related to the ADS project. After the
presentation of comparisons between calculated spallation neutron production
double-differential cross sections and the available experimental one, a
detailed description of NTOF spectrometer is given. Test beam results show that
the spectrometer works well and data analysis procedures are established. The
comparisons of the test beam neutron spectra with those of GEANT4 simulations
are presented.
