The research field of spatial scientometrics is dedicated to measuring and
analyzing science with spatial components (e.g., location, place, mapping).
Because of the dynamic nature of this field, researchers from multidisciplinary
domains constantly contribute qualitative, quantitative and computational
approaches and technologies into scientometric analysis. This article aims to
giving a brief overview about this field by analyzing the publications in
(spatial) scientometrics collected from the Scopus database and introduces
recent frontier researches which integrate advanced spatial analysis and
geovisualization with Semantic Web technologies.
