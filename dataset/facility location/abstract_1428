Measurements of $\gamma p \rightarrow K^{+} \Lambda$ and $\gamma p
\rightarrow K^{+} \Sigma^0$ cross-sections have been obtained with the photon
tagging facility and the Crystal Ball calorimeter at MAMI-C. The measurement
uses a novel $K^+$ meson identification technique in which the weak decay
products are characterized using the energy and timing characteristics of the
energy deposit in the calorimeter, a method that has the potential to be
applied at many other facilities. The fine center-of-mass energy ($W$)
resolution and statistical accuracy of the new data results in a significant
impact on partial wave analyses aiming to better establish the excitation
spectrum of the nucleon. The new analyses disfavor a strong role for
quark-diquark dynamics in the nucleon.
