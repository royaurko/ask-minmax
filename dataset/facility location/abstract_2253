We report major performance test results of the Atacama Compact Array (ACA)
7-m and 12-m antennas of ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array).
The four major performances of the ACA antennas are all-sky pointing (to be not
more than 2.0 arcsec), offset pointing (to be < 0.6 arcsec) surface accuracy (<
25(20) micrometer for 12(7)m-antenna), stability of path-length (15 micrometer
over 3 min), and high servo capability (6 degrees/s for Azimuth and 3 degrees/s
for Elevation). The high performance of the ACA antenna has been extensively
evaluated at the Site Erection Facility area at an altitude of about 2900
meters. Test results of pointing performance, surface performance, and fast
motion capability are demonstrated.
