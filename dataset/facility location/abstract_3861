Direct imaging surveys for exoplanets commonly exclude binary stars from
their target lists, leaving a large part of the overall planet demography
unexplored. To address this gap in our understanding of planet formation and
evolution, we have launched the first direct imaging survey dedicated to
circumbinary planets: SPOTS, the Search for Planets Orbiting Two Stars. In this
paper, we discuss the theoretical context, scientific merit, and technical
feasibility of such observations, describe the target sample and observational
strategy of our survey, and report on the first results from our pilot survey
of 26 targets with the VLT NaCo facility. While we have not found any confirmed
substellar companions to date, a number of promising candidate companions
remain to be tested for common proper motion in upcoming follow-up
observations. We also report on the astrometry of the three resolved binaries
in our target sample. This pilot survey constitutes a successful proof of
concept for our survey strategy and paves the way for a second stage of
exploratory observations with VLT SPHERE.
