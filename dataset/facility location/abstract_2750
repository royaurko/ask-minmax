We present the first results for anisotropy searches around the galactic
center at EeV energies using data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. Our
analysis, based on a substantially larger data set, do not support previous
claim of anisotropy found in this region by the AGASA and Sugar experiment.
Furthermore we place un upper limit on a possible point like source located at
the galactic center which exclude several scenarios predicting neutron sources
in this location.
