Complex patterns generated by the time evolution of a one-dimensional
digitalized coupled map lattice are quantitatively analyzed. A method for
discerning complexity among the different patterns is implemented. The
quantitative results indicate two zones in parameter space where the dynamics
shows the most complex patterns. These zones are located on the two edges of an
absorbent region where the system displays spatio-temporal intermittency.
