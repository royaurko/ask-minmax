The symmetry and structure of the superconducting gap in the Fe-based
superconductors are the central issue for understanding these novel materials.
So far the experimental data and theoretical models have been highly
controversial. Some experiments favor two or more constant or nearly-constant
gaps, others indicate strong anisotropy and yet others suggest gap zeros
("nodes"). Theoretical models also vary, suggesting that the absence or
presence of the nodes depends quantitatively on the model parameters. An
opinion that has gained substantial currency is that the gap structure, unlike
all other known superconductors, including cuprates, may be different in
different compounds within the same family. A unique method for addressing this
issue, one of the very few methods that are bulk and angle-resolved, calls for
measuring the electronic specific heat in a rotating magnetic field, as a
function of field orientation with respect to the crystallographic axes. In
this Communication we present the first such measurement for an Fe-based
high-Tc superconductor (FeBSC). We observed a fourfold oscillation of the
specific heat as a function of the in-plane magnetic field direction, which
allowed us to identify the locations of the gap minima (or nodes) on the Fermi
surface. Our results are consistent with the expectations of an extended s-wave
model with a significant gap anisotropy on the electron pockets and the gap
minima along the \Gamma M (or Fe-Fe bond) direction.
