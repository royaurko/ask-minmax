The emission mechanism of the gamma-ray binary LS5039 in energy bands of TeV,
GeV, and X-ray is investigated. Observed light curves in LS5039 show that TeV
and GeV fluxes anticorrelate and TeV and X-ray fluxes correlate. However, such
correlated variations have not been explained yet reasonably at this stage.
Assuming that relativistic electrons are injected constantly at the location of
the compact object as a point source, and that they lose energy only by the
inverse Compton (IC) process, we calculate gamma-ray spectra and light curves
by the Monte Carlo method, including the full electromagnetic cascade process.
Moreover, we calculated X-ray spectra and light curves by using the resultant
electron distribution. As a result, we are able to reproduce qualitatively
spectra and light curves observed by HESS, Fermi, and Suzaku for the
inclination angle i = 30 dig and the index of injected electron distribution p
= 2.5. We conclude that TeV-GeV anticorrelation is due to anisotropic IC
scattering and anisotropic gamma-gamma absorption, and that TeV-X correlation
is due to the dependence of IC cooling time on orbital phases. In addition, the
constraint on the inclination angle implies that the compact object in LS5039
is a black hole.
