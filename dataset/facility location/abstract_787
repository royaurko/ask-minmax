The existing inclusive electroproduction data base allow us a look at the
issue of the relative behaviors of background and resonance excitations, a part
of the Bloom-Gilman duality. These data lack accuracy at high Q^2, but
establish PQCD scaling in the resonance region and even allow us a glimpse at
the leading logarithmic corrections due to the gluon radiation and its possible
quenching at large W and x. These should inspire better quality experimental
tests at facilities like CEBAF II.
