The Damocloids are a group of unusual asteroids, recently enrolling a new
member of 2010 EJ104. The dynamical evolution for the Damocloids may uncover a
connection passage from the Main Belt, the Kuiper Belt and the scattered disk
beyond. According to our simulations, two regions may be considered as possible
origin of the Damocloids: the scattered disk, or a part of Oort cloud which
will be perturbed to a transient region locating between 700 AU and 1000 AU.
Based on the potential origin, the Damocloids can be classified into two types,
with relation to their semi-major axes, and about 65.5% Damocloids is
classified into type I which mainly originate from Oort cloud. Whether the
Damocloids is inactive nuclei of Halley Family Comets may rely on their origin.
