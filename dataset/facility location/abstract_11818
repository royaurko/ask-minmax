The paper presents the possibility of fast and quality azimuth disambiguation
of vector magnetogram data regardless of location on the solar disc. The new
Super Fast and Quality (SFQ) code of disambiguation is tried out on well-known
models of Metcalf et al. (2006), Leka et al. (2009) and artificial model of
fixed configuration AR 10930 (Rudenko et al., 2010). We make comparison of
Hinode SOT SP vector magnetograms of AR 10930 disambiguated with three codes:
SFQ, NPFC (Georgoulis, 2005), and SME (Rudenko et al., 2010). We exemplify the
SFQ disambiguation of SDO/HMI measurements of the full disc. The preliminary
examination indicates that the SFQ algorithm provides better quality than NPFC
and is comparable to SME. In contrast to other codes, SFQ supports relatively
high quality of results regardless of the magnetogram proximity to the limb
(when being very close to the limb, it is efficient unlike all other
algorithms).
