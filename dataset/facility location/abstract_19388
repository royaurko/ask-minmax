Deep HST/ACS photometry of the young cluster NGC 602, located in the remote
low density "wing" of the Small Magellanic Cloud, reveals numerous pre-main
sequence stars as well as young stars on the main sequence. The resolved
stellar content thus provides a basis for studying the star formation history
into recent times and constraining several stellar population properties, such
as the present day mass function, the initial mass function and the binary
fraction. To better characterize the pre-main sequence population, we present a
new set of model stellar evolutionary tracks for this evolutionary phase with
metallicity appropriate for the Small Magellanic Cloud (Z = 0.004). We use a
stellar population synthesis code, which takes into account a full range of
stellar evolution phases to derive our best estimate for the star formation
history in the region by comparing observed and synthetic color-magnitude
diagrams. The derived present day mass function for NGC 602 is consistent with
that resulting from the synthetic diagrams. The star formation rate in the
region has increased with time on a scale of tens of Myr, reaching $0.3-0.7
\times 10^{-3} M_\odot yr^{-1}$ in the last 2.5 Myr, comparable to what is
found in Galactic OB associations. Star formation is most complete in the main
cluster but continues at moderate levels in the gas-rich periphery of the
nebula.
