I present here a new ring-ring design of eRHIC, a polarized electron-ion
collider based on RHIC at BNL. This alternate eRHIC design utilizes high
repetition rate colliding beams and is likely able to deliver the performance
to meet the requirements of the science program with low technical risk and
modest accelerator R&D. The expected performance includes high luminosities
over multiple collision points and a broad CM energy range with a maximum value
up to 2x10^34 cm-2s-1 per detector, and polarization higher than 70% for the
colliding electron and light ion beams. This new design calls for reuse of
decommissioned facilities in the US, namely, the PEP-II high energy ring and
one section of the SLAC warm linac as a full energy electron injector.
