We describe our work towards the manufacture of micro-optical arrays using
freeform diamond machining techniques. Simulations have been done to show the
feasibility of manufacturing micro-lens arrays using the slow-tool servo
method. Using this technique, master shapes can be produced for replication of
micro-lens arrays of either epoxy-on-glass or monolthic glass types. A machine
tool path programme has been developed on the machine software platform
DIFFSYS, allowing the production of spherical, aspherical and toric arrays. In
addition, in theory spatially varying lenslets, sparse arrays and dithered
lenslet arrays (for high contrast applications) are possible to produce. In
practice, due to the diamond tool limitations not all formats are feasible.
Investigations into solving this problem have been carried out and a solution
is presented here.
