We present the results of detailed N-body simulations regarding the
interaction of four massive globular clusters in the central region of a
triaxial galaxy. The systems undergo a full merging event, producing a sort of
'Super Star Cluster' (SSC) whose features are close to those of a superposition
of the individual initial mergers. In contrast with other similar simulations,
the resulting SSC structural parameters are located along the observed scaling
relations of globular clusters. These findings seem to support the idea that a
massive SSC may have formed in early phases of the mother galaxy evolution and
contributed to the growth of a massive nucleus.
