The arrival times of gravitational waves and optical light from orbiting
binaries provide a mechanism to understand the propagation speed of gravity
when compared to that of light or electromagnetic radiation. This is achieved
with a measurement of any offset between optically derived orbital phase
related to that derived from gravitational wave data, at a specified location
of one binary component with respect to the other. Using a sample of close
white dwarf binaries (CWDBs) detectable with the Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna (LISA) and optical light curve data related to binary eclipses from
meter-class telescopes for the same sample, we determine the accuracy to which
orbital phase differences can be extracted. We consider an application of these
measurements involving a variation to the speed of gravity, when compared to
the speed of light, due to a massive graviton. For a subsample of $\sim$ 400
CWDBs with high signal-to-noise gravitational wave and optical data with
magnitudes brighter than 25, the combined upper limit on the graviton mass is
at the level of $\sim 6 \times 10^{-24}$ eV. This limit is two orders of
magnitude better than the present limit derived by Yukawa-correction arguments
related to the Newtonian potential and applied to the Solar-system.
