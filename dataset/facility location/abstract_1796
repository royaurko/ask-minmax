The cross section and decay angular distributions for the coherent \phi meson
photoproduction on the deuteron have been measured for the first time up to a
squared four-momentum transfer t =(p_{\gamma}-p_{\phi})^2 =-2 GeV^2/c^2, using
the CLAS detector at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The
cross sections are compared with predictions from a re-scattering model. In a
framework of vector meson dominance, the data are consistent with the total
\phi-N cross section \sigma_{\phi N} at about 10 mb. If vector meson dominance
is violated, a larger \sigma_{\phi N} is possible by introducing larger t-slope
for the \phi N \to \phi N process than that for the \gamma N \to \phi N
process. The decay angular distributions of the \phi are consistent with
helicity conservation.
