New astrophysical instruments such as skA (square kilometer Array) and IXO
(formerly Constellation X) promise the discovery of tens of thousands of new
isolated rotating neutron stars (pulsars), neutron stars in low-mass X-ray
binaries (LMXBs), anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs), and soft gamma repeaters
(SGRs). Many of these neutron stars will experience dramatic density changes
over their active lifetimes, driven by either stellar spin-up or spin-down,
which may trigger phase transitions in their dense baryonic cores. More than
that, accretion of matter onto neutron stars in LMXBs is believed to cause
pycno-nuclear fusion reactions in the inner crusts of neutron stars. The
associated reaction rates may be drastically altered if strange quark matter
would be absolutely stable. This paper outlines the investigative steps that
need to be performed in order to explore the thermal response of neutron stars
to rotationally-driven phase transitions in their cores as well as to nuclear
burning scenarios in their crusts. Such research complements the exploration of
the phase diagram of dense baryonic matter through particle collider
experiments, as performed at RHIC in the USA and as planned at the future
Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) in Darmstadt, Germany.
