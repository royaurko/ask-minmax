The stacked contact process is a stochastic model for the spread of an
infection within a population of hosts located on the $d$-dimensional integer
lattice. Regardless of whether they are healthy or infected, hosts give birth
and die at the same rate and in accordance to the evolution rules of the
neutral multitype contact process. The infection is transmitted both vertically
from infected parents to their offspring and horizontally from infected hosts
to nearby healthy hosts. The population survives if and only if the common
birth rate of healthy and infected hosts exceeds the critical value of the
basic contact process. The main purpose of this work is to study the existence
of a phase transition between extinction and persistence of the infection in
the parameter region where the hosts survive.
