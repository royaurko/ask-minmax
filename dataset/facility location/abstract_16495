This document presents Annotated English, a system of diacritical symbols
which turns English pronunciation into a precise and unambiguous process. The
annotations are defined and located in such a way that the original English
text is not altered (not even a letter), thus allowing for a consistent reading
and learning of the English language with and without annotations. The
annotations are based on a set of general rules that make the frequency of
annotations not dramatically high. This makes the reader easily associate
annotations with exceptions, and makes it possible to shape, internalise and
consolidate some rules for the English language which otherwise are weakened by
the enormous amount of exceptions in English pronunciation. The advantages of
this annotation system are manifold. Any existing text can be annotated without
a significant increase in size. This means that we can get an annotated version
of any document or book with the same number of pages and fontsize. Since no
letter is affected, the text can be perfectly read by a person who does not
know the annotation rules, since annotations can be simply ignored. The
annotations are based on a set of rules which can be progressively learned and
recognised, even in cases where the reader has no access or time to read the
rules. This means that a reader can understand most of the annotations after
reading a few pages of Annotated English, and can take advantage from that
knowledge for any other annotated document she may read in the future.
