In this talk we try to clarify the problems existing on the way of theorist
decided to construct nuclear theory on the generalized Skyrme model background.
We conclude that to construct such a model of light nuclei one have to
construct a hybrid model where one particle degrees of freedom are concentrated
around the surface of the nuclei and soliton with non-trivial structure is
located at the center region.
