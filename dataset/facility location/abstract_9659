We study the single-particle spectral properties of a model for coexisting
AFM and ICDW critical fluctuations coupled to electrons, which naturally arises
in the context of the stripe-quantum-critical-point scenario for high-Tc
superconducting materials. Within a perturbative approach, we show that the
on-shell inverse scattering time deviates from the normal Fermi-liquid behavior
near the points of the Fermi surface connected by the characteristic
wave-vectors of the critical fluctuations (hot spots). The anomalous behavior
is stronger when the hot spots are located near singular points of the
electronic spectrum.
  The violations to the normal Fermi-liquid behavior are associated with the
transfer of spectral weight from the quasi-particle peak to incoherent shadow
peaks, which produces an enhancement of incoherent spectral weight near the
Fermi level.
  We use our results to discuss recent ARPES experiments on Bi2212 near optimal
doping.
