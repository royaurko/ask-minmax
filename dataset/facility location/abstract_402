The MINiature Exoplanet Radial Velocity Array (MINERVA) is a US-based
observational facility dedicated to the discovery and characterization of
exoplanets around a nearby sample of bright stars. MINERVA employs a robotic
array of four 0.7 m telescopes outfitted for both high-resolution spectroscopy
and photometry, and is designed for completely autonomous operation. The
primary science program is a dedicated radial velocity survey and the secondary
science objective is to obtain high precision transit light curves. The modular
design of the facility and the flexibility of our hardware allows for both
science programs to be pursued simultaneously, while the robotic control
software provides a robust and efficient means to carry out nightly
observations. In this article, we describe the design of MINERVA including
major hardware components, software, and science goals. The telescopes and
photometry cameras are characterized at our test facility on the Caltech campus
in Pasadena, CA, and their on-sky performance is validated. New observations
from our test facility demonstrate sub-mmag photometric precision of one of our
radial velocity survey targets, and we present new transit observations and
fits of WASP-52b -- a known hot-Jupiter with an inflated radius and misaligned
orbit. The facility is now in the process of being relocated to its final
destination at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in southern Arizona, and
science operations will begin in 2015.
