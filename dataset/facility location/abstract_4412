We have analyzed the Ulysses, BATSE, and COMPTEL spectral data from the
$\gamma$-ray burst of June 22, 1992 (GB 920622). COMPTEL data reveal a hard to
soft evolution within the first pulse of the burst, while the mean hardness
ratios of the three pulses are the same. Unlike the single instrument spectra,
the composite spectrum of GB 920622 averaged over the total burst duration
ranging from 20 keV up to 10 MeV cannot be fit by a single power law. Instead,
the spectrum shows continuous curvature across the full energy range. COMPTEL
imaging and BATSE/Ulysses triangulation constrain the source location of GB
920622 to a ring sector 1.1 arcmin wide and 2 degrees long. This area has been
searched for quiescent X-ray sources using \ros survey data collected about two
years before the burst. After the optical identification of the X-ray sources
in and near the GRB location we conclude that no quiescent X-ray counterpart
candidate for GB 920622 has been found.
