The majority of stars in known star-forming regions are located in binary
systems. Although the separation distribution of these populations varies from
one region to another, most peak between a few and several tens of AU. Given
the >100 AU distance to the youngest regions, binaries with this separation
range are also the most poorly studied. In general, only for about 60 young
pairs have the circumstellar disks and the stellar properties been
well-characterized. We discuss results of recent analyses of inner and outer
disk properties, summarize the status of observations of disk orientations, and
highlight two cases of debris disks in relatively young binaries. A substantial
effort, taking advantage of available and future high-angular resolution
facilities, will be required to further our knowledge of disk evolution in
binaries across the range of separations influential to both terrestrial as
well as giant planet formation.
