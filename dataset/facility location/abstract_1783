Masses of the radioactive isotopes 62Ga, 62Zn and 62Cu have been measured at
the JYFLTRAP facility with a relative precision of better than 18 ppb. A Q_EC
value of (9181.07 +- 0.54) keV for the superallowed decay of 62Ga is obtained
from the measured cyclotron frequency ratios of 62Ga-62Zn, 62Ga-62Ni and
62Zn-62Ni ions. The resulting Ft-value supports the validity of the conserved
vector current hypothesis (CVC). The mass excess values measured were (-51986.5
+-1.0) keV for 62Ga, (-61167.9 +- 0.9) keV for 62Zn and (-62787.2 +- 0.9) keV
for 62Cu.
