We present new magnetic field measurements of the K2 main-sequence star
$\epsilon$ Eridani based on principal components analysis (PCA) line-profile
reconstructions. The aim of this paper is to quantify the surface-averaged
magnetic field and search for possible variations. A total of 338 optical
echelle spectra from our robotic telescope facility STELLA with a spectral
resolution of 55,000 were available for analysis. This time-series was used to
search for the small line-profile variations due to a surface magnetic field
with the help of a PCA. Evidence for a spatial and temporal inhomogeneous
magnetic field distribution is presented. The mean, surface averaged, magnetic
field strength was found to be $\langle B \rangle = 186 \pm 47\,\mathrm{G}$ in
good agreement with previous Zeeman-broadening measurements. Clear short-term
variations of the surface averaged magnetic field of up to few tens Gauss were
detected together with evidence for a three-year cycle in the surface-averaged
magnetic field of $\epsilon$ Eridani.
