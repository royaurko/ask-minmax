We consider wireless caches located in the plane according to general point
process and specialize the results for the homogeneous Poisson process. A large
data file is stored at the caches, which have limited storage capabilities.
Hence, they can only store parts of the data. Clients can contact the caches to
retrieve the data. We compare the expected cost of obtaining the complete data
under uncoded as well as coded data allocation strategies. It is shown that for
the general class of cost measures where the cost of retrieving data is
increasing with the distance between client and caches, coded allocation
outperforms uncoded allocation. The improvement offered by coding is quantified
for two more specific classes of performance measures. Finally, our results are
validated by computing the costs of the allocation strategies for the case that
caches coincide with currently deployed mobile base stations.
