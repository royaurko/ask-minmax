An appropriate model for the random energy landscape in organic glasses is a
spatially correlated Gaussian field, generated by randomly located and oriented
dipoles and quadrupoles. Correlation properties of energetic disorder directly
dictates the mobility dependence on the applied electric field. Electrostatic
disorder is significantly modified in the vicinity of the electrode that
affects injection properties. Correlated Gaussian field forms clusters. We
suggest a simple method to estimate an asymptotics of the cluster distribution
on size for deep clusters where a value of the field on each site is much
greater than the rms disorder. Hopping transport in organic glasses in the case
of high carrier density could be described in terms of the effective
density-dependent temperature.
