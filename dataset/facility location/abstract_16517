Based on high quality spectral data (spectral resolution R>60000) within the
wavelength range of 3550-5000 AA we determined main parameters (effective
temperature, surface gravity, microturbulent velocity, and chemical element
abundances including heavy metals from Sr to Dy) for 14 metal-deficient G-K
stars with large proper motions. The stars we studied have a wide range of
metallicity: [Fe/H]=-0.3 \div -2.9. Abundances of Mg, Al, Sr and Ba were
calculated with non-LTE line-formation effects accounted for. Abundances both
of the radioactive element Th and r-process element Eu were determined using
synthetic spectrum calculations. We selected stars that belong to different
galactic populations according to the kinematical criterion and parameters
determined by us. We found that the studied stars with large proper motions
refer to different components of the Galaxy: thin, thick disks and halo. The
chemical composition of the star BD+80 245 located far from the galactic plane
agrees with its belonging to the accreted halo. For the giant HD115444 we
obtained [Fe/H]=-2.91, underabundance of Mn, overabundance of heavy metals from
Ba to Dy, and, especially high excess of the r-process element Europium:
[Eu/Fe]=+1.26. Contrary to its chemical composition typical for halo stars,
HD115444 belongs to the disc population according to its kinematic parameters.
