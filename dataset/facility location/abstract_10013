Partial differential equations (PDEs) with Dirichlet boundary conditions
defined on boundaries with simple geometry have been succesfuly treated using
sigmoidal multilayer perceptrons in previous works. This article deals with the
case of complex boundary geometry, where the boundary is determined by a number
of points that belong to it and are closely located, so as to offer a
reasonable representation. Two networks are employed: a multilayer perceptron
and a radial basis function network. The later is used to account for the
satisfaction of the boundary conditions. The method has been successfuly tested
on two-dimensional and three-dimensional PDEs and has yielded accurate
solutions.
