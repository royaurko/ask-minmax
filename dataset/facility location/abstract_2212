The electrical and optical response of a field-effect device comprising a
network of semiconductor-enriched single-wall carbon nanotubes, gated with
sodium chloride solution is investigated. Field-effect is demonstrated in a
device that uses facile fabrication techniques along with a small-ion as the
gate electrolyte - and this is accomplished as a result of the semiconductor
enhancement of the tubes. The optical transparency and electrical resistance of
the device are modulated with gate voltage. A time-response study of the
modulation of optical transparency and electrical resistance upon application
of gate voltage suggests the percolative charge transport in the network. Also
the ac response in the network is investigated as a function of frequency and
temperature down to 5 K. An empirical relation between onset frequency and
temperature is determined.
