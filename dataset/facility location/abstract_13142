The electronic structure of the kagome staircase compounds, Ni3V2O8 and
Co3V2O8, has been investigated using soft x-ray absorption, soft x-ray
emission, and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). Comparison between
the two compounds, and with first principles band structure calculations and
crystal-field multiplet models, provide unique insight into the electronic
structure of the two materials. Whereas the location of the narrow (Ni,Co) d
bands is predicted to be close to EF, we experimentally find they lie deeper in
the occupied O 2p and unoccupied V 3d manifolds, and determine their energy via
measured charge-transfer excitations. Additionally, we find evidence for a dd
excitation at 1.5 eV in Ni3V2O8, suggesting the V d states may be weakly
occupied in this compound, contrary to Co3V2O8. Good agreement is found between
the crystal-field dd excitations observed in the experiment and predicted by
atomic multiplet theory.
