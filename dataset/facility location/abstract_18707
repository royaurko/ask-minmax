We present high angular resolution ($2\rlap.{''}8 \times 1\rlap.{''}7$) SiO
J=5$\to$4; $v=0$ line observations of the OMC1S region in the Orion Nebula made
using the Submillimeter Array (SMA). We detect for the first time a cluster of
four compact bipolar and monopolar outflows that show high, moderate and low
velocity gas and appear to be energized by millimeter and infrared sources
associated with this region. The SiO molecular outflows are compact ($<$ 3500
AU), and in most of the cases, they are located very close to their exciting
sources. We thus propose that the SiO thermal emission is tracing the youngest
and most highly excited parts of the outflows which cannot be detected by other
molecules. Moreover, since the ambient cloud is weak in the SiO line emission,
these observations can reveal flows that in other molecular transitions will be
confused with the ambient velocity cloud emission. Analysis of their
positional-velocity diagrams show that some components of these outflows may be
driven by wide-angle winds very close to the exciting object. Finally, we find
that some of these SiO outflows seem to be the base of powerful Herbig-Haro
jets and large-scale molecular flows that emanate from a few arcseconds around
this zone. In particular, we find a strongly excited SiO bipolar outflow with a
P.A. of $\sim$ 100$^{\circ}$, that is likely energized by the luminous ($\sim$
3 $\times$ 10$^3$ L$_{\odot}$) infrared protostar "B" and could be the base of
the remarkable object HH269.
