Gravitational microlensing is a powerful tool for probing the physical
properties of quasar accretion disks and properties of the lens galaxy such as
its dark matter fraction and mean stellar mass. Unfortunately the number of
lensed quasars ($\sim 90$) exceeds our monitoring capabilities. Thus,
estimating their microlensing properties is important for identifying good
microlensing candidates as well as for the expectations of future surveys. In
this work we estimate the microlensing properties of a sample of 87 lensed
quasars. While the median Einstein radius crossing time scale is 20.6 years,
the median source crossing time scale is 7.3 months. Broadly speaking, this
means that on $\sim 10$ year timescales roughly half the lenses will be
quiescent, with the source in a broad demagnified valley, and roughly half will
be active with the source lying in the caustic ridges. We also found that the
location of the lens system relative to the CMB dipole has a modest effect on
microlensing timescales, and in theory microlensing could be used to confirm
the kinematic origin of the dipole. As a corollary of our study we analyzed the
accretion rate parameters in a sub-sample of 32 lensed quasars. At fixed black
hole mass, it is possible to sample a broad range of luminosities (i.e.,
Eddington factors) if it becomes feasible to monitor fainter lenses.
