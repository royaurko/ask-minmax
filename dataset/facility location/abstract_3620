M1 transitions from the $^6$Li($0^+;T=1$) state at 3.563 MeV to the
$^6$Li($1^+$) ground state and to the $\alpha+d$ continuum are studied in a
three-body model. The bound states are described as an $\alpha+n+p$ system in
hyperspherical coordinates on a Lagrange mesh. The ground-state magnetic moment
and the gamma width of the $^6$Li(0$^+$) resonance are well reproduced. The
halo-like structure of the $^6$Li$(0^+)$ resonance is confirmed and is probed
by the M1 transition probability to the $\alpha+d$ continuum. The spectrum is
sensitive to the description of the $\alpha+d$ phase shifts. The corresponding
gamma width is around 1.0 meV, with optimal potentials. Charge symmetry is
analyzed through a comparison with the $\beta$-delayed deuteron spectrum of
$^6$He. In $^6$He, a nearly perfect cancellation effect between short-range and
halo contributions was found. A similar analysis for the $^6$Li($0^+;T=1$)
$\gamma$ decay is performed; it shows that charge-symmetry breaking at large
distances, due to the different binding energies and to different charges,
reduces this effect. The present branching ratio $\Gamma_{\gamma}(0^+\to
\alpha+d)/\Gamma_{\gamma}(0^+\to1^+)\approx 1.3\times 10^{-4}$ should be
observable with current experimental facilities.
