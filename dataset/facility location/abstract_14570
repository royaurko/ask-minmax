We report the detection with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer of a Compton
reflection signature in the Seyfert galaxy MCG-5-23-16. RXTE also resolves the
Fe K-alpha fluorescence line with FWHM ~48,000 km s^{-1}. This measurement
provides the first independent confirmation of ASCA detections in Seyfert
galaxies of broad Fe K-alpha lines that are thought to be the signature of
emission from the inner regions of an accretion disk orbiting a black hole.
Under the assumption that reflection arises from an isotropic source located
above a neutral accretion disk, and using a theoretical model that accounts for
the dependence of the reflected spectrum on inclination angle, we derive a 90%
confidence range for the disk inclination of i = 50 to 81 degrees. The large
inclination is consistent with that expected from the unified model for
MCG-5-23-16 based on its Seyfert 1.9 classification. If we assume that the
high-energy cutoff in the incident spectrum lies at energies larger than a few
hundred keV, then the equivalent width of the Fe K-alpha line is much larger
than predicted for the amount of reflection. This implies either an enhanced
iron abundance, a covering factor of reflecting material > 0.5, or a cutoff in
the incident spectrum at energies between ~60 and ~200 keV.
