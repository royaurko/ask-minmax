One of the tests of nucleosynthesis theory is the $^3$He abundance in the
Galaxy. $^3$He$^+$ is observed through its 3.46 cm hyperfine level in Hii
regions and the $^3$He/H ratio compares well with theory. Since $^3$He can be
created or destroyed in nuclear reactions, one would expect that its abundance
shows a trend with the amount of such reactions, so with distance to the Center
of the Galaxy and with metallicity. Such trends are lacking in observations.
This is explained by assuming that the Hii clouds are recently formed out of
the primordial micro brown dwarfs of earth mass predicted by gravitational
hydrodynamics. If indeed existing, they would preserve their primordial
$^3$He/H ratio and spread this when evaporating into Hii clouds, independent of
the location in the Galaxy.
  In the development of the argument, it is also explained that wide binaries
do not rule out the MACHO dark matter predicted by gravitational hydrodynamics,
but are rather immersed as visible partners in Jeans clusters of dark micro
brown dwarfs.
