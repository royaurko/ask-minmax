NGC3628 is a well-studied starburst/low level AGN galaxy in the Leo Triplet
noted for its extensive outgassed plumes of neutral hydrogen. QSOs are shown to
be concentrated around NGC3628 and aligned with the HI plumes. The closest high
redshift quasar has z=2.15 and is at the tip of an X-ray filament emerging
along the minor axis HI plume. Location at this point has an accidental
probability of ~2x10^-4. In addition a coincident chain of optical objects
coming out along the minor axis ends on this quasar. More recent measures on a
pair of strong X-ray sources situated at 3.2 and 5.4 arcmin on either side of
NGC3628 along its minor axis, reveal that they have nearly identical redshifts
of z=0.995 and 0.981. The closer quasar lies directly in the same X-ray
filament which extends from the nucleus out 4.1 arcmin to end on the quasar of
z=2.15. The chain of objects SW along the minor axis of NGC3628 has been imaged
in four colors with the VLT. Images and spectra of individual objects within
the filament are reported. It is suggested that material in various physical
states and differing intrinsic redshifts is ejected out along the minor axis of
this active, disturbed galaxy.
