We study a solar flare that occurred on September 10, 2002, in active region
NOAA 10105 starting around 14:52 UT and lasting approximately 5 minutes in the
radio range. The event was classified as M2.9 in X-rays and 1N in H\alpha.
Solar Submillimeter Telescope observations, in addition to microwave data give
us a good spectral coverage between 1.415 and 212 GHz. We combine these data
with ultraviolet images, hard and soft X-rays observations and full-disk
magnetograms. Images obtained from Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic
Imaging data are used to identify the locations of X-ray sources at different
energies and to determine the X-ray spectrum, while ultra violet images allow
us to characterize the coronal flaring region. The magnetic field evolution of
the active region is analyzed using Michelson Doppler Imager magnetograms. The
burst is detected at all available radio-frequencies. X-ray images (between 12
keV and 300 keV) reveal two compact sources and 212 GHz data, used to estimate
the radio source position, show a single compact source displaced by 25" from
one of the hard X-ray footpoints. We model the radio spectra using two
homogeneous sources, and combine this analysis with that of hard X-rays to
understand the dynamics of the particles. Relativistic particles, observed at
radio wavelengths above 50 GHz, have an electron index evolving with the
typical soft-hard-soft behaviour.
