The brightness of cloud bands on Jupiter and Saturn as a function of latitude
is reported. Bright Jovian bands near the equator are located in regions of
anti-cyclonic circulation of the atmosphere. By contrast, bright equatorial
bands on Saturn are associated with cyclonic motion. Modern definitions of the
cloud band terms 'zone' and 'belt' are distinguished from their old meanings.
