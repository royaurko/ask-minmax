The structure of proton drip line nuclei in the 60 < A < 100 mass range is
studied with the Relativistic Hartree Bogoliubov (RHB) model. For the elements
which determine the astrophysical rapid proton capture process path, the RHB
model predicts the location of the proton drip-line, the ground-state
quadrupole deformations and one-proton separation energies at and beyond the
drip-line. The results of the present theoretical investigation are compared
with available experimental data. For possible odd-Z ground state proton
emitters, the calculated deformed single-particle orbitals occupied by the odd
valence proton and the corresponding spectroscopic factors are compared with
predictions of the macroscopic-microscopic mass model.
