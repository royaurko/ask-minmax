We report results of our near-IR survey for variables in a field of view of
20 arcmin by 30 arcmin towards the Galactic Center (GC), where we detected 1364
long-period variables. We have established a method for the simultaneous
estimation of distances and extinctions using the period-luminosity relations
for the JHKs bands. Our method is applicable to Miras with periods in the range
100-350 days and mean magnitudes available in two or more filters. Here we
discuss 143 Miras whose distances and extinctions were obtained based on their
periods and H- and Ks-band magnitudes. We find that almost all of them are
located at the same distance to within our accuracy, and the distance modulus
of the GC is estimated to be 14.58+-0.02+-0.11 mag. The former error
corresponds to the statistical error and the latter to the systematic one which
includes the uncertainty of our assumed distance modulus of the LMC
(18.45+-0.05 mag). We also discuss the large and highly variable extinction
towards the GC.
