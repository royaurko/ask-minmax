We consider a model of lipids in which a head group, characterized by its
volume, is attached to two flexible tails of equal length. The phase diagram of
the anhydrous lipid is obtained within self-consistent field theory, and
displays, as a function of lipid architecture, a progression of phases:
body-centered cubic, hexagonal, gyroid, and lamellar. We then examine mixtures
of an inverted hexagonal forming lipid and a lamellar forming lipid. As the
volume fractions of the two lipids vary, we find that inverted hexagonal,
gyroid, or lamellar phases are formed. We demonstrate that the non-lamellar
forming lipid is found preferentially at locations which are difficult for the
lipid tails to reach. Variations in the volume fraction of each type of lipid
tail are on the order of one to ten per cent within regions dominated by the
tails. We also show that the variation in volume fraction is correlated
qualitatively with the variation in mean curvature of the head-tail interface.
