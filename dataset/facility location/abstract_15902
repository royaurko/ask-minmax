Networked applications have software components that reside on different
computers. Email, for example, has database, processing, and user interface
components that can be distributed across a network and shared by users in
different locations or work groups. End-to-end performance and reliability
metrics describe the software quality experienced by these groups of users,
taking into account all the software components in the pipeline. Each user
produces only some of the data needed to understand the quality of the
application for the group, so group performance metrics are obtained by
combining summary statistics that each end computer periodically (and
automatically) sends to a central server. The group quality metrics usually
focus on medians and tail quantiles rather than on averages. Distributed
quantile estimation is challenging, though, especially when passing large
amounts of data around the network solely to compute quality metrics is
undesirable. This paper describes an Incremental Quantile (IQ) estimation
method that is designed for performance monitoring at arbitrary levels of
network aggregation and time resolution when only a limited amount of data can
be transferred. Applications to both real and simulated data are provided.
