The first edition of GEMOC workshop was co-located with the MODELS 2013
conference in Miami, FL, USA. The workshop provided an open forum for sharing
experiences, problems and solutions related to the challenges of using of
multiple modeling languages in the development of complex software based
systems. During the workshop, concrete language composition artifacts,
approaches, and mechanisms were presented and discussed, ideas and opinions
exchanged, and constructive feedback provided to contributors of accepted papers. A
major objective was to encourage collaborations and to start building a
community that focused on providing solutions that support what we refer to as
the globalization of domain-specific modeling languages, that is, support
coordinated use of multiple languages throughout the development of complex
systems. This report summarizes the presentations and discussions that took
place in the first GEMOC 2013 workshop.
