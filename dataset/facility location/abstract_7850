Far away from any sunspot, a bright flare erupted on November 1st, 2014, with
onset at 4:44 UT and a duration of around three hours, causing a C2.7-class
flare. The blast was associated with the sudden disappearance of a large dark
solar filament. The rest of the filament flew out into space, forming the core
of a massive CME. Despite the location of the explosion over the sun's
southeastern region (near the eastern edge of the sun) not be geoeffective, a
radiation storm, that is, solar energetic particles (SEP) started to reach the
Earth around 14:00 UT, reaching the condition of an S1 (minor) radiation storm
level on Nov. 2th. In coincidence with onset of the S1 radiation storm (SEP
above 5 MeV), the Tupi telescopes located at $22^090'$S; $43^020'$W, within the
South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) detected a muon enhancement caused by relativistic
protons from this solar blast. In addition an increase in the particle
intensity was found also at South Pole neutron monitor. This means that there
was a transverse propagation to the interplanetary magnetic field of energetic
solar particles. However, we show that perpendicular diffusion alone cannot
explain these observations, it is necessary a combination with further
processes as a very high speed, at least of a fraction the CME shocks, close to
the ecliptic plane.
