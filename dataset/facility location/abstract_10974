Properties of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black-hole and naked-singularity
spacetimes with a nonzero cosmological constant are represented by their
geodetical structure and embedding diagrams of the central planes of both the
ordinary geometry and associated optical reference geometry. Motion of test
particles and photons is described in terms of an appropriate `effective
potential.' Circular geodesics are discussed and photon escape cones are
determined. In all asymptotically anti-dS black-hole spacetimes and some
asymptotically dS black-hole spacetimes a region containing stable circular
geodesics exists, which allows accretion processes in the disk regime. The
inner region is limited from below by particles with zero angular momentum that
are located in stable equilibrium positions. The inertial and gravitational
forces related to the optical reference geometry are introduced and specified
for the circular motion. It is shown how the properties of the centrifugal
force are closely related to the properties of the optical reference geometry
embedding diagrams.
