Graphene- the wonder material has attracted a great deal of attention from
varied fields of condensed matter physics, materials science and chemistry in
recent times. Its 2D atomic layer structure and unique electronic band
structure makes it attractive for many applications. Its high carrier mobility,
high electrical and thermal conductivity make it an exciting material. However,
its applicability cannot be effectively realised unless facile techniques to
synthesize high quality, large area graphene are developed in a cost effective
way. Besides that a great deal of effort is required to develop techniques for
modifying and opening its band structure so as to make it a potential
replacement for silicon in future electronics. Considerable research has been
carried out for synthesizing graphene and related materials by a variety of
processes and at the same time a great deal of work has also taken place for
manipulating and opening its electronic band structure. This review summarizes
recent developments in the synthesis methods for graphene. It also summarizes
the developments in graphene nanoribbon synthesis and methods to open band gap
in graphene, in addition to pointing out a direction for future research and
developments.
