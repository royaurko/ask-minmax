A simple method is presented for removing the amplitude, frequency and phase
modulations from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) data stream for
sources at any sky location. When combined with an excess power trigger or the
fast chirp transform, the total demodulation procedure allows the majority of
LISA sources to be identified without recourse to matched filtering.
