Continuum observations at radio, millimetre, infrared and soft X-ray energies
are presented for a sample of 22 quasars, consisting of flat and steep spectrum
radio loud, radio intermediate and radio quiet objects. The primary
observational distinctions, among the different kinds of quasars in the radio
and IR energy domains are studied using large observational datasets provided
by ISOPHOT on board the Infrared Space Observatory, by the IRAM interferometer,
by the sub-millimetre array SCUBA on JCMT, and by the European Southern
Observatory (ESO) facilities IRAC1 on the 2.2 m telescope and SEST.
  The spectral energy distributions of all quasars from radio to IR energies
are analyzed and modeled with non-thermal and thermal spectral components.
  The dominant mechanism emitting in the far/mid-IR is thermal dust emission in
all quasars, with the exception of flat spectrum radio loud quasars for which
the presence of thermal IR emission remains rather uncertain, since it is
difficult to separate it from the bright non-thermal component. The dust is
predominantly heated by the optical/ultraviolet radiation emitted from the
external components of the AGN. A starburst contributes to the IR emission at
different levels, but always less than the AGN (< 27%). The distribution of
temperatures, sizes, masses, and luminosities of the emitting dust are
independent of the quasar type.
