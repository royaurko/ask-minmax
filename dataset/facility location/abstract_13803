In this paper we present the performance evaluation for a MIMO in vivo WBAN
system, using ANSYS HFSS and the associated complete Human Body Model. We
analyzed MIMO system capacity statistically and FER performance based upon an
IEEE 802.11n system model, with receiver antennas placed at various angular
positions around the human body. We also analyzed MIMO system capacity with
receiver antennas at the front of the body at various distances from
transmitter antennas. The results were compared to SISO arrangements and we
demonstrate that by using 2x2 MIMO in vivo, better performance can be achieved,
and significantly higher system capacity can be achieved when receiver antennas
are located at the back of the body and in front of the body.
