In this paper we present results of two novel experimental methods to
investigate the collisional behavior of individual macroscopic icy bodies. The
experiments reported here were conducted in the microgravity environments of
parabolic flights and the Bremen drop tower facility. Using a cryogenic
parabolic-flight setup, we were able to capture 41 near-central collisions of
1.5-cm-sized ice spheres at relative velocities between 6 and $22 \mathrm{cm
s^{-1}}$. The analysis of the image sequences provides a uniform distribution
of coefficients of restitution with a mean value of $\overline{\varepsilon} =
0.45$ and values ranging from $\varepsilon = 0.06$ to 0.84. Additionally, we
designed a prototype drop tower experiment for collisions within an ensemble of
up to one hundred cm-sized projectiles and performed the first experiments with
solid glass beads. We were able to statistically analyze the development of the
kinetic energy of the entire system, which can be well explained by assuming a
granular `fluid' following Haff's law with a constant coefficient of
restitution of $\varepsilon = 0.64$. We could also show that the setup is
suitable for studying collisions at velocities of $< 5 \mathrm{mm s^{-1}}$
appropriate for collisions between particles in Saturn's dense main rings.
