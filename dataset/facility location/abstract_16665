With the proliferation of modern high-resolution measuring instruments
mounted on satellites, planes, ground-based vehicles and monitoring stations, a
need has arisen for statistical methods suitable for the analysis of large
spatial datasets observed on large spatial domains. Statistical analyses of
such datasets provide two main challenges: First, traditional
spatial-statistical techniques are often unable to handle large numbers of
observations in a computationally feasible way. Second, for large and
heterogeneous spatial domains, it is often not appropriate to assume that a
process of interest is stationary over the entire domain.
  We address the first challenge by using a model combining a low-rank
component, which allows for flexible modeling of medium-to-long-range
dependence via a set of spatial basis functions, with a tapered remainder
component, which allows for modeling of local dependence using a compactly
supported covariance function. Addressing the second challenge, we propose two
extensions to this model that result in increased flexibility: First, the model
is parameterized based on a nonstationary Matern covariance, where the
parameters vary smoothly across space. Second, in our fully Bayesian model, all
components and parameters are considered random, including the number,
locations, and shapes of the basis functions used in the low-rank component.
  Using simulated data and a real-world dataset of high-resolution soil
measurements, we show that both extensions can result in substantial
improvements over the current state-of-the-art.
