In this work we have estimated upper and lower limits to the strength of the
magnetic dipole moment of all 14 accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars observed
with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). For each source we searched the
archival RXTE data for the highest and lowest flux levels with a significant
detection of pulsations. We assume these flux levels to correspond to the
closest and farthest location of the inner edge of the accretion disk at which
channelled accretion takes place. By estimating the accretion rate from the
observed luminosity at these two flux levels, we place upper and lower limits
on the magnetic dipole moment of the neutron star, using assumptions from
standard magnetospheric accretion theory. Finally, we discuss how our field
strength estimates can be further improved as more information on these pulsars
is obtained.
