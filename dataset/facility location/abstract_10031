AliEn (ALICE Environment) is a lightweight GRID framework developed by the
Alice Collaboration. When the experiment starts running, it will collect data
at a rate of approximately 2 PB per year, producing O(109) files per year. All
these files, including all simulated events generated during the preparation
phase of the experiment, must be accounted and reliably tracked in the GRID
environment. The backbone of AliEn is a distributed file catalogue, which
associates universal logical file name to physical file names for each dataset
and provides transparent access to datasets independently of physical location.
The file replication and transport is carried out under the control of the File
Transport Broker. In addition, the file catalogue maintains information about
every job running in the system. The jobs are distributed by the Job Resource
Broker that is implemented using a simplified pull (as opposed to traditional
push) architecture. This paper describes the Job and File Transport Resource
Brokers and shows that a similar architecture can be applied to solve both
problems.
