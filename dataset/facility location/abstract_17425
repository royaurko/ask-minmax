We present detailed results from a recent microscopic theory of extremely
correlated Fermi liquids, applied to the t-J model in two dimensions. We use
typical sets of band parameters relevant to the cuprate superconductors. The
second order theory in the parameter \lambda is argued to be quantitatively
valid in the overdoped regime for 0 < n < 0.75 (n is the particle density). The
calculation involves the self consistent solution of equations for an auxiliary
Fermi liquid type Greens function and an adaptive spectral weight, or caparison
factor, described in recent papers by Shastry (Refs. (1) and (5)). We present
the numerical results at low as well as high T at various low to intermediate
densities in the normal phase with emphasis placed on features that are
experimentally accessible. We display the momentum space occupation function
m(k), various energy dispersions locating the peaks of spectral functions, the
optical conductivity, relaxation rates for quasiparticles, and the electronic
spectral functions along various directions in the Brillouin zone, and with
typical additional elastic scattering. The line-shapes have an asymmetric shape
and a broad background that is seen in experiments near and beyond optimal hole
doping, and validate approximate recent recent versions of the theory. The
results display features such as the high energy kink, and provide an in depth
understanding of its origin and dependence on band parameters.
