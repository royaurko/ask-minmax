By means of layer resolved ion irradiation the mechanisms involved in the
irradiation driven modifications of the exchange bias effect in NiFe/FeMn
bilayers have been investigated. It is shown that not only the locations of the
defects but also the magnetic coupling between both layers during the
irradiation process is of crucial importance. This requires an extension of
current models accounting for defects in exchange bias systems.
