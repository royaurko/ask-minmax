This work proposes an approach to locate leaks by identifying the parameters
of finite models associated with these fault events. The identification problem
is attacked by using well-known identification methods such as the Prediction
Error Method and extended Kalman filters. In addition, a frequency evaluation
is realized to check the conditions for implementing any method which require
an excitation condition.
