This paper presents a set of exploits an adversary can use to continuously
spy on most BitTorrent users of the Internet from a single machine and for a
long period of time. Using these exploits for a period of 103 days, we
collected 148 million IPs downloading 2 billion copies of contents. We identify
the IP address of the content providers for 70% of the BitTorrent contents we
spied on. We show that a few content providers inject most contents into
BitTorrent and that those content providers are located in foreign data
centers. We also show that an adversary can compromise the privacy of any peer
in BitTorrent and identify the big downloaders that we define as the peers who
subscribe to a large number of contents. This infringement on users' privacy
poses a significant impediment to the legal adoption of BitTorrent.
