In this paper, we consider a synchronization problem between nodes $A$ and
$B$ that are connected through a two--way communication channel. {Node $A$}
contains a binary file $X$ of length $n$ and {node $B$} contains a binary file
$Y$ that is generated by randomly deleting bits from $X$, by a small deletion
rate $\beta$. The location of deleted bits is not known to either node $A$ or
node $B$. We offer a deterministic synchronization scheme between nodes $A$ and
$B$ that needs a total of $O(n\beta\log \frac{1}{\beta})$ transmitted bits and
reconstructs $X$ at node $B$ with probability of error that is exponentially
low in the size of $X$. Orderwise, the rate of our scheme matches the optimal
rate for this channel.
