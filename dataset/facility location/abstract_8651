We demonstrate that conservation of global helicity plays only a minor role
in determining the nature and consequences of magnetic reconnection in the
solar atmosphere. First, we show that observations of the solar coronal
magnetic field are in direct conflict with Taylor's theory. Next, we present
results from three-dimensional MHD simulations of the shearing of bipolar and
multi-polar coronal magnetic fields by photospheric footpoint motions, and
discuss the implications of these results for Taylor's theory and for models of
solar activity. The key conclusion of this work is that significant magnetic
reconnection occurs only at very specific locations and, hence, the Sun's
magnetic field cannot relax completely down to the minimum energy state
predicted by conservation of global helicity.
