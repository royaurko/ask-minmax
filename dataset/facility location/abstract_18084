The frequency ratios $r_{01}$ and $r_{10}$ of KIC 11081729 decrease firstly
and then increase with frequency. These characteristics of the ratios can be
directly reproduced by the models with the overshooting parameter $\delta_{\rm
ov}$ between 1.7 and 1.8 and derive from the effects of both overshooting and
the acoustic glitch between radiative and overshooting regions. The effects of
the glitch on the ratios can be described by a function of sine, which depends
on the frequency $\nu_{0}$ of the mode whose inner turning point is just
located on the boundary between the radiative and overshooting regions. The
value of the $\nu_{0}$ decreases with the increase in the radius of the
overshooting region. The radius of the overshooting region increases with the
increase in $\delta_{\rm ov}$. Thus the distributions of the ratios are
sensitive to the value of $\delta_{\rm ov}$. The characteristics of the ratios
provide a strict constraint on stellar models and aid in determining the size
of the overshooting region. Observational constraints favor a star with
$M=1.23\pm0.02$ $M_{\odot}$, $R=1.41\pm0.01$ $R_{\odot}$, $L=3.07\pm0.12$
$L_{\odot}$, $t=4.4\pm0.8$ Gyr, and $\delta_{\rm ov}$ between 1.7 and 1.8.
