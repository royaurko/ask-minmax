Research on energy efficiency of today's buildings focuses on the monitoring
of a building's behavior while in operation. But without a formalized
description of the data measured, including their correlations and in
particular the expected measurements, the full potential of the collected data
can not necessarily be exploited. Who knows if a measured value is good or bad?
This problem becomes more virulent as smart control systems sometimes exhibit
intelligent, but unexpected behavior (e.g. starting heating at unconventional
times). Therefore we defined a methodology starting already at the design of
the building leading to a formalized specification of the implementation of a
building's management system, which seamlessly integrates to an intelligent
monitoring. DIN EN ISO 16484 proposes a method to describe functional
requirements in an easy to understand way. We extended its use of state
machines to our proposed concept of state based modeling. This proved to be a
wholesome approach to easily model buildings and facilities according to the
DIN EN ISO 16484 while providing the possibility to apply sophisticated and
meaningful analysis methods during monitoring.
