Continuous phase transitions are studied in a two dimensional nonequilibrium
model with an infinite number of absorbing configurations. Spreading from a
localized source is characterized by nonuniversal critical exponents, which
vary continuously with the density phi in the surrounding region. The exponent
delta changes by more than an order of magnitude, and eta changes sign. The
location of the critical point also depends on phi, which has important
implications for scaling. As expected on the basis of universality, the static
critical behavior belongs to the directed percolation class.
