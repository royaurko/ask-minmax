Development of neutron-rich radioactive beams at the HRIBF facility has
stimulated experimental and theoretical activity in heavy Sn and Te isotopes.
Recently, the g-factor of the first 2$^+$ state in $^{132}$Te has been
measured. We report here new shell-model calculation of magnetic moments for
selected Sn and Te isotopes. The residual interaction is based on the CD-Bonn
renormalized $ G $-matrix. Single-particle spin and orbital effective g-factors
are evaluated microscopically including core polarization and meson exchange
currents effects.
