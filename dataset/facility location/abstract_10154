The MACRO detector was located in the Hall B of the Gran Sasso underground
Laboratories under an average rock overburden of 3700 hg/cm^2. A transition
radiation detector composed of three identical modules, covering a total
horizontal area of 36 m^2, was installed inside the empty upper part of the
detector in order to measure the residual energy of muons. This paper presents
the measurement of the residual energy of single and double muons crossing the
apparatus. Our data show that double muons are more energetic than single ones.
This measurement is performed over a standard rock depth range from 3000 to
6500 hg/cm^2.
