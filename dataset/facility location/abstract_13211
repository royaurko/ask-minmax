Localization plays an essential role in many ubiquitous computing
applications. While the outdoor location-aware services based on GPS are
becoming increasingly popular, their proliferation to indoor environments is
limited due to the lack of widely available indoor localization systems. The
de-facto standard for indoor positioning is based on Wi-Fi and while other
localization alternatives exist, they either require expensive hardware or
provide a low accuracy. This paper presents an investigation into localization
system that leverages signals of broadcasting FM radio stations. The FM
stations provide a worldwide coverage, while FM tuners are readily available in
many mobile devices. The experimental results show that FM radio can be used
for indoor localization, while providing longer battery life than Wi-Fi, making
FM an alternative to consider for positioning.
