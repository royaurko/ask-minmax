We present new results from our ongoing multiplicity study of exoplanet host
stars, carried out with the infrared camera SofI at ESO-NTT. We have identified
new low mass companions to the planet host stars HD101930 and HD65216.
HD101930AB is a wide binary systems composed of the planet host star HD101930A
and its companion HD101930B which is a M0 to M1 dwarf with a mass of about
0.7Msun separated from the primary by ~73arcsec (2200AU projected separation).
HD65216 forms a hierarchical triple system, with a projected separation of
253AU (angular separation of about 7arcsec) between the planet host star
HD65216A and its close binary companion HD65216BC, whose two components are
separated by only ~0.17arcsec (6AU of projected separation). Two VLT-NACO
images separated by 3 years confirm that this system is co-moving to the planet
host star. The infrared photometry of HD65216B and C is consistent with a M7 to
M8 (0.089Msun), and a L2 to L3 dwarf (0.078Msun), respectively, both close to
the sub-stellar limit. An infrared spectrum with VLT-ISAAC of the pair
HD65216BC, even though not resolved spatially, confirms this late spectral
type. Furthermore, we present H- and K-band ISAAC infrared spectra of HD16141B,
the recently detected co-moving companion of the planet host star HD16141A. The
infrared spectroscopy as well as the apparent infrared photometry of HD16141B
are both fully consistent with a M2 to M3 dwarf located at the distance of the
planet host star.
