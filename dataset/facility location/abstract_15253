The direction dependence of the WIMP direct detection rate provides a
powerful tool for distinguishing a WIMP signal from possible backgrounds. We
study the the number of events required to discriminate a WIMP signal from an
isotropic background for a detector with 2-d read-out using non-parametric
circular statistics. We also examine the number of events needed to i) detect a
deviation from rotational symmetry, due to flattening of the Milky Way halo and
ii) detect a deviation in the mean direction due to a tidal stream. If the
senses of the recoils are measured then of order 20-70 events (depending on the
plane of the 2-d read out) will be sufficient to reject isotropy of the raw
recoil angles at 90% confidence. If the senses can not be measured these number
increase by roughly two orders of magnitude (compared with an increase of one
order of magnitude for the case of full 3-d read-out). The distributions of the
reduced angles, with the (time dependent) direction of solar motion subtracted,
are far more anisotropic, however, and if the isotropy tests are applied to
these angles then the numbers of events required are similar to the case of 3-d
read-out. A deviation from rotational symmetry will only be detectable if the
Milky Way halo is significantly flattened. The deviation in the mean direction
due to a tidal stream is potentially detectable, however, depending on the
density and direction of the stream.
