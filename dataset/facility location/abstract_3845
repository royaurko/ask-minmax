The latest, production, version of the Los Alamos Monte Carlo N-Particle
transport code MCNP6 has been used to simulate a variety of particle-nucleus
and nucleus-nucleus reactions of academic and applied interest to the Facility
for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), medical isotope production, space-radiation
shielding, cosmic-ray propagation, and accelerator applications, including
several reactions induced by radioactive isotopes, analyzing production of both
stable and radioactive residual nuclei. Here, we discuss examples of validation
and verification of MCNP6 compared to recent neutron spectra measured at the
Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba, Japan; to spectra of light fragments
from several reactions measured recently at GANIL, France; INFN Laboratori
Nazionali del Sud, Catania, Italy; COSY of the Julich Research Center, Germany;
and to cross sections of products from several reactions measured lately at
GSI, Darmstadt, Germany; ITEP, Moscow, Russia; LANSCE, LANL, Los Alamos, USA.
As a rule, MCNP6 provides quite good predictions for most of the reactions we
analyzed so far, allowing us to conclude that it can be used as a reliable and
useful simulation tool for FRIB, medical, and space applications involving
stable and radioactive isotopes.
