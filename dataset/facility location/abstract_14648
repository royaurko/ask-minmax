We present redshift measurements of four faint galaxies around the archetypal
ultraluminous infrared galaxy Arp 220. These galaxies have significantly higher
redshifts ($z \sim$ 0.036 -- 0.091) than that of Arp 220 ($z \simeq 0.018$).
Therefore, we conclude that they are background objects not physically related
to Arp 220. Three of these faint galaxies located to the south of Arp 220 are a
group of galaxies (or the brightest members in a cluster of galaxies) at $z
\simeq 0.09$, as suggested by Heckman et al. [1996, ApJ, 457, 616] on the basis
of their associated soft X-ray emission.
  We also report the serendipitous discovery of three additional galaxies at
redshift $z \sim 0.5$, found along one of the slit positions. All three
galaxies exhibit an [O ii] \lambda 3727 emission line. The spectrum of the
brightest galaxy ($m_R \simeq 24.4$) shows other strong emission lines: Mg ii
\lambda 2798, H \beta, [O iii] \lambda 4959, and [O iii] \lambda 5007. The
emission-line properties of these galaxies as well as their intrinsically low
luminosities ($M_R \geq -18.4$) indicate that they are star-forming dwarf
galaxies.
