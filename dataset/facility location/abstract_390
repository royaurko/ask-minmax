A multi-MW proton facility, Project X has been proposed and is currently
under development at Fermilab. As part of this development program, we are
constructing a prototype of the front end of the Project X linac at Fermilab.
The construction and successful operations of this facility will validate the
concept for the Project X front end, thereby minimizing the primary technical
risk element within the Project. The Project X Injector Experiment (PXIE) can
be constructed over the period FY12-16 and will include an H- ion source, a CW
2.1-MeV RFQ and two SC cryomodules providing up to 30 MeV energy gain at an
average beam current of 1 mA. Successful operations of the facility will
demonstrate the viability of novel front end technologies that will find
applications beyond Project X in the longer term.
