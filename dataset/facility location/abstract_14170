Visible light communication (VLC) using light-emitting-diodes (LEDs) has been
a popular research area recently. VLC can provide a practical solution for
indoor positioning. In this paper, the impact of multipath reflections on
indoor VLC positioning is investigated, considering a complex indoor
environment with walls, floor and ceiling. For the proposed positioning system,
an LED bulb is the transmitter and a photo-diode (PD) is the receiver to detect
received signal strength (RSS) information. Combined deterministic and modified
Monte Carlo (CDMMC) method is applied to compute the impulse response of the
optical channel. Since power attenuation is applied to calculate the distance
between the transmitter and receiver, the received power from each reflection
order is analyzed. Finally, the positioning errors are estimated for all the
locations over the room and compared with the previous works where no
reflections considered. Three calibration approaches are proposed to decrease
the effect of multipath reflections.
