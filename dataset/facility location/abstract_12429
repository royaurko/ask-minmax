Context. We consider a localized pulse in the component of velocity, parallel
to the ambient magnetic field lines, that is initially launched in the solar
chromosphere. Aims. We aim to generalize the recent numerical model of spicule
formation (Murawski & Zaqarashvili 2010) by implementing a VAL-C model of solar
temperature. Methods. With the use of the code FLASH we solve two-dimensional
ideal magnetohydrodynamic equations numerically to simulate the solar
macrospicules. Results. Our numerical results reveal that the pulse located
below the transition region triggers plasma perturbations, which exhibit many
features of macrospicules. We also present an observational (SDO/AIA 304 A)
case study of the macrospicule that approximately mimics the numerical
simulations. Conclusions. In the frame of the model we devised, the solar
macrospicules can be triggered by velocity pulses launched from the
chromosphere.
