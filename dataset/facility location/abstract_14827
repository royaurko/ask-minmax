We discuss a Modified Field Theory (MOFT) in which the number of fields can
vary. It is shown that when the number of fields is conserved MOFT reduces to
the standard field theory but interaction constants undergo an additional
renormalization and acquire a dependence on spatial scales. In particular, the
renormalization of the gravitational constant leads to the deviation of the law
of gravity from the Newton's law in some range of scales $r_{\min}<r<r_{\max
}$, in which the gravitational potential shows essentially logarithmic $\sim
\ln r$ (instead of $1/r$) behavior. In this range, the renormalized value of
the gravitational constant $G$ increases and at scales $r > r_{\max}$ acquires
a new constant value $G^{\prime}\sim Gr_{\max}/r_{\min}$. From the dynamical
standpoint this looks as if every point source is surrounded with a halo of
dark matter. It is also shown that if the maximal scale $r_{\max}$ is absent,
the homogeneity of the dark matter in the Universe is consistent with a fractal
distribution of baryons in space, in which the luminous matter is located on
thin two-dimensional surfaces separated by empty regions of ever growing size.
