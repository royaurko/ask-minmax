Cloud computing is rapidly emerging as a new paradigm for delivering IT
services as utlity-oriented services on subscription-basis. The rapid
development of applications and their deployment in Cloud computing
environments in efficient manner is a complex task. In this article, we give a
brief introduction to Cloud computing technology and Platform as a Service, we
examine the offerings in this category, and provide the basis for helping
readers to understand basic application platform opportunities in Cloud by
technologies such as Microsoft Azure, Sales Force, Google App, and Aneka for
Cloud computing. We demonstrate that Manjrasoft Aneka is a Cloud Application
Platform (CAP) leveraging these concepts and allowing an easy development of
Cloud ready applications on a Private/Public/Hybrid Cloud. Aneka CAP offers
facilities for quickly developing Cloud applications and a modular platform
where additional services can be easily integrated to extend the system
capabilities, thus being at pace with the rapidly evolution of Cloud computing.
