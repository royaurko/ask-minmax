A cascaded iterative Fourier transform (CIFT) algorithm is presented for
optical security applications. Two phase-masks are designed and located in the
input and the Fourier domains of a 4-f correlator respectively, in order to
implement the optical encryption or authenticity verification. Compared with
previous methods, the proposed algorithm employs an improved searching
strategy: modifying the phase-distributions of both masks synchronously as well
as enlarging the searching space. Computer simulations show that the algorithm
results in much faster convergence and better image quality for the recovered
image. Each of these masks is assigned to different person. Therefore, the
decrypted image can be obtained only when all these masks are under
contributorization. This key-assignment strategy may reduce the risk of being
intruded.
