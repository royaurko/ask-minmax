Coronagraphic imagery of the circumstellar disk around HD 169142 in H-band
polarized intensity (PI) with Subaru/HiCIAO is presented. The emission
scattered by dust particles at the disk surface in 0.2" <= r <= 1.2", or 29 <=
r <= 174 AU, is successfully detected. The azimuthally-averaged radial profile
of the PI shows a double power-law distribution, in which the PIs in r=29-52 AU
and r=81.2-145 AU respectively show r^{-3}-dependence. These two power-law
regions are connected smoothly with a transition zone (TZ), exhibiting an
apparent gap in r=40-70 AU. The PI in the inner power-law region shows a deep
minimum whose location seems to coincide with the point source at \lambda = 7
mm. This can be regarded as another sign of a protoplanet in TZ. The observed
radial profile of the PI is reproduced by a minimally flaring disk with an
irregular surface density distribution or with an irregular temperature
distribution or with the combination of both. The depletion factor of surface
density in the inner power-law region (r< 50 AU) is derived to be <= 0.16 from
a simple model calculation. The obtained PI image also shows small scale
asymmetries in the outer power-law region. Possible origins for these
asymmetries include corrugation of the scattering surface in the outer region,
and shadowing effect by a puffed up structure in the inner power-law region.
