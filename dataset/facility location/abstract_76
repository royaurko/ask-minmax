Starlight from distant galaxies ($z > 3$) is redshifted into the near
infrared band with observed wavelengths from 2-8 $\mu$m. Most of the light is
emitted by stars that have a peak emission at the 1.6 $\mu$m wavelength of the
minimum of the H$^-$ opacity. We present simulated images of galaxy and star
fields at 3, 4.7 and 8 $\mu$m, using the expected performance of the infrared
camera on the Space InfraRed Telescope Facility (SIRTF). Standard astronomical
image processing tools are used to locate sources, distinguish stars from
galaxies, and create color-magnitude and color-color diagrams for the galaxies.
