In this paper we present clustering method is very sensitive to the initial
center values, requirements on the data set too high, and cannot handle noisy
data the proposal method is using information entropy to initialize the cluster
centers and introduce weighting parameters to adjust the location of cluster
centers and noise problems.The navigation datasets which are sequential in
nature, Clustering web data is finding the groups which share common interests
and behavior by analyzing the data collected in the web servers, this improves
clustering on web data efficiently using improved fuzzy c-means(FCM)
clustering. Web usage mining is the application of data mining techniques to
web log data repositories. It is used in finding the user access patterns from
web access log. Web data Clusters are formed using on MSNBC web navigation
dataset.
