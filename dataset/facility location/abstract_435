We introduce PIRATE, a new remotely-operable telescope facility for use in
research and education, constructed from 'off-the-shelf' hardware, operated by
The Open University. We focus on the PIRATE Mark 1 operational phase where
PIRATE was equipped with a widely- used 0.35m Schmidt-Cassegrain system (now
replaced with a 0.425m corrected Dall Kirkham astrograph). Situated at the
Observatori Astronomic de Mallorca, PIRATE is currently used to follow up
potential transiting extrasolar planet candidates produced by the SuperWASP
North experiment, as well as to hunt for novae in M31 and other nearby
galaxies. It is operated by a mixture of commercially available software and
proprietary software developed at the Open University. We discuss problems
associated with performing precision time series photometry when using a German
Equatorial Mount, investigating the overall performance of such 'off-the-shelf'
solutions in both research and teaching applications. We conclude that PIRATE
is a cost-effective research facility, and also provides exciting prospects for
undergraduate astronomy. PIRATE has broken new ground in offering practical
astronomy education to distance-learning students in their own homes.
