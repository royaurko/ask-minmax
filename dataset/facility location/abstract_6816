When a drop impacts at very low velocity onto a pool surface it is cushioned
by a thin layer of air, which can be stretched into a hemispheric shape. We use
ultra-high-speed video imaging to show how this thin air-layer ruptures. The
number and locations of these ruptures determines the morphology of the
resulting myriad of micro-bubbles. This fluid dynamics video is submitted to
the APS DFD Gallery of Fluid Motion 2012, part of the 65th Annual Meeting of
the American Physical Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics (18-20 November, San
Diego, CA, USA).
