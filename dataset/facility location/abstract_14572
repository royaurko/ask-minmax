The data from solar neutrino experiments together with standard solar model
predictions are used in order to derive the possible profile of the magnetic
field inside the Sun, assuming the existence of a sizeable neutrino magnetic
moment and the resonant spin flavour mechanism. The procedure is based on the
relationship between resonance location and the energy dependent neutrino
suppression, so that a large neutrino suppression at a given energy is taken to
be connected to a large magnetic field in a given region of the Sun. In this
way it is found that the solar field must undergo a very sharp increase by a
factor of at least 6 - 7 over a distance no longer than 7 - 10% of the solar
radius, decreasing gradually towards the surface. The range in which this sharp
increase occurs is likely to be the bottom of the convective zone. There are
also indications in favour of the downward slope being stronger at the start
and more moderate on approaching the solar surface. Typical ranges for the
magnetic moment are from a few times 10^{-13}\mu_B to its laboratory upper
bounds while the mass square difference between neutrino flavours is of order
(0.6-1.9) x 10^{-8}eV^2.
