This paper studies the identification and estimation of weighted average
derivatives of conditional location functionals including conditional mean and
conditional quantiles in settings where either the outcome variable or a
regressor is interval-valued. Building on Manski and Tamer (2002) who study
nonparametric bounds for mean regression with interval data, we characterize
the identified set of weighted average derivatives of regression functions.
Since the weighted average derivatives do not rely on parametric specifications
for the regression functions, the identified set is well-defined without any
parametric assumptions. Under general conditions, the identified set is compact
and convex and hence admits characterization by its support function. Using
this characterization, we derive the semiparametric efficiency bound of the
support function when the outcome variable is interval-valued. We illustrate
efficient estimation by constructing an efficient estimator of the support
function for the case of mean regression with an interval censored outcome.
