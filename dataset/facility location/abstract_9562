We study the form of the luminosity distance as a function of redshift in the
presence of large scale inhomogeneities, with sizes of order 10 Mpc or larger.
We approximate the Universe through the Swiss-cheese model, with each spherical
region described by the Tolman-Bondi metric. We study the propagation of light
beams in this background, assuming that the locations of the source and the
observer are random. We derive the optical equations for the evolution of the
beam area and shear. Through their integration we determine the configurations
that can lead to an increase of the luminosity distance relative to the
homogeneous cosmology. We find that this can be achieved if the Universe is
composed of spherical void-like regions, with matter concentrated near their
surface. For inhomogeneities consistent with the observed large scale
structure, the relative increase of the luminosity distance is of the order of
a few percent at redshifts near 1, and falls short of explaining the
substantial increase required by the supernova data. On the other hand, the
effect we describe is important for the correct determination of the energy
content of the Universe from observations.
