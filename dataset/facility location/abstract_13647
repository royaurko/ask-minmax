LensExplorer is an IDL GUI code that can be used to visualize the lensing
deflection field derived in the Hubble Frontier Fields clusters. The code can
be used for both, research and educational purposes as it offers and intuitive
and user friendly way to explore the solutions in the different clusters.
LensExplorer can be used to predict the magnifications at different redshifts
of background sources and for a given location. We present in this document a
quick guide to get started with LensExplorer. The code and lens models for the
cluster A2744 and MACSJ0416.1-2403 are publicly available from this website
http://www.ifca.unican.es/users/jdiego/LensExplorer/ where the new solutions
(and new versions of the code) will be also uploaded as they become available.
