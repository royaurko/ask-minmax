We present a rare observation of direct magnetic interaction between an
activating filament and a coronal hole (CH). The filament was a quiescent one
located at the northwest of the CH. It underwent a nonradial activation, during
which filament material constantly fell and intruded into the CH. As a result,
the CH was clearly destroyed by the intrusion. Brightenings appeared at the
boundaries and in the interior of the CH, meanwhile, its west boundaries began
to retreat and the area gradually shrank. It is noted that the CH went on
shrinking after the end of the intrusion and finally disappeared entirely.
Following the filament activation, three coronal dimmings (D1-D3) were formed,
among which D1 and D2 persisted throughout the complete disappearance of the
CH. The derived coronal magnetic configuration shows that the filament was
located below an extended loop system which obviously linked D1 to D2. By
comparison with this result of extrapolation, our observations imply that the
interaction between the filament and the CH involved direct intrusion of the
filament material to the CH and the disappearance of the CH might be due to
interchange reconnection between the expanding loop system and the CH's open
field.
