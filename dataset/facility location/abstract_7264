We present observational evidence that the OH/IR star OH 12.8-0.9 is the
fourth in a class of objects previously dubbed "water-fountain" sources. Using
the Very Long Baseline Array, we produced the first images of the water maser
emission associated with OH 12.8-0.9. We find that the masers are located in
two compact regions with an angular separation of ~109 mas on the sky. The axis
of separation between the two maser regions is at a position angle of 1.5 deg.
East of North with the blue-shifted (-80.5 to -85.5 km/s) masers located to the
North and the red-shifted (-32.0 to -35.5 km/s) masers to the South. In
addition, we find that the blue- and red-shifted masers are distributed along
arc-like structures ~10-12 mas across oriented roughly perpendicular to the
separation axis. The morphology exhibited by the water masers is suggestive of
an axisymmetric wind with the masers tracing bow shocks formed as the wind
impacts the ambient medium. This bipolar jet-like structure is typical of the
three other confirmed water-fountain sources. When combined with the previously
observed spectral characteristics of OH 12.8-0.9, the observed spatio-kinematic
structure of the water masers provides strong evidence that OH 12.8-0.9 is
indeed a member of the water-fountain class.
