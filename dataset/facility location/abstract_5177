Place cells in the rat hippocampus play a key role in creating the animal's
internal representation of the world. During active navigation, these cells
spike only in discrete locations, together encoding a map of the environment.
One important phenomenon is that the animal can replay, during both sleep and
awake states, sequences of place cells that correspond to the sequences of
previously visited locations. Although it can be argued that consistency of
place cell activity during active navigation is enforced by sensory and
proprioceptive inputs, it remains unclear whether a consistent representation
of space can be maintained during spontaneous replay. We propose a model that
demonstrates that a spatially-consistent replay is possible, but requires
imposing a number of constraints on the hippocampal network which affect its
synaptic architecture and the statistics of synaptic connection strengths.
