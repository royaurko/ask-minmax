We observed spectroscopically the eclipsing binary system T-Cyg1-01385 in
order to determine physical properties of the components. The double-lined
nature of the system is revealed for the first time and the radial velocities
are obtained for both stars. We have derived masses, radii and luminosities for
both components. Analyses of the radial velocities and the KeplerCam and the
T$r$ES light curves yielded masses of M$_1$=1.059$\pm$0.032 \Msun ~and
M$_2$=0.342$\pm$0.017 {\Msun} and radii of R$_1$=1.989$\pm$0.022 {\Rsun} and
R$_2$=0.457$\pm$0.013 {\Rsun}. Locations of the low-mass companion in the
mass-radius and mass-effective temperature planes and comparison with the other
low-mass stars show that the secondary star appears just at the transition from
partially to fully convective interiors for the M dwarfs. When compared to
stellar evolution models, the luminosities and effective temperatures of the
components are consistent with Z=0.004 and an age of about 6 Gyr. A distance to
the system was calculated as d=355$\pm$7 pc using the BV and JHK magnitudes.
