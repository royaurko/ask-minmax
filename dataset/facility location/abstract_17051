The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) utilizes large mass, 3" diameter
$\times$ 1" thick target masses as particle detectors. The target is
instrumented with both phonon and ionization sensors and comparison of energy
in each channel provides event-by-event classification of electron and nuclear
recoils. Fiducial volume is determined by the ability to obtain good phonon and
ionization signal at a particular location. Due to electronic band structure in
germanium, electron mass is described by an anisotropic tensor with heavy mass
aligned along the symmetry axis defined by the [111] Miller index (L valley),
resulting in large lateral component to the transport. The spatial distribution
of electrons varies significantly for detectors which have their longitudinal
axis orientations described by either the [100] or [111] Miller indices.
Electric fields with large fringing component at high detector radius also
affect the spatial distribution of electrons and holes. Both effects are
studied in a 3 dimensional Monte Carlo and the impact on fiducial volume is
discussed.
