The launch of the Chandra X-ray Observatory in July 1999 opened a new era in
X-ray astronomy. Its unprecedented, <0.5" spatial resolution and low background
are providing views of the X-ray sky 10-100 times fainter than previously
possible. We have initiated a serendipitous survey (ChaMP) using Chandra
archival data to flux limits covering the range between those reached by
current satellites and those of the small area Chandra deep surveys. We
estimate the survey will cover ~5 sq.deg./year to X-ray fluxes (2-10 keV) in
the range 1E(-13)-6E(-16) erg/cm^2/s discovering ~2000 new X-ray sources, ~80%
of which are expected to be AGN. The ChaMP has two parts, the extragalactic
survey (ChaMP) and the galactic plane survey (ChaMPlane). ChaMP promises
profoundly new science return on a number of key questions at the current
frontier of many areas of astronomy including (1) locating and studying high
redshift clusters and so constraining cosmological parameters (2) defining the
true population of AGN, including those that are absorbed, and so constraining
the accretion history of the universe, (3) filling in the gap in the
luminosity/redshift plane between Chandra deep and previous surveys in studying
the CXRB, (4) studying coronal emission from late-type stars and (5) search for
CVs and quiescent Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (qLXMBs) to measure their luminosity
functions. In this paper we summarize the status, predictions and initial
results from the X-ray analysis and optical imaging.
