We present far-infrared maps and spectroscopy for a number of deeply embedded
protostellar objects (CepE, HH211-MM, IC1396W, L1157, L1211, and RNO15FIR) from
data that we acquired with the ISO instruments PHOT and LWS. Several previously
undetected deeply embedded sources are found in the vicinity of our targets. We
determine temperatures and luminosities of seven objects and locate them on a
Lbol-Tbol diagram - the equivalent to a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for
protostars. Their masses and ages, according to their location on tracks taken
from our evolutionary model, are derived. L1211 and CepE appear to be
intermediate mass objects which will reach final masses of about 3Mo, while the
other sources are in or below the solar mass range. The derived ages of 15000
to 30000yr are consistent with their current Class0 state. A comparison of the
luminosity of the associated outflows in the 1-0S(1) line of molecular hydrogen
with the source properties (bolometric luminosity, bolometric temperature, and
envelope mass) of 16 Class0 sources shows no statistically significant
correlations. Nevertheless, the data are consistent with a scheme in which the
outflow strength and protostar evolve simultaneously. We show that the
relationship is partially disguised, however, by the local properties of the
surrounding material, the extinction, and short-term flux variability.
