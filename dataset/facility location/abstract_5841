Key features of antiferromagnetic dynamical correlations in high-$T_C$
superconductors cuprates are discussed. In underdoped regime, the sharp
resonance peak, occuring exclusively in the SC state, is accompanied by a
broader contribution located around $\sim$ 30 meV which remains above $T_C$.
Their interplay may induce incommensurate structure in the superconducting
state.
