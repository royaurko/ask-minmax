We report the development of a new tool to determine the origin of
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in accretion disk systems. The technique
uses the source energy spectrum and the energy dependence of the QPO fractional
amplitude to restrict the location of the emission region of the modulated
photons, which are assumed to originate in the inner accretion disk. Both Monte
Carlo and semi-analytical methods are presented. We assume the accretion disk
is enshrouded by a slab atmosphere of hot electrons in which unsaturated
Compton scattering produces the high-energy spectrum. Properties of the
atmosphere, in particular the electron temperature, are assumed functions of
radius from the central compact object. We show that our model reproduces the
observed energy dependence of the fractional amplitude of the 67 Hz QPO in GRS
1915+105 if the QPO is assumed to originate within five gravitational radii
from the innermost stable circular orbit.
