The dynamics of the movement of gas is discussed for two-chambered polarized
He-3 target cells of the sort that have been used successfully for many
electron scattering experiments. A detailed analysis is presented showing that
diffusion is a limiting factor in target performance, particularly as these
targets are run at increasingly high luminosities. Measurements are presented
on a new prototype polarized He-3 target cell in which the movement of gas is
due largely to convection instead of diffusion. NMR tagging techniques have
been used to visualize the gas flow, showing velocities along a
cylindrically-shaped target of between 5-80 cm/min. The new target design
addresses one of the principle obstacles to running polarized He-3 targets at
substantially higher luminosities while simultaneously providing new
flexibility in target geometry.
