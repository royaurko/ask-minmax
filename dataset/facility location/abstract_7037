We construct gauge invariant 1PI effective action for the NS sector of type
II and heterotic string field theory. By construction, zero eigenvalues of the
kinetic operator of this action determine the renormalized physical masses, and
tree level amplitudes computed from this action (after gauge fixing) give the
loop corrected S-matrix elements. Using this formalism we can give a simple
proof of the result that the renormalized physical masses do not depend on the
choice of local coordinate system and locations of picture changing operators
used in defining the off-shell amplitude. We also eliminate the need for an
infrared regulator in dealing with tadpoles of massless fields.
