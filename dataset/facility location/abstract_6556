Magnetic impurities adsorbed on graphene are coupled magnetically via the
itinerant electrons. This interaction opens a gap in the band structure of
graphene. The result strongly depends on how the magnetic impurities are
distributed. While random doping produces a semiconductor, if all or most
impurities are located in the same sublattice, the spin degeneracy is removed
and a spin-polarized semiconductor arises.
