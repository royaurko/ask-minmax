Using a novel differential magneto-optical imaging technique we investigate
the phenomenon of vortex lattice melting in crystals of Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8
(BSCCO). The images of melting reveal complex patterns in the formation and
evolution of the vortex solid-liquid interface with varying field (H) or
temperature (T). We believe that the complex melting patterns are due to a
random distribution of material disorder or inhomogeneities across the sample,
which create fluctuations in the local melting temperature or field value. To
study the fluctuations in the local melting temperature / field, we have
constructed maps of the melting landscape T_m(H,r), viz., the melting
temperature (T_m) at a given location (r) in the sample at a given field (H). A
study of these melting landscapes reveals an unexpected feature: the melting
landscape is not fixed, but changes rather dramatically with varying field and
temperature along the melting line. It is concluded that the changes in both
the scale and shape of the landscape result from the competing contributions of
different types of quenched disorder which have opposite effects on the local
melting transition.
