Nowadays, the majority of RSS feeds provide incomplete information about
their news items. The lack of information leads to engagement loss in users. We
present a new automated system for improving the RSS feeds' data quality. RSS
feeds provide a list of the latest news items ordered by date. Therefore, it
makes it easy for a web crawler to precisely locate the item and extract its
raw content. Then it identifies where the main content is located and extracts:
main text corpus, relevant keywords, bigrams, best image and predicts the
category of the item. The output of the system is an enhanced RSS feed. The
proposed system showed an average item data quality improvement from 39.98% to
95.62%.
