We discuss the first results from ongoing studies of the resolved stellar
populations in the outskirts of our nearest large neighbour, M31. Deep
HST/WFPC2 archival observations are used to construct colour-magnitude-diagrams
which reach well below the horizontal branch at selected locations in the outer
disk and halo, while a panoramic ground-based imaging survey maps spatial
density variations through resolved star counts to a projected radius of ~50
kpc.
