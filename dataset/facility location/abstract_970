Theoretical and experimental studies of PXR and diffracted radiation of an
oscillator in crystals combined with the development of VFEL generators with
photonic crystals give a promising basis for creation of X-ray and THz sources
using the same table-top accelerator. Multi-modal medical facility can be
developed on the basis of one dedicated table-top electron accelerator of some
tens of MeV energy. Such a system could find a lot of applications in medical
practice and biomedical investigations.
