In this paper, the flow around each ring-like vortex is investigated by high
order DNS including first sweep, first ejection, second sweep, second ejection,
positive spike, momentum deficit, vortex shape, vortex location, strength of
sweeps, etc. Meanwhile, the mechanism about formation of momentum deficit is
deeply studied. A new mechanism on how the multiple rings are formed one by one
found both by experiment and by DNS in late boundary layer transition is
presented. It also reveals that the relation between streamwise vortex and
spanvise vertex rings, and how the vorticity is transferred between them.
