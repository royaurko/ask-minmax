We report the discovery of an unusual source of extended X-ray emission CXOU
J184846.3-013040 (`The Stem') located on the outskirts of the globular cluster
GLIMPSE-C01. No point-like source falls within the extended emission which has
an X-ray luminosity L_X =10^{32} ergs/s and a physical size of 0.1 pc at the
inferred distance to the cluster. These X-ray properties are consistent with
the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) of an unseen pulsar located within the 95-percent
confidence error contour of unidentified Fermi gamma-ray source 0FGL
J1848.6-0138. However, we cannot exclude an alternative interpretation that
postulates X-ray emission associated with a bow shock produced from the
interaction of the globular cluster and interstellar gas in the Galactic plane.
Analysis of the X-ray data reveals that `The Stem' is most significant in the
2-5 keV band, which suggests that the emission may be dominated by non-thermal
bremsstrahlung from suprathermal electrons at the bow shock. If the bow shock
interpretation is correct, these observations would provide compelling evidence
that GLIMPSE-C01 is shedding its intracluster gas during a galactic passage.
Such a direct detection of gas stripping would help clarify a crucial step in
the evolutionary history of globular clusters. Intriguingly, the data may also
accommodate a new type of X-ray source.
