We introduce the optimal obstacle placement with disambiguations problem
wherein the goal is to place true obstacles in an environment cluttered with
false obstacles so as to maximize the total traversal length of a navigating
agent (NAVA). Prior to the traversal, the NAVA is given location information
and probabilistic estimates of each disk-shaped hindrance (hereinafter referred
to as disk) being a true obstacle. The NAVA can disambiguate a disk's status
only when situated on its boundary. There exists an obstacle placing agent
(OPA) that locates obstacles prior to the NAVA's traversal. The goal of the OPA
is to place true obstacles in between the clutter in such a way that the NAVA's
traversal length is maximized in a game-theoretic sense. We assume the OPA
knows the clutter spatial distribution type, but not the exact locations of
clutter disks. We analyze the traversal length using repeated measures analysis
of variance for various obstacle number, obstacle placing scheme and clutter
spatial distribution type combinations in order to identify the optimal
combination. Our results indicate that as the clutter becomes more regular
(clustered), the NAVA's traversal length gets longer (shorter). On the other
hand, the traversal length tends to follow a concave-down trend as the number
of obstacles increases. We also provide a case study on a real-world maritime
minefield data set.
