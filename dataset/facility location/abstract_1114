We have studied a method to extract neutrino flux from the data of
neutrino-nucleus reaction by using maximum entropy method. We demonstrate a
promising example to extract neutrino flux from the inclusive cross section of
muon production without selecting a particular reaction process such as
quasi-elastic nucleon knockout.
