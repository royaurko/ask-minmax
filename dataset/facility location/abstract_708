We report on high resolution observations (R=35000) of the Hubble Deep Field
South QSO J2233-606 obtained with the University College London Echelle
Spectrograph at the AAT. We present spectral data and an associated absorption
line list for the wavelength region 3530 < lambda < 4390A. The data has a mean
signal-to-noise ratio in the continuum of approximately 15 per 0.05A resolution
element at lambda > 3700A.
