The structure and magnitude of the electric field created by a rotating
accretion disk with a poloidal magnetic field is found for the case of a vacuum
approximation along the axis. The accretion disk is modeled as a torus filled
with plasma and the frozen-in magnetic field. The dimensions and location of
the maximum electric field are found, as well as the energy of the accelerated
particles. The gravitational field is assumed to be weak.
