Growing evidence supports the suggestion that the compact high-velocity
clouds of HI (CHVCs) are located throughout the Local Group and continue to
fuel galactic evolution. Recent distance estimates to individual objects lie in
the range 150-850 kpc, implying an HI mass range of 10^5.7 to 10^7.2 M_Sun
together with sizes ranging from 2-12 kpc, while the average linewidth is 30
km/s FWHM. It is natural to ask whether objects of this type would not already
have been seen by current blind HI surveys of the extragalactic sky. We
consider the properties of the deepest published surveys of this type and
conclude that the sensitivity and coverage have now begun to reveal the high
mass end of the distribution (M_HI >10^7 M_Sun). Achieving detection limits an
order of magnitude deeper should finally enable direct study of these systems
beyond the Local Group, or definitively rule out their existence.
