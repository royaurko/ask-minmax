The recent discovery by the Daya-Bay and RENO experiments, that \theta_{13}
is nonzero and relatively large, significantly impacts existing experiments and
the planning of future facilities. In many scenarios, the nonzero value of
\theta_{13} implies that \theta_{23} is likely to be different from \pi/4.
Additionally, large detectors will be sensitive to matter effects on the
oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos, making it possible to determine the
neutrino mass hierarchy and the octant of \theta_{23}. We show that a 50 kT
magnetized liquid argon neutrino detector can ascertain the mass hierarchy with
a significance larger than 4 sigma with moderate exposure times, and the octant
at the level of 2-3 sigma with greater exposure.
