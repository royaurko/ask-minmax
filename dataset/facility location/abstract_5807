Monte Carlo simulations are used to investigate the tricritical point
properties of a 2d spin fluid. Measurements of the scaling operator
distributions are employed in conjunction with a finite-size scaling analysis
to locate the tricritical point and determine the directions of the relevant
scaling fields and their associated tricritical exponents. The scaling operator
distributions and exponents are shown to match quantitatively those of the 2d
Blume-Capel model, confirming that both models belong to the same universality
class. Mean-field calculations of the tricritical point properties are also
compared with the simulation measurements.
