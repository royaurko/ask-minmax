Neutron spectrum and scattered neutrons caused distortions are major problems
in fast neutron radiography and should be considered for improving the image
quality. This paper puts emphasis on the removal of these image distortions and
deviations for fast neutron radiography performed at the NECTAR facility of the
research reactor FRM-II in Technische Universit\"at M\"unchen (TUM), Germany.
The NECTAR energy spectrum is analyzed and established to modify the influence
caused by neutron spectrum, as well as the Point Scattered Function (PScF)
simulated by the Monte-Carlo program MCNPX is used to evaluate scattering
effects from the object and improve images qualities. Good analysis results
prove the sounded effects of above two corrections.
