The first cryomodule for the beam test facility at the Fermilab New-Muon-Lab
building is currently under RF commissioning. Among other diagnostics systems,
the transverse position of the helium gas return pipe with the connected 1.3
GHz SRF accelerating cavities is measured along the ~15 m long module using a
stretched-wire position monitoring system. An overview of the wire position
monitor system technology is given, along with preliminary results taken at the
initial module cool down, and during further testing. As the measurement system
offers a high resolution, we also discuss options for use as a vibration
detector.
