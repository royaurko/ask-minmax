A series of experiments have been carried out by using a linearly polarized
photon beam at the SPring-8/LEPS facility from December 2000 to June 2001. The
photon beam asymmetries and differential cross sections of the
p(gamma,K+)Lambda and p(gamma,K+)Sigma^0 reactions have been measured in the
photon energy range from 1.5 GeV to 2.4 GeV at forward angles, 0 deg. <
Theta_cm < 60 deg.. We report preliminary results of the photon beam
asymmetries.
