An M6.5-class flare was observed at N12E56 of the solar surface at 16:06 UT
on July 8, 2014. In association with this flare, solar neutron detectors
located on two high mountains, Mt. Sierra Negra and Chacaltaya and at the space
station observed enhancements in the neutral channel. The contributors analysed
these data and a possible scenario of enhancements produced by high-energy
protons and neutrons is proposed, using the data from continuous observation of
a solar surface by the ultraviolet telescope onboard the Solar Dynamical
Observatory (SDO).
