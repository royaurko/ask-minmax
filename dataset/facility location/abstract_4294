The paper focuses on the structure of fundamental sequences of ordinals
smaller than $\epsilon_0$. A first result is the construction of a monadic
second-order formula identifying a given structure, whereas such a formula
cannot exist for ordinals themselves. The structures are precisely classified
in the pushdown hierarchy. Ordinals are also located in the hierarchy, and a
direct presentation is given.
