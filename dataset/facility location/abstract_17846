Using data from the Voyager 1 and 2 CRS telescopes available on the web
through the end of 2014 we have studied the intensity variations of termination
shock H nuclei and anomalous cosmic ray H and He nuclei as a function of radial
distance. In contrast to the inner part of the heliosheath where the intensity
vs. radius profiles in the North and South heliosheaths are much different,
these intensity vs. radius profiles, as well as the intensities themselves, are
more similar in the outer North and South heliosheaths as measured by V1 and V2
respectively. In the N heliosheath, taken to be 27.6 AU thick beyond the HTS
crossing distance of 94 AU, the intensities of termination shock particles and
anomalous cosmic rays reach a maximum at between 110-112 AU or at a location
~halfway between the termination shock and the heliopause. They then decrease
more or less continuously to an intensity ~2/3 of the maximum for each
component just before the final dropout at ~121 AU, just inside the heliopause.
This intensity-time behavior favors theories in which the acceleration and loss
effects lead to a maximum near the middle of the heliosheath.
