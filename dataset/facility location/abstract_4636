Caustic rings of dark matter were predicted to exist in the plane of the
Galaxy at radii $a_n \simeq 40 {\rm kpc}/n$ for $n = 1,2,3 ..$. The recently
discovered Monoceros Ring of stars is located near the $n=2$ caustic, prompting
us to consider a possible connection between these two objects. We identify two
processes through which the Monoceros Ring of stars may have formed. One
process is the migration of gas to an angular velocity minimum at the caustic
leading to enhanced star formation there. The other is the adiabatic
deformation of star orbits as the caustic slowly grows in mass and radius. The
second process predicts an order 100% enhancement of the density of disk stars
at the location of the caustic ring.
