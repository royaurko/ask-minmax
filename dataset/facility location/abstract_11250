We use the star formation history map of the Large Magellanic Cloud recently
published by Harris & Zaritsky to study the sites of the youngest Type Ia
supernova remnants. We find that most Type Ia remnants are associated with old,
metal-poor stellar populations, with little or no recent star formation. These
include SNR 0509-67.5 which is known to have been originated by an extremely
bright SN 1991T-like event, and yet is located very far away from any star
forming regions. The Type Ia remnant SNR N103B, however, is associated with
vigorous star formation activity in the last 100 Myr, and might have had a
relatively younger and more massive progenitor.
