The main component of the s process is produced by low mass stars (between
1.5 and 3 Mo), when they climb for the second time the red giant branch and
experience a series of He shell flashes called thermal pulses. During the
relatively long period (10^5 yr) that elapses between two subsequent thermal
pulses, a slow neutron flux is provided by the 13C(a,n)16O reaction taking
place within a thin 13C pocket located in the He-rich and C-rich mantel of
these stars. A second, marginal, neutron burst occurs during the thermal pulse
and it is powered by the 22Ne(a,n)25Mg reaction. We review the present status
of the nucleosynthesis models of low mass AGB stars. The advance in the
knowledge of the complex coupling between convective mixing and nuclear
process, which allows the surface enrichment of C and s-process elements, is
presented, together with the hypotheses concerning the physical mechanism
driving the formation of the 13C pocket. In order to illustrate the
capabilities and the limits of the theory, an updated computation of a 2 Mo
stellar structure with solar chemical composition is reported. This model has
been obtained by including a full nuclear network (from H up to Bi, at the
termination point of the s-process path) into the stellar evolution code. The
predicted modification of the surface composition occurring during the AGB
evolution is shown. The new challenge of AGB modeling, namely the study of
C-rich and s-rich very metal-poor stars, is discussed.
