A development program is underway at the IGISOL (Ion Guide Isotope Separator
On-Line) facility, University of Jyvaskyla, to efficiently and selectively
produce low-energy radioactive ion beams of silver isotopes and isomers, with a
particular interest in N=Z 94Ag. A hot cavity ion source has been installed,
based on the FEBIAD (Forced Electron Beam Induced Arc Discharge) technique,
combined with a titanium:sapphire laser system for selective laser ionization.
The silver recoils produced via the heavy-ion fusion-evaporation reaction,
40Ca(58Ni, p3n)94Ag, are stopped in a graphite catcher, diffused, extracted and
subsequently ionized using a three-step laser ionization scheme. The
performance of the different components of the hot cavity laser ion source is
discussed and initial results using stable 107,109Ag are presented.
