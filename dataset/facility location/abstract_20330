We present the first detection from the Spitzer Space Telescope of 4.5 micron
variability from Sgr A*, the emitting source associated with the Milky Way's
central black hole. The >23 hour continuous light curve was obtained with the
IRAC instrument in 2013 December. The result characterizes the variability of
Sgr A* prior to the closest approach of the G2 object, a putative infalling gas
cloud that orbits close to Sgr A*. The high stellar density at the location of
Sgr A* produces a background of ~250 mJy at 4.5 microns in each pixel with a
large pixel-to-pixel gradient, but the light curve for the highly variable Sgr
A* source was successfully measured by modeling and removing the variations due
to pointing wobble. The observed flux densities range from the noise level of
~0.7 mJy rms in a 6.4-s measurement to ~10 mJy. Emission was seen above the
noise level ~34% of the time. The light curve characteristics, including the
flux density distribution and structure function, are consistent with those
previously derived at shorter infrared wavelengths. We see no evidence in the
light curve for activity attributable to the G2 interaction at the observing
epoch, ~100 days before the expected G2 periapsis passage. The IRAC light curve
is more than a factor of two longer than any previous infrared observation,
improving constraints on the timescale of the break in the power spectral
distribution of Sgr A* flux densities. The data favor the longer of the two
previously published values for the timescale.
