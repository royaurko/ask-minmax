The possibility of having discrete degrees of freedom at singularities
associated to `conifolds with discrete torsion' is studied. We find that the
field theory of D-brane probes near these singularities is identical to
ordinary conifolds, so that there are no additional discrete degrees of freedom
located at the singularity. We shed light on how the obstructions to resolving
the singularity are global topological issues rather that local obstrucions at
the singularity itself. We also analyze the geometric transitions and duality
cascades when one has fractional branes at the singularity and compute the
moduli space of an arbitrary number of probes in the geometry. We provide some
evidence for a conjecture that there are no discrete degrees of freedom
localized at any Calabi-Yau singularity that can not be guessed from
topological data away from the singularity.
