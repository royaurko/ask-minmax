A number of recent investigations have revealed that transverse waves are
ubiquitous in the solar chromosphere. The vast majority of these have been
reported in limb spicules and active region fibrils. We investigate long-lived,
quiet Sun, on-disk features such as chromospheric mottles (jet-like features
located at the boundaries of supergranular cells) and their transverse motions.
The observations were obtained with the Rapid Oscillations in the Solar
Atmosphere (ROSA) instrument at the Dunn Solar Telescope. The dataset comprises
simultaneous imaging in the H$\alpha$ core, Ca II K, and G band of an on-disk
quiet Sun region. Time-distance techniques are used to study the
characteristics of the transverse oscillations. We detect over 40 transverse
oscillations in both bright and dark mottles, with periods ranging from 70 to
280 s, with the most frequent occurrence at ~ 165 s. The velocity amplitudes
and transverse displacements exhibit characteristics similar to limb spicules.
Neighbouring mottles oscillating in-phase are also observed. The transverse
oscillations of individual mottles are interpreted in terms of
magnetohydrodynamic kink waves. Their estimated periods and damping times are
consistent with phase mixing and resonant mode conversion.
