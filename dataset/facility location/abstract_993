Inclusive electron scattering from nuclei at large x and $Q^2$ is the result
of a reaction mechanism that includes both quasi--elastic scattering from
nucleons and deep inelastic scattering from the quark constituents of the
nucleons. Data in this regime can be used to study a wide variety of topics,
including the extraction of nuclear momentum distributions, the influence of
final state interactions and the approach to $y$-scaling, the strength of
nucleon-nucleon correlations, and the approach to $x$- scaling, to name a few.
Selected results from the recent experiment E02-019 at the Thomas Jefferson
National Accelerator Facility will be shown and their relevance discussed.
