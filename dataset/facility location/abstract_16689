Low-mass protostars have been suggested to show highly variable accretion
rates through-out their evolution. Such changes in accretion, and related
heating of their ambient envelopes, may trigger significant chemical variations
on different spatial scales and from source-to-source. We present images of
emission from C17O, H13CO+, CH3OH, C34S and C2H toward the low-mass protostar
IRAS 15398-3359 on 0.5" (75 AU diameter) scales with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 340 GHz. The resolved images show that
the emission from H13CO+ is only present in a ring-like structure with a radius
of about 1-1.5" (150-200 AU) whereas the CO and other high dipole moment
molecules are centrally condensed toward the location of the central protostar.
We propose that HCO+ is destroyed by water vapor present on small scales. The
origin of this water vapor is likely an accretion burst during the last
100-1000 years increasing the luminosity of IRAS 15398-3359 by a factor of 100
above its current luminosity. Such a burst in luminosity can also explain the
centrally condensed CH3OH and extended warm carbon-chain chemistry observed in
this source and furthermore be reflected in the relative faintness of its
compact continuum emission compared to other protostars.
