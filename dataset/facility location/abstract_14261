Swift's remarkable ability to quickly localize gamma-ray bursts has led to
the accumulation of a sizable burst sample for which both angular locations and
redshifts are measured. This sample has become large enough that it can
potentially be used to probe angular anisotropies indicative of large-scale
universal structure. In a previous work, a large clustering of gamma-ray bursts
at redshift z about 2 was reported in the general direction of the
constellations of Hercules and Corona Borealis. Since that report, a 42 per
cent increase in the number of z about 2 gamma-ray bursts has been observed,
warranting an updated analysis. Surprisingly, the cluster is more pronounced
now than it was when it was first reported.
