Among the persistent questions raised by the existence of a rotational
modulation of the Saturn Kilometric Radiation (SKR), the origin of the
variability of the 10.8 hours SKR period at a 1% level over weeks to years
remains intriguing. While its short-term fluctuations (20-30 days) have been
related to the variations of the solar wind speed, its long-term fluctuations
(months to years) were proposed to be triggered by Enceladus mass-loading
and/or seasonal variations. This situation has become even more complicated
since the recent identification of two separated periods at 10.8h and 10.6h,
each varying with time, corresponding to SKR sources located in the southern
(S) and the northern (N) hemispheres, respectively. Here, six years of Cassini
continuous radio measurements are investigated, from 2004 (pre-equinox) to the
end of 2010 (post-equinox). From S and N SKR, radio periods and phase systems
are derived separately for each hemisphere and fluctuations of radio periods
are investigated at time scales of years to a few months. Then, the S phase is
used to demonstrate that the S SKR rotational modulation is consistent with an
intrinsically rotating phenomenon, in contrast with the early Voyager picture.
