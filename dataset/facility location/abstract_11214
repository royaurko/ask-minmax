The Smoluchowski equation is a system of partial differential equations
modelling the diffusion and binary coagulation of a large collection of tiny
particles. The mass parameter may be indexed either by positive integers, or by
positive reals, these corresponding to the discrete or the continuous form of
the equations. In dimension at least 3, we derive the continuous Smoluchowski
PDE as a kinetic limit of a microscopic model of Brownian particles liable to
coalesce, using a similar method to that used to derive the discrete form of
the equations in Hammond and Rezakhanlou [4]. The principal innovation is a
correlation-type bound on particle locations that permits the derivation in the
continuous context while simplifying the arguments of [4]. We also comment on
the scaling satisfied by the continuous Smoluchowski PDE, and its potential
implications for blow-up of solutions of the equations.
