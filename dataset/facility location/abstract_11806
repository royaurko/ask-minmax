We develop a transfer matrix formalism to visualize the framing of discrete
piecewise linear curves in three dimensional space. Our approach is based on
the concept of an intrinsically discrete curve, which enables us to more
effectively describe curves that in the limit where the length of line segments
vanishes approach fractal structures in lieu of continuous curves. We verify
that in the case of differentiable curves the continuum limit of our discrete
equation does reproduce the generalized Frenet equation. As an application we
consider folded proteins, their Hausdorff dimension is known to be fractal. We
explain how to employ the orientation of $C_\beta$ carbons of amino acids along
a protein backbone to introduce a preferred framing along the backbone. By
analyzing the experimentally resolved fold geometries in the Protein Data Bank
we observe that this $C_\beta$ framing relates intimately to the discrete
Frenet framing. We also explain how inflection points can be located in the
loops, and clarify their distinctive r\^ole in determining the loop structure
of foldel proteins.
