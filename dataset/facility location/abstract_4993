We present results of the Suzaku/XIS observation around the radio supernova
remnant (SNR) G12.0-0.1. No significant diffuse emission extending in or along
the radio shell was observed. Instead two compact X-ray sources, Suzaku
J181205-1835 and Suzaku J181210-1842, were found in or near G12.0-0.1. Suzaku
J181205-1835 is located at the northwest of the radio shell of G12.0-0.1. The
X-ray profile is slightly extended over the point spread function of the Suzaku
telescope. The X-ray spectrum has no line-like structure and is well
represented by a power-law model with a photon index of 2.2 and an absorption
column of N_{H}=4.9x10^{22} cm^{-2}. The distances of Suzaku J181205-1835 and
G12.0-0.1 are estimated from the absorption column and the Sigma-D relation,
respectively, and are nearly the same with each other. These results suggest
that Suzaku J181205-1835 is a candidate of a pulsar wind nebula associated with
G12.0-0.1. From its location, Suzaku J181210-1842 would be unrelated object to
G12.0-0.1. The X-ray profile is point-like and the spectrum is thin thermal
emission with Fe K-lines at 6.4, 6.7, and 6.97 keV, similar to those of
cataclysmic variables.
