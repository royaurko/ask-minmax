The structure of the superconducting order parameter in the iron-pnictide
superconductor BaFe$_2$(As$_{0.67}$P$_{0.33}$)$_2$ ($T_c=31$\,K) with line
nodes is studied by the angle-resolved thermal conductivity measurements in a
magnetic field rotated within the basal plane. We find that the thermal
conductivity displays distinct fourfold oscillations with minima when the field
is directed at $\pm45^\circ$ with respect to the tetragonal a-axis. We discuss
possible gap structures that can account for the data, and conclude that the
observed results are most consistent with the closed nodal loops located at the
flat parts of the electron Fermi surface with high Fermi velocity.
