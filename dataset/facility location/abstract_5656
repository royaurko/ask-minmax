We present initial results from a search to detect radio emission at 1.4 GHz
from gravitationally lensed arcs towards galaxy clusters. Using the FIRST
survey observations of galaxy cluster fields, we have clearly detected 1.4 GHz
emission at the location of bright arc towards the galaxy cluster Abell 370.
The possibility that this emission is associated with a projected galaxy
superimposed on the arc cannot be completely ruled out. However, the detection
of CO(2-1) line towards this arc by Casoli et al. (1996) and the increase in
1.4 GHz diffuse emission near the arc region strongly suggest a lensed origin
for detected radio emission.
