We analyse multiwavelength observations of an M2.9/1N flare that occurred in
AR NOAA 11112 on 16 October 2010. AIA 211 {\AA} EUV images reveal the presence
of a faster coronal wave (decelerating from ~1390 to ~830 km/s) propagating
ahead of a slower wave (decelerating from ~416 to ~166 km/s) towards the
western limb. The dynamic radio spectrum from Sagamore Hill radio telescope
shows the presence of metric type II radio burst, which reveals the presence of
a coronal shock wave (speed~800 km/s). The speed of the faster coronal wave
derived from AIA 211 {\AA} images is found to be comparable to the coronal
shock speed. AIA 171 {\AA} high-cadence observations showed that a coronal
loop, which was located at the distance of ~0.32 Rs to the west of the flaring
region, started to oscillate by the end of the impulsive phase of the flare.
The results indicate that the faster coronal wave may be the first driver of
the transversal oscillations of coronal loop. As the slower wave passed through
the coronal loop, the oscillations became even stronger. There was a plasmoid
eruption observed in EUV and a white-light CME was recorded, having velocity of
~340-350 km/s. STEREO 195 {\AA} images show an EIT wave, propagating in the
same direction of the lower-speed coronal wave observed in AIA, but
decelerating from ~320 to ~254 km/s. These observations reveal the co-existence
of both waves (i.e. coronal Moreton and EIT waves), and type II radio burst
seems to be associated with the coronal Moreton wave.
