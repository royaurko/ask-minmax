The present paper is devoted to the study of transition fronts in nonlocal
reaction-diffusion equations with time heterogeneous nonlinearity of ignition
type. It is proven that such an equation admits space monotone transition
fronts with finite speed and space regularity in the sense of uniform Lipschitz
continuity. Our approach is first constructing a sequence of approximating
front-like solutions and then proving that the approximating solutions converge
to a transition front. We take advantage of the idea of modified interface
location, which allows us to characterize the finite speed of approximating
solutions in the absence of space regularity, and leads directly to uniform
exponential decaying estimates.
