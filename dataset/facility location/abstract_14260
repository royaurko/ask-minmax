The adsorption of two different organic molecules cyanidin glucoside
(C$_{21}$O$_{11}$H$_{20}$) and TA-St-CA on anatase (101) and (001) nanowires
have been investigated using the standard and the range separated hybrid
density functional theory calculations. The electronic structures and optical
spectra of resulting dye--nanowire combined systems show distinct features for
these types of photochromophores. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of
the natural dye cyanidin glucoside is located below the conduction band of the
semiconductor while, in the case of TA-St-CA, it resonates with the states
inside the conduction band. The wide-bandgap anatase nanowires can be
functionalized for solar cells through electron-hole generation and subsequent
charge injection by these dye sensitizers. The intermolecular charge transfer
character of Donor-$\pi$-Acceptor type dye TA-St-CA is substantially modified
by its adsorption on TiO$_2$ surfaces. Cyanidin glucoside exhibits relatively
stronger anchoring on the nanowires through its hydroxyl groups. The atomic
structures of dye--nanowire systems re-optimized with the inclusion of
nonlinear solvation effects showed that the binding strengths of both dyes
remain moderate even in ionic solutions.
