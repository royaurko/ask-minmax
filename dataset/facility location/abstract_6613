Selected issues of the concept of spontaneous collapse are discussed, with
the emphasis on the gravity-related model. We point out that without
spontaneous collapses the Schr\"odinger cat states would macroscopically
violate the standard conservation laws even in the presence of environmental
noise. We prove that the collapse time of condensed matter c.o.m.
superpositions is not sensitive to the natural uncertainty of the nuclear
locations whereas we formulate the conjecture that superfluid He may show an
anomalous low rate of spontaneous collapse compared to common condensed matter.
