Wide-field optical imaging was obtained of the cluster and reflection nebula
NGC 7023 and the Bok globule B175. We report the discovery of four new
Herbig-Haro (HH) objects in NGC 7023, the first HH objects to be found in this
region. They were first detected by their H-alpha and [S II] emission but are
also visible at 3.6 and 4.5micron in archival Spitzer observations of this
field. These HH objects are part of at least two distinct outflows. Both
outflows are aligned with embedded "Class I" YSOs in a tight group on the
western edge of the nebula. One of the outflows may have a projected distance
of 0.75pc, which is a notable length for an embedded source.
  No new HH objects were discovered in B175. However, we reclassify the knot
HH450X, in B175, as a background galaxy. The discovery that HH 450X is not a
shock front weakens the argument that HH 450 and SNR G110.3+11.3 are co-located
and interacting.
