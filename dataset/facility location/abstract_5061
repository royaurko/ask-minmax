Humans are social animals and they interact with different communities of
friends to conduct different activities. The literature shows that human
mobility is constrained by their social relations as well as geographic
constraints. In this paper, we investigate the social impact of a person's
communities on his mobility, instead of all friends from his online social
networks. This study can be particularly useful, as certain social behaviors
are influenced by specific communities but not all friends. To achieve our
goal, we first develop a measure to characterize a person's social diversity,
which we term `community entropy'. Through analysis of a real-life dataset, we
demonstrate that a person's mobility is influenced only by a small fraction of
his communities and the influence depends on the social contexts of the
communities. We then exploit machine learning techniques to predict users'
future movement based on their communities' information. Experiments on a
location-based social network dataset demonstrate the prediction's
effectiveness.
