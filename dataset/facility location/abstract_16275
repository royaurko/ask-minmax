Weak gravitational lensing of the CMBR manifests as a secondary anisotropy in
the temperature maps. The effect, quantified through the shear and convergence
fields imprint the underlying large scale structure (LSS), geometry and
evolution history of the Universe. It is hence perceived to be an important
observational probe of cosmology. De-lensing the CMBR temperature maps is also
crucial for detecting the gravitational wave generated B-modes. Future
observations of redshifted 21-cm radiation from the cosmological neutral
hydrogen (HI) distribution hold the potential of probing the LSS over a large
redshift range. We have investigated the correlation between post-reionization
HI signal and weak lensing convergence field. Assuming that the HI follows the
dark matter distribution, the cross-correlation angular power spectrum at a
multipole \ell is found to be proportional to the cold dark matter power
spectrum evaluated at \ell/r, where r denotes the comoving distance to the
redshift where the HI is located. The amplitude of the ross-correlation depends
on quantities specific to the HI distribution, growth of perturbations and also
the underlying cosmological model. In an ideal ituation, we found that a
statistically significant detection of the cross-correlation signal is
possible. If detected, the cross-correlation signal hold the possibility of a
joint estimation of cosmological parameters and also test various CMBR
de-lensing estimators.
