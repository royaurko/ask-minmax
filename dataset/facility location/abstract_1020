Advanced neutral particles analyzer for plasma diagnostic with possibility of
simultaneous measurements of energy distributions of D and H ions has developed
in the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics. The analyzer was used in two plasma
facilities with injection of fast neutrals - on the MST reversed field pinch
(University of Wisconsin) and the field reversed configuration C-2 (Tri Alpha
Energy). In this paper, the design of the analyzer, calculation of efficiency
of registration, results of analyzer calibration and experimental results from
MST and C-2 experiments are presented
