PSR B1259-63 is in a highly eccentric 3.4 yr orbit around the Be-star SS2883.
The system is located in the direction of the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm at
a distance of $\sim$1.5 kpc. We have made scintillation observations of the
pulsar far from periastron at 4.8 GHz and 8.4 GHz, determining the diffractive
bandwidth, $\Delta \nu_{\rm d}$, and timescale, $\Delta t_{\rm d}$, at both
frequencies. We find no dependency on orbital phase until within 30 days of
periastron. The data indicate that the scintillation is caused, not by the
circumstellar environment, but by an HII region within the Sagittarius-Carina
spiral arm located at least three-quarters of the way to the pulsar. Close to
periastron, when the line-of-sight to the pulsar intersects the disk of the Be
star, the electron densities within the disk are sufficient to overcome the
`lever-arm effect' and produce a reduction in the scintillation bandwidth by
six orders of magnitude.
