We briefly review statistical models for the probability distribution of
money developed in the econophysics literature since the late 1990s. In these
models, economic transactions are modeled as random transfers of money between
the agents in payment for goods and services. We focus on conceptual
foundations for this approach, on the issues of money conservation and debt,
and present new results for the energy consumption distribution around the
world.
