We extend our previous analysis on the exchange statistics of vortices having
a single Dirac fermion trapped in each core, to the case where vortices trap
two Dirac fermions with U(2) symmetry. Such a system of vortices with
non-Abelian Dirac fermions appears in color superconductors at extremely high
densities, and in supersymmetric QCD. We show that the exchange of two vortices
having doublet Dirac fermions in each core is expressed by non-Abelian
representations of a braid group, which is explicitly verified in the matrix
representation of the exchange operators when the number of vortices is up to
four. We find that the result contains the matrices previously obtained for the
vortices with a single Dirac fermion in each core as a special case. The whole
braid group does not immediately imply non-Abelian statistics of identical
particles because it also contains exchanges between vortices with different
numbers of Dirac fermions. However, we find that it does contain, as its
subgroup, a genuine non-Abelian statistics for the exchange of the identical
particles, that is, vortices with the same number of Dirac fermions. This
result is surprising compared with conventional understanding because all Dirac
fermions are defined locally at each vortex, unlike the case of Majorana
fermions for which Dirac fermions are defined non-locally by Majorana fermions
located at two spatially separated vortices.
