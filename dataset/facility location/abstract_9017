We present 86 GHz (v = 1, J = 2 -1) SiO maser line observations with the IRAM
30-m telescope of a sample of 441 late-type stars in the Inner Galaxy (-4 degr
< l < +30 degr). These stars were selected on basis of their infrared
magnitudes and colours from the ISOGAL and MSX catalogues. SiO maser emission
was detected in 271 sources, and their line-of-sight velocities indicate that
the stars are located in the Inner Galaxy. These new detections double the
number of line-of-sight velocities available from previous SiO and OH maser
observations in the area covered by our survey and are, together with other
samples of e.g. OH/IR stars, useful for kinematic studies of the central parts
of the Galaxy.
