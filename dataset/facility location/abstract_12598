Let $G$ be a non--linear function of a Gaussian process
$\{X_t\}_{t\in\mathbb{Z}}$ with long--range dependence. The resulting process
$\{G(X_t)\}_{t\in\mathbb{Z}}$ is not Gaussian when $G$ is not linear. We
consider random wavelet coefficients associated with
$\{G(X_t)\}_{t\in\mathbb{Z}}$ and the corresponding wavelet scalogram which is
the average of squares of wavelet coefficients over locations. We obtain the
asymptotic behavior of the scalogram as the number of observations and scales
tend to infinity. It is known that when $G$ is a Hermite polynomial of any
order, then the limit is either the Gaussian or the Rosenblatt distribution,
that is, the limit can be represented by a multiple Wiener-It\^o integral of
order one or two. We show, however, that there are large classes of functions
$G$ which yield a higher order Hermite distribution, that is, the limit can be
represented by a a multiple Wiener-It\^o integral of order greater than two.
