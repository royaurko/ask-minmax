We argue that the asymmetric morphology of the blue and red shifted
components of the outflow at hundreds of AU from the massive binary system Eta
Carinae can be understood from the collision of the primary stellar wind with
the slowly expanding dense equatorial gas. Recent high spatial observations of
some forbidden lines, e.g. [Fe III] lambda4659, reveal the outflowing gas
within about one arcsecond (2300 AU) from Eta Car. The distribution of the blue
and red shifted components are not symmetric about the center, and they are
quite different from each other. The morphologies of the blue and red shifted
components correlate with the location of dense slowly moving equatorial gas
(termed the Weigelt blob environment; WBE), that is thought to have been
ejected during the 1887 - 1895 Lesser Eruption. In our model the division to
the blue and red shifted components is caused by the postshock flow of the
primary wind on the two sides of the equatorial plane after it collides with
the WBE. The fast wind from the secondary star plays no role in our model for
these components, and it is the freely expanding primary wind that collides
with the WBE. Because the line of sight is inclined to the binary axis, the two
components are not symmetric. We show that the postshock gas can also account
for the observed intensity in the [Fe III] lambda4659 line.
