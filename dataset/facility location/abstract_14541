We present results on the X-ray spectrum of the quasar PG 1114+445 from an
ASCA observation performed in 1996 June, and a ROSAT observation performed 3
years earlier. We show good agreement between all the datasets can be obtained
if the underlying continuum in the 0.2--10 keV band is assumed to be a powerlaw
(photon index Gamma approx 1.8) absorbed by photoionized material. The ionized
gas imprints deep absorption edges in the observed spectrum <~ 2 keV due to
Ovii and Oviii, from which we determine its column density (approx 2E22
cm^{-2}) and ionization parameter (Ux approx 0.1) to be similar to that
observed in Seyfert-I galaxies. Unfortunately these data do not allow any
strong constraints to be placed on the location, or solid angle subtended by
the material at the ionizing source. We also find evidence for absorption in
the Fe K-shell band in excess of that predicted from the lower energy features.
This implies an Fe/O abundance ratio approx 10 times the cosmic value, or an
additional screen of more-highly ionized gas, possibly out-flowing from the
nucleus. We briefly compare our results with those obtained from other active
galaxies.
