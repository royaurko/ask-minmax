This article discusses the problem of estimation of parameters in finite
mixtures when the mixture components are assumed to be symmetric and to come
from the same location family. We refer to these mixtures as semi-parametric
because no additional assumptions other than symmetry are made regarding the
parametric form of the component distributions. Because the class of symmetric
distributions is so broad, identifiability of parameters is a major issue in
these mixtures. We develop a notion of identifiability of finite mixture
models, which we call k-identifiability, where k denotes the number of
components in the mixture. We give sufficient conditions for k-identifiability
of location mixtures of symmetric components when k=2 or 3. We propose a novel
distance-based method for estimating the (location and mixing) parameters from
a k-identifiable model and establish the strong consistency and asymptotic
normality of the estimator. In the specific case of L_2-distance, we show that
our estimator generalizes the Hodges--Lehmann estimator. We discuss the
numerical implementation of these procedures, along with an empirical estimate
of the component distribution, in the two-component case. In comparisons with
maximum likelihood estimation assuming normal components, our method produces
somewhat higher standard error estimates in the case where the components are
truly normal, but dramatically outperforms the normal method when the
components are heavy-tailed.
