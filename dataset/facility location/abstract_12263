We present an updated and newly compiled radio-continuum data-base for MASH
PNe detected in the extant large scale "blind" radio-continuum surveys (NVSS,
SUMSS/MGPS-2 and PMN) and, for a small number of MASH PNe, observed and
detected in targeted radio-continuum observations. We found radio counterparts
for approximately 250 MASH PNe. In comparison with the percentage of previously
known Galactic PNe detected in the NVSS and MGPS-2 radio-continuum surveys and
according to their position on the flux density-angular diameter and the radio
brightness temperature evolutionary diagrams we conclude, unsurprisingly, that
the MASH sample presents the radio-faint end of the known Galactic PNe
population. Also, we present radio-continuum spectral properties of a small
sub-sample of MASH PNe located in the strip between declinations -30arcdeg and
-40arcdeg, that are detected in both the NVSS and MGPS-2 radio surveys.
