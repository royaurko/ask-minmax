We report the discovery of a prominent nonthermal X-ray feature located near
the Galactic center that we identify as an energetic pulsar wind nebula. This
feature, G359.95-0.04, lies 1 lyr north of Sgr A* (in projection), is
comet-like in shape, and has a power law spectrum that steepens with increasing
distance from the putative pulsar. The distinct spectral and spatial X-ray
characteristics of the feature are similar to those belonging the rare class of
ram-pressure confined pulsar wind nebulae. The luminosity of the nebula at the
distance of \sgra, consistent with the inferred X-ray absorptions, is 1 10^{34}
ergs s^{-1} in the 2--10 keV energy band. The cometary tail extends back to a
region centered at the massive stellar complex IRS 13 and surrounded by
enhanced diffuse X-ray emission, which may represent an associated supernova
remnant. Furthermore, the inverse Compton scattering of the strong ambient
radiation by the nebula consistently explains the observed TeV emission from
the Galactic center. We also briefly discuss plausible connections of
G359.95-0.04 to other high-energy sources in the region, such as the young
stellar complex IRS 13 and SNR Sgr A East.
