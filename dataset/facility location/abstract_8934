We present new results from a 40.8 ks Chandra ACIS observation of the young
supernova remnant (SNR) N103B located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The high
resolution Chandra image reveals structure at the sub-arcsecond level,
including several bright knots and filaments. Narrow-band imaging and spatially
resolved spectroscopy reveal dramatic spectral variations in this remnant as
well. In this paper we discuss whether these variations are due to
inhomogeneities in the surrounding environment or were generated in the
explosion which created the SNR.
