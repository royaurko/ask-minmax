Experience using hardware knobs as an operator interface for controlling
equipment has varied considerably at different facilities. Reactions have
ranged from "indispensable" at some facilities, to "virtually useless" at
others. In this paper, we will attempt to outline some basic principles for
successful knob implementation. These principles derive from our own experience
with control knobs at the LANSCE Accelerator Complex and our recent effort to
adapt our control knobs to EPICS. Topics to be covered include what the
operator needs the knob to do, what the knob needs to know about the device it
is controlling, and knob scaling issues. Advanced topics such as closed-loop,
PID, and aggregate knobs are left as topics for future papers.
