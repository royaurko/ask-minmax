Finding a basis/coordinate system that can efficiently represent an input
data stream by viewing them as realizations of a stochastic process is of
tremendous importance in many fields including data compression and
computational neuroscience. Two popular measures of such efficiency of a basis
are sparsity (measured by the expected $\ell^p$ norm, $0 < p \leq 1$) and
statistical independence (measured by the mutual information). Gaining deeper
understanding of their intricate relationship, however, remains elusive.
Therefore, we chose to study a simple synthetic stochastic process called the
spike process, which puts a unit impulse at a random location in an
$n$-dimensional vector for each realization. For this process, we obtained the
following results: 1) The standard basis is the best both in terms of sparsity
and statistical independence if $n \geq 5$ and the search of basis is
restricted within all possible orthonormal bases in $R^n$; 2) If we extend our
basis search in all possible invertible linear transformations in $R^n$, then
the best basis in statistical independence differs from the one in sparsity; 3)
In either of the above, the best basis in statistical independence is not
unique, and there even exist those which make the inputs completely dense; 4)
There is no linear invertible transformation that achieves the true statistical
independence for $n > 2$.
