Lattice imaging facilitates digital implementation of optical darkfield
strategies that have for decades played a key role in the conventional electron
microscopy of materials. Applications to the microscopy of periodic structures
are described in the context of recent developments in the mathematical
harmonic analysis community, with hopes of inspiring further development along
these lines. Applications here, which push present day limits using sharp-edged
Fourier windows alone, include the location of weak periodicities in images by
virtue of their spatial correlations, and the quantitative mapping of projected
strain in a variety of nanostructures.
