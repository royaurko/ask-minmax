The TGF and Energetic Thunderstorm Rooftop Array (TETRA) is an array of NaI
scintillators located at rooftop level on the campus of Louisiana State
University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. From July 2010 through March 2014, TETRA
has detected 28 millisecond-duration bursts of gamma-rays at energies 50 keV -
2 MeV associated with nearby (< 8 km) thunderstorms. The ability to observe
ground-level Terrestrial Gamma Flashes from close to the source allows a unique
analysis of the storm cells producing these events. The results of the initial
analysis will be presented.
