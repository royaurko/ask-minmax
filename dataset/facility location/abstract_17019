We present time-series photometry of stars located in the extremely young
open cluster Berkeley 59. Using the 1.04 m telescope at ARIES, Nainital, we
have identified 42 variables in a field of 13'x13' around the cluster. The
probable members of the cluster are identified using (V, V-I) colour-magnitude
diagram and (J-H, H-K) colour-colour diagram. Thirty one variables are found to
be pre-main sequence stars associated with the cluster. The ages and masses of
pre-main sequence stars are derived from colour-magnitude diagram by fitting
theoretical models to the observed data points. The ages of the majority of the
probable pre-main sequence variable candidates range from 1 to 5 Myrs. The
masses of these pre-main sequence variable stars are found to be in the range
of ~0.3 to ~3.5 Msun and these could be T Tauri stars. The present statistics
reveal that about 90% T Tauri stars have periods < 15 days. The classical T
Tauri stars are found to have larger amplitude in comparison to the weak line T
Tauri stars. There is an indication that the amplitude decreases with increase
of the mass, which could be due to the dispersal of disk of relatively massive
stars.
