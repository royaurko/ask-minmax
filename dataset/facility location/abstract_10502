First on-line mass measurements were performed at the SHIPTRAP Penning trap
mass spectrometer. The masses of 18 neutron-deficient isotopes in the
terbium-to-thulium region produced in fusion-evaporation reactions were
determined with relative uncertainties of about $7\cdot 10^{-8}$, nine of them
for the first time. Four nuclides ($^{144, 145}$Ho and $^{147, 148}$Tm) were
found to be proton-unbound. The implication of the results on the location of
the proton drip-line is discussed by analyzing the one-proton separation
energies.
