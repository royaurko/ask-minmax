In this study, a low energy beam transport (LEBT) channel for the proton
linac section of the Turkish Accelerator Center (TAC) has been designed by
using TRAVEL code. Commonly used LEBT including two focusing solenoid magnets
will transport and match the H- beam from a volume source to RFQ. In the beam
dynamics simulations of such a LEBT line, 95% space-charge compensation (SCC)
has been considered in this study. We aimed to find out the determination of
our RFQ input parameters that gives the best possible beam quality at the
entrance of the RFQ using beam collimator in the LEBT line as an alternative
way. In this way, we have acquired the best possible beam quality on RFQ input
plane as well as optimizing the LEBT line.
