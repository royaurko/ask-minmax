The unidentified VHE (E>100 GeV) gamma-ray source HESS J1507-622 seems to not
fit into standard models for sources related to young supernova remnants,
pulsar wind nebulae, or young stellar populations in general. This is due to
its intrinsically extended, but yet compact morphology, coupled with a relative
large offset (~3.5 deg) from the Galactic plane. Therefore, it has been
suggested that this object may be the first representative of a new distinct
class of extended off-plane gamma-ray sources. The distance to HESS J1507-622
is the key parameter to constrain the source's most important properties, such
as age and energetics of the relativistic particle population.
  In this article we report on results of follow-up observations of the
potential X-ray counterpart with Suzaku. We present detailed measurements of
its spectral parameters and find a high absorbing hydrogen column density,
compatible with the total amount of Galactic gas in this direction. In
comparisons to measurements and models of the Galactic three-dimensional gas
distribution we show that the potential X-ray counterpart of HESS J1507-622 may
be located at the far end of the Galaxy. If the gamma-ray source is indeed
physically connected to this extended X-ray source, this in turn would place
the object outside of the usual distribution of Galactic VHE gamma-ray
emitters.
