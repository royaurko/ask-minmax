One IGEX 76Ge double-beta decay detector is currently operating in the
Canfranc Underground Laboratory in a search for dark matter WIMPs, through the
Ge nuclear recoil produced by the WIMP elastic scattering. A new exclusion plot
has been derived for WIMP-nucleon spin-independent interactions. To obtain this
result, 40 days of data from the IGEX detector (energy threshold 4 keV),
recently collected, have been analyzed. These data improve the exclusion limits
derived from all the other ionization germanium detectors in the mass region
from 20 GeV to 200 GeV, where a WIMP supposedly responsible for the annual
modulation effect reported by the DAMA experiment would be located. The new
IGEX exclusion contour enters, by the first time, the DAMA region by using only
raw data, with no background discrimination, and excludes its upper left part.
It is also shown that with a moderate improvement of the detector performances,
the DAMA region could be fully explored.
