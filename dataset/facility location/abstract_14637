New wide-field images of the Rho Ophiuchus molecular cloud at 850 and 450
microns obtained with SCUBA on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope reveal a wide
variety of large-scale features that were previously unknown. Two linear
features each 4' (0.2 pc) in length extend to the north of the bright emission
region containing SM1 and VLA 1623. These features may correspond to the walls
of a previously unidentified outflow cavity, or the boundary of a photon
dominated region powered by a nearby B star. A previously unidentified source
is located in the north-east region of the image. The properties of this source
(diameter ~5000 AU, mass ~0.3-1 Msun) suggest that it is a pre-protostellar
core. Two arcs of emission are seen in the direction of the north-west
extension of the VLA 1623 outflow. The outer arc appears relatively smooth at
850 microns and is estimated to have a mass of ~0.3 Msun, while the inner arc
breaks up into a number of individual clumps, some of which are previously
identified protostars.
