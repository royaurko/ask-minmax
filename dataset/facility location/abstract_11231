We perform numerical simulations, including parallel tempering, on the Potts
glass model with binary random quenched couplings using the JANUS
application-oriented computer. We find and characterize a glassy transition,
estimating the location of the transition and the value of the critical
exponents. We show that there is no ferromagnetic transition in a large
temperature range around the glassy critical temperature. We also compare our
results with those obtained recently on the "random permutation" Potts glass.
