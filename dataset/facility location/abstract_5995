We discuss the influence of the superconducting transition in a film on the
fluorescence spectrum of a single molecule located nearby. We show that single
molecule spectroscopy (SMS) should be an appropriate tool to detect the
electric charge associated with a vortex line. Also we argue that an electric
field must appear at the boundaries between normal and superconducting regions
of the intermediate phase and SMS could be useful to study this effect.
