An all solid-state kicker modulator for the Dual-Axis Radiographic
Hydrodynamic Test facility (DARHT-2) has been designed and tested. This kicker
modulator uses multiple solid-state modules stacked in an inductive-adder
configuration where the energy is switched into each section of the adder by a
parallel array of MOSFETs. The modulator features very fast rise and fall
times, pulse width agility and a high pulse-repetition rate in burst mode. The
modulator can drive a 50* cable with voltages up to 20 kV and can be easily
configured for either positive or negative polarity. The presentation will
include test data collected from both the ETA II accelerator kicker and
resistive dummy loads.
