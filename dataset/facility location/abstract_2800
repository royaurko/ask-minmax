We first consider teleportation of entangled states shared between Claire and
Alice to Bob1 and Bob2 when Alice and the two Bobs share a single copy of a
GHZ-class state and where {\it all} the four parties are at distant locations.
We then generalize this situation to the case of teleportation of entangled
states shared between Claire1, Claire2, ....., Claire(N-1) and Alice to Bob1,
Bob2, ....., BobN when Alice and the N Bobs share a single copy of a Cat-like
state and where again {\it all} the 2N parties are at distant locations.
