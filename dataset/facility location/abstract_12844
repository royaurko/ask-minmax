We consider the dimerized spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with spin hexameric
distortion of the exchange pattern and study the zero-temperature phase diagram
in the parameter space $(J_{1}, J_{2}, J_{3})$ by continuum-limit bosonization
approach and the exact diagonalization method. The phase diagram is rich and
has two gaped dimer phases. We obtain an estimate of the critical line
separating the different gapped dimer phases by the bosonization approach. The
existence of the transition line and the difference between dimer phases is
checked numerically. The behavior of the energy gap and the dimer order
parameter supports the exact location of the gapless line.
