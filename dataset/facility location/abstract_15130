High resolution millimeter-wave and near-infrared observations of the
supernova remnants W28 and W44 reveal extensive shocked molecular gas where
supernova blast waves are propagating into giant molecular clouds. New CO
observations were carried out with the IRAM 30-m and ARO 12-m telescopes, and
the near-infrared observations were with Palomar 200-inch telescope. The
near-infrared observations reveal shocked H2 emission from both supernova
remnants, showing intricate networks of filaments on arcsec scales, following
the bright ridges of the radio shells. The CO and CS linewidths, indicative of
the shock speed, are 20-30 km/s. Both the near-infrared and millimeter-wave
emission are attributed to shocks into gas with density >1e3 cm-3. Individual
shock structures are resolved in the H2 emission, with inferred edge-on shock
thickness ~1e17 cm, consistent with non-dissociative shocks into gas densities
of 1e3-1e4 cm-3. Bright 1720 MHz OH masers are located within the shocked H2
gas complexes and highlight only localized areas where the conditions for
masing are optimal. The Halpha and X-ray emission, have morphologies very
different from the radio. We find a detailed correlation of the radio and H2
emission for some long filaments, indicating cosmic ray acceleration or
re-acceleration due to the shocks into moderately dense gas. The different
morphologies of these two remnants at different wavelengths is explained by a
highly nonuniform structure for giant molecular clouds.
