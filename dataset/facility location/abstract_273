We are currently setting up a facility for low-background gamma-ray
spectrometry based on a HPGe detector. It is dedicated to material screening
for the XENON and DARWIN dark matter projects as well as to the
characterization of meteorites. The detector will be installed in a medium
depth ($\sim$620 m.w.e.) underground laboratory in Switzerland with several
layers of shielding and an active muon-veto. The GeMSE facility will be
operational by fall 2015 with an expected background rate of $\sim$250
counts/day (100-2700 keV).
