Dynamical and statistical properties of the vortex and passive particle
advection in chaotic flows generated by four and sixteen point vortices are
investigated. General transport properties of these flows are found anomalous
and exhibit a superdiffusive behavior with typical second moment exponent (\mu
\sim 1.75). The origin of this anomaly is traced back to the presence of
coherent structures within the flow, the vortex cores and the region far from
where vortices are located. In the vicinity of these regions stickiness is
observed and the motion of tracers is quasi-ballistic. The chaotic nature of
the underlying flow dictates the choice for thorough analysis of transport
properties. Passive tracer motion is analyzed by measuring the mutual relative
evolution of two nearby tracers. Some tracers travel in each other vicinity for
relatively large times. This is related to an hidden order for the tracers
which we call jets. Jets are localized and found in sticky regions. Their
structure is analyzed and found to be formed of a nested sets of jets within
jets. The analysis of the jet trapping time statistics shows a quantitative
agreement with the observed transport exponent.
