We introduce a mode of operation for studying the vortex phase in
superconductors using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). While in the
conventional STM method, the tip is scanned over a sample in which a fixed
vortex pattern is prepared, in our "Lazy Fisherman" method the STM tip is kept
fixed at a selected location while the vortices are being moved by varying the
applied magnetic field. By continuously acquiring the local tunnelling
conductance spectra, dI/dV(V), we detect the changes in the local density of
states under the tip due to the vortex motion. With no need for scanning, the
method permits one to extend the study of vortices to samples in which scanning
is difficult or even impossible due to surface nonuniformity and allows one to
study vortex dynamics. Using a statistical analysis of the spectra, we
reconstruct the single vortex zero bias conductance profile. We apply the
method to the c-axis face of an MgB$_2$ single crystal sample and obtain a
vortex profile with a coherence length, xi of 57+-2 nm.
