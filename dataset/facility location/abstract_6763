In this study, we propose an alternative way to simulate particle suspensions
using the lattice Boltzmann method. The main idea is to impose the non-slip
boundary condition in the lattice sites located on the particle boundaries. The
focus on the lattice sites, instead of the links between them, as done in the
more used methods, represents a great simplification in the algorithm. A fully
description of the method will be presented, in addition to simulations
comparing the proposed method with other methods and, also, with experimental
results.
