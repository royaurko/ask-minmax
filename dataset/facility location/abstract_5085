Open sourcing modelling tools and generators becomes more and more important
as open source software as a whole becomes more important. We evaluate the
impact open source licenses of code generators have on the intellectual
property (IP) of generated artifacts comparing the most common open source
licenses by categories found in literature. Restrictively licensed generators
do have effects on the IP and therefore on the usability of the artifacts they
produce. We then how how this effects can be shaped to the needs of the
licensor and the licensee.
