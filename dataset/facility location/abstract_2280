A pioneering electromagnetic (EM) observation follow-up program of candidate
gravitational wave (GW) triggers has been performed, Dec 17 2009 to Jan 8 2010
and Sep 4 to Oct 20 2010, during the recent LIGO/Virgo run. The follow-up
program involved ground-based and space EM facilities observing the sky at
optical, X-ray and radio wavelengths. The joint GW/EM observation study
requires the development of specific image analysis procedures able to
discriminate the possible EM counterpart of GW trigger from background events.
The paper shows an overview of the EM follow-up program and the developing
image analysis procedures as they are applied to data collected with TAROT and
Zadko.
