The ability to place objects in the environment is an important skill for a
personal robot. An object should not only be placed stably, but should also be
placed in its preferred location/orientation. For instance, a plate is
preferred to be inserted vertically into the slot of a dish-rack as compared to
be placed horizontally in it. Unstructured environments such as homes have a
large variety of object types as well as of placing areas. Therefore our
algorithms should be able to handle placing new object types and new placing
areas. These reasons make placing a challenging manipulation task. In this
work, we propose a supervised learning algorithm for finding good placements
given the point-clouds of the object and the placing area. It learns to combine
the features that capture support, stability and preferred placements using a
shared sparsity structure in the parameters. Even when neither the object nor
the placing area is seen previously in the training set, our algorithm predicts
good placements. In extensive experiments, our method enables the robot to
stably place several new objects in several new placing areas with 98%
success-rate; and it placed the objects in their preferred placements in 92% of
the cases.
