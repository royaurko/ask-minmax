Dynamical correlation functions for temperature T=0 are calculated for a
Hubbard chain with infinite on-site repulsion. This chain contains three sites
per unit cell and has a known resonating-valence-bond ground state for a
filling of 2 particles per unit cell. A finite system of 24 sites is studied
numerically. The recursion method is applied and results for spectral densities
are compared to variationally calculated excited-state eigenvalues. Charge and
spin degrees of freedom located at the backbone sites are considered. The
spectral densities show dispersionless excitations. The energy spectrum
displays a gap indicating an insulating ground state. Spectral functions for
the propagation of a single hole in a resonating-valence-bond background are
provided and indicate delocalized dispersive hole excitations.
