The search for the onset of star formation in pre-stellar cores has focussed
on the identification of an infall signature in the molecular line profiles of
tracer species. The classic infall signature is a double peaked line profile
with an asymmetry in the strength of the peaks such that the blue peak is
stronger. L1689B is a pre-stellar core and infall candidate but new JCMT HCO+
line profile data, presented here, confirms that both blue and red asymmetric
line profiles are present in this source. Moreover, a dividing line can be
drawn between the locations where each type of profile is found. It is argued
that it is unlikely that the line profiles can be interpreted with simple
models of infall or outflow and that rotation of the inner regions is the most
likely explanation. A rotational model is developed in detail with a new 3D
molecular line transport code and it is found that the best type of model is
one in which the rotational velocity profile is in between solid body and
Keplerian. It is firstly shown that red and blue asymmetric line profiles can
be generated with a rotation model entirely in the absence of any infall
motion. The model is then quantitively compared with the JCMT data and an
iteration over a range of parameters is performed to minmize the difference
between the data and model. The results indicate that rotation can dominate the
line profile shape even before the onset of infall.
