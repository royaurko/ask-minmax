A torsion pendulum allows ground-based investigation of the purity of
free-fall for the LISA test masses inside their capacitive position sensor.
This paper presents recent improvements in our torsion pendulum facility that
have both increased the pendulum sensitivity and allowed detailed
characterization of several important sources of acceleration noise for the
LISA test masses. We discuss here an improved upper limit on random force noise
originating in the sensor. Additionally, we present new measurement techniques
and preliminary results for characterizing the forces caused by the sensor's
residual electrostatic fields, dielectric losses, residual spring-like
coupling, and temperature gradients.
