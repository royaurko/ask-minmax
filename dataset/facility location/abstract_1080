We describe a new method of identifying night-time clouds over the Pierre
Auger Observatory using infrared data from the Imager instruments on the
GOES-12 and GOES-13 satellites. We compare cloud identifications resulting from
our method to those obtained by the Central Laser Facility of the Auger
Observatory. Using our new method we can now develop cloud probability maps for
the 3000 km^2 of the Pierre Auger Observatory twice per hour with a spatial
resolution of ~2.4 km by ~5.5 km. Our method could also be applied to monitor
cloud cover for other ground-based observatories and for space-based
observatories.
