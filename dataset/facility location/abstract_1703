Within the minimal supergravity model (mSUGRA) framework, the expectation for
the relic density of neutralinos exceeds the WMAP determination unless
neutralinos a) have a significant higgsino component, b) have a mass close to
half that of a heavy Higgs boson, or c)can efficiently co-annihilate with a
charged or colored particle. Within a 1-parameter extension of the mSUGRA model
which includes non-universal Higgs masses, we show that agreement with the WMAP
data can be obtained over a wide range of mSUGRA parameters for scenarios a)
and b), so that the phenomenological implications may be much more diverse than
in mSUGRA. We show that direct and/or indirect detection of neutralino dark
matter should be possible at various current and planned facilities.
