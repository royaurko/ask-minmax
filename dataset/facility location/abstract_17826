As a part of the "Dust, Ice, and Gas In Time" (DIGIT) key program on
Herschel, we observed GSS30-IRS1, a Class I protostar located in Ophiuchus (d =
120 pc), with Herschel/Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS). More
than 70 lines were detected within a wavelength range from 50 micron to 200
micron, including CO, H2O, OH, and two atomic [O I] lines at 63 and 145 micron.
The [C II] line, known as a tracer of externally heated gas by the interstellar
radiation field, is also detected at 158 micron. All lines, except [O I] and [C
II], are detected only at the central spaxel of 9.4" X 9.4". The [O I]
emissions are extended along a NE-SW orientation, and the [C II] line is
detected over all spaxels, indicative of external PDR. The total [C II]
intensity around GSS30 reveals that the far-ultraviolet radiation field is in
the range of 3 to 20 G0, where G0 is in units of the Habing Field, 1.6 X
10^{-3} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. This enhanced external radiation field heats the
envelope of GSS30-IRS1, causing the continuum emission to be extended, unlike
the molecular emission. The best-fit continuum model of GSS30-IRS1 with the
physical structure including flared disk, envelope, and outflow shows that the
internal luminosity is 10 Lsun, and the region is externally heated by a
radiation field enhanced by a factor of 130 compared to the standard local
interstellar radiation field.
