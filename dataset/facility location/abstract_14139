The quest for the particle nature of dark matter is one of the big open
questions of modern physics. The CRESST-II experiment, located at the Gran
Sasso laboratory in Italy, is optimised for the detection of the elastic
scattering of dark matter particles with ordinary matter. We present the result
obtained with an improved detector setup with increased radiopurity and
enhanced background rejection. The limit obtained in the so-called low mass
region between one and three GeV/c2 is at the present among the best limits
obtained for direct dark matter experiments. In addition we give an outlook of
the future potential for direct dark matter detection using further improved
CRESST CaWO4 cryogenic detectors.
