Experiment E02-019, performed in Hall C at the Thomas Jefferson National
Accelerator Facility (TJNAF), was a measurement of inclusive electron cross
sections for several nuclei ($^{2}$H,$^{3}$He, $^{4}$He, $^{9}$Be,$^{12}$C,
$^{63}$Cu, and $^{197}$Au) in the quasielastic region at high momentum
transfer.
  In the region of low energy transfer, the cross sections were analyzed in
terms of the reduced response, F(y), by examining its $y$-scaling behavior. The
data were also examined in terms of the nuclear structure function $\nu W_2^A$
and its behavior in $x$ and the Nachtmann variable $\xi$. The data show
approximate scaling of $\nu W_2^A$ in $\xi$ for all targets at all kinematics,
unlike scaling in $x$, which is confined to the DIS regime. However,
$y$-scaling observations are limited to the kinematic region dominated by the
quasielastic response ({$y<$0}), where some scaling violations arising from
FSIs are observed.
