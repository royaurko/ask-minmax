A hydrodynamic model involving cooling gas in the stagnation region of a
collimated outflow is proposed for the formation of the giant parsec-scale
bipolar envelope that surrounds the planetary nebula KjPn 8. Analytical
calculations and numerical simulations are presented to evaluate the model. The
envelope is considered to consist mainly of environmental gas swept-up by
shocks driven by an episodic, collimated, bipolar outflow. In this model, which
we call the ``free stagnation knot'' mechanism, the swept-up ambient gas
located in the stagnation region of the bow-shock cools to produce a high
density knot. This knot moves along with the bow-shock. When the central
outflow ceases, pressurization of the interior of the envelope stops and its
expansion slows down. The stagnation knot, however, has sufficient momentum to
propagate freely further along the axis, producing a distinct nose at the end
of the lobe. The model is found to successfully reproduce the peculiar shape
and global kinematics of the giant bipolar envelope of KjPn 8.
