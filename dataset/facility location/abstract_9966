Another phase transition that is probably of first order is found in the
beta-pyrochlore oxide superconductor KOs2O6 with a superconducting transition
temperature Tc of 9.6 K. It takes place at Tp=7.5 K in the superconducting
state in a zero magnetic field. By applying magnetic fields of up to 140 kOe,
the Tc gradually decreased to 5.2 K, while Tp changed little, eventually
breaking through the Hc2 line at approximately 65 kOe in the H-T diagram. Both
the normal-state resistivity and Hc2 change slightly but significantly across
the second phase transition. It is suggested that the transition is associated
with the rattling of potassium ions located in an oversized cage of osmium and
oxide ions.
