A method of enhanced optical cooling (EOC) based on nonlinear selective
interaction between particles and theirs amplified undulator radiation wavelets
(URW) in storage rings is discussed. It leads to non-exponential fast damping.
The selectivity is arranged by a moving screen located on the image plane of
the optical system projecting URW there.
