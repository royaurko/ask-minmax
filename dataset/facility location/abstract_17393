Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) HI observations, done as part of an
ongoing study of dwarf galaxies in the Lynx-Cancer void, resulted in the
discovery of a triplet of extremely gas rich galaxies located near the centre
of the void.The triplet members SDSS J0723+3621, J0723+3622 and J0723+3624 have
absolute magnitudes M_B of -14.2, -11.9 and -9.7 and M(HI)/L_B of \sim 2.9, ~10
and ~25, respectively. The gas mass fractions, as derived from the SDSS
photometry and the GMRT data are 0.93, 0.997, 0.997 respectively. The faintest
member of this triplet SDSS J0723+3624 is one of the most gas rich galaxies
known. We find that all three galaxies deviate significantly from the
Tully-Fisher relation, but follow the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. All three
galaxies also have a baryon fraction that is significantly smaller than the
cosmic baryon fraction. For the largest galaxy in the triplet, this is in
contradiction to numerical simulations. The discovery of this very unique dwarf
triplet lends support to the idea that the void environment is conducive to the
formation of galaxies with unusual properties. These observations also provide
further motivation to do deep searches of voids for a "hidden" very gas-rich
galaxy population with M_B > -11.
