A class of Fourier based statistics for irregular spaced spatial data is
introduced, examples include, the Whittle likelihood, a parametric estimator of
the covariance function based on the $\ell_{2}$-contrast function and a simple
nonparametric estimator of the spatial autocovariance which is a non-negative
function. The Fourier based statistic is a quadratic form of a discrete
Fourier-type transform of the spatial data. Evaluation of the statistic is
computationally tractable, requiring $O(b^{2})$ operations, where $b$ are the
number Fourier frequencies used in the definition of the statistic (which
varies according to the application). The asymptotic sampling properties of the
statistic are derived using mixed spatial asymptotics, where the number of
locations grows at a faster rate than the size of the spatial domain and under
the assumption that the spatial random field is stationary and the irregular
design of the locations are independent, identically distributed random
variables. The asymptotic analysis allows for both the case that the frequency
domain over which the estimator is defined is fixed and the case that the
frequency domain grows with the spatial domain.
