Visual observations of meteor showers have been carried out for many decades
by astronomers. Modern developments in imaging systems have advanced our
knowledge about the shower dynamics and their origin. We have made an attempt
to make a portable video recording system to observe meteor showers. The system
consists of a camera capable of recording the rapid motion of meteors entering
the Earths atmosphere. The camera is interfaced with a laptop using an open
source software like VirtualDub. The initial testing was carried out while
observing Geminid meteor shower in December, 2010 from the base of Mahuli fort
(Lat: $19.47{\deg}$ N, Long: $73.26{\deg}$ E) near Asangaon, India. Here, we
present few of the meteors recorded during this event, followed by a
preliminary analysis of the shower. The portable video recording system enables
to capture meteors at a remote location. This system will strengthen
traditional visual observation methods used by astronomers in India. Future
coordinated studies with a multi-station approach using such systems will
assist in deriving the parameters associated with meteor shower activity and
its impact on the Earth's atmosphere. Therefore, we propose long term and
simultaneous multi-station video observations in the Indian subcontinent for
continuous monitoring and better understanding of meteor dynamics.
