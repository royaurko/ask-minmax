We investigate the scattering process of impulse from impurities in vertical
granular chain system under gravity. Most of the studies are focused on the
case of light impurities. The reflection rates follow power laws with the
impuity depth. There is a valley in the curve of reflection rate versus the
initial perturbation strength and the curve is not symmetric. Some results on
the scattering process from heavy impurities are also presented. There is a
transition region in the initial velocity space. Through this region the
exponent for leading peak changes smoothly from its saturant value in small $
v_i$ side to its saturant value in large $v_i$ side; the exponent for signal
speed changes smoothly from its saturant value in small $v_i$ side to its
saturant value in large $v_i$ side. Both the peak of the exponent for
reflection rate and the valley for the reflection rate versus $v_i$ also locate
within this transition region.
