Jefferson Lab and MIT are developing a set of web-based tools within the
Lattice Hadron Physics Collaboration to allow lattice QCD theorists to treat
the computational facilities located at the two sites as a single
meta-facility. The prototype Lattice Portal provides researchers the ability to
submit jobs to the cluster, browse data caches, and transfer files between
cache and off-line storage. The user can view the configuration of the PBS
servers and to monitor both the status of all batch queues as well as the jobs
in each queue. Work is starting on expanding the present system to include job
submissions at the meta-facility level (shared queue), as well as multi-site
file transfers and enhanced policy-based data management capabilities.
