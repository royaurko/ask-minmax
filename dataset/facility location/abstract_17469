We present first results of a comprehensive photometric O-star survey
performed with a robotic twin refractor at the Universit\"atssternwarte Bochum
located near Cerro Armazones in Chile. For three high-mass stars, namely
Pismis24-1, CPD-518946 and HD319702, we determined the period through the
Lafler-Kinman algorithm and model the light curves within the framework of the
Roche geometry. For Pismis24-1, a previously known eclipsing binary, we provide
first light curves and determined a photometric period of 2.36 days together
with an orbital inclination of 61.8 degrees. The best-fitting model solution to
the light curves suggest a detached configuration. With a primary temperature
of T1 = 42520K we obtain the temperature of the secondary component as T2 =
41500K. CPD-518946 is another known eclipsing binary for which we present a
revised photometric period of 1.96 days with an orbital inclination of 58.4
degrees. The system has likely a semi-detached configuration and a mass ratio q
= M1/M2 = 2.8. If we adopt a primary temperature of T1 = 34550K we obtain T2 =
21500K for the secondary component. HD319702 is a newly discovered eclipsing
binary member of the young open cluster NGC6334. The system shows well-defined
eclipses favouring a detached configuration with a period of 2.0 days and an
orbital inclination of 67.5 degrees. Combining our photometric result with the
primary spectral type O8 III(f) (T1 = 34000K) we derive a temperature of T2 =
25200K for the secondary component.
