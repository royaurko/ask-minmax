We consider the mechanical equilibrium and stability of matter trapped in the
magnetosphere of a rapidly rotating star. Assuming a dipolar magnetic field and
arbitrary inclination of the magnetic axis with respect to the axis of rotation
we find stable equilibrium positions a) in a (warped) disk roughly aligned with
the magnetic equatorial plane and b) at two locations above and below the disk,
whose distance from the star increases with decreasing inclination angle
between dipole and rotation axis. The distribution of matter is not strongly
affected by allowing for a spatial offset of the magnetic dipole. These results
provide a possible explanation for some observations of corotating localized
mass concentrations in hot magnetic stars.
