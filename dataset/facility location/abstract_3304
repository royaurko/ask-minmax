We have converted the Palomar 60-inch telescope (P60) from a classical night
assistant-operated telescope to a fully robotic facility. The automated system,
which has been operational since September 2004, is designed for moderately
fast (t <~ 3 minutes) and sustained (R <~ 23 mag) observations of gamma-ray
burst afterglows and other transient events. Routine queue-scheduled
observations can be interrupted in response to electronic notification of
transient events. An automated pipeline reduces data in real-time, which is
then stored on a searchable web-based archive for ease of distribution. We
describe here the design requirements, hardware and software upgrades, and
lessons learned from roboticization. We present an overview of the current
system performance as well as plans for future upgrades.
