Photoactivation measurements on 144Sm have been performed with bremsstrahlung
endpoint energies from 10.0 to 15.5 MeV at the bremsstrahlung facility of the
superconducting electron accelerator ELBE of Forschungszentrum
Dresden-Rossendorf. The measured activation yield for the 144Sm(gamma,n)
reaction is compared with the calculated yield using cross sections from
previous photoneutron experiments. The activation yields measured for all
disintegration channels 144Sm(gamma,n), (gamma,p) and (gamma,alpha) are
compared to the yield calculated by using Hauser-Feshbach statistical models. A
new parametrization of the photon strength function is presented and the yield
simulated by using the modified photon strength parameters are compared to the
experimental data.
