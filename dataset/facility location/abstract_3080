Using the unique X-ray imaging capabilities of the Chandra observatory, a
2006 observation of Cygnus X-3 has provided insight into a singular feature
associated with this well-known microquasar. This extended emission, located
~16 arcseconds from Cygnus X-3, varies in flux and orbital phase (shifted by
0.56 in phase) with Cygnus X-3, acting like a celestial X-ray "mirror". The
feature's spectrum, flux and time variations allow us to determine the
location, size, density, and mass of the scatterer. We find that the scatterer
is a Bok globule located along our line of sight, and discuss its relationship
to Cygnus X-3. This is the first time such a feature has been identified with
the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
