We present a theoretical framework to accurately calculate the location of
the multicritical point in the phase diagram of spin glasses. The result shows
excellent agreement with numerical estimates. The basic idea is a combination
of the duality relation, the replica method, and the gauge symmetry. An
additional element of the renormalization group, in particular in the context
of hierarchical lattices, leads to impressive improvements of the predictions.
