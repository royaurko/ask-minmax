The Tokai to Kamioka (T2K) experiment uses a beam of muon neutrinos, produced
at the J-PARC facility on the east coast of Japan, to study neutrino
oscillations driven by the $\Delta m_{\textrm{atm}}^{2}$ mass splitting. A
suite of near detectors located 280~m from the secondary beam source samples
the unoscillated beam, and the Super-Kamiokande water Cherenkov detector
samples the beam at a baseline of 295~km, and at a point $2.5^\circ$ off the
beam axis, giving a narrow-band beam centred around 600~MeV. Analyses of the
oscillation channels $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\mu$ allow
measurements to be made of $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$ and $\Delta
m^2_{\textrm{atm}}$, and, ultimately, for weak constraints to be placed on the
CP-violating phase $\delta_{CP}$.
  In addition to these analyses, T2K has made world-leading neutrino
cross-section measurements in the sub-GeV energy range, utilising both the near
and far detectors. The present work will discuss both the most recent
measurements of the oscillation parameters, and these cross section analyses.
