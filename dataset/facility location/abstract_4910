Spectral properties of periodic one-dimensional array of nanorings in a
magnetic field are investigated. Two types of the superlattice are considered.
In the first one, rings are connected by short one-dimensional wires while in
the second one rings have immediate contacts between each other. The dependence
of the electron energy on the quasimomentum is obtained from the Schrodinger
equation for the Bloch wave function. We have found an interesting feature of
the system, namely, presence of discrete energy levels in the spectrum. The
levels can be located in the gaps or in the bands depending on parameters of
the system. The levels correspond to bound states and electrons occupying these
levels are located on individual rings or couples of neighbouring rings and
does not contribute to the charge transport. The wave function for the bound
states corresponding to the discrete levels is obtained. Modification of
electron energy spectrum with variation of system parameters is discussed.
