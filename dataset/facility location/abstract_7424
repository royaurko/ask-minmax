The present study presents a simple but effective method for 3D visualization
of the two-phase flow in the micro-tube. An isosceles right-angle prism
combined with a mirror located 45^o bevel to the prism is employed to obtain
synchronously the front and side views of the flow patterns with a single
camera, where the locations of the prism and the micro-tube for clearly imaging
should satisfy a fixed relationship which is specified in the present study.
The optical design is proven successfully by the tough visualization work at
the cryogenic temperature range. The image deformation due to the refraction
and geometrical configuration of the test section is quantitatively
investigated. It is calculated that the image is enlarged by about 20% in inner
diameter compared to the real object, which is validated by the experimental
results. Meanwhile, the image deformation by adding a rectangular optical
correction box outside the circular tube is comparatively investigated. It is
calculated that the image is reduced by about 20% in inner diameter with a
rectangular optical correction box compared to the real object. The 3D
re-construction process based on the two views is conducted through three
steps, which shows that 3D visualization method can be easily applied for
two-phase flow research in micro-scale channels and improves the measurement
accuracy of some important parameters of two-phase flow such as void fraction,
spatial distribution of bubbles, etc..
