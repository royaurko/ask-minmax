The truncation method is a collective name for techniques that arise from
truncating a Laurent series expansion (with leading term) of generic solutions
of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite its utility in
finding Backlund transformations and other remarkable properties of integrable
PDEs, it has not been generally extended to ordinary differential equations
(ODEs). Here we give a new general method that provides such an extension and
show how to apply it to the classical nonlinear ODEs called the Painleve
equations. Our main new idea is to consider mappings that preserve the
locations of a natural subset of the movable poles admitted by the equation. In
this way we are able to recover all known fundamental Backlund transformations
for the equations considered. We are also able to derive Backlund
transformations onto other ODEs in the Painleve classification.
