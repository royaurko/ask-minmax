We carried out the intercomparison experiments between VLBI and other
techniques to show the capability of VLBI time and frequency transfer by using
the current geodetic VLBI technique and facilities as the summary of the
experiments that we carried out since 2007. The results from the two different
types of experiments show that the VLBI is more stable than GPS but is slightly
noisier than two new two-way techniques (TW(DPN), ETS8(TCE)), and VLBI can
measure the correct time difference as same as ETS8(TCE).
