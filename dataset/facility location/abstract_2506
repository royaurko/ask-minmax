The CHIRON spectrometer is a new high-resolution, fiber-fed instrument on the
1.5 meter telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-America Observatory (CTIO). To
optimize use of the instrument and limited human resources, we have designed an
integrated set of web applications allowing target submission, observing script
planning, nightly script execution and logging, and access to reduced data by
multiple users. The unified and easy to use interface has dramatically reduced
the time needed to submit and schedule observations and improved the efficiency
and accuracy of nightly operations. We present our experience to help
astronomers and project managers who need to plan for the scope of effort
required to commission a queue-scheduled facility instrument.
