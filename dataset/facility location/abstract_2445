We compare the predictions of the SuperScaling model for charged current
quasielastic muonic neutrino and antineutrino scattering from $^{12}$C with
experimental data spanning an energy range up to 100 GeV. We discuss the
sensitivity of the results to different parametrizations of the nucleon vector
and axial-vector form factors. Finally, we show the differences between
electron and muon (anti-)neutrino cross sections relevant for the $\nu$STORM
facility.
