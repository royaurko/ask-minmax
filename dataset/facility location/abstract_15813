Band structure properties of $^{182}$Os are investigated through a particle
number and angular momentum constrained generator coordinate(GCM) calculation
based on self-consistent three-dimensional cranking solutions. From the
analysis of the wave function of the lowest GCM solution, we confirm that this
nucleus shows a tilted rotational motion in its yrast states, at least with the
present set of force parameters of the pairing-plus-quadrupole interaction
Hamiltonian. A close examination of behavior of other GCM solutions reveals a
sign of a possible occurrence of multi-band crossing in the nucleus.
Furthermore, in the course of calculations, we have also found a new potential
curve along the prime meridian on the globe of the $J=18\hbar$ sphere. Along
this new solution the characters of proton and neutron gap parameters get
interchanged. Namely, $\Delta_p$ almost vanishes while $\Delta_n$ grows to a
finite value close to the one corresponding to the principal axis
rotation(PAR). A state in the new solution curve at the PAR point turns out to
have almost the same characteristic features of an yrare $s$-band state which
gets located just above the $g$-band in our calculation. This fact suggests a
new type of seesaw vibrational mode of the proton and the neutron pairing,
occurring through a wobbling motion. The mode is considered to bridge the
$g$-band states and the $s$-band states in the backbending region.
