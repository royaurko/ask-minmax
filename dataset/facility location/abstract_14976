Using data from the Southern Galactic Plane Survey (SGPS) we analyze an HI
self-absorption cloud centered on l = 318.0 deg, b = -0.5 deg, and velocity, v
= -1.1 km/s. The cloud was observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA) and the Parkes Radio Telescope, and is at a near kinematic distance of
less than 400 pc with derived dimensions of less than 5 x 11 pc. We apply two
different methods to find the optical depth and spin temperature. In both
methods we find upper limit spin temperatures ranging from 20 K to 25 K and
lower limit optical depths ~ 1. We look into the nature of the HI emission and
find that 60-70% originates behind the cloud. We analyze a second cloud at the
same velocity centered on l = 319 deg and b = 0.4 deg with an upper limit spin
temperature of 20 K and a lower limit optical depth of 1.6. The similarities in
spin temperature, optical depth, velocity, and spatial location are evidence
the clouds are associated, possibly as one large cloud consisting of smaller
clumps of gas. We compare HI emission data with 12CO emission and find a
physical association of the HI self-absorption cloud with molecular gas.
