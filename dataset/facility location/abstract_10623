A mathematical model of genome degradation is proposed that takes into
account a variable rate of mutation and increasing number of cells in a
developing human organism. The model explains known properties of cancer
development, in particular, a synergism between different mutagens and an
increased probability of cancer in the early years of life. An iteration
equation is suggested that uses only a few model parameters and describes basic
regularities observed in cancer onset. In the model context, relatively small
chronic variations in the intracellular content of free radicals may markedly
affect the probability of a cell to become a cancer cell. On the other hand,
magnetic nanoparticles are shown to be an endogenous source of chronic magnetic
exposure that increases the local concentration of free radicals. An enhanced
level of leukaemia in early childhood is assumed to originate from magnetic
nanoparticles located in hematopoietic stem cells.
