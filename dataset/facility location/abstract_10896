The $\ge73m$ metastable states decay with a very characteristic signature
which allow them to be tagged event-by-event. Studies were performed using data
taken with a high-purity germanium detector in a low-background laboratory near
a nuclear power reactor core where $\nuebar$-flux was $\rm{6.4 \times 10^{12} ~
cm^{-2} s^{-1}}$. The measured average and equilibrium production rates of
$\ge73m$ were $\rm{(8.7 \pm 0.4)}$ and $\rm{(6.7 \pm 0.3) ~ kg^{-1} day^{-1}}$,
respectively. The production channels were studied and identified. By studying
the difference in the production of $\ge73m$ between the reactor ON and OFF
spectra, the limiting sensitivities at the range of $\rm{\sim 10^{-42} -
10^{-43} ~ cm^2}$ for the cross-sections of neutrino-induced nuclear
transitions were derived. The dominant background are due to $\beta$-decays of
cosmic-ray induced $^{73}$Ga. The prospects of enhancing the sensitivities at
underground locations are discussed.
