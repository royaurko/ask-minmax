We present a comprehensive study of a low-mass star-forming region,L1251B, at
wavelengths from the near-infrared to the millimeter. L1251B, where only one
protostar, IRAS 22376+7455, was known previously, is confirmed to be a small
group of protostars based on observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The
most luminous source of L1251B is located 5" north of the IRAS position. A
near-infrared bipolar nebula, which is not associated with the brightest object
and is located at the southeast corner of L1251B, has been detected in the IRAC
bands. OVRO and SMA interferometric observations indicate that the brightest
source and the bipolar nebula source in the IRAC bands are deeply embedded disk
sources.Submillimeter continuum observations with single-dish telescopes and
the SMA interferometric observations suggest two possible prestellar objects
with very high column densities. Outside of the small group, many young stellar
object candidates have been detected over a larger region of 12' x 12'.
Extended emission to the east of L1251B has been detected at 850 micron; this
"east core" may be a site for future star formation since no point source has
been detected with IRAC or MIPS. This region is therefore a possible example of
low-mass cluster formation, where a small group of pre- and protostellar
objects (L1251B) is currently forming, alongside a large starless core (the
east core).
