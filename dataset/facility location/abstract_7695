Edge localised modes (ELMs) are a concern for future devices, such as ITER,
due to the large transient heat loads they generate on the divertor surfaces
which could limit the operational time of the device. This paper discusses the
application of resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) as a mechanism for ELM
control on MAST. Experiments have been performed using an n=3 toroidal mode
number perturbation and measurements of the strike point splitting performed.
The measurements have been made using both infrared and visible imaging to
measure the heat and particle flux to the divertor. The measured profiles have
shown clear splitting in L-mode which compares well with the predication of the
splitting location from modelling including the effect of screening. The
splitting of the strike point has also been studied as a function of time
during the ELM. The splitting varies during the ELM, being the strongest at the
time of the peak heat flux and becoming more filamentary at the end of the ELM
(200 microseconds after the peak midplane D(alpha) emission). Variation in the
splitting profiles has also been seen, with some ELMs showing clear splitting
and others no splitting. A possible explanation of this effect is proposed, and
supported by modelling, which concerns the relative phase between the RMP field
and the ELM filament location.
