In this work, we find exact gravastar solutions in the context of
noncommutative geometry, and explore their physical properties and
characteristics. The energy density of these geometries is a smeared and
particle-like gravitational source, where the mass is diffused throughout a
region of linear dimension $\sqrt{(\alpha)}$ due to the intrinsic uncertainty
encoded in the coordinate commutator. These solutions are then matched to an
exterior Schwarzschild spacetime. We further explore the dynamical stability of
the transition layer of these gravastars, for the specific case of
$\beta=M^2/\alpha<1.9$, where M is the black hole mass, to linearized
spherically symmetric radial perturbations about static equilibrium solutions.
It is found that large stability regions exist and, in particular, located
sufficiently close to where the event horizon is expected to form.
