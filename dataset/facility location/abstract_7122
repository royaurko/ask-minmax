We study conditions for formation of recollimation shocks in jets interacting
with stellar winds in high-mass X-ray binaries. We show the existence of a
critical jet power, dependent on the wind rate and velocity and the jet
velocity, above which a recollimation shock is not formed. For the jet power
below critical, we derive the location of the shock. We test these prediction
by 3-D numerical simulations, which confirm the existence and the value of the
critical power. We apply our results to Cyg X-1 and Cyg X-3.
