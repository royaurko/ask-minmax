We review a sample of the experimental results from AGS to SPS and RHIC and
their interpretations towards understanding of the Quark-Gluon Plasma. We
discuss extrapolations of these results to the upcoming LHC experiments.
Finally, we present the plans to probe the QCD critical point with an energy
scan at RHIC and FAIR facilities.
