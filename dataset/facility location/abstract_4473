In order to distinguish between regular and chaotic planetary orbits we apply
a new technique called MEGNO in a wide neighbourhood of orbital parameters
determined using standard two-body Keplerian fits for HD 12661, HD 38529, HD
37124 and HD 160691 planetary systems. We show that the currently announced
orbital parameters place these systems in very different situations from the
point of view of dynamical stability. While HD 38529 and HD 37124 are located
within large stability zones in the phase space around their determined orbits,
the preliminary orbits in HD 160691 are highly unstable. The orbital parameters
of the HD 12661 planets are located in a border region between stable and
unstable dynamical regimes, so while its currently determined orbital
parameters produce stable regular orbits, a minor change within the margin of
error of just one parameter may result in a chaotic dynamical system.
