Investigating long series of spectral and photometric observations, we found
that the orbital elements of epsilon Aur are subject to much larger
uncertainties than usually believed. The H alpha emission is found to move
basically with the F primary but its exact location should still be
investigated. We also find strong additional absorption and large reddening of
the object near the third contact during the eclipse. Episodic atmospheric mass
transfer from the F primary towards its companion is tentatively suggested.
