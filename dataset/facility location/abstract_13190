The first full-scale three-dimensional (3D) core-collapse supernova (SN)
simulations with sophisticated neutrino transport show pronounced effects of
the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) for two high-mass progenitors
(20 and 27 M_sun). In a low-mass progenitor (11.2 M_sun), large-scale
convection is the dominant nonradial hydrodynamic instability in the postshock
accretion layer. The SASI-associated modulation of the neutrino signal (80 Hz
in our two examples) will be clearly detectable in IceCube or the future
Hyper-Kamiokande detector, depending on progenitor properties, distance, and
observer location relative to the main SASI sloshing direction. The neutrino
signal from the next galactic SN can therefore diagnose the nature of the
hydrodynamic instability.
