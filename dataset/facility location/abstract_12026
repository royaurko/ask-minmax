In a Hamiltonian system with impacts (or "billiard with potential"), a point
particle moves about the interior of a bounded domain according to a background
potential, and undergoes elastic collisions at the boundaries. When the
background potential is identically zero, this is the hard-wall billiard model.
Previous results on smooth billiard models (where the hard-wall boundary is
replaced by a steep smooth billiard-like potential) have clarified how the
approximation of a smooth billiard with a hard-wall billiard may be utilized
rigorously. These results are extended here to models with smooth background
potential satisfying some natural conditions. This generalization is then
applied to geometric models of collinear triatomic chemical reactions (the
models are far from integrable $n$-degree of freedom systems with $n\geq2$).
The application demonstrates that the simpler analytical calculations for the
hard-wall system may be used to obtain qualitative information with regard to
the solution structure of the smooth system and to quantitatively assist in
finding solutions of the soft impact system by continuation methods. In
particular, stable periodic triatomic configurations are easily located for the
smooth highly-nonlinear two and three degree of freedom geometric models.
