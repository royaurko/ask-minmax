We study the kinematics of a local sample of stars, located within a cylinder
of 500 pc radius centered on the Sun, in the RAVE dataset. We find clear
asymmetries in the $v_R$-$v_\phi$ velocity distributions of thin and thick disk
stars: here are more stars moving radially outwards for low azimuthal
velocities and more radially inwards for high azimuthal velocities. Such
asymmetries have been previously reported for the thin disk as being due to the
Galactic bar, but this is the first time that the same type of structures are
seen in the thick disk. Our findings imply that the velocities of thick disk
stars should no longer be described by Schwarzschild's, multivariate Gaussian
or purely axisymmetric distributions. Furthermore, the nature of previously
reported substructures in the thick disk needs to be revisited as these could
be associated with dynamical resonances rather than to accretion events. It is
clear that dynamical models of the Galaxy must fit the 3D velocity
distributions of the disks, rather than the projected 1D, if we are to
understand the Galaxy fully.
