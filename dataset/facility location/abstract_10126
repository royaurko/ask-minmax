We have developed a full model to simulate spherical detectors where all main
sources of noise are considered. We have built a computer code for determining
the source direction and the wave polarization (solution of the inverse
problem) in real time acquisition. The digital filter used is a simple bandpass
filter. The ``data'' used for testing our code was simulated, which considers
both the source signal and detector noise. The detector noise includes the
antenna thermal, back action, phase noise, series noise and thermal from
transducer coupled masses. The simulated noise takes into account all these
noises and the antenna-transducers coupling. The detector transfer function was
calculated for a spherical antenna with six two-mode parametric transducers.
  From the results we determined that spherical detectors are able to locate an
astrophysical source in the sky in real time as long as the signal-to-noise
ratio for a burst signal is equal to or higher than 3.
