Galactic open clusters do not survive long in the high density regions of the
inner Galactic disc. Inside the solar ring only 11 open clusters are known with
ages older than one Gyr. We show here, basing on deep, high-quality photometry,
that NGC 4337, contrary to earlier findings, is indeed an old open cluster. The
cluster is located very close to the conspicuous star cluster Trumpler 20, as
well mis-classified in the past, and that has received so much attention in
recent years. NGC 4337 shows a significant clump of He-burning stars which was
not detected previously. Its beautiful color-magnitude diagram is strikingly
similar to the one of the classical old open clusters IC 4651, NGC 752, and NGC
3680, and this suggests similar age and composition. A spectroscopic study is
much needed to confirm our findings. This, in turn, would also allow us to
better define the inner disc radial abundance gradient and its temporal
evolution.To this aim, a list of clump star candidates is provided.
