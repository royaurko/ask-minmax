In a previous paper a semi-microscopic core-particle coupling method that
includes the conventional strong coupling core-particle model as a limiting
case, was applied to spectra and electromagnetic properties of several
well-deformed odd nuclei. This work, coupled a large single-particle space to
the ground state bands of the neighboring even cores. In this paper, we
generalize the theory to include excited bands of the cores, such as beta and
gamma bands, and thereby show that the resulting theory can account for the
location and structure of all bands up to about 1.5 MeV.
