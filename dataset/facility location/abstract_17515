This paper argues that the effect of Hawking radiation on an astrophysical
black hole situated in a realistic cosmological context is not total
evaporation of the black hole; rather there will always be a remnant mass. The
key point is that the locus of emission of Hawking radiation is not the
globally defined event horizon. Rather the emission domain lies just outside a
timelike Marginal Outer Trapped Surface that is locally defined. The emission
domain is mainly located inside the event horizon. A spacelike singularity
forms behind the event horizon, and most of the Hawking radiation ends up at
this singularity rather than at infinity. Whether any Hawking radiation reaches
infinity depends on the relation between the emission domain and the event
horizon. From the outside view, even if radiation is seen as always being
emitted, the black hole never evaporates away, rather its mass and entropy
asymptote to finite non-zero limits, and the event horizon always acts as a
sink for matter and information. From an inside view, the matter and
information disappear into the singularity, which is the boundary of spacetime.
The argument is based on the nature of the processes at work plus a careful
delineation of the relevant causal domains; in order to confirm this model and
determine details of the outcome, detailed calculations of the expectation
value of the stress-energy-momentum tensor are needed to determine back
reaction effects.
