In very high energy collisions, many particles are produced and distributed
in the available phase space volume in various ways. With advent of new
accelerator facilities (especially, for nucleus-nucleus collisions), the
problem of pattern recognition in high multiplicity events becomes very actual
in order to classify such events and to separate those of them with some
special features (e.g. ring-like events, jets and other regular patterns). This
paper presents the first attempt to use wavelet technique for pattern
recognition in nucleus-nucleus collisions. After describing the method in
general, we demonstrate its power by applying it to a single event of Pb-Pb
collision at 158A GeV with 1072 charged particles produced and discuss results
obtained for some other events. Further extension of the method is proposed.
