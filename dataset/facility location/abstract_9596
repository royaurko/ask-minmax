It is shown that a coupled map model for open flow may exhibit spatial chaos
and spatial quasiperiodicity with temporal periodicity. The locations of these
patterns, which cover a substantial part of parameter space, are indicated in a
comprehensive phase diagram. In order to analyze the encountered phenomena, a
novel class of spatial maps is introduced which is very efficient in accurately
reproducing the original spatial patterns. It is found that temporally period
one spatial chaos is convectively unstable, and that it is possible to predict
an essential aspect of the bifurcation behavior of the coupled system solely by
considering its corresponding spatial map.
