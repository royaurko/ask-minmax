Correlations between anomalous activity patterns can yield pertinent
information about complex social processes: a significant deviation from normal
behavior, exhibited simultaneously by multiple pairs of actors, provides
evidence for some underlying relationship involving those pairs---i.e., a
multilateral relation. We introduce a new nonparametric Bayesian latent
variable model that explicitly captures correlations between anomalous
interaction counts and uses these shared deviations from normal activity
patterns to identify and characterize multilateral relations. We showcase our
model's capabilities using the newly curated Global Database of Events,
Location, and Tone, a dataset that has seen considerable interest in the social
sciences and the popular press, but which has is largely unexplored by the
machine learning community. We provide a detailed analysis of the latent
structure inferred by our model and show that the multilateral relations
correspond to major international events and long-term international
relationships. These findings lead us to recommend our model for any
data-driven analysis of interaction networks where dynamic interactions over
the edges provide evidence for latent social structure.
