Theories with ingredients like the Higgs mechanism, gravitons, and inflaton
fields rejuvenate the idea that relativistic kinematics is dynamically
emergent. Eternal inflation treats the Hubble constant H as depending on
location. Microscopic dynamics implies that H is over much smaller lengths than
pocket universes to be understood as a local space reproduction rate. We
illustrate this via discussing that even exponential inflation in TeV-gravity
is slow on the relevant time scale. In our on small scales inhomogeneous
cosmos, a reproduction rate H depends on position. We therefore discuss
Einstein-Straus vacuoles and a Lindquist-Wheeler like lattice to connect the
local rate properly with the scaling of an expanding cosmos. Consistency allows
H to locally depend on Weyl curvature similar to vacuum polarization. We derive
a proportionality constant known from Kepler's third law and discuss the
implications for the finiteness of the cosmological constant.
