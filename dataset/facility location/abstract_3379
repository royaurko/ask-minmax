The 2H(e,e'p)n cross section was measured in Hall A of the Thomas Jefferson
National Accelerator Facility (JLab) in quasielastic kinematics (x=0.96) at a
four-momentum transfer squared, Q^2=0.67 (GeV/c)^2. The experiment was
performed in fixed electron kinematics for recoil momenta from zero to 550
MeV/c. Though the measured cross section deviates by 1-2 sigma from a
state-of-the-art calculation at low recoil momenta, it agrees at high recoil
momenta where final state interactions (FSI) are predicted to be large.
