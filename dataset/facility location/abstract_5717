We present a two-band, wide-field imaging survey of an X-ray selected sample
of 78 clusters in the redshift range z=0.03-0.07. The aim of the project is to
provide the astronomical community with a complete set of homogeneous,
CCD-based, surface photometry and morphological data of the nearby cluster
galaxies located within 1.5Mpc from the cluster center.
