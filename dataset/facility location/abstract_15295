The 2-m Liverpool Telescope (LT), owned by Liverpool John Moores University,
is located in La Palma (Canary Islands) and operates in fully robotic mode. In
2005, the LT began conducting an automatic GRB follow-up program. On receiving
an automatic GRB alert from a Gamma-Ray Observatory (Swift, INTEGRAL, HETE-II,
IPN) the LT initiates a special override mode that conducts follow-up
observations within 2-3 min of the GRB onset. This follow-up procedure begins
with an initial sequence of short (10-s) exposures acquired through an r' band
filter. These images are reduced, analyzed and interpreted automatically using
pipeline software developed by our team called "LT-TRAP" (Liverpool Telescope
Transient Rapid Analysis Pipeline); the automatic detection and successful
identification of an unknown and potentially fading optical transient triggers
a subsequent multi-color imaging sequence. In the case of a candidate brighter
than r'=15, either a polarimetric (from 2006) or a spectroscopic observation
(from 2007) will be triggered on the LT. If no candidate is identified, the
telescope continues to obtain z', r' and i' band imaging with increasingly
longer exposure times. Here we present a detailed description of the LT-TRAP
and briefly discuss the illustrative case of the afterglow of GRB 050502a,
whose automatic identification by the LT just 3 min after the GRB, led to the
acquisition of the first early-time (< 1 hr) multi-color light curve of a GRB
afterglow.
