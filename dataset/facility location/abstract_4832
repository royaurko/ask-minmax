The magnetism of C-doped SnO$_{2}$ (001) surfaces is studied using
first-principles calculations. It is found that carbon does not induce
magnetism in bulk SnO$_{2}$ when located at the oxygen site, but shows a large
magnetic moment at the SnO$_{2}$ (001) surface. The magnetic moment is mainly
contributed by the carbon atoms due to empty minority spins of $p$ orbitals and
is localized at the surface and subsurface atoms. No magnetism is observed when
the carbon atom is located at the subsurface oxygen sites. The origin of
magnetism is discussed in the context of surface bonding.
