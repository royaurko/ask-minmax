By employing a semi-analytical dynamical mean-field approximation theory
previously proposed by the contributor [H. Hasegawa, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 67}, 041903
(2003)], we have developed an augmented moment method (AMM) in order to discuss
dynamics of an $N$-unit ensemble described by linear and nonlinear Langevin
equations with delays. In AMM, original $N$-dimensional {\it stochastic} delay
differential equations (SDDEs) are transformed to infinite-dimensional {\it
deterministic} DEs for means and correlations of local as well as global
variables. Infinite-order DEs arising from the non-Markovian property of SDDE,
are terminated at the finite level $m$ in the level-$m$ AMM (AMM$m$), which
yields $(3+m)$-dimensional deterministic DEs. Model calculations have been made
for linear and nonlinear Langevin models. The stationary solution of AMM for
the linear Langevin model with N=1 is nicely compared to the exact result. The
synchronization induced by an applied single spike is shown to be enhanced in
the nonlinear Langevin ensemble with model parameters locating at the
transition between oscillating and non-oscillating states. Results calculated
by AMM6 are in good agreement with those obtained by direct simulations.
