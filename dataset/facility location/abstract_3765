In this work we shall investigate the mass modifications of scalar mesons
$\left( D_{0}, B_{0}\right)$,vector mesons $\left( D^{\ast}, B^{\ast}\right)$
and axial-vector mesons $\left(D_{1}, B_{1}\right)$ at finite density and
temperature of the nuclear medium. The above mesons are modified in the nuclear
medium through themodification of quark and gluon condensates. We shall find
the medium modification of quark and gluon condensates within chiral SU(3)
model through the medium modification of scalar-isoscalar fields $\sigma$ and
$\zeta$ at finite density and temperature. These medium modified quark and
gluon condensates will further be used through QCD sum rules for the evaluation
of in-medium properties of above mentioned scalar, vector and axial vector
mesons. We shall also discuss the effects of density and temperature of the
nuclear medium on the scattering lengths of above scalar, vector and
axial-vector mesons. The study of the medium modifications of above mesons may
be helpful for understanding their production rates in heavy-ion collision
experiments. The results of present investigations of medium modifications of
scalar, vector and axial-vector mesons at finite density and temperature can be
verified in the Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment of FAIR facility at
GSI, Germany.
