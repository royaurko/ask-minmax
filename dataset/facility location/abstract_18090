We analyze retrospectively/prospectively the transient variations of three
different physical parameters of atmosphere during the time of M7.8 and M7.3
events in Nepal: outgoing earth radiation (OLR), GPS/TEC and the thermodynamic
proprieties in the lower atmosphere. We found that in mid March 2015 a rapid
augment of satellite observed earth radiation in atmosphere and the anomaly
located in close vicinity to the future M7.8 epicenter reached the maximum on
April 21-22. Our continuous satellite analysis revealed prospectively the new
strong anomaly on May 3th, which was the reason to contemplate another large
event in the area. On May 12, 2015 a large aftershock of M7.3 occurred. The
analysis of air temperature from weather ground station near Katmandu shows
analogous patterns with offset 1-2 days earlier to the satellite anomalies. The
GPS/TEC data analysis indicates an augment and variation in electron density
reaching a maximum value during April 22-24 period. A strong negative TEC
anomaly in the crest of EIA (Equatorial Ionospheric Anomaly) has occurred on
April 21st and strong positive on April 24th, 2015. Our preliminary results
show correlation between the pre-earthquake atmospheric and ionospheric
anomalies and the occurrence of 2015 M7.8 and M7.3 events in Nepal.
