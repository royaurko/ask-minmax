The nonlinear ionization with accompanied photorecombination on closely
located center has been considered. The radiation spectrum has been calculated
in the frame of the Lewenstein-Corkum approach. The dependence of radiation on
the distance between ionization point and the recombination center, and the
frequency and laser field strength has been investigated.
