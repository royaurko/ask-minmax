Non-conventional mesons, such as glueballs and tetraquarks, will be in the
focus of the PANDA experiment at the FAIR facility. In this lecture we recall
the basic properties of QCD and describe some features of unconventional
states.\ We focus on the search of the not-yet discovered glueballs and the use
of the extended Linear Sigma Model for this purpose, and on the already
discovered but not-yet understood $X,Y,Z$ states.
