An all sky redshift survey, using hydrogen 21 cm emission to locate galaxies,
can be used to track the wavelength of baryon acoustic oscillations imprints
from z ~ 1.5 to z = 0. This will allow precise determination of the evolution
of dark energy. A telescope made of fixed parabolic cylindrical reflectors
offers substantial benefit for such a redshift survey. Fixed cylinders can be
built for low cost, and long cylinders also allow low cost fast fourier
transform techniques to be used to define thousands of simultaneous beams. A
survey made with fixed reflectors naturally covers all of the sky available
from it's site with good uniformity, minimizing sample variance in the
measurement of the acoustic peak wavelength. Such a survey will produce about a
billion redshifts, nearly a thousand times the number available today. The
survey will provide a three dimensional mapping of a substantial fraction of
the Hubble Sphere.
