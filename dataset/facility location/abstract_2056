We reconstructed the 3D Fourier intensity distribution of mono-disperse
prolate nano-particles using single-shot 2D coherent diffraction patterns
collected at DESY's FLASH facility when a bright, coherent, ultrafast X-ray
pulse intercepted individual particles of random, unmeasured orientations. This
first experimental demonstration of cryptotomography extended the
Expansion-Maximization-Compression (EMC) framework to accommodate unmeasured
fluctuations in photon fluence and loss of data due to saturation or background
scatter. This work is an important step towards realizing single-shot
diffraction imaging of single biomolecules.
