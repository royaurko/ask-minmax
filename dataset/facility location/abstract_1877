Building an accelerator at six geographically dispersed sites is quite mad,
but politically expedient. The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), currently under
construction in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, combines a pulsed 1 Gev H-
superconducting linac with a compressor ring to deliver 2MW of beam power to a
liquid mercury target for neutron production [1]. Accelerator components,
target and experimental (neutron-scattering) instruments are being developed
collaboratively by Lawrence Berkeley (Ion Source and Front End), Los Alamos
(Linac), Thomas Jefferson (Cryosystems), Brookhaven (Compressor Ring), Oak
Ridge (Target and Conventional Facilities) and Argonne (Neutron Scattering
Instruments) National Laboratories. Similarly, a team distributed among all of
the participating laboratories is developing the EPICS-based control system.
This paper discusses the management model and strategies being used to address
the unusual issues of organization, communication, standardization, integration
and hand-off inherent in this widely-distributed project.
