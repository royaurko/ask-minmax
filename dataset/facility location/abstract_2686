The China Accelerator Driven Sub-critical System (CADS) is a high intensity
proton facility to dispose of nuclear waste and generate electric power. CADS
is based on 1.5GeV, 10mA CW superconducting (SC) linac as a driver. The
high-energy section of the linac is compose of two families of SC elliptical
cavities which are designed for the geometrical beta 0.63 and 0.82. In this
paper, the 650 MHz \b{eta}=0.63 SC elliptical cavity was studied including
cavity optimization, multipacting, high order modes (HOMs) and generator RF
power calculation. Keywords: high current, medium beta, ADS, superconducting
cavity, HOMs
