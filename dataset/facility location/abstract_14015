We examine Illinois educational data from standardized exams and analyze
primary factors affecting the achievement of public school students. We focus
on the simplest possible models: representation of data through visualizations
and regressions on single variables. Exam scores are shown to depend on school
type, location, and poverty concentration. For most schools in Illinois,
student test scores decline linearly with poverty concentration. However
Chicago must be treated separately. Selective schools in Chicago, as well as
some traditional and charter schools, deviate from this pattern based on
poverty. For any poverty level, Chicago schools perform better than those in
the rest of Illinois. Selective programs for gifted students show high
performance at each grade level, most notably at the high school level, when
compared to other Illinois school types. The case of Chicago charter schools is
more complex. In the last six years, their students' scores overtook those of
students in traditional Chicago high schools.
