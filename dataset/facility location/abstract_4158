Compared to traditional online maps, crowdsourced maps such as Waze are
unique in providing real-time updates on traffic, congestion, accidents and
points of interest. In this paper, we explore the practical impact of attacks
against crowdsourced map systems, and develop robust defenses against them. Our
experiments show that a single attacker with limited resources can cause havoc
on Waze, reporting false congestion and accidents and automatically rerouting
user traffic. We describe techniques to emulate Waze-enabled vehicles using
lightweight scripts, and how to use these "ghost riders" to compromise user
privacy by remotely tracking precise user movements while avoiding detection. A
single attacker can control groups of ghost riders, overwhelming data from
legitimate users and magnifying the impact of attacks. As defense, we propose a
new approach based on {\em co-location edges}, authenticated records that
attest to the one-time physical co-location of a pair of devices. Over time,
co-location edges combine to form large {\em proximity graphs}, network that
attest to physical interactions between devices. "Ghost-riders" cannot
physically interact with real devices and can be detected using graph
algorithms. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach using large
simulations, and discuss how they can be used to dramatically reduce the impact
of attacks against crowdsourced mapping services.
