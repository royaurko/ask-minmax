We describe the star formation histories of three late-type dwarfs located
outside the Local Group: IZw18, NGC1569 and NGC1705. The results are based on
the application of the method of synthetic colour-magnitude diagrams to deep
HST photometric data. All the examined galaxies were already forming stars at
the reached lookback time and show no evidence of long quiescent phases. The
obtained scenarios are quite similar to those derived for other galaxies of
this morphological type, both inside and outside the Local Group.
