An extension of the QED 'return to resonance' mechanism to light meson
emission ($\pi$, $\rho$) in (anti)proton collisions with a hadronic target
(nucleon or nucleus) is proposed. The cross section and the multiplicity
distributions are calculated. The collinear emission (along the beam direction)
of a charged meson may be used to produce high energy (anti)neutron beams.
Possible applications at existing and planned facilities are considered.
