Information on the size and shape of the neutron skin on $^{208}$Pb has been
extracted from coherent pion photoproduction cross sections measured using the
Crystal Ball together with the Glasgow tagger at the MAMI electron beam
facility. On exploitation of an interpolated fit of a theoretical model to the
measured cross sections the half-height radius and diffuseness of the neutron
distribution are found to be 6.70$\pm 0.03(stat)$ fm and 0.55$\pm
0.01(stat)$$^{+0.02}_{-0.03}(sys)$ fm respectively, corresponding to a neutron
skin thickness $\Delta r_{np}$=0.15$\pm 0.03(stat)$$^{+0.01}_{-0.03}(sys)$ fm.
The results give the first successful extraction of a neutron skin with an
electromagnetic probe and indicate the skin of $^{208}$Pb has a halo character.
The measurement provides valuable new constraints on both the structure of
nuclei and the equation of state for neutron-rich matter.
