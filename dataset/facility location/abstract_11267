This note is written for the Festschrift in honor of Professor Christer
Kiselman. Multiplier ideal sheaves identify the location and the extent of the
failure of crucial estimates. In this note we will discuss and explain the
historic evolution of the notion of multiplier ideal sheaves, especially the
interpretation from the viewpoint of destabilizing subsheaves in the context of
terminating or bounding an infinite process. We will also discuss the approach
of constructing rational curves in Fano manifolds by using dynamic multiplier
ideal sheaves and singularity-magnifying complex Monge-Ampere equations. This
approach is still under development with details in the process of being worked
out. We will indicate where details still need to be worked out.
