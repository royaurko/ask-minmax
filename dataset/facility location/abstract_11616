It has been established earlier that sharp features like the base of the
convective zone or the second helium ionisation zone inside a star give rise to
sinusoidal oscillations in the frequencies of pulsation. The acoustic depth of
such features can be estimated from this oscillatory signal in the frequencies.
We apply this technique for the CoRoT frequencies of the solar-type star
HD49933. This is the first time that such analysis has been done of seismic
data for any star other than the Sun. We are able to determine the acoustic
depth of both the base of the convective zone and the HeII ionisation zone of
HD49933 within 10% error from the second differences of the frequencies. The
locations of these layers using this technique is in agreement with the current
seismic models of HD49933.
