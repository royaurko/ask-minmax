The Telescope Array Low-Energy Extension (TALE) is a hybrid, Air Fluorescence
Detector (FD) / Scintillator Array, designed to study cosmic ray initiated
showers at energies above $\sim3\times10^{16}$ eV. Located in the western Utah
desert, the TALE FD is comprised of 10 telescopes which cover the elevation
range 31-58$^{\circ}$ in addition to 14 telescopes with elevation coverage of
3-31$^{\circ}$.
  As with all other FD's, a subset of the shower events recorded by TALE are
ones for which the Cerenkov light produced by the shower particles dominates
the total observed light signal. In fact, for the telescopes with higher
elevation coverage, low energy Cerenkov events form the vast majority of
triggered cosmic ray events. In the typical FD data analysis procedure, this
subset of events is discarded and only events for which the majority of signal
photons come from air fluorescence are kept.
  In this talk, I will report on a study to reconstruct the "Cerenkov Events"
seen by the high elevation viewing telescopes of TALE. Monte Carlo studies and
a first look at real events observed by TALE look very promising. Even as a
monocular detector, the geometrical reconstruction method employed in this
analysis allows for a pointing accuracy on the order of a degree. Preliminary
Monte Carlo studies indicate that, the expected energy resolution is better
than 25$%$. It may be possible to extend the low energy reach of TALE to below
$10^{16}$ eV. This would be the first time a detector designed specifically as
an air fluorescence detector is used as an imaging Cerenkov detector.
