The evaluation of fluid forces on the stem is important for wear prediction
of valve and actuator guidance parts. While estimating the axial load is
straight forward, estimating and/or measuring the side load is more difficult,
especially for globe valves. Therefore, measurements are carried out on an ad
hoc, scale 1, model of a 2" globe valve. The body is replicated in Plexiglas to
enable flow visualization and the original stem is heavily instrumented to
allow force measurements in every direction. The flow loop facility used for
this experiment is designed to allow fine-tuning of the cavitation intensity.
The experiment is run for a set of cavitation conditions, flow rates and disc
positions. The results show that the transverse force (perpendicular to the
stem) can reach the order of the axial force; thus it should not be ignored. We
also observed that it depends very weakly on the cavitation levels. Videos made
with a high-speed camera allow an interesting understanding of the fluid flow
and the cavitation creation. Moreover, CFD simulations of this experiment,
limited to the single phase flow are compared to the experiments. Through the
experimental testing, visual observations, and computational predictions, the
role of the cavitation on the fluid forces is better understood.
