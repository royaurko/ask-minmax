Two models for the long-range random impurity potential (the model with
randomly distributed charged centers located within a layer and the model of
the system with a spacer) are used for evaluation of the impurity potential
fluctuation characteristics: the random potential amplitude, nonlinear
screening length in vicinity of integer filling factors nu = 1 and nu = 2 and
the background density of state (DOS). The described models are suitable for
explanation of the unusually high value of DOS at nu = 1 and nu = 2, in
contrast to the short-range impurity potential models.
