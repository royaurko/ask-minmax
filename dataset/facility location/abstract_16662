Cosmic ray electrons and positrons constitute an important component of the
background for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope Systems with very low
energy thresholds. As the primary energy of electrons and positrons decreases,
their contribution to the background trigger rate dominates over protons, at
least in terms of differential rates against actual energies. After event
reconstruction, this contribution might become comparable to the proton
background at energies of the order of few GeV. It is well known that the flux
of low energy charged particles is suppressed by the Earth's magnetic field.
This effect strongly depends on the geographical location, the direction of
incidence of the charged particle and its mass. Therefore, the geomagnetic
field can contribute to diminish the rate of the electrons and positrons
detected by a given array of Cherenkov Telescopes.
  In this work we study the propagation of low energy primary electrons in the
Earth's magnetic field by using the backtracking technique. We use a more
realistic geomagnetic field model than the one used in previous calculations.
We consider some sites relevant for new generations of imaging atmospheric
Cherenkov Telescopes. We also study in detail the case of 5@5, a proposed low
energy Cherenkov Telescope array.
