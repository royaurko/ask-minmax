We propose novel methods for predictive (sparse) PCA with spatially
misaligned data. These methods identify principal component loading vectors
that explain as much variability in the observed data as possible, while also
ensuring the corresponding principal component scores can be predicted
accurately by means of spatial statistics at locations where air pollution
measurements are not available. This will make it possible to identify
important mixtures of air pollutants and to quantify their health effects in
cohort studies, where currently available methods cannot be used. We
demonstrate the utility of predictive (sparse) PCA in simulated data and apply
the approach to annual averages of particulate matter speciation data from
national Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory monitors.
