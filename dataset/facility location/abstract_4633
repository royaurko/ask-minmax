Recently the Lifshitz theory of dispersion forces was extended for the case
of an atom (molecule) interacting with a plane surface of a uniaxial crystal or
with a long solid cylinder or cylindrical shell made of isotropic material or
uniaxial crystal. The obtained results are applicable to nanosystems. In
particular, we investigate the Casimir-Polder interaction between hydrogen
atoms (molecules) and multi-wall carbon nanotubes. It is demonstrated that the
hydrogen atoms located inside multiwall carbon nanotubes have a lower free
energy compared to those located outside. We also perform comparison studies of
the interaction of hydrogen atoms between themselves and with multi-wall carbon
nanotube. The obtained results are important for the problem of hydrogen
storage.
