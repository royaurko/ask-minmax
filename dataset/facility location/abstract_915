We present a prototype system that can be used to capture longitudinal
socialising processes by recording people's encounters in space. We argue that
such a system can usefully be deployed in prisons and other detention
facilities in order help intelligence analysts assess the behaviour or
terrorist and organised crime groups, and their potential relationships. Here
we present the results of a longitudinal study, carried out with civilians,
which demonstrates the capabilities of our system.
