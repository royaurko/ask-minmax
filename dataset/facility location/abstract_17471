We present a deep Cousins RI photometric survey of the open cluster NGC 1960,
complete to R_C \simeq 22, I_C \simeq 21, that is used to select a sample of
very low-mass cluster candidates. Gemini spectroscopy of a subset of these is
used to confirm membership and locate the age-dependent "lithium depletion
boundary" (LDB) --the luminosity at which lithium remains unburned in its
low-mass stars. The LDB implies a cluster age of 22 +/-4 Myr and is quite
insensitive to choice of evolutionary model. NGC 1960 is the youngest cluster
for which a LDB age has been estimated and possesses a well populated upper
main sequence and a rich low-mass pre-main sequence. The LDB age determined
here agrees well with precise age estimates made for the same cluster based on
isochrone fits to its high- and low-mass populations. The concordance between
these three age estimation techniques, that rely on different facets of stellar
astrophysics at very different masses, is an important step towards calibrating
the absolute ages of young open clusters and lends confidence to ages
determined using any one of them.
