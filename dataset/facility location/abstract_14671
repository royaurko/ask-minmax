We report on monitoring of the BL Lac object PKS 2005-489 by the Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer (RXTE) in October-December 1998. During these months, the
source underwent a spectacular flare; at its peak on November 10, its 2-10 keV
flux was $3.33 \times 10^{-10} {\rm ~erg ~cm^{-2} ~s^{-1}}$, over 30 times
brighter than in quiescence. During the rising phase, the X-ray spectrum of PKS
2005-489 hardened considerably, reaching $\alpha = 1.32~ (F_\nu \propto
\nu^{-\alpha})$ near maximum. During the declining phase, the X-ray spectrum
steepened rapidly, reaching $\alpha = 1.82$, then became somewhat harder
towards the end of December ($\alpha \sim 1.6$). While such behavior has been
seen before, the simplicity, magnitude and duration of this flare allowed us to
study it in great detail. We argue that this flare was caused by either the
injection of particles into the jet or {\it in situ} particle acceleration, and
that the spectral steepening which followed the flare maximum was the result of
synchrotron cooling. Contrary to other recently observed blazar flares (e.g.,
Mkn 501, 3C 279, PKS 2155-304), our results do not imply a major shift in the
location of the synchrotron peak during this flare.
