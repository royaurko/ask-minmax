The pulsational properties of the Cepheid models along the evolutionary
tracks from the Padova group (Girardi et al.), as calculated with our turbulent
convective pulsation code, are in good agreement with the resonance constraints
imposed by the observational OGLE-2 data of the Small and Large Magellanic
Clouds. Our study suggests that the P_4/P_1=1/2 resonance for the overtone
Cepheids occurs for periods clustering around 4.2 d, in disagreement with the
suggestion of Antonello & Poretti based on the observations of light curves,
but in agreement with Kienzle et al. and Feuchtinger et al. For the fundamental
Cepheids the lowest order Fourier decomposition coefficients from the light
curves, \viz R_21 and phi_21 can be used to locate the resonance region, but
not so for the first overtone Cepheids. Here, the radial velocity curves can be
used to locate the overtone resonance region, or in their absence, one needs to
resort to numerical hydrodynamic modelling.
