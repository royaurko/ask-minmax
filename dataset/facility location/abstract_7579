Presence-only data, point locations where a species has been recorded as
being present, are often used in modeling the distribution of a species as a
function of a set of explanatory variables---whether to map species occurrence,
to understand its association with the environment, or to predict its response
to environmental change. Currently, ecologists most commonly analyze
presence-only data by adding randomly chosen "pseudo-absences" to the data such
that it can be analyzed using logistic regression, an approach which has
weaknesses in model specification, in interpretation, and in implementation. To
address these issues, we propose Poisson point process modeling of the
intensity of presences. We also derive a link between the proposed approach and
logistic regression---specifically, we show that as the number of
pseudo-absences increases (in a regular or uniform random arrangement),
logistic regression slope parameters and their standard errors converge to
those of the corresponding Poisson point process model. We discuss the
practical implications of these results. In particular, point process modeling
offers a framework for choice of the number and location of pseudo-absences,
both of which are currently chosen by ad hoc and sometimes ineffective methods
in ecology, a point which we illustrate by example.
