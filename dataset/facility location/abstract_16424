I report observations of unusually strong photospheric and chromospheric
velocity oscillations in and near the leading sunspot of NOAA 10781 on 03 July
2005. I investigate an impinging wave as a possible origin of the velocity
pattern, and the changes of the wave after the passage through the magnetic
fields of the sunspot. The wave pattern found consists of a wave with about 3
Mm apparent wavelength that propagates towards the sunspot. This wave seems to
trigger oscillations inside the sunspot's umbra, which originate from a
location inside the penumbra on the side of the impinging wave. The wavelength
decreases and the velocity amplitude increases by an order of magnitude in the
chromospheric layers inside the sunspot. On the side of the sunspot opposite to
the impinging plane wave, circular wave fronts centered on the umbra are seen
propagating away from the sunspot outside its outer white-light boundary. They
lead to a peculiar ring structure around the sunspot, which is visible in both
velocity and intensity maps. The fact that only weak photospheric velocity
oscillations are seen in the umbra - contrary to the chromosphere where they
peak there - highlights the necessity to include the upper solar atmosphere in
calculations of wave propagation through spatially and vertically extended
magnetic field concentrations like sunspots.
