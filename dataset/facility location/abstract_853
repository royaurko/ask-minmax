We explore changes in abundance patterns that occur late in the r process. As
the neutrons available for capture begin to disappear, a quasiequilibrium
funnel shifts material into the large peaks at A=130 and A=195, and into the
rare-earth "bump" at A=160. A bit later, after the free-neutron abundance has
dropped and beta-decay has begun to compete seriously with neutron capture, the
peaks can widen. The degree of widening depends largely on neutron-capture
rates near closed neutron shells and relatively close to stability. We identify
particular nuclei the capture rates of which should be examined experimentally,
perhaps at a radioactive beam facility.
