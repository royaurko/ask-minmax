The proton radius puzzle questions the self-consistency of theory and
experiment in light muonic and electronic bound systems. Here, we summarize the
current status of virtual particle models as well as Lorentz-violating models
that have been proposed in order to explain the discrepancy. Highly charged
one-electron ions and muonic bound systems have been used as probes of the
strongest electromagnetic fields achievable in the laboratory. The average
electric field seen by a muon orbiting a proton is comparable to hydrogenlike
Uranium and, notably, larger than the electric field in the most advanced
strong-laser facilities. Effective interactions due to virtual annihilation
inside the proton (lepton pairs) and process-dependent corrections (nonresonant
effects) are discussed as possible explanations of the proton size puzzle. The
need for more experimental data on related transitions is emphasized.
