We present 0.15 arcsec (56 pc) resolution MERLIN observations of neutral
hydrogen (HI) 21 cm absorption detected towards the arcsecond-scale radio jet
of the Seyfert 1.5 galaxy Markarian 6.
  Absorption is detected only towards a bright, compact radio feature located,
in projection, ~ 380 pc north of the likely location of the optical nucleus.
Based on comparison with an archival HST image, we propose a geometry in which
the HI absorption arises in a dust lane passing north of, but not covering, the
optical nucleus, and the southern lobe of the jet is oriented on the near side
of the inclined galaxian disk. We note that this result is contrary to previous
models which place the extended narrow-line region on the near side of the
disk.
