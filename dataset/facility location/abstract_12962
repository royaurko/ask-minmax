Nereid, a satellite of Neptune, has a highly eccentric prograde orbit with a
semi-major axis larger than 200 Neptune radius and is classified as an
irregular satellite. Although the capture origin of irregular satellites has
been widely accepted, several previous studies suggest that Nereid was formed
in the circumplanetary disk of Neptune and was ejected outward to the present
location by Triton. Our time-series photometric observations confirm that the
spin is stable and non-chaotic with a period of 11.5 hr as indicated by Grav et
al. (2003). The optical colors of Nereid are indistinguishable from those of
trans-Neptunian objects and Centaurs, especially those with neutral colors. We
also find the consistency of Nereid's rotation with the size-rotation
distribution of small outer bodies. It is more likely that Nereid originates in
an immigrant body captured from a heliocentric orbit which was 4-5 AU away from
Neptune's orbit.
