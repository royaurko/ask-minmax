The first heavy-ion run at the LHC with Pb+Pb collisions at roots_NN = 2.76
TeV took place in the fall of 2010. In a short and relatively low luminosity
run, the three detectors, ALICE, ATLAS and CMS showcased an impressive
performance and produced a wealth of a high quality results. This article
compares the new LHC results with those accumulated over the last decade at
RHIC, focussing on the quantitative and qualitative differences between the
different energy regimes of these two facilities.
