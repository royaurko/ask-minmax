This paper gives a survey of related work on the information visualization
domain and study the real integration of the cartography paradigms in actual
information search systems. Based on this study, we propose a semantic
visualization and navigation approach which offer to users three search modes:
precise search, connotative search and thematic search. The objective is to
propose to the users of an information search system, new interaction paradigms
which support the semantic aspect of the considered information space and guide
users in their searches by assisting them to locate their interest center and
to improve serendipity.
