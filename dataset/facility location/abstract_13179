Many DNA sequence variants influence phenotypes by altering gene expression.
Our understanding of these variants is limited by sample sizes of current
studies and by measurements of mRNA rather than protein abundance. We developed
a powerful method for identifying genetic loci that influence protein
expression in very large populations of the yeast Saccharomyes cerevisiae. The
method measures single-cell protein abundance through the use of
green-fluorescent-protein tags. We applied this method to 160 genes and
detected many more loci per gene than previous studies. We also observed closer
correspondence between loci that influence protein abundance and loci that
influence mRNA abundance of a given gene. Most loci cluster at hotspot
locations that influence multiple proteins - in some cases, more than half of
those examined. The variants that underlie these hotspots have profound effects
on the gene regulatory network and provide insights into genetic variation in
cell physiology between yeast strains.
