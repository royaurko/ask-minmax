Searching for objects amongst clutter is a key ability of visual systems.
Speed and accuracy are often crucial: how can the visual system trade off these
competing quantities for optimal performance in different tasks? How does the
trade-off depend on target appearance and scene complexity? We show that the
optimal tradeoff strategy may be cast as the solution to a partially observable
Markov decision process (POMDP) and computed by a dynamic programming
procedure. However, this procedure is computationally intensive when the visual
scene becomes too cluttered. Therefore, we also conjecture an optimal strategy
that scales to large number of clutters. Our conjecture applies to homogeneous
visual search and for a special case of heterogenous search where the
signal-to-noise ratio differs across location. Using the conjecture we show
that two existing decision mechanisms for analyzing human data, namely
diffusion-to-bound and maximum-of-output, are sub-optimal; the optimal strategy
instead employs two scaled diffusions.
