We compute the $1/N$ correction to the location of the previously found
first-order phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model at a chemical potential
$\mu = \mu_c = {1 \over \sqrt{2}} m$, where $m$ is the fermion mass. We
employ an expression for the free energy $f(\mu)$ given by the thermodynamic
Bethe ansatz under the approximation that the fundamental fermions dominate
the ground state, and combine it with the effective potential evaluated at
zero chemical potential. Our result is $\mu_c = {m \over \sqrt{2}} [1 - {0.47
\over N}]$.
