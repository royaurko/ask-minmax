In the last years it turned out that instantons and monopoles have a certain
local correlation in four-dimensional QCD. It was demonstrated by several
groups independently and by different methods that at the locations of
instantons also monopoles in the maximal abelian projection can be found with
enhanced probability. Further we observed such nontrivial correlation functions
in the deconfinement phase. We continue our visualization project to analyze
several specific gauge-field configurations.
