Wireless sensor networks are often modeled in terms of a dense deployment of
smart sensor nodes in a two-dimensional region. Give a node deployment, the
\emph{critical geometric graph (CGG)} over these locations (i.e., the connected
\emph{geometric graph (GG)} with the smallest radius) is a useful structure
since it provides the most accurate proportionality between hop-count and
Euclidean distance. Hence, it can be used for GPS-free node localisation as
well as minimum distance packet forwarding. It is also known to be
asymptotically optimal for network transport capacity and power efficiency. In
this context, we propose DISCRIT, a distributed and asynchronous algorithm for
obtaining an approximation of the CGG on the node locations. The algorithm does
not require the knowledge of node locations or internode distances, nor does it
require pair-wise RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) measurements to be
made. Instead, the algorithm makes use of successful Hello receipt counts
(obtained during a Hello-protocol-based neighbour discovery process) as edge
weights, along with a simple distributed min-max computation algorithm. In this
paper, we first provide the theory for justifying the use of the above edge
weights. Then we provide extensive simulation results to demonstrate the
efficacy of DISCRIT in obtaining an approximation of the CGG. Finally, we show
how the CGG obtained from DISCRIT performs when used in certain network
self-organisation algorithms.
