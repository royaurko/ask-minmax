The launch of several sensitive X-ray and gamma-ray instruments during the
last decade heralded a new era in the research of millisecond pulsars. The
current number of millisecond pulsars detected in the X-ray spectral window is
about 30, including those located in globular clusters, which represents a
significant fraction of the total number of spin-down powered pulsars emitting
high-energy radiation.In this paper the observational X/gamma-ray status is
reported for a subset of X-ray emitting millisecond pulsars which show
high-energy tails: PSR B1821-24, PSR J0218+4232 and PSR B1937+21. The prospects
for future detection of these 3 millisecond pulsars at soft (INTEGRAL) and hard
(AGILE/GLAST) gamma-rays are discussed.
