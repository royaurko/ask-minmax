Dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB) is one of the keystones of
low-energy hadronic phenomena. Dyson-Schwinger equations provide a
model-independent quark-level understanding and correlate that with the
behaviour of the pion's Bethe-Salpeter amplitude. This amplitude is a core
element in the calculation of pion observables and combined with the
dressed-quark Schwinger function required by DCSB it yields a valence-quark
distribution function for the pion that behaves as (1-x)^2 for x~1, in
accordance with perturbative analyses. This behaviour can be verified at
contemporary experimental facilities.
