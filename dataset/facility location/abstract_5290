The GERDA (GERmanium Detector Array) experiment aiming to search for the
neutrinoless double beta decay of 76Ge at the Laboratori Nazionali Del Gran
Sasso (LNGS), Italy, will operate bare enriched high-purity germanium (HPGe)
detectors in liquid argon. GERDA Phase I will use the enriched diodes from the
previous Heidelberg-Moscow (HdM) and IGEX experiments. With the HPGe detectors
mounted in a low-mass holder, GERDA aims at an excellent energy resolution and
extremely low background. The goal is to check the claim for the neutrinoless
double beta decay evidence in the HdM 76Ge experiment within one year of data
taking. Before dismounting the enriched diodes from their cryostat, the
performance parameters of the HdM and the IGEX detectors have been measured.
The diodes have been removed from their cryostats, their dimensions measured
and they have been put under va-cuum in a transportation container. They are
now being refurbished for GERDA Phase I at Canberra Semiconductor NV. Before
operating the enriched diodes, a non-enriched HPGe p-type detector mounted in a
low-mass holder is operated in the liquid argon test facility of the GERDA
Detector Laboratory (GDL) at LNGS. Since January 2006, the testing of the
prototype detector is being carried out in the GDL as well as at the site of
the detector manufacturer.
