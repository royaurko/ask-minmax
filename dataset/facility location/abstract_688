Sampling of physical fields with mobile sensor is an emerging area. In this
context, this work introduces and proposes solutions to a fundamental question:
can a spatial field be estimated from samples taken at unknown sampling
locations? Unknown sampling location, sample quantization, unknown bandwidth of
the field, and presence of measurement noise present difficulties in the
process of field estimation. In this work, except for quantization, the other
three issues will be tackled together in a mobile-sampling framework. Spatially
bandlimited fields are considered. It is assumed that measurement-noise
affected field samples are collected on spatial locations obtained from an
unknown renewal process}. That is, except for a renewal process structure, the
sampling locations and the inter-sample distribution are unknown. It is shown
that the mean-squared error decreases as $O(1/n)$ where $n$ is the oversampling
employed by the mobile sensor. Oversampling is obtained by controlling the mean
value of the inter-sample spacing. An algorithm to ascertain spatial field's
bandwidth is detailed, which works with high probability as the oversampling
increases. This algorithm works in the same setup, i.e., in the presence of
measurement-noise and unknown sampling locations.
