EDELWEISS-2 is a Ge-bolometer experiment located in the underground
laboratory Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane (LSM, France). For the second phase
of the experiment, the collaboration has developed new cryogenic detectors with
an improved background rejection (interleaved electrodes design, Phys. Lett.
B681 (2009) 305). A continuous operation of ten of these bolometers at LSM
together with an active muon veto shielding has been achieved. First results
based on an effective exposure of 144 kg \dot d taken in 2009 have been
published recently (Phys. Lett. B687 (2010) 29), the acquired data set has
since then been doubled. The already published data correspond to an
improvement in sensitivity of about 15 compared to EDELWEISS-1. We present and
discuss the latest bolometer data including the identification of muon-induced
background events and special measurements of muon-induced neutrons in LSM.
