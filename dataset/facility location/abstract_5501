The first data on target and beam-target asymmetries for the $\gamma
p\to\pi^0\eta p$ reaction at photon energies from 1050 up to 1450 MeV are
presented. The measurements were performed using the Crystal Ball and TAPS
detector setup at the Glasgow tagged photon facility of the Mainz Microtron
MAMI. The general assumption that the reaction is dominated by the $\Delta
3/2^-$ amplitude is confirmed. The data are in particular sensitive to small
contributions from other partial waves.
