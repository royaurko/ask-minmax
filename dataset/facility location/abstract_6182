We prove a strong law of large numbers for the location of the second class
particle in a totally asymmetric exclusion process when the process is started
initially from a decreasing shock. This completes a study initiated in Ferrari
and Kipnis [Ann. Inst. H. Poincare Probab. Statist. 13 (1995) 143-154].
