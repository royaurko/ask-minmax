We address two questions related to the procedure of identifying center
vortices based on center projection in maximal center gauge: 1. How does the
procedure work, why is it expected to locate center vortices relevant for
confinement, and why does it in some cases fail, on lattice configurations
preconditioned in a special way? 2. Does the mechanism work the same way for 3
colors instead of 2? (The paper is an abridged version of two recent e-prints,
hep-lat/9910033 and hep-lat/9911006.)
