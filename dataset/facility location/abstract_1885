The term beta-beam has been coined for the production of a pure beam of
electron neutrinos or their antiparticles through the decay of radioactive ions
circulating in a storage ring. This concept requires radioactive ions to be
accelerated to a Lorentz gamma of 150 for 6He and 60 for 18Ne. The neutrino
source itself consists of a storage ring for this energy range, with long
straight sections in line with the experiment(s). Such a decay ring does not
exist at CERN today, nor does a high-intensity proton source for the production
of the radioactive ions. Nevertheless, the existing CERN accelerator
infrastructure could be used as this would still represent an important saving
for a beta-beam facility. This paper outlines the first study, while some of
the more speculative ideas will need further investigations.
