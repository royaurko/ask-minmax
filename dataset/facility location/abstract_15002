This letter presents the first results of an observational campaign to study
the Galactic Centre with INTEGRAL. The mosaicked images obtained with the
IBIS/ISGRI coded aperture instrument in the energy ranges 20-40 and 40-100 keV,
give a yet unseen view of the high-energy sources of this region in hard X- and
gamma-rays with an angular resolution of 12 arcmin (FWHM). We report on the
discovery of a source, IGR J17456-2901, coincident with the Galactic Nucleus
SgrA* to within 0.9 arcmin. Located at R.A.(J2000.0) = 17h45m38.5s,
Dec.(J2000.0) = -29:01:15, the source is visible up to about 100 keV with a
20-100 keV luminosity at 8 kpc of (2.89 +/- 0.41) x 10^35 ergs/s. Although the
new INTEGRAL source cannot unequivocally be associated to the Galactic Nucleus,
this is the first report of significant hard X-ray emission from within the
inner 10 arcmin of the Galaxy and a contribution from the galactic supermassive
black hole itself cannot be excluded.
