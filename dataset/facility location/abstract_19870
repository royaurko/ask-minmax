As part of the Transit Ephemeris Refinement and Monitoring Survey (TERMS), we
present new radial velocities and photometry of the HD 192263 system. Our
analysis of the already available Keck-HIRES and CORALIE radial velocity
measurements together with the five new Keck measurements we report in this
paper results in improved orbital parameters for the system. We derive
constraints on the size and phase location of the transit window for HD
192263b, a Jupiter-mass planet with a period of 24.3587 \pm 0.0022 days. We use
10 years of Automated Photoelectric Telescope (APT) photometry to analyze the
stellar variability and search for planetary transits. We find continuing
evidence of spot activity with periods near 23.4 days. The shape of the
corresponding photometric variations changes over time, giving rise to not one
but several Fourier peaks near this value. However, none of these frequencies
coincides with the planet's orbital period and thus we find no evidence of
star-planet interactions in the system. We attribute the ~23-day variability to
stellar rotation. There are also indications of spot variations on longer (8
years) timescales. Finally, we use the photometric data to exclude transits for
a planet with the predicted radius of 1.09 RJ, and as small as 0.79 RJ.
