N=2 Seiberg-Witten theories allow an interesting interplay between the
Argyres-Douglas loci, singularity structures and wall-crossing formulae. In
this paper we investigate this connection by first studying the singularity
structures of hyper-elliptic Seiberg-Witten curves for pure N=2 gauge theories
with SU(r+1) and Sp(2r) gauge groups, and propose new methods to locate the
Argyres-Douglas loci in the moduli space, where multiple mutually non-local BPS
states become massless. In a region of the moduli space, we compute dyon
charges for all 2r+2 and 2r+1 massless dyons for SU(r+1) and Sp(2r) gauge
groups respectively for rank r>1. From here we elucidate the connection to the
wall-crossing phenomena for pure Sp(4) Seiberg-Witten theory near the
Argyres-Douglas loci, despite our emphasis being only at the massless sector of
the BPS spectra. We also present 2r-1 candidates for the maximal
Argyres-Douglas points for pure SO(2r+1) Seiberg-Witten theory.
