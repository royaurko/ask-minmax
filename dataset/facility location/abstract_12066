We present first results from the Near-infrared Integral Field Spectrograph
(NIFS) located at Gemini North. For the active galaxies Cygnus A and Perseus A
we observe rotationally-supported accretion disks and adduce the existence of
massive central black holes and estimate their masses. In Cygnus A we also see
remarkable high-excitation ionization cones dominated by photoionization from
the central engine. In the T-Tauri stars HV Tau C and DG Tau we see
highly-collimated bipolar outflows in the [Fe II] 1.644 micron line, surrounded
by a slower molecular bipolar outflow seen in the H_2 lines, in accordance with
the model advocated by Pyo et al. (2002).
