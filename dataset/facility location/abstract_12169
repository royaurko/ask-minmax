The mapping observations of CO $J=2-1$, CO $J=3-2$, $^{13}$CO $J=2-1$ and
$^{13}$CO $J=3-2$ lines in the direction of IRAS 22506+5944 have been made. The
results show that the cores in the $J=2-1$ transition lines have a similar
morphology to those in the $J=3-2$ transition lines. Bipolar molecular outflows
are verified. The prior IRAS 22506+5944 observations indicated that two IRAS
sources and three H$_{2}$O masers were located close to the peak position of
the core. One of the IRAS sources may be the driving source of the outflows. In
addition, the H$_{2}$O masers may occur in relatively warm environments. The
parameters of the dense core and outflow, obtained by the LTE method, indicate
that IRAS 22506+5944 is a high-mass star formation region.
