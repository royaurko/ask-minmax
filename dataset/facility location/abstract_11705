We report on a variable high-velocity narrow absorption line outflow in the
redshift 2.3 quasar J2123-0050. Five distinct outflow systems are detected with
velocity shifts from -9710 to -14,050 km/s and CIV 1548,1551 line widths of
FWHM = 62-164 km/s. These data require five distinct outflow structures with
similar kinematics, physical conditions and characteristic sizes of order
0.01-0.02 pc. The most likely location is ~5 pc from the quasar. The
coordinated line variations in <0.63 yr (rest) are best explained by global
changes in the outflow ionization caused by changes in the quasar's ionizing
flux. The absence of strong X-ray absorption shows that radiative shielding is
not needed to maintain the moderate ionizations and therefore, apparently, it
is not needed to facilitate the radiative acceleration to high speeds. The
kinetic energy yield of this flow is at least two orders of magnitude too low
to be important for feedback to the host galaxy's evolution.
