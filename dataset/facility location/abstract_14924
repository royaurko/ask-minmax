We present the results of XMM-Newton observations of four high-z quasars, two
radio-loud and two radio-quiet. One of the radio-loud objects, PKS 2126-158,
clearly shows absorption in excess of the galactic value as claimed before from
ASCA and ROSAT observations. For PKS 2149-306 the evidence for excess
absorption is only marginal in contrast to previous results. The location of
the absorber in PKS 2126-158 is compatible with the redshift of the source.
Both, a warm and a cold absorber are allowed by the X-ray data. Both quasars
have very flat photon spectra (\Gamma \la 1.5) and the high photon statistics
reveal small deviations from a simple power law form. For the two radio-quiet
objects, Q 0000-263 and Q 1442+2931, we determine, for the first time, reliable
spectral parameters. Both quasars have steeper power laws (\Gamma \sim 2) and
show absorption consistent with the galactic value, similar to radio-quiet
quasars at low redshifts.
  In the case of Q 0000-263 the presence of the damped Ly$\alpha $ system
(N(HI)\sim 2.6\times 10^{21} cm^{-2} at z = 3.39) cannot be examined further
due to the limited photon statistics in all instruments.
