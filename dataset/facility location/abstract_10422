We consider a model, introduced by Boldrighini, Minlos and Pellegrinotti, of
random walks in dynamical random environments on the integer lattice Z^d with
d>=1. In this model, the environment changes over time in a Markovian manner,
independently across sites, while the walker uses the environment at its
current location in order to make the next transition. In contrast with the
cluster expansions approach of Boldrighini, Minlos and Pellegrinotti, we follow
a probabilistic argument based on regeneration times. We prove an annealed SLLN
and invariance principle for any dimension, and provide a quenched invariance
principle for dimension d > 7, providing for d>7 an alternative to the
analytical approach of Boldrighini, Minlos and Pellegrinotti, with the added
benefit that it is valid under weaker assumptions. The quenched results use, in
addition to the regeneration times already mentioned, a technique introduced by
Bolthausen and Sznitman.
