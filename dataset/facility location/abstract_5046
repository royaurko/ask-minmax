In this paper, we propose a cyclic prefix (CP) based MIMO-OFDM range
reconstruction method and its corresponding MIMO-OFDM waveform design for
co-located MIMO radar systems. Our proposed MIMO-OFDM waveform design achieves
the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain after the range reconstruction and
its peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in the discrete time domain is also
optimal, i.e., 0dB, when Zadoff-Chu sequences are used in the discrete
frequency domain as the weighting coefficients for the subcarriers. We also
investigate the performance when there are transmit and receive digital
beamforming (DBF) pointing errors. It is shown that our proposed CP based
MIMO-OFDM range reconstruction is inter-range-cell interference (IRCI) free no
matter whether there are transmit and receive DBF pointing errors or not.
Simulation results are presented to verify the theory and compare it with the
conventional OFDM and LFM co-located MIMO radars.
