At present each neutron scattering facility has its own set of data treatment
software, normally based on a proprietary data format. The travelling scientist
is either forced to continually learn new software or to write conversion
routines for his own software tools.
  During software development most of the time is spent on routines connected
with file input and output or visualisation. Our aim is to relieve the
scientist from such tedious work to allow maximum effort to be spent on data
processing routines.
  I present an "Open Source" component based, extendable, platform independent
framework for visualisation and transformation of data.
  Most of the existing software appears as a monolithic block. In contrast
openDaVE is built up in a modular design. It consists of three parts: the
kernel, a lot of modules, and some different front-ends. The actual
functionality of the framework is done by the modules. The kernel provides the
creation, the destruction of the modules, and the interaction between them,
whereas the front-end interacts with the user.
  The modules are divided in three classes: sources, filters, and sinks. Each
of the module consists of two different parts: the module logic, and one or
more interfaces, which set the module parameters. The interfaces are front-end
specific.
