By means of the orbital dynamics of the known Sun's outer planets, we use the
just released EPM2013 planetary ephemerides to put on the test the recently
proposed hypothesis that one (or more) still unseen super-Earth(s) may lurk at
about $200-250$ astronomical units in the outskirts of the Solar system. Even
by conservatively rescaling by a factor of ten the EPM2013 formal uncertainties
in the orbital elements of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto over a century
(1913-2013), it turns out that their numerically simulated centennial
signatures due to a distant perturber 15 times more massive than the Earth
located at about 200 astronomical units in an almost circular and ecliptical
orbit are far larger, thus making its existence highly unlikely. A careful
analysis of the full parameter space of the hypothesized rock-ice planetoid
further confirms such a conclusion. Moreover, it turns out that such a body
could not exist at less than about $1100-1300$ astronomical units, thus
tightening the previous constraints published in the literature and further
justifying the name of Telisto for it.
