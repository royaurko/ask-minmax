We theoretically study the joint influence of uniform Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
(DM) interactions, symmetric exchange anisotropy (with its axis parallel to the
DM vector) and arbitrarily oriented magnetic fields on one-dimensional spin 1/2
antiferromagnets. We show that the zero-temperature phase diagram contains
three competing phases: (i) an antiferromagnet with Neel vector in the plane
spanned by the DM vector and the magnetic field, (ii) a {\em dimerized}
antiferromagnet with Neel vector perpendicular to both the DM vector and the
magnetic field, and (iii) a gapless Luttinger liquid. Phase (i) is destroyed by
a small magnetic field component along the DM vector and is furthermore
unstable beyond a critical value of easy-plane anisotropy, which we estimate
using Abelian and non-Abelian bosonization along with perturbative
renormalization group. We propose a mathematical equivalent of the spin model
in a one-dimensional Josephson junction (JJ) array located in proximity to a
bulk superconductor.
  We discuss the analogues of the magnetic phases in the superconducting
context and comment on their experimental viability.
