We report the tentative detection of the modulation of a transient,
redshifted Fe Kalpha emission feature in the X-ray spectrum of the Seyfert
galaxy NGC3516. The detection of the spectral feature at 6.1 keV, in addition
to a stable 6.4 keV line, has been reported previously. We find on re-analysing
the XMM-Newton data that the feature varies systematically in flux at intervals
of 25 ks. The peak moves in energy between 5.7 keV and 6.5 keV. The spectral
evolution of the feature agrees with Fe K emission arising from a spot on the
accretion disc, illuminated by a corotating flare located at a radius of (7-16)
rg, modulated by Doppler and gravitational effects as the flare orbits around
the black hole. Combining the orbital timescale and the location of the
orbiting flare, the mass of the black hole is estimated to be (1-5)e+7 Msun,
which is in good agreement with values obtained from other techniques.
