We introduce a method based on the chiral susceptibility, which enables one
to draw a phase diagram in the chemical-potential/temperature plane for
strongly-interacting quarks whose interactions are described by any reasonable
gap equation, even if the diagrammatic content of the quark-gluon vertex is
unknown. We locate a critical endpoint (CEP) at (\mu^E,T^E) ~ (1.0,0.9)T_c,
where T_c is the critical temperature for chiral symmetry restoration at \mu=0;
and find that a domain of phase coexistence opens at the CEP whose area
increases as a confinement length-scale grows.
