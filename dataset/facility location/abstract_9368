One of the most perplexing problems associated with the supermassive black
hole at the center of our Galaxy is the origin of the young stars in its close
vicinity. Using proper motion measurements and stellar number density counts
based on 9 years of diffraction-limited K(2.2 micron)-band speckle imaging at
the W. M. Keck 10-meter telescopes, we have identified a new comoving group of
stars, which we call the IRS 16SW comoving group, located 1.9" (0.08 pc, in
projection) from the central black hole. Four of the five members of this
comoving group have been spectroscopically identified as massive young stars,
specifically He I emission-line stars and OBN stars. This is the second young
comoving group within the central parsec of the Milky Way to be recognized and
is the closest, by a factor of 2, in projection to the central black hole.
These comoving groups may be the surviving cores of massive infalling star
clusters that are undergoing disruption in the strong tidal field of the
central supermassive black hole.
