The electron propagator in a laser background has been shown to be made up of
a series of sideband poles. In this paper we study this decomposition by
analysing the impact of the residual gauge freedom in the Volkov solution on
the sidebands. We show that the gauge transformations do not alter the location
of the poles. The identification of the propagator from the two-point function
is maintained but we show that the sideband structures mix under residual gauge
transformations.
