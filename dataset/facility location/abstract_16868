Coagulation of submicron-sized dust grains into porous aggregates is the
initial step of dust evolution in protoplanetary disks. Recently, it has been
pointed out that negative charging of dust in the weakly ionized disks could
significantly slow down the coagulation process. In this paper, we apply the
growth criteria obtained in Paper I to finding out a location ("frozen" zone)
where the charging stalls dust growth at the fractal growth stage. For
low-turbulence disks, we find that the frozen zone can cover the major part of
the disks at a few to 100 AU from the central star. The maximum mass of the
aggregates is approximately 10^{-7} g at 1 AU and as small as a few monomer
masses at 100 AU. Strong turbulence can significantly reduce the size of the
frozen zone, but such turbulence will cause the fragmentation of macroscopic
aggregates at later stages. We examine a possibility that complete freezeout of
dust evolution in low-turbulence disks could be prevented by global transport
of dust in the disks. Our simple estimation shows that global dust transport
can lead to the supply of macroscopic aggregates and the removal of frozen
aggregates on a timescale of 10^6 yr. This overturns the usual understanding
that tiny dust particles get depleted on much shorter timescales unless
collisional fragmentation is effective. The frozen zone together with global
dust transport might explain "slow" (\sim 10^6 yr) dust evolution suggested by
infrared observation of T Tauri stars and by radioactive dating of chondrites.
