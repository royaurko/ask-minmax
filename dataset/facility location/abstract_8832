Observations of the nebula associated with the WO star in the galaxy IC 1613
are presented. The observations were carried out with a scanning Interferometer
Fabry-Perot in H_alpha at the 6m Special Astrophysical Observatory telescope;
narrow-band H_alpha and [OIII] images were obtained with the 4-m KPNO
telescope. The monochromatic H_alpha image clearly reveals a giant bipolar
shell structure outside the bright nebula S3. The sizes of the southeastern and
northwestern shells are 112x77 pc and (186-192)x(214-224) pc, respectively. We
have studied the object's kinematics for the first time and found evidence for
expansion of both shells. The expansion velocities of the southeastern and
northwestern shells exceed 50 and 70 km/s, respectively. We revealed a
filamentary structure of the shells and several compact features in the S3
core. A scenario is proposed for the formation of the giant bipolar structure
by the stellar wind from the central WO star located at the boundary of a dense
``supercavity'' in the galaxy's H I distribution.
