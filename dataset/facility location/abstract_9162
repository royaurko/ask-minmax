We estimate the spatial densities of different types of neutron star near the
Sun. It is shown that the distances of dim isolated thermal neutron stars must
be on average about 300-400 pc. The combined birth rate of these sources
together with radio pulsars and dim radio quiet neutron stars can be a little
more than the supernova rate as some of the dim isolated thermal neutron stars
can be formed from dim radio quiet neutron stars and radio pulsars. Some of
these sources must have relations with anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft gamma
repeaters. In order to understand the locations of different types of neutron
star on the P-\.{P} diagram it is also necessary to take into account the
differences in the masses and the structures of neutron stars.
