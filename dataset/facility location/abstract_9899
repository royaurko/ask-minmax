In a recent letter Machida et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 200402 (2004)]
concluded that in a trapped gas of fermions with repulsive interactions a
superfluid phase appears around the Mott-insulator at the center of the trap.
They base their conclusion on a negative binding energy, and a large weight for
a singlet formed by particles located at opposite sides of the Mott-insulator.
We show here that the observed effects are not related to superfluidity.
