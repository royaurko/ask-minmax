An optical photometric observation in 15 bands was carried out for nearby
galaxy cluster Abell 1775 by the Beijing-Arizona-Taiwan-Connecticut (BATC)
multi-color system. Over 5000 sources' spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
were obtained. Since this cluster has also been observed by the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS), the BATC SEDs were combined with the SDSS five-band
photometric data. Using the combined SEDs, 146 faint galaxies were selected as
new member galaxies by the photometric redshift technique. Based on the
positions, redshifts and 20-band SEDs of member galaxies, dynamical
substructures and luminosity functions (LFs) of A1775 were investigated. The
previous reported bimodal structure of A1775 has been confirmed: a poor
subcluster with lower redshift, A1775A, is located ~14' southeast to the main
concentration A1775B. After taking into account the new supplemented member
galaxies, a new subcluster A1775C was found along the aligned direction of
A1775A and A1775B. The different LF faint ends of the two subclusters indicate
that A1775B is a more dynamically evolved system, while A1775A is still
dynamically young. By the STARLIGHT spectral synthesis code, the star-
formation histories of the member galaxies were studied. The dependence of the
mean stellar ages upon the Hubble type was confirmed, and the environmental
effect on star-formation activities for galaxies in A1775B has been explored.
