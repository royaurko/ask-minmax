At the IGISOL-JYFLTRAP facility, fission mass yields can be studied at high
precision. Fission fragments from a U target are passing through a Ni foil and
entering a gas filled chamber. The collected fragments are guided through a
mass separator to a Penning trap where their masses are identified. This
simulation work focuses on how different fission fragment properties (mass,
charge and energy) affect the stopping efficiency in the gas cell. In addition,
different experimental parameters are varied (e. g. U and Ni thickness and He
gas pressure) to study their impact on the stopping efficiency. The simulations
were performed using the Geant4 package and the SRIM code. The main results
suggest a small variation in the stopping efficiency as a function of mass,
charge and kinetic energy. It is predicted that heavy fragments are stopped
about 9% less efficiently than the light fragments. However it was found that
the properties of the U, Ni and the He gas influences this behavior. Hence it
could be possible to optimize the efficiency.
