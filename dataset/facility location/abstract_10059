We describe a method to subdivide the surface of a sphere into spherical
triangles of similar, but not identical, shapes and sizes. The Hierarchical
Triangular Mesh (HTM) is a quad-tree that is particularly good at supporting
searches at different resolutions, from arc seconds to hemispheres. The
subdivision scheme is universal, providing the basis for addressing and for
fast lookups. The HTM provides the basis for an efficient geospatial indexing
scheme in relational databases where the data have an inherent location on
either the celestial sphere or the Earth. The HTM index is superior to
cartographical methods using coordinates with singularities at the poles. We
also describe a way to specify surface regions that efficiently represent
spherical query areas. This article presents the algorithms used to identify
the HTM triangles covering such regions.
