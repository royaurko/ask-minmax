Motivated by recent observations of $C_4$ symmetry breaking in strongly
correlated two-dimensional electron systems on a square lattice, we analyze
this phenomenon within an extended Fermi liquid approach. It is found that the
symmetry violation is triggered by a continuous topological phase transition
associated with exchange of antiferromagnetic fluctuations. In contrast to
predictions of mean-field theory, the structure of a part of the
single-particle spectrum violating $C_4$ symmetry is found to be highly
anisotropic, with a peak located in the vicinity of saddle points.
