The effect of changes in hadron properties in a nuclear medium on physical
observables is discussed. Highlighted results are, (1) hypernuclei, (2)
meosn-nuclear bound states, (3) $K$-meson production in heavy ion collisions,
and (4) $J/\Psi$ dissociation in a nuclear medium. In addition, results for the
near-threshold $\omega$- and $\phi$-meson productions in proton proton
collisions are reported.
