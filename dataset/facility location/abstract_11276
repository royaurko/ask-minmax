We present the first detailed simulations of the head-tail effect relevant to
directional Dark Matter searches. Investigations of the location of the
majority of the ionization charge as being either at the beginning half (tail)
or at the end half (head) of the nuclear recoil track were performed for carbon
and sulphur recoils in 40 Torr negative ion carbon disulfide and for fluorine
recoils in 100 Torr carbon tetrafluoride. The SRIM simulation program was used,
together with a purpose-written Monte Carlo generator, to model production of
ionizing pairs, diffusion and basic readout geometries relevant to potential
real detector scenarios, such as under development for the DRIFT experiment.
The results clearly indicate the existence of a head-tail track asymmetry but
with a magnitude critically influenced by two competing factors: the nature of
the stopping power and details of the range straggling. The former tends to
result in the tail being greater than the head and the latter the reverse.
