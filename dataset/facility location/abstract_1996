We report on the results of the first measurement of exclusive $f_0(980)$
meson photoproduction on protons for $E_\gamma=3.0 - 3.8$ GeV and $-t =
0.4-1.0$ GeV$^2$. Data were collected with the CLAS detector at the Thomas
Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The resonance was detected via its
decay in the $\pi^+ \pi^-$ channel by performing a partial wave analysis of the
reaction $\gamma p \to p \pi^+ \pi^-$. Clear evidence of the $f_0(980)$ meson
was found in the interference between $P$ and $S$ waves at $M_{\pi^+ \pi^-}\sim
1$ GeV. The $S$-wave differential cross section integrated in the mass range of
the $f_0(980)$ was found to be a factor of 50 smaller than the cross section
for the $\rho$ meson. This is the first time the $f_0(980)$ meson has been
measured in a photoproduction experiment.
