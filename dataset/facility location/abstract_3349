The CompHEP package was developed for calculations of decay and high energy
collision processes with, correspondingly, up to 5 and 4 final particles in the
lowest order (tree) approximation. The main idea put into CompHEP was to make
available passing from the Lagrangian to final distributions efficiently with
high level automation what is extremely needed in collider physics.
  The present talk describes a general structure of the CompHEP facilities and
reports some physical results obtained with its help. The main purpose of the
talk is to attract the attention of high energy physicists to this
user-friendly package which is completely aimed at making easier their routine
and tedious calculations in the TeV region.
