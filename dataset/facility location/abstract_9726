The polarisation conversion of a linear polarised electromagnetic wave
incident onto a two-dimensional (2D) electron system at an angle is
theoretically studied. We consider the 2D system located at the interface
between two dielectric media with different dielectric constants. An external
dc magnetic field is assumed to be directed along the normal to the 2D electron
layer. In such a configuration the cyclotron-polaritons (CPs) in 2D electron
system can be excited with the frequencies in the vicinity of the cyclotron
frequency. Under the CPs excitation the resonance polarisation conversion of
electromagnetic wave greatly increases in the system. In the absence of the
electron scattering in 2D system, the polarisation conversion reaches 100% at a
certain value of the angle of incidence which is more than the total reflection
angle. Extremely high polarisation conversion takes place in a quite wide range
of variation of the angle of incidence. High polarisation conversion efficiency
(above 80%) remains when the actual electron scattering in the 2D system on
GsAs is taken into account. The considered phenomena may be taken up in
polarisation spectroscopy of 2D electron systems.
