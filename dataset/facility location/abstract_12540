By combining different ideas, a general and efficient protocol to deal with
discontinuous phase transitions at low temperatures is proposed. For small
$T$'s, it is possible to derive a generic analytic expression for appropriate
order parameters, whose coefficients are obtained from simple simulations. Once
in such regimes simulations by standard algorithms are not reliable, an
enhanced tempering method, the parallel tempering -- accurate for small and
intermediate system sizes with rather low computational cost -- is used.
Finally, from finite size analysis, one can obtain the thermodynamic limit. The
procedure is illustrated for four distinct models, demonstrating its power,
e.g., to locate coexistence lines and the phases density at the coexistence.
