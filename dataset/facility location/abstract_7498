In order to investigate the evolution of E+A galaxies, we observed a galaxy
SDSS J160241.00+521426.9, a possible E+A progenitor which shows both emission
and strong Balmer absorptions, and its neighbor galaxy. We used the integral
field spectroscopic mode of the Kyoto Tridimensional Spectrograph (Kyoto3DII),
mounted on the University of Hawaii 88-inch telescope located on Mauna Kea, and
the slit-spectroscopic mode of the Faint Object Camera and Spectrograph (FOCAS)
on the Subaru Telescope. We found a strong Balmer absorption region in the
center of the galaxy and an emission-line region located 2 kpc from the center,
in the direction of its neighbor galaxy. The recession velocities of the galaxy
and its neighbor galaxy differ only by 100 km s^-1, which suggests that they
are a physical pair and would have been interacting. Comparing observed Lick
indices of Balmer lines and color indices with those predicted from stellar
population synthesis models, we find that a suddenly quenched star-formation
scenario is plausible for the star-formation history of the central region. We
consider that star formation started in the galaxy due to galaxy interactions
and was quenched in the central region, whereas star formation in a region
offset from the center still continues or has begun recently. This work is the
first study of a possible E+A progenitor using spatially resolved spectroscopy.
