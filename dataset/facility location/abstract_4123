One main goal of the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) which is located at
the \emph{Fuxian Solar Observatory} is to image the Sun at high resolution.
Based on the high spatial and temporal resolution NVST H$\alpha$ data and
combined with the simultaneous observations from the \emph{Solar Dynamics
Observatory} for the first time, we investigate a flux rope tracked by a
filament activation. The filament material is initially located at one end of
the flux rope and fills in a section of the rope, and then the filament is
activated due to magnetic field cancellation. The activated filament rises and
flows along helical threads, tracking out the twisted flux rope structure. The
length of the flux rope is about 75 Mm, the average width of its individual
threads is 1.11 Mm, and the estimated twist is 1$\pi$. The flux rope appears as
a dark structure in H$\alpha$ images, a partial dark and partial bright
structure in 304 {\AA}, while as bright structures in 171 {\AA} and 131 {\AA}
images. During this process, the overlying coronal loops are quite steady since
the filament is confined within the flux rope and does not erupt successfully.
It seems that, for the event in this study, the filament is located and
confined within the flux rope threads, instead of being suspended in the dips
of twisted magnetic flux.
