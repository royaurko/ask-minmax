Transverse spin and transverse momentum distribution functions of the
constituents of the nucleon are a crucial input for a complete description of
the nucleon. COMPASS measured such for longitudinally and transversely
polarized deuterons and protons. In the following we will focus on recent
results from the 2007 transverse proton data and on the results for unpolarized
deuterons.
