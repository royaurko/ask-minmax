We explore the biological damage initiated in the environments of F, G, K,
and M-type main-sequence stars due to photospheric, chromospheric and flare
radiation. The amount of chromospheric radiation is, in a statistical sense,
directly coupled to the stellar age as well as the presence of significant
stellar magnetic fields and dynamo activity. With respect to photospheric
radiation, we also consider detailed synthetic models, taking into account
millions or hundred of millions of lines for atoms and molecules. Chromospheric
UV radiation is increased in young stars in regard to all stellar spectral
types. Flare activity is most pronounced in K and M-type stars, which also has
the potential of stripping the planetary atmospheres of close-in planets,
including planets located in the stellar habitable zone. For our studies, we
take DNA as a proxy for carbon-based macromolecules, guided by the paradigm
that carbon might constitute the biochemical centerpiece of extraterrestrial
life forms. Planetary atmospheric attenuation is considered in an approximate
manner.
