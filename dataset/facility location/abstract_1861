An all solid-state kicker pulser for a high current induction accelerator
(the Dual-Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test facility DARHT-2) has been
designed and fabricated. This kicker pulser uses multiple solid state
modulators stacked in an inductive-adder configuration. Each modulator is
comprised of multiple metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors
(MOSFETs) which quickly switch the energy storage capacitors across a magnetic
induction core. Metglas is used as the core material to minimize loss. Voltage
from each modulator is inductively added by a voltage summing stalk and
delivered to a 50 ohm output cable. A lumped element circuit model of the
inductive adder has been developed to optimize the performance of the pulser.
Results for several stalk geometries will be compared with experimental data.
