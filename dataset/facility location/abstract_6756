The diffusive motion of a colloidal particle trapped inside a small cavity
filled with fluid is reduced by hydrodynamic interactions with the confining
walls. In this work, we study these wall effects on a spherical particle
entrapped in a closed cylinder. We calculate the diffusion coefficient along
the radial, azimuthal and axial direction for different particle positions. At
all locations the diffusion is smaller than in a bulk fluid and it becomes
anisotropic near the container's walls. We present a simple model which
reasonably well desribes the simulation results for the given dimensions of the
cylinder, which are taken from recent experimental work.
