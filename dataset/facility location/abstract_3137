The use of phasor angle measurements provided by phasor measurement units
(PMUs) in fault detection is regarded as a promising method in identifying
locations of power line outages. However, communication errors or system
malfunctions may introduce errors to the measurements and thus yield bad data.
Most of the existing methods on line outage identification fail to consider
such error. This paper develops a framework for identifying multiple power line
outages based on the PMUs' measurements in the presence of bad data. In
particular, we design an algorithm to identify locations of line outage and
recover the faulty measurements simultaneously. The proposed algorithm does not
require any prior information on the number of line outages and the noise
variance. Case studies carried out on test systems of different sizes validate
the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.
