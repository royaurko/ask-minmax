Radiation hard helium gas ionization chambers capable of operating in vacuum
at temperatures ranging from 5K to 350K have been designed, fabricated and
tested and will be used inside the cryostats at Fermilab's Superconducting
Radiofrequency beam test facility. The chamber vessels are made of stainless
steel and all materials used including seals are known to be radiation hard and
suitable for operation at 5K. The chambers are designed to measure radiation up
to 30 kRad/hr with sensitivity of approximately 1.9 pA/(Rad/hr). The signal
current is measured with a recycling integrator current-to-frequency converter
to achieve a required measurement capability for low current and a wide dynamic
range. A novel scheme of using an FPGA-based time-to-digital converter (TDC) to
measure time intervals between pulses output from the recycling integrator is
employed to ensure a fast beam loss response along with a current measurement
resolution better than 10-bit. This paper will describe the results obtained
and highlight the processing techniques used.
