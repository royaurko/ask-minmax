Global navigation systems and location-based services have found their way
into our daily lives. Recently, indoor positioning techniques have also been
proposed, and there are several live or trial systems already operating. In
this paper, we present insights from MazeMap, the first live indoor/outdoor
positioning and navigation system deployed at a large university campus in
Norway. Our main contribution is a measurement case study; we show the spatial
and temporal distribution of MazeMap geo-location and wayfinding requests,
construct the aggregated human mobility map of the campus and find strong
logical ties between different locations. On one hand, our findings are
specific to the venue; on the other hand, the nature of available data and
insights coupled with our discussion on potential usage scenarios for indoor
positioning and location-based services predict a successful future for these
systems and applications.
