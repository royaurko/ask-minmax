Future neutrino projects in Europe will follow two distinct time lines. On
the medium term, they will be dominated by the CERN-Gran Sasso long-baseline
project, with two experiments OPERA and ICARUS, mainly concentrated on $\tau$
appearance. On the longer term, several projects are under discussion. A new
proton driver at CERN that accelerates a 4 MW beam to 2.2 GeV of energy would
open the possibility of a low-energy super-beam, possibly sent to the French
laboratory under the Frejus. A new radioactive heavy ion facility could produce
a pure $\nu_e$ beam, to be used independently or simultaneously with the
super-beam. In the framework of R&D for Super-Beam and Neutrino Factory, the
HARP experiment is studying hadron production at low energies on various
targets.
