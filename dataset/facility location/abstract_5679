We study the dependence of nonthermal radiation spectra in OVV quasars on
location of the low energy break in the electron/positron injection function.
We show that the high energy spectra produced during the outbursts are
presumably superposed from two components, one resulting from Comptonization of
emission lines, which dominates at MeV-GeV energies, and the other resulting
from Comptonization of infrared radiation, which dominates in the X-ray band.
