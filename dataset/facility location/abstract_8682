The small Antlia-Sextans clustering of galaxies is located at a distance of
only 1.36 Mpc from the Sun, and 1.72 Mpc from the adopted barycenter of the
Local Group. The latter value is significantly greater than the radius of the
zero- velocity surface of the Local Group which, for an assumed age of 14 Gyr,
has Ro = 1.18 " 0.15 Mpc. This, together with the observation that the members
of the Ant-Sex group have a mean redshift of +114 " 12 km s-1 relative to the
centroid of the Local Group, suggests that the Antlia-Sextans group is not
bound to our Local Group, and that it is expanding with the Hubble flow. If
this conclusion is correct, then Antlia-Sextans may be the nearest external
clustering of galaxies. The total galaxian population of the Ant-Sex group is ~
1/5 that of the Local Group. However, the integrated luminosity of Ant-Sex is
two orders of magnitude lower than that of the Local Group.
