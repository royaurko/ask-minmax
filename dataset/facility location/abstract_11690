Ams: We study the 12C/13C isotopic ratio in the disk of the central molecular
zone and in the halo to trace gas accretion toward the Galactic center region
in the Milky Way. Methods: Using the IRAM 30m telescope, we observe the J=1-0
rotational transition of HCO+, HCN, HNC and their 13C isotopic substitutions in
order to measure the 12C/13C isotopic ratio. We observe 9 positions selected
throughout the Galactic center region, including clouds at high latitude;
locations where the X1 and X2 orbits associated with the barred potential are
expected to intersect; and typical Galactic center molecular clouds. Results:
We find a systematically higher 12C/13C isotopic ratio (>40) toward the halo
and the X1 orbits than for the Galactic center molecular clouds (20-25). Our
results point out to molecular gas which has undergone a different degree of
nuclear processing than that observed in the gas towards the inner Galactic
center region. Conclusions: The high isotopic ratios are consistent with the
accretion of the gas from the halo and from the outskirts of the Galactic disk.
