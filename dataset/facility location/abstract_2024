In view of recent data from the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator
Facility (JLab) on inclusive electron scattering off nuclei at high momentum
transfer (Q^2 > 1 GeV^2) and their current analysis, it is shown that, if the
scaling variable is properly chosen, the analysis in terms of scaling functions
can provide useful information on Short Range Correlations (SRC). This is
demonstrated by introducing a new relativistic scaling variable that
incorporates the momentum dependence of the excitation energy of the
(A-1)system, with the resulting scaling function being closely related to the
longitudinal momentum distributions.
