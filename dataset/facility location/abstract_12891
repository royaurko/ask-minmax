Motivated by earlier work on the use of fully-coupled Forward-Backward
Stochastic Differential Equations (henceforth FBSDEs) in the analysis of
mathematical models for the CO2 emissions markets, the present study is
concerned with the analysis of these equations when the generator of the
forward equation has a conservative degenerate structure and the terminal
condition of the backward equation is a non-smooth function of the terminal
value of the forward component. We show that a general form of existence and
uniqueness result still holds. When the function giving the terminal condition
is binary, we also show that the flow property of the forward component of the
solution can fail at the terminal time. In particular, we prove that a Dirac
point mass appears in its distribution, exactly at the location of the jump of
the binary function giving the terminal condition. We provide a detailed
analysis of the breakdown of the Markovian representation of the solution at
the terminal time.
