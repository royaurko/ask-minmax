We derive nonstatic spherically symmetric solutions of a null fluid, in five
dimension (5D), to Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) equations with the coupling of
Gauss-Bonnet (GB) combination of quadratic curvature terms, namely, 5D-EYMGB
radiating black hole solution. It is shown that, in the limit, we can recover
known radiating black hole solutions. The spherically symmetric known 5D static
black hole solutions are also retrieved. The effect of the GB term and
Yang-Mills (YM) gauge charge on the structure and location of horizons, of the
5D radiating black hole, is also discussed.
