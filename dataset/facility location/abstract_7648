The Orange "Data for Development" (D4D) challenge is an open data challenge
on anonymous call patterns of Orange's mobile phone users in Ivory Coast. The
goal of the challenge is to help address society development questions in novel
ways by contributing to the socio-economic development and well-being of the
Ivory Coast population. Participants to the challenge are given access to four
mobile phone datasets and the purpose of this paper is to describe the four
datasets. The website http://www.d4d.orange.com contains more information about
the participation rules. The datasets are based on anonymized Call Detail
Records (CDR) of phone calls and SMS exchanges between five million of Orange's
customers in Ivory Coast between December 1, 2011 and April 28, 2012. The
datasets are: (a) antenna-to-antenna traffic on an hourly basis, (b) individual
trajectories for 50,000 customers for two week time windows with antenna
location information, (3) individual trajectories for 500,000 customers over
the entire observation period with sub-prefecture location information, and (4)
a sample of communication graphs for 5,000 customers
