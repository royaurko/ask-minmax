The intracluster plasma of Abell 2052 exhibits in X-rays a spiral structure
extending more than 250 kpc, which is comprised of cool gas. This feature is
understood to be the result of gas sloshing caused by the off-axis collision
with a smaller subcluster. We aim to recover the dynamical history of Abell
2052 and to reproduce the broad morphology of the spiral feature. To this end,
we perform hydrodynamical $N$-body simulations of cluster collisions. We obtain
two regimes that adequately reproduce the desired features. The first scenario
is a close encounter and a recent event (0.8 Gyr since pericentric passage),
while the second scenario has a larger impact parameter and is older (almost
2.6 Gyr since pericentric passage). In the second case, the simulation predicts
that the perturbing subcluster should be located approximately 2 Mpc from the
centre of the major cluster. At that position, we are able to identify an
observed optical counterpart at the same redshift: a galaxy group with $M_{500}
= (1.16 \pm 0.43) \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$.
