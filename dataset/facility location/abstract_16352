We present comparison of numerical simulations of propagation of MHD
waves,excited by subphotospheric perturbations, in two different ("deep" and
"shallow") magnetostatic models of the sunspots. The "deep" sunspot model
distorts both the shape of the wavefront and its amplitude stronger than the
"shallow" model. For both sunspot models, the surface gravity waves (f-mode)
are affected by the sunspots stronger than the acoustic p-modes. The wave
amplitude inside the sunspot depends on the photospheric strength of the
magnetic field and the distance of the source from the sunspot axis. For the
source located at 9 Mm from the center of the sunspot, the wave amplitude
increases when the wavefront passes through the central part of the sunspot.
For the source distance of 12 Mm, the wave amplitude inside the sunspot is
always smaller than outside. For the same source distance from the sunspot
center but for the models with different strength of the magnetic field, the
wave amplitude inside the sunspot increases with the strength of the magnetic
field. The simulations show that unlike the case of the uniform inclined
background magnetic field, the p- and f-mode waves are not spatially separated
inside the sunspot where the magnetic field is strongly non-uniform. These
properties have to be taken into account for interpretation of observations of
MHD waves traveling through sunspot regions.
