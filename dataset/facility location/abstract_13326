Hyperspectral imaging, due to providing high spectral resolution images, is
one of the most important tools in the remote sensing field. Because of
technological restrictions hyperspectral sensors has a limited spatial
resolution. On the other hand panchromatic image has a better spatial
resolution. Combining this information together can provide a better
understanding of the target scene. Spectral unmixing of mixed pixels in
hyperspectral images results in spectral signature and abundance fractions of
endmembers but gives no information about their location in a mixed pixel. In
this paper we have used spectral unmixing results of hyperspectral images and
segmentation results of panchromatic image for data fusion. The proposed method
has been applied on simulated data using AVRIS Indian Pines datasets. Results
show that this method can effectively combine information in hyperspectral and
panchromatic images.
