Urbanization has been the dominant demographic trend in the entire world,
during the last half century. Rural to urban migration, international
migration, and the re-classification or expansion of existing city boundaries
have been among the major reasons for increasing urban population. The
essentially fast growth of cities in the last decades urgently calls for a
profound insight into the common principles stirring the structure of urban
developments all over the world. We have discussed the graph representations of
urban spatial structures and suggested a computationally simple technique that
can be used in order to spot the relatively isolated locations and
neighborhoods, to detect urban sprawl, and to illuminate the hidden community
structures in complex urban textures. The approach may be implemented for the
detailed expertise of any urban pattern and the associated transport networks
that may include many transportation modes.
