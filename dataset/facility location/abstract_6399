We consider a model of the shape of a growing polymer introduced by Durrett
and Rogers (Probab. Theory Related Fields 92 (1992) 337--349). We prove their
conjecture about the asymptotic behavior of the underlying continuous process
$X_t$ (corresponding to the location of the end of the polymer at time $t$) for
a particular type of repelling interaction function without compact support.
