We aim at constraining the angular momentum evolution of low mass stars by
measuring their rotation rates when they begin to evolve freely towards the
ZAMS, i.e. after the disk accretion phase has stopped. We conducted a
multi-site photometric monitoring of the young open cluster h Persei that has
an age of ~13 Myr. The observations were done in the I-band using 4 different
telescopes and the variability study is sensitive to periods from less than 0.2
day to 20 days. Rotation periods are derived for 586 candidate cluster members
over the mass range 0.4<=M/Msun<=1.4. The rotation period distribution
indicates a sligthly higher fraction of fast rotators for the lower mass
objects, although the lower and upper envelopes of the rotation period
distribution, located respectively at ~0.2-0.3d and ~10d, are remarkably flat
over the whole mass range. We combine this period distribution with previous
results obtained in younger and older clusters to model the angular momentum
evolution of low mass stars during the PMS. The h Per cluster provides the
first statistically robust estimate of the rotational period distribution of
solar-type and lower mass stars at the end of the PMS accretion phase (>10
Myr). The results are consistent with models that assume significant
core-envelope decoupling during the angular momentum evolution to the ZAMS.
