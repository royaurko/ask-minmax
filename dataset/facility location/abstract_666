Spatial wireless channel prediction is important for future wireless
networks, and in particular for proactive resource allocation at different
layers of the protocol stack.Various sources of uncertainty must be accounted
for during modeling and to provide robust predictions. We investigate two
frameworks, classical Gaussian processes (cGP) and uncertain Gaussian processes
(uGP), and analyze the impact of location uncertainty during both
learning/training and prediction/testing phases. We observe that cGP generally
fails both in terms of learning the channel parameters and in predicting the
channel in the presence of location uncertainties. In contrast, uGP explicitly
considers the location uncertainty and is able to learn and predict the
wireless channel.
