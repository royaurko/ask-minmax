We present optical and millimetric data for 47 intermediate Hubble type
spiral galaxies located either in dense environments or in the field. We
compare correlations between global parameters, such as far-infrared
luminosity, blue luminosity, and total molecular gas content, with other
samples of galaxies, including normal galaxies, clusters and ultraluminous
infrared galaxies. We find that overall our sample is a well defined subset of
these other samples of galaxies.
