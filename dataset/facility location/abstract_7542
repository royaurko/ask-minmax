Knowledge about the background solar wind plays a crucial role in the
framework of space weather forecasting. In-situ measurements of the background
solar wind are only available for a few points in the heliosphere where
spacecraft are located, therefore we have to rely on heliospheric models to
derive the distribution of solar wind parameters in interplanetary space. We
test the performance of different solar wind models, namely Magnetohydrodynamic
Algorithm outside a Sphere/ENLIL (MAS/ENLIL), Wang-Sheeley-Arge/ENLIL
(WSA/ENLIL), and MAS/MAS, by comparing model results with in-situ measurements
from spacecraft located at 1 AU distance to the Sun (ACE, Wind). To exclude the
influence of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), we chose the year
2007 as a time period with low solar activity for our comparison. We found that
the general structure of the background solar wind is well reproduced by all
models. The best model results were obtained for the parameter solar wind
speed. However, the predicted arrival times of high-speed solar wind streams
have typical uncertainties of the order of about one day. Comparison of model
runs with synoptic magnetic maps from different observatories revealed that the
choice of the synoptic map significantly affects the model performance.
