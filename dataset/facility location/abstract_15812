The quasielastic longitudinal electromagnetic response function R_L is studied
within the context of a model that extends our previous investigations of
pionic correlations and currents. Four mesons are now employed (pion, rho,
sigma and omega, via the Bonn potential) and the many-body dynamics are
extended to the full random-phase approximation built upon a Hartree-Fock
basis. Wherever possible the Lorentz covariance of the problem is respected.
The first three energy-weighted moments of the reduced response are computed,
namely, the zeroth moment (Coulomb sum rule), the first moment (related to the
position of the quasielastic peak) and the second moment (related to the peak
width or variance). We discuss how with a modest downward adjustment of the
Fermi momentum it is possible to obtain the expected zeroth and second moments;
this implies that the nuclear system has a lower density than that required
when using the free relativistic Fermi gas and accordingly that the interaction
effects are weaker than one might initially find.
