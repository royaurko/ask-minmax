We examine images of the field of X1832-330, the luminous (Lx ~ 10^36 erg/s)
X-ray burst source near the center of the globular cluster NGC 6652, in order
to identify the optical counterpart for further study. U and B ground-based
images allow us to set a limit M_B > 3.5 for the counterpart at the time of
those observations, provided that the color is (U-B)_0 ~ -1, similar to the
sources known in other clusters. Archival Hubble Space Telescope observations
survey most but not all of the 1 sigma X-ray error circle, and allow us to set
limits M_B > 5.9 and M_B > 5.2 in the WF/PC and WFPC2 regions, respectively. In
the WF/PC images we do weakly detect a faint object with UV-excess, but it is
located 11.7'' from the ROSAT X-ray position. This considerable (2.3 sigma)
discrepancy in position suggests that this candidate be treated with caution,
but it remains the only reasonable one advanced thus far. We measure for this
star m_439 = 20.2 +- 0.2, (m_336 - m_439) = -0.5 +- 0.2, and estimate M_B =
5.5, (U-B)_0 = -0.9, similar to other known optical counterparts. If this
candidate is not the identification, our limits imply that the true
counterpart, not yet identified, is probably the optically-faintest cluster
source yet known, or alternatively that it did not show significant UV excess
at the time of these observations. Finally, we assess the outlook for the
identification of the remaining luminous globular cluster X-ray sources.
