From the equivalence principle (EP) and experiments on gravitational (G) time
dilation (GTD) it is proved that the standards of observers located in
different ``distances'' from the earth are physically different with respect to
each other. Thus the current mathematical relationships between their
measurements are physically inhomogeneous. This has caused fundamental errors
in gravitation, cosmology and astrophysics. The true transformations between
basic parameters of bodies located in different field positions, derived from
just experimental facts, are used to test fundamental hypotheses in current
literature. G fields do not exchange energy with bodies and radiation, but just
momentum. The G energy comes the bodies. The average relative distances and
cosmological redshifts in the universe cannot change after universe expansion
because the average increase of distances (G potentials) would change the sizes
of particles in identical proportion. Locally, atoms must be evolving,
indefinitely, in closed cycles between states of gas and linear black hole. The
last ones, after recovering energy, must explode thus regenerating gas. Most of
the universe must be in state of black galaxy cooled down by linear black
holes. They must account for the CMBR. The new scenarios are also explained by
using particle models consistent with the EP.
