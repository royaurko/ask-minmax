Within the intermediate-coupling theory, the quasiparticle weight $Z$ of one
hole injected in the undoped antiferromagnetic ground state is studied. We find
that, for the hole located at the quasiparticle band minimun with momentum
${\bf k}_0 = (\pm \frac{\pi}{2}, \pm \frac{\pi}{2})$, $Z$ is finite. By
comparing the results obtained by the self-consistent Born approximation, we
show that the intermediate-coupling theory for $Z$ is appropriate only when
$J/t \stackrel{>}{\sim} 1.6$. Finally, the reason why this approach fails in
the small-$J$ case will also be clarified.
