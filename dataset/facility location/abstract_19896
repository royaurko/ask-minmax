We present the astrometric VLBI observations of water masers associated with
IRAS 22480+6002 (IRC+60370, hereafter I22480) with the VLBI Exploration of
Radio Astrometry (VERA). The stellar type of I22480 looks unusual as a stellar
maser source and has been debated since the 1970s. We successfully determined
the annual parallax of a group of the water maser spots, pi=0.400+/-0.025 mas,
corresponding to a distance to I22480 of D=2.50 /+0.17/-0.15 kpc. This suggests
that the estimated bolometric luminosity of I22480 should be revised to 35 000
L_sun, favoring a K-type supergiant rather than an RV Tau-type variable star
previously suggested. Although the spectral type is unusual as a stellar maser
source, the internal motions of the water maser features suggest that the water
masers are associated with the circumstellar envelope of this star. Taking into
account a possible stellar motion with respect to the maser feature motions, we
derived a secular proper motion of I22480, (mu_alpha, mu_delta)=(-2.58+/-0.33,
-1.91+/-0.17) [mas yr^-1]. The derived motion of I22480 in the Milky Way has a
deviation by ~ -30 km/s in the galactic azimuthal direction from a circular
motion estimated from the galactocentric distance to I22480 and assumption of a
flat Galactic rotation curve. This peculiar motion is still comparable to those
typically seen in the water maser sources located in the Perseus spiral arm.
Taking into account the peculiar motion and the proximity to the Galactic
midplane (z ~60 pc), I22480 may be a member of the Galactic thin disk.
