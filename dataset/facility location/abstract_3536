A key feature for the success of the liquid Argon imaging TPC (LAr-TPC)
technology is the industrial purification against electro-negative impurities,
especially Oxygen and Nitrogen remnants, which have to be continuously kept at
an exceptionally low level by filtering and recirculating liquid Argon.
Improved purification techniques have been applied to a 120 liters LAr-TPC test
facility in the INFN-LNL laboratory. Through-going muon tracks have been used
to determine the free electron lifetime in liquid Argon against
electro-negative impurities. The short path length here observed (30 cm) is
compensated by the high accuracy in the observation of the specific ionization
of cosmic ray muons at sea level as a function of the drift distance. A free
electron lifetime of (21.4+7.3-4.3) ms, namely > 15.8 ms at 90 % C.L. has been
observed over several weeks under stable conditions, corresponding to a
residual Oxygen equivalent of about 15 ppt (part per trillion). At 500 V/cm,
the free electron speed is 1.5 m/ms. In a LAr-TPC a free electron lifetime in
excess of 15 ms corresponds for instance to an attenuation of less than 15 %
after a drift path of 5 m, opening the way to the operation of the LAr-TPC with
exceptionally long drift distances.
