We present results of the search for variable stars in the field of young
open cluster NGC 581. Based on 19 nights of observations, 6 new variable stars
were discovered. Two of them turned out to be eclipsing binary systems. Another
two detected variable stars are most probably of gamma Dor type. During our
observations one of the known Be stars located in our field of view showed
irregular variations of brightness, typical for this class of stars. The sixth
variable star is a pulsating red giant.
