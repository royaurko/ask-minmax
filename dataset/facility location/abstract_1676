We examine the possible tests of violation of the gravitational equivalence
principle (VEP) at a muon storage ring via neutrino oscillation experiments. If
the gravitational interactions of the neutrinos are not diagonal in the flavour
basis and the gravitational interaction eigenstates have different couplings to
the gravitational field, this leads to the neutrino oscillation. If one starts
with $\mu ^+$ beam then appearance of $\tau ^\pm$, $e ^+$ and $\mu ^-$ in the
final state are the signals for neutrino oscillation. We have estimated the
number of $\mu ^-$ events in this scenario in $\nu_\mu -N$ deep inelastic
scattering. Final state lepton energy distribution can be used to distinguish
the VEP scenario from the others. A large area of VEP parameter space can be
explored at a future muon storage ring facility with moderate beam energy.
