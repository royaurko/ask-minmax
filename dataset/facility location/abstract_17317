In the course of our VLTI young stellar object PIONIER imaging program, we
have identified a strong visibility chromatic dependency that appeared in
certain sources. This effect, rising value of visibilities with decreasing
wavelengths over one base, is also present in previous published and archival
AMBER data. For Herbig AeBe stars, the H band is generally located at the
transition between the star and the disk predominance in flux for Herbig AeBe
stars. We believe that this phenomenon is responsible for the visibility rise
effect. We present a method to correct the visibilities from this effect in
order to allow "gray" image reconstruction software, like Mira, to be used. In
parallel we probe the interest of carrying an image reconstruction in each
spectral channel and then combine them to obtain the final broadband one. As an
illustration we apply these imaging methods to MWC158, a (possibly Herbig) B[e]
star intensively observed with PIONIER. Finally, we compare our result with a
parametric model fitted onto the data.
