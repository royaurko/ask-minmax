The GIRAFFE spectrograph is unique in providing the integral field
spectroscopy of fifteen distant galaxies at the same time. It has been
successfully implemented at the second VLT unit within the FLAMES facility. We
present GIRAFFE observations acquired during the Guaranteed Time Observation of
the Paris Observatory, using total exposure times ranging from 6 to 12 hours.
The reduced 3D cube of each galaxy has been deconvolved using our new package
DisGal3D. This software has been written using the only assumption that UV
light traces the emission line regions. The comparison between GIRAFFE spectra
and HST imagery allows us to recover details on velocity fields as small as
0.3-0.4 arcsec. It has been successfully tested using Fabry Perot observations
of nearby galaxies purposely redshifted to large distances. We present here
preliminary results for three distant galaxies at 0.45< z < 0.65, whose
velocity fields have been derived with exquisite spectral (R=10000) and spatial
resolutions. Observed velocity fields range from disturbed fields expected in
major merger events to those of regular spiral with minor perturbations. For
the latter, one could accurately derive the dynamical major axis and the
maximal rotational velocity. We conclude that dynamical properties of a large
number of distant galaxies can be routinely derived at VLT. This opens a new
avenue towards the understanding of the galaxy formation and evolution during
the last 8 Gyr.
