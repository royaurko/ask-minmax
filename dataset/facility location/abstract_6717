By introducing a suitable Lagrangian, a canonical quantization of the
electromagnetic field in the presence of a non-dispersive bi-anisotropic
inhomogeneous magnetodielectric medium is investigated. A tensor projection
operator is defined and the commutation relation between the vector potential
and its canonically conjugate variable is written in terms of the projection
operator. The quantization method is generalized in the presence of the atomic
systems. The spontaneous emission of a two-level atom located in a
non-dispersive anisotropic megnetodielectric medium is studied.
