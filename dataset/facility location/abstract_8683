In order to map the galaxy density field on small scales in the local
universe, we use the Nearby Optical Galaxy (NOG) sample, which is currently one
of the largest, nearly complete, magnitude-limited ($B\leq$ 14 mag), all-sky
sample of nearby optical galaxies ($\sim$ 6400 galaxies with cz< 5500 km/s). We
have corrected the redshift-dependent distances of these galaxies for
non-cosmological motions by means of peculiar velocity field models.
  Relying on group assignments and on total B magnitudes fully corrected for
internal and Galactic extinctions, we determine the total and
morphological-type specific luminosity functions for field and grouped galaxies
using their locations in real distance space.
  The related determination of the selection function is meant to be an
important step in recovering the galaxy density field on small scales from the
NOG sample. Local galaxy density parameters will be used in statistical studies
of environmental effects on galaxy properties.
