Differential cross sections and photon beam asymmetries for the gamma p
rightarrow K+ Lambda and gamma p rightarrow K+ Sigma0 reactions have been
measured in the photon energy range from 1.5 GeV to 2.4 GeV and in the angular
range from Theta_{cm} = 0 to 60 of the K+ scattering angle in the center of
mass system at the SPring-8/LEPS facility. The photon beam asymmetries for both
the reactions have been found to be positive and to increase with the photon
energy. The measured differential cross sections agree with the data measured
by the CLAS collaboration at cosTheta_{cm}<0.9 within the experimental
uncertainties, but the discrepancy with the SAPHIR data for the K+Lambda
reaction is large at cosTheta_{cm}>0.9. In the K+Lambda reaction, the
resonance-like structure found in the CLAS and SAPHIR data at W=1.96 GeV is
confirmed. The differential cross sections at forward angles suggest a strong
K-exchange contribution in the t-channel for the K+Lambda reaction, but not for
the K+Sigma0 reaction.
