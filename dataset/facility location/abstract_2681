Cosmic ray muon tomography is a novel technology to detect high-Z material. A
prototype of TUMUTY with 73.6 cm x 73.6 cm large scale position sensitive MRPC
detectors has been developed and is introduced in this paper. Three test kits
have been tested and image is reconstructed using MAP algorithm. The
reconstruction results show that the prototype is working well and the objects
with complex structure and small size (20 mm) can be imaged on it, while the
high-Z material is distinguishable from the low-Z one. This prototype provides
a good platform for our further studies of the physical characteristics and the
performances of cosmic ray muon tomography.
