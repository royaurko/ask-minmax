We present the results of the spectral classification of the 82 brightest
galaxies in a sample of 17 compact groups. We verify that the AGNs are
preferentially located in the most early-type and luminous galaxies of the
groups, as is usually observed in the field. But these AGNs also appear to be
systematically concentrated towards the central parts of the groups. Our
observations suggest a correlation between activity types, morphologies and
densities of galaxies in the compact groups. This is consistent with a scenario
in which galaxies of compact groups evolve by interacting with their
environment and are currently in a quiet phase of their activity
