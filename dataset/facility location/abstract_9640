We study a two-dimensional granular system where external driving force is
applied to each particle in the system in such a way that the system is driven
into a steady state by balancing the energy input and the dissipation due to
inelastic collision between particles. The velocities of the particles in the
steady state satisfy the Maxwellian distribution. We measure the
density-density correlation and the velocity-velocity correlation functions in
the steady state and find that they are of power-law scaling forms. The
locations of collision events are observed to be time-correlated and such a
correlation is described by another power-law form. We also find that the
dissipated energy obeys a power-law distribution. These results indicate that
the system evolves into a critical state where there are neither characteristic
spatial nor temporal scales in the correlation functions. A test particle
exhibits an anomalous diffusion which is apparently similar to the Richardson
law in a three-dimensional turbulent flow.
