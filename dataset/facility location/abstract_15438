We present a detailed study on the kinematics of metal-rich stars with and
without planets, and their relation with the Hyades, Sirius and Hercules
dynamical streams in the solar neighbourhood. Accurate kinematics have been
derived for all the stars belonging to the CORALIE planet search survey. We
used precise radial velocity measurements and CCF parameters from the CORALIE
database, and parallaxes, photometry and proper motions from the HIPPARCOS and
Tycho-2 catalogues. The location of stars with planets in the thin or thick
discs has been analysed using both kinematic and chemical constraints. We
compare the kinematic behaviour of known planet-host stars to the remaining
targets belonging to the volume-limited sample, in particular to its metal-rich
population. The high average metallicity of the Hyades stream is confirmed. The
planet-host targets show a kinematic behaviour similar to that of the
metal-rich comparison subsample, rather than to that of the comparison sample
as a whole, thus supporting a primordial origin for the metal excess observed
in stars with known planetary companions. According to the scenarios proposed
as an explanation for the dynamical streams, systems with giant planets could
have formed more easily in metal-rich inner Galactic regions and then been
brought into the solar neighbourhood by dynamical streams.
