We analyse a sample of over 1000 stars from 32 fields imaged in the V and I
bands with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera, on board of the Hubble Space
Telescope. The fields are located at Galactic latitudes | b | >= 15deg and in
various directions on the sky. We consider models for the structure of the
Galaxy with different choices for the main parameters governing the shape and
luminosity function of the thick disk and stellar halo. Comparing model
predictions with the observed colour-magnitude diagram we are able to rule out
an increasing or flat stellar luminosity function at the low-luminosity end. We
also rule out large values of the vertical scale height of the thick disc, z_0,
finding it to be in the range 800 <= z_0 <= 1200 pc. As for the local density
normalization, values within the range 4 % <= n_0 <= 8 % seem to better
reproduce the data. Our data essentially rule out a flattened stellar halo (c/a
<~ 0.5) or models with both large local normalization and effective radii.
