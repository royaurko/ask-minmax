We consider the Dirichlet Laplacian in tubular neighbourhoods of complete
non-compact Riemannian manifolds immersed in the Euclidean space. We show that
the essential spectrum coincides with the spectrum of a planar tube provided
that the second fundamental form of the manifold vanishes at infinity and the
transport of the cross-section along the manifold is asymptotically parallel.
For low dimensions and codimensions, the result applies to the location of
propagating states in nanostructures under physically natural conditions.
