Results of a narrow-band imaging for the redshifted [OII]3727 emission around
a quasar at z=4.7 obtained with the Subaru telescope and CISCO (a Cassegrain
near infrared camera) are presented. A significant emission line is detected in
the narrow-band H_2 (v=1-0 S(1)) filter at a location 2.4" northwest from the
quasar, where the presence of a companion has been reported in Lyman alpha
emission and the rest-frame UV continuum. We identify this line as [OII]3727
emission and confirm that the source really is a companion at z=4.7. The
[OII]3727 flux from the companion is estimated to be 2.5 x 10^{-17} erg s^{-1}
cm^{-2}. If the companion is a star forming object, the inferred star formation
rate is as high as 45-230 M_{solar} yr^{-1} even without assuming the
extinction correction. This value is higher than those derived from the Lyman
alpha emission or from the UV continuum. Thus, provided that the difference is
caused by dust extinction, the extinction corrected star formation rate is
calculated to be 45 to 2300 M_{solar} yr^{-1} depending on the assuming
extinction curves.
