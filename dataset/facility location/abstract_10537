For particles emerging from a second order QCD phase transition, we show that
a recently introduced shape parameter of the Bose-Einstein correlation
function, the Levy index of stability equals to the correlation exponent - one
of the critical exponents that characterize the behavior of the matter in the
vicinity of the second order phase transition point. Hence the shape of the
Bose-Einstein / HBT correlation functions, when measured as a function of
bombarding energy and centrality in various heavy ion reactions, can be
utilized to locate experimentally the second order phase transition and the
critical end point of the first order phase transition line in QCD.
