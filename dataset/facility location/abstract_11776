In this paper, we make use of the exact hydrodynamic solution for the Stokes
equation for the velocity of a binary ionic solution that we have recently
obtained, and show that the nonequilibrium pressure in an electrolyte solution
subjected to an external electric field can be not only compressive, but also
divergent in the region containing the coordinate origin at which the center
ion of its ion atmosphere is located. This divergent compressive pressure
implies that it would be theoretically possible to locally confine the ion and
also to adiabatically generate heat in the local by means of the external
electric field. The field dependence of pressure and thus heat emission is
numerically shown and tabulated together with the theoretical estimate of its
upper bound, which is exponential with respect to the field strength. It shows
that, theoretically, the Coulomb barrier between nuclei in the electrolyte
solution (e.g., the ion and a nucleus of the solvent molecule) can be overcome
so as to make them fuse together, if no other effects intervene to prevent it.
