Here we aim to understand the origin of 47 Tuc's La-rich star Lee 4710. We
report abundances for O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Zn, Y, Zr,
Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Eu, and present a detailed abundance analysis of two 47
Tuc stars with similar stellar parameters but different slow neutron-capture
(s-)process enrichment. Star Lee 4710 has the highest known La abundance ratio
in this cluster ([La/Fe] = 1.14), and star Lee 4626 is known to have normal
s-process abundances (e.g., [Ba/Eu]$<0$). The nucleosynthetic pattern of
elements with Z$\gtrsim$56 for star Lee 4710 agrees with the predicted yields
of a $1.3M_{\odot}$ asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. Therefore, Lee 4710 may
have been enriched by mass transfer from a more massive AGB companion, which is
compatible with its location far away from the center of this relatively
metal-rich ([Fe/H]$\sim-0.7$) globular cluster. A further analysis comparing
the abundance pattern of Lee 4710 with data available in the literature reveals
that nine out of the $\sim200$ 47 Tuc stars previously studied show strong
s-process enhancements that point towards later enrichment by more massive AGB
stars.
