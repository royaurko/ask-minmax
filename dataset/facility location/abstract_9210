We estimate the dust extinction laws in two intermediate redshift galaxies.
The dust in the lens galaxy of LBQS1009-0252, which has an estimated lens
redshift of zl~0.88, appears to be similar to that of the SMC with no
significant feature at 2175 A. Only if the lens galaxy is at a redshift of
zl~0.3, completely inconsistent with the galaxy colors, luminosity or location
on the fundamental plane, can the data be fit with a normal Galactic extinction
curve. The dust in the zl=0.68 lens galaxy for B0218+357, whose reddened image
lies behind a molecular cloud, requires a very flat ultraviolet extinction
curve with (formally) R(V)=12 +- 2. Both lens systems seem to have unusual
extinction curves by Galactic standards.
