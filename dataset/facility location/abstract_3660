The rate of the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle of hydrogen burning is
controlled by the 14N(p,gamma)15O reaction. The reaction proceeds by capture to
the ground states and several excited states in O-15. In order to obtain a
reliable extrapolation of the excitation curve to astrophysical energy, fits in
the R-matrix framework are needed. In an energy range that sensitively tests
such fits, new cross section data are reported here for the four major
transitions in the 14N(p,gamma)15O reaction. The experiment has been performed
at the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA) 400 kV
accelerator placed deep underground in the Gran Sasso facility in Italy. Using
a composite germanium detector, summing corrections have been considerably
reduced with respect to previous studies. The cross sections for capture to the
ground state and to the 5181, 6172, and 6792 keV excited states in O-15 have
been determined at 359, 380, and 399 keV beam energy. In addition, the
branching ratios for the decay of the 278 keV resonance have been remeasured.
