The present paper describes a live project study carried out for the
universities located in the western Himalayan region of India in the year 2009.
The objective of this study is to undertake the task of assessment regarding
initiative, utilization of ICT resources, its performance and impact in these
higher educational institutions/universities. In order to answer these,
initially basic four- tier framework was prepared. Followed by a questionnaire
containing different ICT components 18 different groups like vision, planning,
implementation, ICT infrastructure and related activities exhibiting
performance. Primary data in the form of feedback on the five point scale, of
the questionnaire, was gathered from six universities of the region. A simple
statistical analysis was undertaken using weighted mean, to assess the ICT
initiative, status and performance of various universities. In the process, a
question related to Performance Indicator was identified from each group, whose
Coefficient of Correlation was calculated. This study suggests that a
progressive vision, planning and initiative regarding academic syllabi, ICT
infrastructure, used in training the skilled human resource, is going to have a
favourable impact through actual placement, research and play a dominant role
at the National and International level.
