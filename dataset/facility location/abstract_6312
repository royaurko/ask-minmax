We propose a scheme of storing and releasing pulses or cw beams of light in a
moving atomic medium illuminated by two stationary and spatially separated
control lasers. The method is based on electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT) but in contrast to previous schemes, storage and retrieval of the probe
pulse can be achieved at different locations and without switching off the
control laser.
