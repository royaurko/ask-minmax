Nowadays, many scientific areas share the same broad requirements of being
able to deal with massive and distributed datasets while, when possible, being
integrated with services and applications. In order to solve the growing gap
between the incremental generation of data and our understanding of it, it is
required to know how to access, retrieve, analyze, mine and integrate data from
disparate sources. One of the fundamental aspects of any new generation of data
mining software tool or package which really wants to become a service for the
community is the possibility to use it within complex workflows which each user
can fine tune in order to match the specific demands of his scientific goal.
These workflows need often to access different resources (data, providers,
computing facilities and packages) and require a strict interoperability on (at
least) the client side. The project DAME (DAta Mining & Exploration) arises
from these requirements by providing a distributed WEB-based data mining
infrastructure specialized on Massive Data Sets exploration with Soft Computing
methods. Originally designed to deal with astrophysical use cases, where first
scientific application examples have demonstrated its effectiveness, the DAME
Suite results as a multi-disciplinary platform-independent tool perfectly
compliant with modern KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) requirements and
Information & Communication Technology trends.
