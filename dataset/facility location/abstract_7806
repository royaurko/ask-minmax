Impacts that leave the Earth-Moon system with a large excess in angular
momentum have recently been advocated as a means of generating a protolunar
disc with a composition that is nearly identical to that of the Earth's mantle.
We here investigate the accretion of the Moon from discs generated by such
"non-canonical" impacts, which are typically more compact than discs produced
by canonical impacts and have a higher fraction of their mass initially located
inside the Roche limit. Our model predicts a similar overall accretional
history for both canonical and non-canonical discs, with the Moon forming in
three consecutive steps over hundreds of years. However, we find that, to yield
a lunar-mass Moon, the more compact non-canonical discs must initially be more
massive than implied by prior estimates, and only a few of the discs produced
by impact simulations to date appear to meet this condition. Non-canonical
impacts require that capture of the Moon into the evection resonance with the
Sun reduced the Earth-Moon angular momentum by a factor of 2 or more. We find
that the Moon's semimajor axis at the end of its accretion is approximately
$7R_\oplus$, which is comparable to the location of the evection resonance for
a post-impact Earth with a 2.5 h rotation period in the absence of a disc.
Thus, the dynamics of the Moon's assembly may directly affect its ability to be
captured into the resonance.
