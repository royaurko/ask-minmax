We consider a $N_f=3$ chiral Lagrangian which describes the interaction
between the pseudoscalar glueball, $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$, and scalar and pseudoscalar
mesons. We calculate the decay widths of the pseudoscalar glueball, where we
fixed its mass to 2.6 GeV, as predicted by lattice QCD simulations, and take a
closer look in the scalar-isoscalar decaying channel. We present our results as
branching ratios which are relevant for the future PANDA experiment at the FAIR
facility.
