This paper establishes the symmetries of Darboux's equations (1882) on tori.
We extend Ince's work (1940) by developing new infinite series expansions in
terms of Jacobi elliptic functions around each of the four regular singular
points of the Darboux equation which are located at the four half-periods of
the torus. The symmetry group of the Darboux equation is given by the Coxeter
group $B_4\cong G_{\mathrm{I}}\rtimes_{\Gamma} G_{\mathrm{II}}$ where the
actions of $G_{\mathrm{I}}$ correspond to the sign changes of the parameters in
the solutions of the equations, which have no effective changes on the equation
itself, while the actions of $G_{\mathrm{II}}$ permute the four half-periods of
the torus, which are described by a short-exact sequence. We are able to
clarify the symmetries of the equation when ordered bases of the underlying
torus changes. Our results show that it is much more transparent to consider
the symmetries of the Darboux equation on a torus than on the Riemann sphere
$\mathbb{CP}^1$ as was usually considered by earlier researchers such as Maier
(2007). We list the symmetry tables of the Darboux equation in both the
Jacobian form and Weierstrass form. A consolidated list of 192 solutions of the
Darboux equation is also given. We then consider the symmetries of several
classical equations (e.g. Lam\'e equation) all of which are special cases of
the Darboux equation. Those terminating solutions of the Darboux equation
generalize the classical Lam\'e polynomials.
