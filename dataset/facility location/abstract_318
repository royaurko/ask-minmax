The CHARM 2010 meeting had over 30 presentations of experimental results,
plus additional future facilities talks just before this summary talk. Since
there is not enough time even to summarize all that has been shown from
experiments and to recognize all the memorable plots and results, this summary
will give a few personal observations, an overview at a fairly high level of
abstraction.
