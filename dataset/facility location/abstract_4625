The spin-statistics connection is obtained for a simple formulation of a
classical field theory containing even and odd Grassmann variables. To that
end, the construction of irreducible canonical realizations of the rotation
group corresponding to general causal fields is reviewed. The connection is
obtained by imposing local commutativity on the fields and exploiting the
parity operation to exchange spatial coordinates in the scalar product of
classical field evaluated at one spatial location with the same field evaluated
at a distinct location. The spin-statistics connection for irreducible
canonical realizations of the Poincar\'{e} group of spin $j$ is obtained in the
form: Classical fields and their conjugate momenta satisfy fundamental
field-theoretic Poisson bracket relations for 2$j$ even, and fundamental
Poisson antibracket relations for 2$j$ odd
