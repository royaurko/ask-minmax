This paper extends a spreadsheet visualization technique by using layout
information. The original approach identifies logically or semantically related
cells by relying exclusively on the content of cells for identifying semantic
classes. A disadvantage of semantic classes is that users have to supply
parameters which describe the possible shapes of these blocks. The correct
parametrization requires a certain degree of experience and is thus not
suitable for untrained users. To avoid this constraint, the approach reported
in this paper uses row/column-labels as well as common format information for
locating areas with common, recurring semantics. Heuristics are provided to
distinguish between cell groups with intended common semantics and cell groups
related in an ad-hoc manner.
