Heavy mesons in nuclear matter and nuclei are analyzed within different
frameworks, paying a special attention to unitarized coupled-channel
approaches. Possible experimental signatures of the properties of these mesons
in matter are addressed, in particular in connection with the future FAIR
facility at GSI.
