Along an individual lifetime, stem cells replicate and suffer modifications
in their DNA content. I model the modifications in the DNA of a single cell as
a Levy flight, made up of small amplitude Brownian motions plus rare
large-jumps events. The distribution function of mutations has a long tail, in
which cancer events are located far away. The probability of cancer in a given
tissue is roughly estimated as a Ncell Nstep, where Ncell is the number of stem
cells, and Nstep -- the number of replication steps in the evolution of a
single cell. I test this expression against recent data on lifetime cancer
risk, Ncell and Nstep in different tissues. The coefficient a takes values
between 2x10^{-15} and 2x10^{-11}, depending on the role played by carcinogenic
factors and the immune response. The smallest values of a correspond to cancers
in which randomness plays the major role.
