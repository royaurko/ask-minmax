The Cobra fiber positioner is being developed by the California Institute of
Technology (CIT) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for the Prime Focus
Spectrograph (PFS) instrument that will be installed at the Subaru Telescope on
Mauna Kea, Hawaii. PFS is a fiber fed multi-object spectrometer that uses an
array of Cobra fiber positioners to rapidly reconfigure 2394 optical fibers at
the prime focus of the Subaru Telescope that are capable of positioning a fiber
to within 5um of a specified target location. A single Cobra fiber positioner
measures 7.7mm in diameter and is 115mm tall. The Cobra fiber positioner uses
two piezo-electric rotary motors to move a fiber optic anywhere in a 9.5mm
diameter patrol area. In preparation for full-scale production of 2550 Cobra
positioners an Engineering Model (EM) version was developed, built and tested
to validate the design, reduce manufacturing costs, and improve system
reliability. The EM leveraged the previously developed prototype versions of
the Cobra fiber positioner. The requirements, design, assembly techniques,
development testing, design qualification and performance evaluation of EM
Cobra fiber positioners are described here. Also discussed is the use of the EM
build and test campaign to validate the plans for full-scale production of 2550
Cobra fiber positioners scheduled to begin in late-2014.
