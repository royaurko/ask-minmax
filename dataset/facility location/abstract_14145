We propose a new estimator H-SMUCE (heterogeneous simultaneous multiscale
change-point estimator) for the detection of multiple change-points of the
signal in a heterogeneous gaussian regression model. A piecewise constant
function is estimated by minimizing the number of change-points over the
acceptance region of a multiscale test which locally adapts to possible changes
in the variance. The multiscale test is a combination of likelihood ratio tests
which are weighted by scale dependent critical values. We show that H-SMUCE
controls over- and underestimation of the number of change-points at a given
probability. Moreover, we obtain confidence sets for the location of the
change-points and for the whole signal. All results are non-asymptotic and
uniform over a large class of heterogeneous change-point models. H-SMUCE
achieves the optimal detection rate and estimates the number of change-points
consistently for vanishing signals, even when the number of change-points is
unbounded. The estimator is computed by a fine tuned dynamic program and often
performs almost linear in computation time. An R-package is available online.
We compare the performance of H-SMUCE with several state of the art methods in
simulations and analyse current recordings of a transmembrane protein in the
bacterial outer membrane with pronounced heterogeneity for its states.
