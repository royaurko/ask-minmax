We present a spatially resolved spectroscopic analysis of the young Galactic
supernova remnant Kes 75 (SNR G29.7-0.3) using the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
Kes 75 is one of an increasing number of examples of a shell-type remnant with
a central pulsar powering an extended radio/X-ray core. We are able to pinpoint
the location of the recently discovered pulsar, PSR J1846-0258, and confirm
that X-rays from the remnant's core component are consistent with non-thermal
power-law emission from both the pulsar and its surrounding wind nebula. We
find that the spectrum of the pulsar is significantly harder than that of the
wind nebula. Fainter, diffuse emission is detected from throughout the volume
delineated by the radio shell with a surface brightness distribution strikingly
similar to the radio emission. The presence of strong lines attributable to
ionized Mg, Si, and S indicate that at least some of this emission is thermal
in nature. However, when we characterize the emission using a model of an
underionized plasma with non-solar elemental abundances, we find we require an
additional diffuse high-energy component. We show that a significant fraction
of this emission is an X-ray scattering halo from the pulsar and its wind
nebula, although a nonthermal contribution from electrons accelerated in the
shock cannot be excluded.
