Fundamental antenna limits of the gain-bandwidth product are derived from
polarizability calculations. This electrostatic technique has significant value
in many antenna evaluations. Polarizability is not available in closed form for
most antenna shapes and no commercial electromagnetic packages have this
facility. Numerical computation of the polarizability for arbitrary conducting
bodies was undertaken using an unstructured triangular mesh over the surface of
2D and 3D objects. Numerical results compare favourably with analytical
solutions and can be implemented efficiently for large structures of arbitrary
shape.
