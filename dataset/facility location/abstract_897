Microscopic studies of nuclear matter under diverse conditions of density and
asymmetry are of great contemporary interest. Concerning terrestrial
applications, they relate to future experimental facilities that will make it
possible to study systems with extreme neutron-to-proton ratio. In this talk, I
will review recent efforts of my group aimed at exploring nuclear interactions
in the medium through the nuclear equation of state (EoS). The approach we take
is microscopic and relativistic, with the predicted EoS properties derived from
realistic nucleon-nucleon potentials. I will also discuss work in progress.
Most recently, we completed a DBHF calculation of the $\Lambda$ hyperon binding
energy in nuclear matter.
