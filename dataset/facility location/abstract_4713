We use statistical equilibrium equations to investigate the IRAC color space
of shocked molecular hydrogen. The location of shocked H_2 in [3.6]-[4.5] vs
[4.5]-[5.8] color is determined by the gas temperature and density of neutral
atomic hydrogen. We find that high excitation H_2 emission falls in a unique
location in the color-color diagram and can unambiguously be distinguished from
stellar sources. In addition to searching for outflows, we show that the IRAC
data can be used to map the thermal structure of the shocked gas. We analyze
archival Spitzer data of Herbig-Haro object HH 54 and create a temperature map,
which is consistent with spectroscopically determined temperatures.
