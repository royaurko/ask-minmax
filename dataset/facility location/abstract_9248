AGN activity is known to drive fast outflows of gas. We report the discovery
of fast outflows of neutral gas with velocities over 1000 km/s in a number of
radio galaxies. In the best studied object, 3C~293, the kinematical properties
of the neutral and ionised outflows are similar, indicating a common origin.
Moreover, the outflow appears to be located near the radio lobes and not near
the nucleus. This suggests that the interaction between the radio jet and the
ISM is driving the outflow.
