In this paper, we report the results of measurements of the intensities and
delays of super-radiance decays from excited helium atoms at multiple
wavelengths. The experiment was performed using extreme ultraviolet radiation
produced by the free electron laser at the SPring-8 Compact SASE Source test
accelerator facility as an excitation source. We observed super-radiant
transitions on the $1s3p \to 1s2s$ ($\lambda=$502 nm), $1s3d \to 1s2p$
($\lambda=$668 nm), and $1s3s \to 1s2p$ ($\lambda=$728 nm) transitions. The
pulse energy of each transition and its delay time were measured as a function
of the target helium gas density. Several interesting features of the data,
some of which appear to contradict with the predictions of the simple two-level
super-radiance theory, are pointed out.
