Isotope ratios of fragments produced at mid-rapidity in peripheral and
central collisions of 114Cd ions with 92Mo and 98Mo target nuclei at E/A = 50
MeV are compared. Neutron-rich isotopes are preferentially produced in central
collisions as compared to peripheral collisions. The influence of the size (A),
density, N/Z, E*/A, and Eflow/A of the emitting source on the measured isotope
ratios was explored by comparison with a statistical model (SMM). The
mid-rapidity region associated with peripheral collisions does not appear to be
neutron-enriched relative to central collisions.
