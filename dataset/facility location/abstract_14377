A number of Galactic sources emit GeV-TeV gamma rays that are produced
through leptonic and/or hadronic mechanisms. Spectral analysis in this energy
range is crucial in order to understand the emission mechanisms. The HAWC
Gamma-Ray Observatory, with a large field of view and location at $19^\circ$ N
latitude, is surveying the Galactic Plane from high Galactic longitudes down to
near the Galactic Center. Data taken with partially-constructed HAWC array in
2013-2014 exhibit TeV gamma-ray emission along the Galactic Plane. A high-level
analysis likelihood framework for HAWC, also presented at this meeting, has
been developed concurrently with the Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood (3ML)
architecture to deconvolve the Galactic sources and to perform multi-instrument
analysis. It has been tested on early HAWC data and the same method will be
applied on HAWC data with the full array. I will present preliminary results on
Galactic sources from TeV observations with HAWC and from joint analysis on
Fermi and HAWC data in GeV-TeV energy range.
