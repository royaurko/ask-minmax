We describe a camera beam simulator for the LSST which is capable of
illuminating a 60mm field at f/1.2 with realistic astronomical scenes, enabling
studies of CCD astrometric and photometric performance. The goal is to fully
simulate LSST observing, in order to characterize charge transport and other
features in the thick fully depleted CCDs and to probe low level systematics
under realistic conditions. The automated system simulates the centrally
obscured LSST beam and sky scenes, including the spectral shape of the night
sky. The doubly telecentric design uses a nearly unit magnification design
consisting of a spherical mirror, three BK7 lenses, and one beam-splitter
window. To achieve the relatively large field the beam-splitter window is used
twice. The motivation for this LSST beam test facility was driven by the need
to fully characterize a new generation of thick fully-depleted CCDs, and assess
their suitability for the broad range of science which is planned for LSST. Due
to the fast beam illumination and the thick silicon design [each pixel is 10
microns wide and over 100 microns deep] at long wavelengths there can be
effects of photon transport and charge transport in the high purity silicon.
The focal surface covers a field more than sufficient for a 40x40 mm LSST CCD.
Delivered optical quality meets design goals, with 50% energy within a 5 micron
circle. The tests of CCD performance are briefly described.
