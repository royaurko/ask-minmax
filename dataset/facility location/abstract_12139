The central part of the massive star-forming region Cepheus A contains
several radio sources which indicate multiple outflow phenomena, yet the
driving sources of the individual outflows have not been identified. We present
a high-resolution Chandra observation of this region that shows the presence of
bright X-ray sources, consistent with active pre-main sequence stars, while the
strong absorption hampers the detection of less luminous objects. A new source
has been discovered located on the line connecting H_2 emission regions at the
eastern and western parts of Cepheus A. This source could be the driving source
of HH 168. We present a scenario relating the observed X-ray and radio
emission.
