We report the discovery of two highly dispersed pulsars in the direction of
the Galactic Centre made during a survey at 3.1 GHz with the Parkes radio
telescope. Both PSRs J1745-2912 and J1746-2856 have an angular separation from
the Galactic Centre of less than 0.3 degrees and dispersion measures in excess
of 1100 cm-3pc, placing them in the top 10 pulsars when ranked on this value.
The frequency dependence of the scatter-broadening in PSR J1746-2856 is much
shallower than expected from simple theory. We believe it likely that the
pulsars are located between 150 and 500 pc from the Galactic Centre on the near
side, and are part of an excess population of neutron stars associated with the
Centre itself. A second survey made at 8.4 GHz did not detect any pulsars. This
implies either that there are not many bright, long-period pulsars at the
Galactic Centre or that the scattering is more severe at high frequencies than
current models would suggest.
