The pursuit of the progenitors of short duration-hard spectrum gamma-ray
bursts (SHBs) draws strongly upon similar quests for the origin of supernovae
(SNe) and long duration-soft spectrum GRBs(LSBs). Indeed the notion that, in
the absence of smoking guns, the progenitors of cosmic explosions betray their
identities both on the global and local scale, motivates the study of SHB
redshifts, host galaxies, and locations with respect to hosts. To this end, we
suggest both a historical and emergent physical analogy of GRBs with SNe:
long-soft GRBs are to core-collapsed supernovae as short-hard GRBs are to Type
Ia supernovae ("LSB:CC::SHB:Ia''). Still, the SHB progenitor pursuit is just
beginning and we caution that while there are some substantive differences
between observations of LSBs and SHBs on large-scales, particularly in host
demographics, neither the offset nor the redshift distributions of SHBs are
statistically inconsistent with those of LSBs.
