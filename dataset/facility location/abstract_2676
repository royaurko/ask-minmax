A 1-5 MeV proton beamline is being built by the Turkish Atomic Energy
Authority in collaboration with a number of graduate students from different
universities. The most important aspect of the project, is to acquire the
design ability and manufacturing capability of all the components locally. SPP
will be an accelerator and beam diagnostics test facility and it will also
serve the detector development community with its low beam current. This paper
discusses the design and construction of the RF power supply and the RF
transmission line components such as its waveguide converters and its
circulator.
