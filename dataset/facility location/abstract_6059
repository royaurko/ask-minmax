A chiral fermion action allows one to do very clean studies of chiral
symmetry breaking in QCD. I will briefly describe how to compute with the
overlap action (relatively) cheaply, and then turn to physics: Low modes of the
Dirac operator show a ``lumped'' chiral density which peaks at the locations of
instantons and anti-instantons. These modes dominate correlation functions at
small quark mass in many channels. The picture qualitatively (and in some cases
quantitatively) resembles an instanton liquid model.
