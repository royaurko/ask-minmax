We present the results of optical spectroscopy of a newly discovered H II
region residing in the H I gas cloud located between the dwarf irregular galaxy
UGC 7636 and the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 4472 in the Virgo Cluster. By
comparing UGC 7636 with dwarf irregular galaxies in the field, we show that the
H I cloud must have originated from UGC 7636 because (1) the oxygen abundance
of the cloud agrees with that expected for a galaxy with the blue luminosity of
UGC 7636, and (2) M_{H I}/L_B for UGC 7636 becomes consistent with the measured
oxygen abundance of the cloud if the H I mass of the cloud is added back into
UGC 7636. It is likely that tides from NGC 4472 first loosened the H I gas,
after which ram-pressure stripping removed the gas from UGC 7636.
