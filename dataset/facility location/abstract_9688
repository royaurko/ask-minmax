The emergence of mutual cooperation is studied in a spatially extended
evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game in which the players are located on the
sites of cubic lattices for dimensions d=1, 2, and 3. Each player can choose
one of the three strategies: cooperation (C), defection (D) or Tit for Tat (T).
During the evolutionary process the randomly chosen players adopt one of their
neighboring strategies if the chosen neighbor has higher payoff. Morover, an
external constraint imposes that the players always cooperate with probability
p. The stationary state phase diagram are computed by both using generalized
mean-field approximations and Monte Carlo simulations. Nonequilibrium second
order phase transitions assosiated with the extinction of one of the possible
strategies are found and the corresponding critical exponents belong to the
directed percolation universality class. It is shown that forcing externally
the collaboration does not always produce the desired result.
