It is demonstrated that velocity selective optical pumping/saturation
resonances of reduced absorption in a Rb vapor nanocell with thickness
\textit{L=} $\lambda $, 2$\lambda $, and 3$\lambda $ (resonant wavelength
$\lambda $ = 780 nm) allow the complete elimination of crossover (CO)
resonances. We observe well pronounced resonances corresponding to the
F$_{g}=3$ $\to $ F$_{e}=2,3,4$ hyperfine transitions of the $^{85}$Rb D$_{2}$
line with linewidths close to the natural width. A small CO resonance located
midway between F$_{g}=3$ $\to $ F$_{e}=3$ and F$_{g}=3$ $\to$ F$_{e}=4$
transitions appears only for \textit{L} = 4$\lambda $. The D$_{2}$ line
($\lambda $ = 852 nm) in a Cs nanocell exhibits a similar behavior. From the
amplitude ratio of the CO and VSOP resonances it is possible to determine the
thickness of the column of alkali vapor in the range of 1 - 1000 $\mu $m. The
absence of CO resonances for nanocells with $L \sim \lambda $ is attractive for
frequency reference application and for studying transitions between Zeeman
sublevels in external magnetic fields.
