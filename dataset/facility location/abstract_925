A parameterization of the $\bar pp$ differential elastic scattering cross
section in the beam momentum range from 2 to 16 GeV/c is proposed. The
parameterization well describes the existing data including the observed
diffraction pattern at four-momentum transfer $|t|$ up to 1.5-2.0 GeV$^2$. It
can be used for detailed calculations of the radiation load on the detectors
being designed for the PANDA detector at the future FAIR facility in Darmstadt.
