First, this chapter introduces the expressions for the electric and magnetic
space-charge internal fields and forces induced by high-intensity beams. Then,
the root-mean-square equation with space charge is derived and discussed. In
the third section, the one-dimensional Child-Langmuir law, which gives the
maximum current density that can be extracted from an ion source, is exposed.
Space-charge compensation can occur in the low-energy beam transport lines
(located after the ion source). This phenomenon, which counteracts the
spacecharge defocusing effect, is explained and its main parameters are
presented. The fifth section presents an overview of the principal methods to
perform beam dynamics numerical simulations. An example of a particles-in-cells
code, SolMaxP, which takes into account space-charge compensation, is given.
Finally, beam dynamics simulation results obtained with this code in the case
of the IFMIF injector are presented.
