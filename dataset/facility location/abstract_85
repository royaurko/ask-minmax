The Southern Abell Redshift Survey contains 39 clusters of galaxies with
redshifts in the range 0.0 < z < 0.31 and a median redshift depth of z =
0.0845. SARS covers the region 0 < decl < -65 deg, R.A. < 5h, R.A. > 21h (while
avoiding the LMC and SMC) with b > 40. Cluster locations were chosen from the
Abell and Abell-Corwin-Olowin catalogs while galaxy positions were selected
from the Automatic Plate Measuring Facility galaxy catalog with
extinction-corrected magnitudes in the range 15 <= b_j < 19. SARS utilized the
Las Campanas 2.5 m duPont telescope, observing either 65 or 128 objects
concurrently over a 1.5 sq deg field. New redshifts for 3440 galaxies are
reported in the fields of these 39 clusters of galaxies.
