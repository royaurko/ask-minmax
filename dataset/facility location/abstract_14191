Two iron-chalcogenide superconductors Li(x)[C5H5N](y)Fe(2-z)Se2 and
Cs(x)Fe(2-z)Se2 in the as-prepared and annealed state have been investigated by
means of the Moessbauer spectroscopy versus temperature. Multi-component
spectra are obtained. One can see a non-magnetic component due to iron located
in the unperturbed Fe-Se sheets responsible for superconductivity. Remaining
components are magnetically ordered even at room temperature. There is some
magnetically ordered iron in Fe-Se sheets perturbed by presence of the iron
vacancies. Additionally, one can see iron dispersed between sheets in the form
of magnetically ordered high spin trivalent ions, some clusters of above ions,
and in the case of pyridine intercalated compound in the form of alpha-Fe
precipitates. Pyridine intercalated sample shows traces of superconductivity in
the as-prepared state, while cesium intercalated sample in the as-prepared
state does not show any superconductivity. Superconductors with transition
temperatures being 40 K and 25 K, respectively, are obtained upon annealing.
Annealing leads to removal/ordering of the iron vacancies within Fe-Se sheets,
while clusters of alpha-Fe grow in the pyridine intercalated sample.
