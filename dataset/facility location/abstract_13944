We report parallaxes and proper motions of three water maser sources in
high-mass star-forming regions in the Outer Spiral Arm of the Milky Way. The
observations were conducted with the Very Long Baseline Array as part of Bar
and Spiral Structure Legacy Survey and double the number of such measurements
in the literature. The Outer Arm has a pitch angle of 14.9 +/- 2.7 deg and a
Galactocentric distance of 14.1 +/- 0.6 kpc toward the Galactic anticenter. The
average motion of these sources toward the Galactic center is 10.7 +/- 2.1 km/s
and we see no sign of a significant fall in the rotation curve out to 15 kpc
from the Galactic center. The three-dimensional locations of these star-forming
regions are consistent with a Galactic warp of several hundred parsecs from the
plane.
