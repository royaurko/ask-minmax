The fundamental problem underlying all multi-criteria decision analysis
(MCDA) problems is that of dominance between any two alternatives: "Given two
alternatives A and B, each described by a set criteria, is A preferred to B
with respect to a set of decision maker (DM) preferences over the criteria?".
Depending on the application in which MCDA is performed, the alternatives may
represent strategies and policies for business, potential locations for setting
up new facilities, designs of buildings, etc. The general objective of MCDA is
to enable the DM to order all alternatives in order of the stated preferences,
and choose the ones that are best, i.e., optimal with respect to the
preferences over the criteria. This article presents and summarizes a recently
developed MCDA framework that orders the set of alternatives when the relative
importance preferences are incomplete, imprecise, or qualitative in nature.
