The advent of new observational facilities in the last two decades has
allowed the rapid discovery and high-resolution optical imaging of many strong
lens systems from galaxy to cluster scales, as well as their spectroscopic
follow-up. Radio telescopes have played the dominant role in the systematic
detection of dozens of new arcsec-scale lens systems. For the future, we expect
nothing less! The next major ground- and space-based facilities, especially the
Square Kilometer Array can discover tens of thousands of new lens systems in
large sky surveys. For optical imaging and spectroscopic follow-up a strong
synergy with planned optical facilities is needed. Here, we discuss the field
where strong gravitational lensing is expected to play the dominant role and
where SKA can have a major impact: The study of the internal mass structure and
evolution of galaxies and clusters to z~1. In addition, studies of more exotic
phenomena are contemplated. For example, milli- and microlensing can provide a
way to measure the mass-functions of stars and CDM substructure at cosmological
distances. All-sky radio monitoring will also rapidly develop the field of
time-domain lensing.
