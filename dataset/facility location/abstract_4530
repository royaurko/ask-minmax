We present a progress report of a project to study the quantitative star
formation history (SFH) in different parts of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).
We use the information in [(B-R), R] color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), which
reach down to the oldest main-sequence turnoffs and allow us to retrieve the
SFH in detail. We show the first results of the SFH in a SMC field located in
the Southern direction (at $\thicksim$1 kpc from the SMC center). This field is
particularly interesting because in spite of being located in a place in which
the HI column density is very low, it still presents a recent enhancement of
star formation.
