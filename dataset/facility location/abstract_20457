Here we describe the \emph{Siding Spring Southern Seyfert Spectroscopic
Snapshot Survey} (S7) and present results on 64 galaxies drawn from the first
data release. The S7 uses the Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) mounted on the
ANU 2.3m telescope located at the Siding Spring Observatory to deliver an
integral field of $38\times25$~ arcsec at a spectral resolution of $R=7000$ in
the red ($530-710$nm), and $R=3000$ in the blue ($340-560$nm). {From these data
cubes we have extracted the Narrow Line Region (NLR) spectra from a 4 arc sec
aperture centred on the nucleus. We also determine the H$\beta$ and
[OIII]~$\lambda$5007 fluxes in the narrow lines, the nuclear reddening, the
reddening-corrected relative intensities of the observed emission lines, and
the H$\beta$ and \lOIII\ luminosities {determined from spectra for which the
stellar continuum has been removed.} We present a set of images of the galaxies
in [OIII]~$\lambda$5007, [NII]~$\lambda$6584 and H$\alpha$ which serve to
delineate the spatial extent of the extended narrow line region (ENLR) and {\bf
also to} reveal the structure and morphology of the surrounding \HII\ regions.
Finally, we provide a preliminary discussion of those Seyfert~1 and Seyfert~2
galaxies which display coronal emission lines in order to explore the origin of
these lines.
