When non-adsorbing polymers are added to an isotropic suspension of rod-like
colloids, the colloids effectively attract each other via depletion forces. We
performed Monte Carlo simulations to study the phase diagram of such
rod-polymer mixture. The colloidal rods were modelled as hard spherocylinders;
the polymers were described as spheres of the same diameter as the rods. The
polymers may overlap with no energy cost, while overlap of polymers and rods is
forbidden.
  Large amounts of depletant cause phase separation of the mixture. We
estimated the phase boundaries of isotropic-isotropic coexistence both, in the
bulk and in confinement. To determine the phase boundaries we applied the grand
canonical ensemble using successive umbrella sampling [J. Chem. Phys. 120,
10925 (2004)], and we performed a finite-size scaling analysis to estimate the
location of the critical point. The results are compared with predictions of
the free volume theory developed by Lekkerkerker and Stroobants [Nuovo Cimento
D 16, 949 (1994)]. We also give estimates for the interfacial tension between
the coexisting isotropic phases and analyse its power-law behaviour on approach
of the critical point.
