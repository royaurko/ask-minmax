We review in this paper the main results recently obtained on the
identification and study of very high-z galaxies usinglensing clusters as
natural gravitational telescopes. We present in detail our pilot survey with
ISAAC/VLT, aimed at the detection of z>7 sources. Evolutionary synthesis models
for extremely metal-poor and PopIII starbursts have been used to derive the
observational properties expected for these high-z galaxies, such as expected
magnitudes and colors, line fluxes for the main emission lines, etc. These
models have allowed to define fairly robust selection criteria to find z~7-10
galaxies based on broad-band near-IR photometry in combination with the
traditional Lyman drop-out technique. The first results issued from our
photometric and spectroscopic survey are discussed, in particular the
preliminary confirmation rate, and the global properties of our high-z
candidates, including the latest results on the possible z=10.0 candidate
A1835-1916. The search efficiency should be significantly improved by the
future near-IR multi-object ground-based and space facilities. However, strong
lensing clusters remain a factor of ~5-10 more efficient than blank fields in
this redshift domain, within the FOV of a few arcminutes around the cluster
core, for the typical depth required for this survey project.
