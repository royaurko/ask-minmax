The self-similar collapse of 3D and quasi-2D atom condensates with negative
scattering length is examined. 3D condensates are shown to blow up following
the scenario of {\it weak collapse}: The inner core of the condensate diverges
with an almost zero particle number, while its tail distribution spreads out to
large distances with a constant density profile. For this case, the 3-body
recombination arrests the collapse, but it weakly dissipates the atoms. The
confining trap then reforms the condensate at later times. In contrast, 2D
condensates undergo a {\it strong collapse}: The atoms stay mainly located at
center and recombination sequentially absorbs a significant amount of
particles.
