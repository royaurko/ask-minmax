We introduce a partition of (coweight) lattice points inside the dilated
fundamental parallelepiped into those of partially closed simplices. This
partition can be considered as a generalization and a lattice points
interpretation of the classical formula of Worpitzky.
  This partition, and the generalized Eulerian polynomial, recently introduced
by Lam and Postnikov, can be used to describe the characteristic
(quasi)polynomials of Shi and Linial arrangements. As an application, we prove
that the characteristic quasi-polynomial of the Shi arrangement turns out to be
a polynomial. We also present several results on the location of zeros of
characteristic polynomials, related to a conjecture of Postnikov and Stanley.
In particular, we verify the "functional equation" of the characteristic
polynomial of the Linial arrangement for any root system, and give partial
affirmative results on "Riemann hypothesis" for the root systems of type $E_6,
E_7, E_8$, and $F_4$.
