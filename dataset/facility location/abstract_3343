Measurements on the eta meson production in proton-deuteron collisions have
been performed using the COSY-11 facility at COSY Juelich. Here we present
preliminary results on total and differential cross sections for the pd --> 3He
eta reaction at five excess energies between Q = 5.1 and Q = 40.6 MeV. The
obtained angular distributions for the emitted eta mesons in the center of mass
system expose a transition from an almost isotropic emission to a highly
anisotropic distribution. The extracted total cross sections support a strong
eta-3He final state interaction and will be compared with model predictions.
