We show that the Minesweeper game is PP-hard, when the object is to locate
all mines with the highest probability. When the probability of locating all
mines may be infinitesimal, the Minesweeper game is even PSPACE-complete. In
our construction, the player can reveal a boolean circuit in polynomial time,
after guessing an initial square with no surrounding mines, a guess that has 99
percent probability of success. Subsequently, the mines must be located with a
maximum probability of success.
  Furthermore, we show that determining the solvability of a partially
uncovered Minesweeper board is NP-complete with hexagonal and triangular grids
as well as a square grid, extending a similar result for square grids only by
R. Kaye. Actually finding the mines with a maximum probability of success is
again PP-hard or PSPACE-complete respectively.
  Our constructions are in such a way that the number of mines can be computed
in polynomial time and hence a possible mine counter does not provide
additional information. The results are obtained by replacing the dyadic gates
in [3] by two primitives which makes life more easy in this context.
