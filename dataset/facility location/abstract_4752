In this paper we present a way of hiding the data in mobile devices from
being compromised. We use two level data hiding technique, where in its first
level data is encrypted and stored in special records and the second level
being a typical password protection scheme. The second level is for secure
access of information from the device. In the first level, encryption of the
data is done using the location coordinates as key. Location Coordinates are
rounded up figures of longitude and latitude information. In the second phase
the password entry differs from conventional schemes. Here we have used the
patterns of traditional Rangoli for specifying the password and gaining access,
thus minimising the chances of data leak in hostile situations. The proposed
structure would be a better trade off in comparison with the previous models
which use Bio Metric authentication -- a relatively costly way of
authentication.
