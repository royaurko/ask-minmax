We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the
electronic properties of the newly discovered oxypnictide superconductor,
NdFeAsO_{1-x}F_x. We find a well-defined Fermi surface that consists of a large
hole pocket at the Brillouin zone center and a smaller electron pocket in each
corner of the Brillouin zone. The overall location and shape of the Fermi
surface agrees reasonably well with calculations. The band dispersion is quite
complicated with many flat bands located just below the chemical potential. We
observe a superconducting gap of 20 meV, which indicates that this system is in
the strong coupling regime. The emergence of a coherent peak below the critical
temperature Tc and diminished spectral weight at the chemical potential above
Tc closely resembles the spectral characteristics of the cuprates.
