The THz atmospheric windows centered at roughly 1.3 and 1.5~THz, contain
numerous spectral lines of astronomical importance, including three high-J CO
lines, the N+ line at 205 microns, and the ground transition of para-H2D+. The
CO lines are tracers of hot (several 100K), dense gas; N+ is a cooling line of
diffuse, ionized gas; the H2D+ line is a non-depleting tracer of cold (~20K),
dense gas. As the THz lines benefit the study of diverse phenomena (from
high-mass star-forming regions to the WIM to cold prestellar cores), we have
built the CO N+ Deuterium Observations Receiver (CONDOR) to further explore the
THz windows by ground-based observations. CONDOR was designed to be used at the
Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) and Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared
Astronomy (SOFIA). CONDOR was installed at the APEX telescope and test
observations were made to characterize the instrument. The combination of
CONDOR on APEX successfully detected THz radiation from astronomical sources.
CONDOR operated with typical Trec=1600K and spectral Allan variance times of
30s. CONDOR's first light observations of CO 13-12 emission from the hot core
Orion FIR4 (= OMC1 South) revealed a narrow line with T(MB) = 210K and
delta(V)=5.4km/s. A search for N+ emission from the ionization front of the
Orion Bar resulted in a non-detection. The successful deployment of CONDOR at
APEX demonstrates the potential for making observations at THz frequencies from
ground-based facilities.
