While doing optical study in an instrument similar to the interferometers
dedicated to the Very Large Telescope (VLT), we have to take care of the pupil
and focus conjugations. Modules with artificial sources are designed to
simulate the stellar beams, in terms of collimation and pupil location. They
constitute alignment and calibration tools. In this paper, we present such a
module in which the pupil mask is not located in a collimated beam thus
introducing Fresnel diffraction. We study the instrumental contrast taking into
account the spatial coherence of the source, and the pupil diffraction. The
considered example is MATISSE, but this study can apply to any other instrument
concerned with Fresnel diffraction.
