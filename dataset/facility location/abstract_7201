A tremendous starburst, that ended about 4 million years ago, has had a very
strong impact on the dwarf galaxy NGC 1569. Evidence for this event is still
prominent in the different components of the galaxy: For example, photometric
studies of the resolved stellar population close to the very luminous
super-star clusters hint at past star formation rates of up to 3 M_solar/yr. In
ROSAT observations, extended X-ray emission has been found at the same
location. And the spectrum of the strong synchrotron emission shows a kink
characteristic for a recently stopped starburst. We study the impact of the
starburst on the neutral atomic and molecular gas. Our CO(3--2) map obtained
with the Heinrich-Hertz Telescope reveals 3 giant molecular associations as
well as a large amount of extended CO gas. The comparison of this map with
interferometric and single-dish data of the CO(2--1) and CO(1--0) transitions
indicates an unusually warm molecular gas phase. The HI distribution is
remarkably smooth for a star-forming dwarf galaxy. Only one huge bubble has
been found. It is located near the position of the super-star clusters. With
our naturally weighted VLA data cube, we can confirm the existence of a
low-mass HI cloud and a bridge connecting it to NGC 1569. This might be an HI
cloud in the process of merging with the galaxy and being tidally disrupted. We
also report the detection of the remnants of a shell, that can be traced best
in the HI velocity field.
