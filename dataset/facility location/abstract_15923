Data analysis for the proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will
be complicated by the huge number of sources in the LISA band. Throughout much
of the band, galactic white dwarf binaries (GWDBs) are sufficiently dense in
frequency space that it will be impossible to resolve most of them, and
"confusion noise" from the unresolved Galactic binaries will dominate over
instrumental noise in determining LISA's sensitivity to other sources in that
band. Confusion noise from unresolved extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs)
could also contribute significantly to LISA's total noise curve. To date,
estimates of the effect of LISA's confusion noise on matched-filter searches
and their detection thresholds have generally approximated the noise as
Gaussian, based on the Central Limit Theorem. However in matched-filter
searches, the appropriate detection threshold for a given class of signals may
be located rather far out on the tail of the signal-to-noise probability
distribution, where a priori it is unclear whether the Gaussian approximation
is reliable. Using the Edgeworth expansion and the theory of large deviations,
we investigate the probability distribution of the usual matched-filter
detection statistic, far out on the tail of the distribution. We apply these
tools to four somewhat idealized versions of specific LISA searches.
