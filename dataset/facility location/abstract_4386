The present paper is devoted to questions located at the junction of the
theory of space quasiconformal mappings and Riemannian surfaces. Theorems on
local behavior of one class of open discrete mappings with unbounded
characteristic of quasiconformality on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds are
obtained
