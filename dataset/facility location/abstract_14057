This paper proposes Navigo, a location based packet forwarding mechanism for
vehicular Named Data Networking (NDN). Navigo takes a radically new approach to
address the challenges of frequent connectivity disruptions and sudden network
changes in a vehicle network. Instead of forwarding packets to a specific
moving car, Navigo aims to fetch specific pieces of data from multiple
potential carriers of the data. The design provides (1) a mechanism to bind NDN
data names to the producers' geographic area(s); (2) an algorithm to guide
Interests towards data producers using a specialized shortest path over the
road topology; and (3) an adaptive discovery and selection mechanism that can
identify the best data source across multiple geographic areas, as well as
quickly react to changes in the V2X network.
