Laser Interference Lithography (LIL) is a versatile fabrication method for
patterning sub-micron structures in arrays covering large areas. It is a facile
and fast mask-less lithography process to produce large area periodic patterns.
The objective in this study is to simulate and design periodic and
quasi-periodic 1D, 2D and 3D nanostructures using two-beam interference
technique. We designed and simulated periodic and quasi-periodic structures by
two-beam interference patterning using a MATLAB program by varying angle of
incidence, wavelength and geometry. The generated patterns/features depend on
the interference intensity, wavelength, slit separation and angle of incidence.
Using this technique, we can achieve potentially high-volume of uniformity,
throughput, process control, and repeatability. By varying different input
parameters, we have optimized simulated patterns with controlled periodicity,
density and aspect ratio also it can be programmed to obtain images of
interference results showing interference intensity distributions.
