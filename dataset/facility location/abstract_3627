Thanks to a variety of pertinent wide-angle facilities (WFI-slitless mode,
VLT-FLAMES (Pasquini et al. 2002), SPITZER, 2MASS) it is possible to
comprehensively study the nature of early-type objects in star-forming regions
like the Eagle Nebula and Carina on large spatial scales. In them, the young
open clusters NGC 6611, Trumpler 14, Trumpler 15, Trumpler 16, and their
vicinities are of particular interest. With the WFI in its slitless mode (Baade
et al. 1999), one can reliably and with little extra effort discriminate in
thousands of spectra between intrinsic circumstellar emission as in HBe/Ae
stars and diffuse interstellar line emission. The only bias results from the
need of the equivalent width and absolute strength of the line emission to be
sufficient for detection. VLT-FLAMES spectra combined with infrared data from
SPITZER and 2MASS permit the nature of the objects with and without
emission-lines to be derived. Following this approach, we report on the
discovery and classification of new Herbig Be/Ae stars, pre-main sequence
objects, and main sequence stars in these regions. Based on line-width
measurements in VLT-FLAMES spectra, the evolution of the rotational velocities
between pre-main sequence and main sequence phases is also discussed.
