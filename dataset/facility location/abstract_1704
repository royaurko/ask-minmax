We discuss the possibility to produce the bound states of the $\eta'(958)$
meson in nuclei theoretically. We calculate the formation cross sections of the
$\eta'$ bound states with the Green function method for ($\gamma$,p) reaction
and discuss the experimental feasibility at photon facilities like SPring-8. We
conclude that we can expect to observe resonance peaks in ($\gamma$,p) spectra
for the formation of $\eta'$ bound states and we can deduce new information on
$\eta'$ properties at finite density. These observations are believed to be
essential to know the possible mass shift of $\eta'$ and deduce new information
of the effective restoration of the chiral $U_A(1)$ anomaly in the nuclear
medium.
