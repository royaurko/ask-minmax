Thermoluminescence detectors (TLD) were used for dose measurements at JET.
Several hundreds of LiF detectors of various types, standard LiF:Mg,Ti and
highly sensitive LiF:Mg,Cu,P were produced. LiF detectors consisting of natural
lithium are sensitive to slow neutrons, their response to neutrons being
enhanced by 6Li-enriched lithium or suppressed by using lithium consisting
entirely of 7Li. Pairs of 6LiF/7LiF detectors allow distinguishing between
neutron/non-neutron components of a radiation field. For detection of neutrons
of higher energy, polyethylene (PE-300) moderators were used. TLDs, located in
the centre of cylindrical moderators, were installed at eleven positions in the
JET hall and the hall labyrinth in July 2012, and exposure took place during
the last two weeks of the experimental campaign. Measurements of the gamma dose
were obtained for all positions over a range of about five orders of magnitude
variation. As the TLDs were also calibrated in a thermal neutron field, the
neutron fluence at the experimental position could be derived. The experimental
results are compared with calculations using the MCNP code. The results confirm
that the TLD technology can be usefully applied to measurements of neutron
streaming through JET Torus Hall ducts.
