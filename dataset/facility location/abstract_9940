We report results of investigations of a high-speed drainage of thin aqueous
films squeezed between randomly nanorough surfaces. A significant decrease in
hydrodynamic resistance force as compared with predicted by Taylor's equation
is observed. However, this reduction in force does not represents the slippage.
The measured force is exactly the same as that between equivalent smooth
surfaces obeying no-slip boundary conditions, but located at the intermediate
position between peaks and valleys of asperities. The shift in hydrodynamic
thickness is shown to be independent on the separation and/or shear rate. Our
results disagree with previous literature data reporting very large and
shear-dependent boundary slip for similar systems.
