In a recent publication [Ferreira {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. D89 (2014) 083011]
we tested the consistency of current astrophysical tests of the stability of
the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and the proton-to-electron mass ratio
$\mu=m_p/m_e$ (mostly obtained in the optical/ultraviolet) with combined
measurements of $\alpha$, $\mu$ and the proton gyromagnetic ratio $g_p$ (mostly
in the radio band). Given the significant observational progress made in the
past year, we now revisit and update this analysis. We find that apparent
inconsistencies, at about the two-sigma level, persist and are in some cases
enhanced, especially for matter era measurements (corresponding to redshifts
$z>1$). Although hidden systematics may be the more plausible explanation, we
briefly highlight the importance of clarifying this issue, which is within the
reach of state-of-the art observational facilities such as ALMA and ESPRESSO.
