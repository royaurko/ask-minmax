We study the self-focusing dynamics and collapse of vortex Airy optical beams
in a Kerr medium. The collapse is suppressed compared to a non- vortex Airy
beam in a Kerr medium as a result of the existence of vortex fields. The
locations of collapse depend sensitively on the initial power, vortex order,
and modulation parameters. Unlike the collapses reported before for any beam,
the collapse may occur in a position where the initial field is nearly zero
while no collapse appears in the region where the initial field is mainly
distributed. This study sheds light on how to control and manipulate the
location of collapse based on the initial power, vortex order and modulation
parameter.
