Exact nonstatic spherically symmetric black-hole solution of the higher
dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills equations for a null dust with Yang-Mills gauge
charge are obtained by employing Wu-Yang \textit{ansatz}, namely, HD-EYM Vaidya
solution. It is interesting to note that gravitational contribution of YM gauge
charge for this ansatz is indeed opposite (attractive rather than repulsive)
that of Maxwell charge. It turns out that the gravitational collapse of null
dust with YM gauge charge admit strong curvature shell focusing naked
singularities violating cosmic censorship. However, there is significant
shrinkage of the initial data space for a naked singularity of the HD-Vaidya
collapse due to presence of YM gauge charge. The effect of YM gauge charge on
structure and location of the apparent and event horizons is also discussed.
