The UN/ESA Workshops on Basic Space Science is a long-term effort for the
development of astronomy and regional and international co-operation in this
field on a world wide basis, particularly in developing nations. The first four
workshops in this series (India 1991, Costa Rica and Colombia 1992, Nigeria
1993, and Egypt 1994) addressed the status of astronomy in Asia and the
Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, and Western Asia,
respectively. One major recommendation that emanated from the first four
workshops was that small astronomical facilities should be established in
developing nations for research and education programmes at the university
level and that such facilities should be networked. Subsequently, material for
teaching and observing programmes for small optical telescopes were developed
or recommended and astronomical telescope facilities have been inaugurated at
UN/ESA Workshops on Basic Space Science in Sri Lanka (1995), Honduras (1997),
and Jordan (1999). UN/ESA Workshops on Basic Space Science in Germany (1996),
France (2000), Mauritius (2001), Argentina (2002), and P.R. China (2004)
emphasised the particular importance of astrophysical data systems and the
virtual observatory concept for the development of astronomy on a world wide
basis. Since 1996, the workshops are contributing to the development of the
World Space Observatory concept. Achievements of the series of workshops are
briefly summarised in this report.
