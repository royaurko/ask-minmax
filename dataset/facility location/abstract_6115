We demonstrate that one could measure the absolute matter density of the
Earth's core with a vertical neutrino factory baseline at the per cent level
for $\sin^2 2 \theta_{13} \gtrsim 0.01$, where we include all correlations with
the oscillation parameters in the analysis. We discuss the geographical
feasibility of such an approach, and illustrate how the results change as a
function of the detector location. We point out the complementarity to
geophysics.
