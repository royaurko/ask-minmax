We report on our experiences using the Metsahovi Radio Observatory's (MRO)
VLBI Standard Interface (VSI, Whitney 2002) recorder in a number of
astronomical applications. The PC-EVN device is a direct memory access (DMA)
interface which allows 512 megabit per second (Mbps) or better recording to
"off the shelf" PC components. We have used this setup to record at 640 Mbps
for a pulsar coherent dispersion system and at 256 Mpbs for a global VLBI
session. We have also demonstrated recording at 512 Mbps and will shortly form
cross correlations between the CPSR-II and the PC-EVN systems.
