In previous studies the dynamics of the relativistic particle moving along
the rotating pipe was investigated. The simple gedanken experiment was
considered. It was shown that at large enough velocities a centrifugal force
acting on the bead changes its usual sign and attracts towards the rotation
axis. The contributors studied motion of the particle along the rotating straight
pipe in the frame of the observer located in the center of rotation, also
dynamics of centrifugally accelerated relativistic particle was studied in the
laboratory frame. In the both cases it was shown that centrifugal force changes
sign. Recently the problem was studied in the frame of stationary observers. It
was argued that centrifugal acceleration reversal is not frame invariant
effect. In the present paper we consider motion of particle along the rotating
straight line in the frame of an arbitrary stationary observer located at
certain distance form the center of rotation and rigidly rotating with constant
angular velocity. It is shown that any stationary observer could detect
reversal of centrifugal acceleration.
