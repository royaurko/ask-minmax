We propose a concept for contributorisation using the location of a mobile device
and the enforcement of location-based policies. Mobile devices enhanced by
Trusted Computing capabilities operate an autonomous and secure location
trigger and policy enforcement entity. Location determination is two-tiered,
integrating cell-based triggering at handover with precision location
measurement by the device.
