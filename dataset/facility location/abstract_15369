Images obtained with NIRI on the Gemini North telescope are used to
investigate the photometric properties of the central regions of M31 in the 3 -
5 micron wavelength range. The light distribution in the central arcsecond
differs from what is seen in the near-infrared in the sense that the difference
in peak brigh tness between P1 and P2 is larger in M' than in K'; no obvious
signature of P3 is dete cted in M'. These results can be explained if there is
a source of emission that contributes ~ 20% of the peak M' light of P1 and has
an effective temperature of no more than a few hundred K that is located
between P1 and P2. Based on the red K-M' color of this source, it is suggested
that the emission originates in a circumstellar dust shell surrounding a single
bright AGB star. A similar bright source that is ~ 8 arcsec from the center of
the galaxy is also detected in M'. Finally, the (L', K-L') color-magnitude
diagram of unblended stars shows a domin ant AGB population with photometric
characteristics that are similar to those of the most luminous M giants in the
Galactic bulge.
