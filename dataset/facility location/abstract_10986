We study parameter estimation of supermassive black holes in the range
$10^5-10^8\Ms$ by LISA using the inspiral full post-Newtonian gravitational
waveforms, and we compare the results with those arising from the commonly used
restricted post-Newtonian approximation. The analysis shows that for
observations of the last year before merger, the inclusion of the higher
harmonics clearly improves the parameter estimation. We pay special attention
to the source location errors and we study the improvement on the percentage of
sources for which we could potentially identify electromagnetic counterparts.
We also show how the additional harmonics can help to mitigate the impact of
losing laser links during the mission.
