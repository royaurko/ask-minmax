Personal ontologies have been proposed as a means to support the semantic
management of user information. Assuming that a personal ontology system is in
use, new tools have to be developed at user interface level to exploit the
enhanced capabilities offered by the system. In this work, we present an
ontology-based file manager that allows semantic searching on the user's
personal information space. The file manager exploits the ontology relations to
present files associated with specific concepts, proposes new related concepts
to users, and helps them explore the information space and locate the required
file.
