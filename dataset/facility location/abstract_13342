Superfluid spin transport $-$ dissipationless transport of spin $-$ is
theoretically studied in a ferromagnetic insulator with easy-plane anisotropy.
We consider an open geometry where spin current is injected into the
ferromagnet from one side by a metallic reservoir with a nonequilibrium spin
accumulation, and ejected into another metallic reservoir located downstream.
Spin transport through the device is studied using a combination of
magnetoelectric circuit theory, Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert phenomenology, and
microscopic linear-response theory. We discuss how spin superfluidity can be
probed using a magnetically-mediated electron-drag experiment.
