In this paper, we provide a complete blow-up picture for solution sequences
to an elliptic sinh-Poisson equation with variable intensities arising in the
context of the statistical mechanics description of two-dimensional turbulence,
as initiated by Onsager. The vortex intensities are described in terms of a
probability measure defined on the interval. Under Dirichlet boundary
conditions we establish the exclusion of boundary blowup points, we show that
the concentration mass does not have residual L1-terms and we determine the
location of blowup points in terms of Kirchhoff's Hamiltonian. We allow the
measure to be a general Borel measure, which could be "degenerate." Our main
results are new for the standard sinh-Poisson equation as well.
