We consider a Markovian clearing queueing system, where the customers are
accumulated according to a Poisson arrival process and the server removes all
present customers at the completion epochs of exponential service cycles. This
system may represent the visits of a transportation facility with unlimited
capacity at a certain station. The system evolves in an alternating environment
that influences the arrival and the service rates. We assume that the arriving
customers decide whether to join the system or balk, based on a natural linear
reward-cost structure. We study the balking behavior of the customers and
derive the corresponding Nash equilibrium strategies under various levels of
information.
