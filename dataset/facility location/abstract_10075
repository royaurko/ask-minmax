We present techniques and methods for analyzing the dynamics of event
horizons in numerically constructed spacetimes. There are three classes of
analytical tools we have investigated. The first class consists of proper
geometrical measures of the horizon which allow us comparison with perturbation
theory and powerful global theorems. The second class involves the location and
study of horizon generators. The third class includes the induced horizon
2-metric in the generator comoving coordinates and a set of membrane-paradigm
like quantities. Applications to several distorted, rotating, and colliding
black hole spacetimes are provided as examples of these techniques.
