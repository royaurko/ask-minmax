We present a new visualization method to summarize and present periodic
population movement between distinct locations, such as floors, buildings,
cities, or the like. In the specific case of this paper, we have chosen to
focus on student movement between college dormitories on the Columbia
University campus. The visual information is presented to the information
analyst in the form of an interactive geographical map, in which specific
temporal periods as well as individual buildings can be singled out for
detailed data exploration. The navigational interface has been designed to
specifically meet a geographical setting.
