Mechanically bent nickel nanowires show clear features in their room
temperature magnetoresistance when a domain wall is pinned at the location of
the bend. By varying the direction of an applied magnetic field, the wire can
be prepared either in a single-domain state or a two-domain state. The presence
or absence of the domain wall acts to shift the switching fields of the
nanowire. In addition, a comparison of the magnetoresistance of the nanowire
with and without a domain wall shows a shift in the resistance correlated with
the presence of a wall. The resistance is decreased by 20-30 milli-Ohms when a
wall is present, compared to an overall resistance of 40-60 Ohms. A model of
the magnetization was developed that allowed calculation of the magnetostatic
energy of the nanowires, giving an estimate for the nucleation energy of a
domain wall.
