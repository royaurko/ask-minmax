This paper presents the implementation of polynomial vector back propagation
algorithm (PVBPA) for estimating the power, torque, specific fuel consumption
and presence of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons in the emission of a direct
injection diesel engine. Experimental readings were obtained using the
biodiesel prepared form the waste low quality cooking oil collected from the
canteen of Sri Sairam Engineering College, India.. This waste cooking oil was
due to the preparation of varieties of food (vegetables fried and non
vegetarian). Over more than a week, trans esterification was done in chemical
lab and the biodiesel was obtained. The biodiesel was mixed in proportions of
10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% with remaining combinations of the diesel supplied by
the Indian government. Variable compression ratio (VCR) diesel engine with
single cylinder, four stroke diesel type was used. The outputs of the engine as
power, torque and specific fuel consumption were obtained from the
computational facility attached to the engine. The data collected for different
input conditions of the engine was further used to train (PVBPA). The trained
PVBPA network was further used to predict the power, torque and brake specific
fuel consumption (SFC) for different speed, biodiesel and diesel combinations
and full load condition. The estimation performance of the PVBPA network is
discussed.
