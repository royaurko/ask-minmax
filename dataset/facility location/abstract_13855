Instagram is a relatively new form of communication where users can instantly
share their current status by taking pictures and tweaking them using filters.
It has seen a rapid growth in the number of users as well as uploads since it
was launched in October 2010. Inspite of the fact that it is the most popular
photo sharing application, it has attracted relatively less attention from the
web and social media research community. In this paper, we present a
large-scale quantitative analysis on millions of users and pictures we crawled
over 1 month from Instagram. Our analysis reveals several insights on Instagram
which were never studied before: 1) its social network properties are quite
different from other popular social media like Twitter and Flickr, 2) people
typically post once a week, and 3) people like to share their locations with
friends. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth analysis of
user activities, demographics, social network structure and user-generated
content on Instagram.
