Large-scale surveys of the Perseus molecular cloud have provided many clues
as to the processes occurring during star formation. Here, analysis of both
column density maps and kinematic data (maps and pointed data) are discussed
and compared with predictions from simulations. Results include a column
density threshold for the formation of dense star-forming cores and that the
dense cores are quiescent within their local environment, while the molecular
cloud as a whole has turbulent motions that are dominated by large-scale modes.
Some of these results have already been used to constrain models of star
formation, and the others can be included as future tests of the models. The
next few years of star formation research promises to provide exciting advances
to the field, particularly with the Gould Belt Legacy Surveys in progress at
several facilities, including the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT).
