We apply the Yang-Lee theory of phase transitions to an urn model of
separation of sand. The effective partition function of this nonequilibrium
system can be expressed as a polynomial of the size-dependent effective
fugacity $z$. Numerical calculations show that in the thermodynamic limit, the
zeros of the effective partition function are located on the unit circle in the
complex $z$-plane. In the complex plane of the actual control parameter certain
roots converge to the transition point of the model. Thus the Yang-Lee theory
can be applied to a wider class of nonequilibrium systems than those considered
previously.
