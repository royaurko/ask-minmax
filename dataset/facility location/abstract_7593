We present recent studies using the near-infrared instrument AMBER of the VLT
Interferometer (VLTI) to investigate the structure and shaping processes within
the extended atmosphere of AGB stars. Spectrally resolved near-infrared AMBER
observations of the Mira variable S Ori have revealed wavelength-dependent
apparent angular sizes. These data were successfully compared to dynamic model
atmospheres, which predict wavelength-dependent radii because of geometrically
extended molecular layers. Most recently, AMBER closure phase measurements of
several AGB stars have also revealed wavelength-dependent deviations from 0/180
deg., indicating deviations from point symmetry. The variation of closure phase
with wavelength indicates a complex non-spherical stratification of the
extended atmosphere, and may reveal whether observed asymmetries are located
near the photosphere or in the outer molecular layers. Concurrent observations
of SiO masers located within the extended molecular layers provide us with
additional information on the morphology, conditions, and kinematics of this
shell. These observations promise to provide us with new important insights
into the shaping processes at work during the AGB phase. With improved imaging
capabilities at the VLTI, we expect to extend the successful story of imaging
studies of planetary nebulae to the photosphere and extended outer atmosphere
of AGB stars.
