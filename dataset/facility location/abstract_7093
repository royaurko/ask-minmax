We study the resonances of a two-by-two semiclassical system of one
dimensional Schr\"odinger operators, near an energy where the two potentials
intersect transversally, one of them being bonding, and the other one
anti-bonding. Under an ellipticity condition on the interaction, we obtain
optimal estimates on the location and on the widths of these resonances.
