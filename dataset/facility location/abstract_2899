The bulge carbon stars have been a mystery since their discovery, because
they are about 2.5mag too faint to be regarded as genuine AGB stars, if located
inside the metal-rich bulge (m-M=14.5mag). Part of the mystery can be solved if
these carbon stars are related to the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (SDG;
m-M=17.0mag). They are in that case not old and metal-rich, but young, ~0.1
Gyr, with SMC-like metallicity. The sigma_RV=113+/-14 km/s radial velocity
dispersion of the stars appears to be consistent with bulge membership. On the
other hand, a similar velocity dispersion could be the result from an induced
star formation event when the SDG crosses the galactic midplane. It is
suggested that the carbon stars are tracers of such an event and that they
therefore are located at distances related to the SDG. However, the majority of
the carbon stars are not member of the SDG, nor are they similar to the C-stars
which are member of the SDG. The radial velocities can be used to determine a
possible membership to the SDG. However, they do not give information about the
distance of the stars. In particular, if the stars are located at a distance
comparable to the SDG. This implies that only the period-luminosity relation
can be used to distinguish unambiguously if the carbon stars are located at
bulge-like or SDG-like distances. Thus far only carbon stars with reliable
periods have been identified at a SDG related distance.
