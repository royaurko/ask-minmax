The axial anomaly contribution to generalized longitudinal-transverse
polarizability $\delta_{LT}^{}$ is calculated within Regge approach. It is
shown that the contribution from the exchange of the $a_1^{}(1260)$ Regge
trajectory is nontrivial and might have the key role to explain the large
difference between the predictions of chiral perturbation theory and the
experimental data for the neutron $\delta_{LT}^{}$. We also present the
prediction for the proton $\delta_{LT}^{}$, which will be measured at the
Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in near future.
