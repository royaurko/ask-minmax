We discuss the solution of accretion disk when the black hole is chosen to be
rotating. We study, how the fluid properties get affected for different
rotation parameters of the black hole. We know that no cosmic object is static
in Universe. Here the effect of the rotation of the black hole to the
space-time is considered following an earlier work of the contributor, where the
pseudo-Newtonian potential was prescribed for the Kerr geometry. We show that,
with the inclusion of rotation of the black hole, the valid disk parameter
region dramatically changes and disk becomes unstable. Also we discuss about
the possibility of shock in accretion disk around rotating black holes. When
the black hole is chosen to be rotating, the sonic locations of the accretion
disk get shifted or disappear, making the disk unstable. To bring it in the
stable situation, the angular momentum of the accreting matter has to be
reduced/enhanced (for co/counter-rotating disk) by means of some physical
process.
