Cross-section and neutron-emission data from heavy-ion fusion-fission
reactions are consistent with a Kramers-modified statistical model which takes
into account the collective motion of the system about the ground state; the
temperature dependence of the location of fission transition points; and the
orientation degree of freedom. We see no evidence to suggest that the nuclear
viscosity departs from the surface-plus-window dissipation model. The strong
increase in the nuclear viscosity above a temperature of ~1 MeV deduced by
others is an artifact generated by an inadequate fission model.
