In a six dimensional brane world model with multiple $S_1/Z_2$ warping, two
of the 4-branes at the boundaries have coordinate dependent brane tensions in
order to implement the orbifolded boundary conditions consistently. Such brane
tension is shown to be equivalent to a scalar field distribution on the brane
[1]. We show that in such a scenario a masslesss left chiral fermion on the
4-brane localizes naturally on the standard model 3-brane located at one edge
of the compact manifold while the massless right chiral fermion wave function
as well as the wave functions for the massive fermion modes peak away from this
brane. This offers a mechanism of obtaining massless chiral fermion with only
one of its chiral component present in our brane.
