We compute the Coleman-Weinberg potential with a finite cut-off for pure
SU(2) and SU(3) five-dimensional gauge theories compactified on an interval. We
show that besides the expected Coulomb phase located at and in the vicinity of
the free infrared stable or "trivial" fixed point, the theory possesses also a
Higgs phase. We compare the results from the potential computation with lattice
data from simulations.
