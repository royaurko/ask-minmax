Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) are produced by the collapse of very
massive stars. Due to the short lifetime of their progenitors, LGRBs pinpoint
star-forming galaxies. We present here a multi-band search for the host galaxy
of the long dark GRB 050219A within the enhanced Swift/XRT error circle. We
used spectroscopic observations acquired with VLT/X-shooter to determine the
redshift and star-formation rate of the putative host galaxy. We compared the
results with the optical/IR spectral energy distribution obtained with
different facilities. Surprisingly, the host galaxy is a old and quiescent
early-type galaxy at z = 0.211 characterised by an unprecedentedly low specific
star-formation rate. It is the first LGRB host to be also an early-type
post-starburst galaxy. This is further evidence that GRBs can explode in all
kind of galaxies, with the only requirement being an episode of star-formation.
