We present X-ray dust scattering halo results based on our 76 ks {\it
Chandra} ACIS-S/HETGS observation of the LMXB dipping source 4U 1624-490.
Through analysis of the halo light curves with 2-6 keV spectra over the
persistent and dipping periods, we estimate a geometric distance of $\sim$15
kpc to 4U 1624-490. We also fit halo radial profiles with different ISM dust
grain models to assess the location, uniformity, and density of the halo. Our
analysis shows that the dust spatial distribution is not uniform along the
line-of-sight; rather, it is consistent with the spiral arm structure mapped in
{\sc Hii}. The large difference between the absorption Hydrogen column ($N_{\rm
H}^{abs} \sim 8 \times10^{22} \rm cm^{-2}$; probes all gas along the
line-of-sight) derived from broadband spectral fitting, and the scattering
Hydrogen column ($N_{\rm H}^{sca} \sim 4 \times10^{22} \rm cm^{-2}$; probes
only Galactic gas) derived from our studies of the 4U 1624-490 X-ray halo
suggests that a large fraction of the column is local to the X-ray binary. We
also present (and apply) a new method for assessing the {\it Chandra} point
spread function at large ($> 50''$) angles, through use of the time delays from
the observed dips.
