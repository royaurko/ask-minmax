In this paper we use the MareNostrum Universe Simulation, a large scale,
hydrodynamic, non-radiative simulation in combination with a simple abundance
matching approach to determine the ram pressure statistics for bent radio
sources (BRSs). The abundance matching approach allows us to determine the
locations of all galaxies with stellar masses $> 10^{11} MSol$ in the
simulation volume. Assuming ram pressure exceeding a critical value causes bent
morphology, we compute the ratio of all galaxies exceeding the ram pressure
limit (RPEX galaxies) relative to all galaxies in our sample. According to our
model 50% of the RPEX galaxies at $z = 0$ are found in clusters with masses
larger than $10^{14.5}MSol$ the other half resides in lower mass clusters.
Therefore, the appearance of bent tail morphology alone does not put tight
constraints on the host cluster mass. In low mass clusters, $M < 10^{14}MSol$,
RPEX galaxies are confined to the central 500 kpc whereas in clusters of $>
10^{15}Msol$ they can be found at distances up to 1.5Mpc. Only clusters with
masses $> 10^{15}MSol $ are likely to host more than one BRS. Both criteria may
prove useful in the search for distant, high mass clusters.
