This short paper summarizes a calculational method for obtaining the
dynamical properties of many-body theories formulated in terms of
(unrenormalized) bare propagators (and more generally, in terms of meromorphic
functions, or convolutions over meromorphic functions) to a very high accuracy.
We demonstrate the method by applying it to a T-matrix theory of the attractive
Hubbard model in two dimensions. We expand the pair propagator using a partial
fraction decomposition, and then solve for the residues and pole locations of
such a decomposition using a computer algebra system to an arbitrarily high
accuracy (we used MapleV and obtained these quantities to a relative error of
10^(-80)). Thus, this method allows us to bypass all inaccuracies associated
with the traditional analytical continuation problem. Our results for the
density of states make clear the pronounced development of a pseudogap as the
temperature is lowered in this formulation of the attractive Hubbard model.
