We are conducting a project aimed at surveys and repeated observations of red
variables (or long-period variables) in globular clusters. Using the
IRSF/SIRIUS near-infrared facility located at South Africa, we are observing
145 globular clusters that are accessible from the site. In this contribution,
we present our observations and preliminary results. We have discovered many
red variables, especially in the Bulge region, whose memberships to the
clusters remain to be confirmed. Using a sample of all red variables (both
already known and newly discovered ones) in globular clusters except those
projected to the Bulge region, we produce a log P-K diagram and compare it with
those for the Bulge and the Large Magellanic Cloud. A prominent feature is that
the bright part of overtone-pulsators' sequence (B+ and C') is absent.
