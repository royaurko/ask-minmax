Large amount of electronic data is generated in Cloud computing every day.
Efficient maintenance of this data requires proper services. Hence a method to
collect data securely, by protecting and developing backups is mentioned. The
Objective is to provide Auto Response Server, better solutions for data backup
and restoring using Cloud. Data can be collected and sent to a centralized
repository in a platform independent format without any network consideration.
This data can then be used according to the requirement. The purpose of this
particular Remote Backup Server is to collect information from any remote
location even if network connectivity is not available at that point of time
and provide proper services as well as to recover data in case of loss.
