We report on the discovery of the simultaneous observation of Fishtail Effect
(FE) and Peak Effect (PE) via the study of angular dependence of dc
magnetization hysteresis loops in a clean crystal of 2H-NbSe$_2$. These result
clarify and establish the occurrence of the reentrant characteristics in order
to disorder transformation in an isothermal scan close to zero field
superconducting transition temperature of 2H-NbSe$_2$. The ubiquitous FE arises
from coalescence of two anomalous variations in current density J$_c$, one of
which is related to the collapse of the rigidity FLL close to H$_{c2}$ and
another one located at very low fields presumably corresponds to the pinning
induced order to disorder transformation. When the two effects get well
separated, an ordered state of FLL exists in the intermediate field region.
