The CRYRING accelerator, previously located at the Manne Siegbahn Laboratory
of Stockholm University, has been chosen by the FLAIR collaboration as the
central accelerator for the planned facility. It has been modified to allow for
high-energy injection and extraction and is capable of providing fast and slow
extracted beams of antiprotons and highly charged ions. It is currently being
installed at the ESR of GSI Darmstadt where it can be used with highly charged
ions. The future possibilities for its use with slow antiprotons will be
discussed.
