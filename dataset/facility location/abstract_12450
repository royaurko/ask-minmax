The variable gamma-ray source HESS J0632+057 is an excellent candidate for a
gamma-ray binary. The putative binary system was discovered as a point-like VHE
gamma-ray source by HESS. Later measurements by VERITAS yielding no detection,
provided evidence for variable emission in the gamma-ray domain. A variable
X-ray source as well as a Be star (MWC 148) are found at the location of the
gamma-ray source. Recently a periodic X-ray outburst occurring about every 320
days was reported by Swift (ATel 3152). The putative binary system was observed
by the MAGIC stereo system in 2010 and 2011. Our measurements demonstrate
significant activity in the gamma-ray (E > 200 GeV) band in February 2011. Our
detection of the system occurred during an X-ray outburst reported by Swift.
Here we present the obtained light curve and spectrum during this outburst and
put them into context with the X-ray measurements.
