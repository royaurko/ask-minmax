We show that shifts in locations of two-photon coincidence spectral peaks,
for a bichromatically-driven two-level atom passing through a single-mode
cavity, are due to competition between excitation pathways for a
Jaynes-Cummings system. We also discuss an analogous shift of (single-photon)
spectral peaks for a driven three-level V-system, which demonstrates that
competition between excitation pathways is also important in this simple
system.
