Motivation: Recombination rates vary considerably at the fine scale within
mammalian genomes, with the majority of recombination occurring within hotspots
of ~2 kb in width. We present a method for inferring the location of
recombination hotspots from patterns of linkage disequilibrium within samples
of population genetic data. Results: Using simulations, we show that our method
has hotspot detection power of approximately 50-60%, but depending on the
magnitude of the hotspot. The false positive rate is between 0.24 and 0.56
false positives per Mb for data typical of humans. Availability:
