The Telescope Array (TA) observatory, located in midwest Utah, USA, is
designed to detect ultra high energy cosmic rays whose energy is greater than 1
EeV. TA mainly consists of two types of detector. The first type is the
atmospheric Fluorescence Detector (FD). TA's three FDs have been in operation
since Fall 2007. The other type of detector is a ground-covering Surface
Detector (SD), which has been operating at TA since Spring 2008. In addition,
the TA-Rader (TARA) and EUSO-TA associated experiments are co-located with TA,
and the TA Low Energy (TALE) extension recently started partial operation. I
report some recent general results from TA, and describe our future plans.
