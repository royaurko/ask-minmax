We compute the response and the angular pattern function of an interferometer
for a scalar component of gravitational radiation in Brans-Dicke theory. We
examine the problem of detecting a stochastic background of scalar GWs and
compute the scalar overlap reduction function in the correlation between an
interferometer and the monopole mode of a resonant sphere. While the
correlation between two interferometers is maximized taking them as close as
possible, the interferometer-sphere correlation is maximized at a finite value
of f*d, where `f' is the resonance frequency of the sphere and `d' the distance
between the detectors. This defines an optimal resonance frequency of the
sphere as a function of the distance. For the correlation between the Virgo
interferometer located near Pisa and a sphere located in Frascati, near Rome,
we find an optimal resonance frequency f=590 Hz. We also briefly discuss the
difficulties in applying this analysis to the dilaton and moduli fields
predicted by string theory.
