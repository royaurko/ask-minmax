We investigate kilometer-scale field-aligned currents that were detected both
in the magnetospheric cusp at a few Earth radii altitude and in the ionosphere
by satellites that were, according to the Tsyganenko model, within a few tens
of kilometers and minutes on the same magnetic field line. Also thermosphere
up-welling that often accompanies the dayside field-aligned currents in the
inner cusp was seen. We used Cluster and CHAMP satellites, and searched for
conjunctions during the whole year of 2008, as then the Cluster spacecrafts
were mostly at mid-altitudes when crossing the cusps. We focus on two case
studies from this period. Evidence is presented that sheets of small scale
field-aligned current continue through the low altitude cusp and ionosphere.
The ionospheric current densities are not particularly strong, a few micro A/m2
at about 340 km, and several tens of nA/m2 at about 20000 km, implying that
these currents might be relatively common events, but are hard to detect due to
rareness of suitable locations of at least two satellites from different
missions.
