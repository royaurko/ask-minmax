The paper presents a slope stability analysis for a heterogeneous earthen
levee in Boston, UK, which is prone to occasional slope failures under tidal
loads. Dynamic behavior of the levee under tidal fluctuations was simulated
using a finite element model of variably saturated linear elastic perfectly
plastic soil. Hydraulic conductivities of the soil strata have been calibrated
according to piezometers readings, in order to obtain correct range of
hydraulic loads in tidal mode. Finite element simulation was complemented with
series of limit equilibrium analyses. Stability analyses have shown that slope
failure occurs with the development of a circular slip surface located in the
soft clay layer. Both models (FEM and LEM) confirm that the least stable
hydraulic condition is the combination of the minimum river levels at low tide
with the maximal saturation of soil layers. FEM results indicate that in winter
time the levee is almost at its limit state, at the margin of safety (strength
reduction factor values are 1.03 and 1.04 for the low-tide and high-tide
phases, respectively); these results agree with real-life observations. The
stability analyses have been implemented as real-time components integrated
into the UrbanFlood early warning system for flood protection.
