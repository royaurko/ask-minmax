The association between the Pencil nebula (RCW 37, NGC 2736), the Vela X-ray
fragment D/D' and the recently discovered new X-ray supernova remnant (RX
J0852.0-4622) in Vela is investigated. Recently published Chandra images of
D/D' are compared with optical images of RCW 37 and confirm the close
association of the two objects. New optical line profiles of RCW 37 from an
extended slit position passing through this unusual optical nebula are
presented. They reveal a partial velocity ellipse with expansion velocities of
around 120 km/s. Various scenarios for the origin of the nebula are considered
and the evidence of a link with RX J0852.0-4622 is reviewed. A funnel of gas
similar to those in the Crab and DEM34a SNRs is not ruled out but a more
plausible explanation may be that a `wavy sheet' is responsible. We suggest
that RX J0852.0-4622 is located within the older larger Vela SNR and that some
of the X-ray gas from RX J0852.0-4622 has collided with the dense HI wall of
the older remnant. This gives rise to the morphology and velocity structure of
the optical emission and explains the unusual X-ray emission from this portion
of the supernova remnant. If our hypothesis is correct, a distance prediction
of 250 +/- 30 pc can be made, based on recent measurements of the distance to
the old Vela SNR. This is at the lower end of the range of distances quoted in
the literature would confirm unusual nature of this young nearby supernova
remnant.
