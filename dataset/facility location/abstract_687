In a caching game introduced by Alpern et al., a Hider who can dig to a total
fixed depth normalized to $1$ buries a fixed number of objects among $n$
discrete locations. A Searcher who can dig to a total depth of $h$ searches the
locations with the aim of finding all of the hidden objects. If he does so, he
wins, otherwise the Hider wins. This zero-sum game is complicated to analyze
even for small values of its parameters, and for the case of $2$ hidden objects
has been completely solved only when the game is played in up to $3$ locations.
For some values of $h$ the solution of the game with $2$ objects hidden in $4$
locations is known, but the solution in the remaining cases was an open
question recently highlighted by Fokkink et al. Here we solve the remaining
cases of the game with $2$ objects hidden in $4$ locations. We also give some
more general results for the game, in particular showing that when there are
$2$ objects hidden in $n$ locations and $n \rightarrow \infty$, the value of
the game is asymptotically equal to $h/n$ for $h \ge n/2$.
