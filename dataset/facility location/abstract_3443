ALPHA is an international project that has recently begun experimentation at
CERN's Antiproton Decelerator (AD) facility. The primary goal of ALPHA is
stable trapping of cold antihydrogen atoms with the ultimate goal of precise
spectroscopic comparisons with hydrogen. We discuss the status of the ALPHA
project and the prospects for antihydrogen trapping.
