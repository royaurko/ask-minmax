Using neutron inelastic scattering, we investigate the low-energy spin
fluctuations in Fe1+xTe as a function of both temperature and interstitial iron
concentration. For Fe1.057(7)Te the magnetic structure is defined by a
commensurate wavevector of (1/2,0,1/2). The spin fluctuations are gapped with a
sharp onset at 7 meV and are three dimensional in momentum transfer, becoming
two dimensional at higher energy transfers. On doping with interstitial iron,
we find in Fe1.141(5)Te the ordering wavevector is located at the (0.38, 0,
1/2) position and the fluctuations are gapless with the intensity peaked at an
energy transfer of 4 meV. These results show that the spin fluctuations in the
Fe1+xTe system a can be tuned not only through selenium doping, but also with
interstitial iron. We also compare these results with superconducting
concentrations and in particular the resonance mode in the Fe_1+xTe_1-ySe_y
system.
