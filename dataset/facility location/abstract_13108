An Obstruction Avoidance Generously Mobility (OAGM) model has been introduced
for controlling ad-hoc sensor networks and thereby operating emerging fields
like military and healthcare services. According to this model, the ability to
send a message to a group of users simultaneously, based solely on their
geographic location, is desirable by using Mission Critical Mobility model that
assumes the obstacle shapes like rectangle or square in the simulation terrain.
The OAGM model is developed by grasping the critical situations of military and
healthcare services by incorporating the node movement model, hierarchical node
organization, placement of obstacle that affect the movement of nodes and also
signal propagation. Graph theory technique is used to find the shortest path of
the node movement process. The varying number of parameter sets with DSR
protocol is analyzed for MCM and OAGM mobility model. The results show OAGM
performance is better than MCM.
