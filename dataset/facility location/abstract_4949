We study the conformations of a self-avoiding polymer confined to a channel
by computing the cross-sectional distributions of the positions of its
monomers. By means of Monte-Carlo simulations for a self-avoiding,
freely-jointed chain we determine how the cross-sectional distribution for a
given monomer depends on its location in the polymer, and how strongly this
distribution is affected by self avoidance. To this end we analyze how the
frequency of intra-chain collisions between monomers depends on their spatial
position in the channel and on their location within the polymer. We show that
most collisions occur between closely neighboring monomers. As a consequence
the collision probability depends only weakly on the spatial position of the
monomers. Our results explain why the effect of self-avoidance on the monomer
distributions is weaker than predicted by mean-field theory. We discuss the
relevance of our results for studies of DNA conformations in nanofluidic
channels.
