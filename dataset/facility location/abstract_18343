We used a set of archived HST/WFPC2 images to probe the stellar population in
the core of the nearby Galactic Globular Cluster (GGC) 47 Tuc. From the
ultraviolet (UV) Color Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs) obtained for ~4,000 stars
detected within the Planetary Camera (PC) field of view we have pinpointed a
number of interesting objects:
  (i) 43 blue stragglers stars (BSSs) including 20 new candidates;
  (ii) 12 bright (young) cooling white dwarfs (WDs) at the extreme blue region
of the UV-CMD; (iii) a large population of UV-excess (UVE) stars, lying between
the BSS and the WD sequences. The WD candidates identified here define a clean
pattern in the CMD, which define the WD cooling sequence. Moreover, both the
location on the UV-CMDs and the number of WDs are in excellent agreement with
the theoretical expectations. The UVE stars discovered here represent the
largest population of anomalous blue objects ever observed in a globular
cluster -- if the existence of such a large population is confirmed, we have
finally found the long-searched population of interacting binaries predicted by
the theory. Finally, we have investigated the feasibility of the optical
identification of the companions of the binary X-ray sources recently detected
by CHANDRA and of binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) residing in the core of 47
Tuc. Unfortunately, the extreme faintness expected for the MSP companions
together with the huge stellar crowding in the cluster center prevent
statistically reliable identifications based only on positional coincidences.
