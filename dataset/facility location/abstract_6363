We study the `local entanglement' remaining after filtering operations
corresponding to imperfect measurements performed by one or both parties, such
that the parties can only determine whether or not the system is located in
some region of space. The local entanglement in pure states of general
bipartite multidimensional continuous-variable systems can be completely
determined through simple expressions. We apply our approach to semiclassical
WKB systems, multi-dimensional harmonic oscillators, and a hydrogen atom as
three examples.
