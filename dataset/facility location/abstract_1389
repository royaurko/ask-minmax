We examine the foraging behavior of stingless bees (Tetragonula biroi Friese)
with regard to their preference of food location. The three factors considered
are distance of the food source from the hive, direction of the food source,
and height of the food source from the ground. Single-factor experiments for
each factor were performed to determine the preferred food location.
Statistical analysis shows that T. biroi species prefer the feeders located 1m
away from the hive, which is the shortest distance used in the experiment.
Results also show that this group of bees has no conclusive preferred
direction, which might be a result of non-apparent cause, such as random
search. In addition, the bees prefer the feeders located 1m above the ground,
which are directly in front of the hive opening. Using the results from the
single-factor experiments, a Three-Factor Factorial Experimental Design is used
to analyze the interaction of the three factors. Factorial Analysis of Variance
shows that the interaction among the three factors affects the preference of
the bees. We hypothesize that the preference of the bees can be explained by
(1) optimal foraging theory, (2) memory of food location, and (3) chemical
marks left by conspecifics.
