We examine the benefits of performing a joint LIGO--Virgo search for
transient signals. We do this by adding burst and inspiral signals to 24 hours
of simulated detector data. We find significant advantages to performing a
joint coincidence analysis, above either a LIGO only or Virgo only search.
These include an increased detection efficiency, at a fixed false alarm rate,
to both burst and inspiral events and an ability to reconstruct the sky
location of a signal.
