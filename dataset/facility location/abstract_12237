A quantitative study was performed to investigate the impact of
crystallographic dislocation defects, 21 including screw dislocation, basal
plane dislocation, and threading edge dislocation, and their locations in 22
active and JTE region, on the reverse performance of 4H-SiC p-n diodes. It was
found that higher leakage 23 current in diodes is associated with basal plane
dislocations, while lower breakdown voltage is attributed to 24 screw
dislocations. The above influence increases in severity when the dislocation is
in the active region than 25 in the JTE region. Furthermore, due to the
closed-core nature, the impact of threading edge dislocation on the 26 reverse
performance of the p-n diodes is less severe than that of other dislocations
although its density is 27 much higher.
