The electric field applied perpendicularly to smectic layers breaks the
rotational symmetry of the system. Consequently, the elastic energy associated
with distortions induced by an edge dislocation diverges logarithmically with
the size of the system. In freely suspended smectic films the dislocations in
the absence of the electric field are located exactly in the middle of the
film. The electric field above a certain critical value can shift them towards
the surface. This critical field squared is a linear function of the surface
tension and is inversly proportional to the thickness of the film. The
equilibrium location of a dislocation in the smectic film subjected to the
field is also calculated.
