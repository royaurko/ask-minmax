We construct new, efficient, and accurate high-order finite differencing
operators which satisfy summation by parts. Since these operators are not
uniquely defined, we consider several optimization criteria: minimizing the
bandwidth, the truncation error on the boundary points, the spectral radius, or
a combination of these. We examine in detail a set of operators that are up to
tenth order accurate in the interior, and we surprisingly find that a
combination of these optimizations can improve the operators' spectral radius
and accuracy by orders of magnitude in certain cases. We also construct
high-order dissipation operators that are compatible with these new finite
difference operators and which are semi-definite with respect to the
appropriate summation by parts scalar product. We test the stability and
accuracy of these new difference and dissipation operators by evolving a
three-dimensional scalar wave equation on a spherical domain consisting of
seven blocks, each discretized with a structured grid, and connected through
penalty boundary conditions.
