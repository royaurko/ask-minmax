In this brief note we repeat an earlier calculation of the Fourier
transformed scanning tunneling spectra of the $d$-density wave (DDW) phase
using a different band structure, which is more realistic and consistent with
the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data. We note that four
peaks, which used to be located at $(\pm \pi/4,0)$ and $(0, \pm \pi/4)$, are
still present, but at positive energies their wavevectors shift to the
neighborhood of $(\pm 2 \pi/5,0)$, $(0, \pm 2\pi/5)$ and slowly disperse with
energy. The implications for the sensitivity with respect to the band structure
are discussed.
