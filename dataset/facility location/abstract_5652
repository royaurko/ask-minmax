Recent analysis of the distribution of clusters of galaxies is reviewed.
Clusters of galaxies located in rich superclusters form a quasiregular lattice
with a step size 120 Mpc. The power spectrum of clusters of galaxies has a
sharp peak at the same wavelength. The matter power spectrum is compared with
angular spectrum of background radiation for a wide variety of cosmological
parameters. It is shown that the peaked spectrum is in agreement with CMB data.
The peak in the power spectrum may be due to processes during the inflationary
stage of the structure evolution.
