We present a physically motivated parametrization of the chiral-even
generalized parton distributions in the non-singlet sector obtained from a
global analysis using a set of available experimental data. Our analysis is
valid in the kinematical region of intermediate Bjorken $x$ and for $Q^2$ in
the multi-GeV region which is accessible at present and currently planned
facilities. Relevant data included in our fit are from the nucleon elastic form
factors measurements, from deep inelastic scattering experiments. Additional
information provided by lattice calculations of the higher moments of
generalized parton distributions, is also considered. Recently extracted
observables from Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering on the nucleon are
reproduced by our fit.
