We demonstrate plasmon assisted energy transfer between two fluorophores
located at distances up to $7\; \mu$m on the top of a thin silver film. Thanks
to the strong confinement and large propagation length of surface plasmon
polaritons, the range of the energy transfer is almost two orders of magnitude
larger than the values reported in the literature so far. The parameters
driving the energy transfer range are thoroughly characterized and are in very
good agreement with theoretically expected values. This work shows the
potential of plasmonic structures for efficient long-range energy transfer and
opens rich perspectives for the study of collective emission phenomena.
