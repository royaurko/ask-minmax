In CLEAN (Cryogenic Low Energy Astrophysics with Noble gases), a proposed
neutrino and dark matter detector, background discrimination is possible if one
can determine the location of an ionizing radiation event with high accuracy.
We simulate ionizing radiation events that produce multiple scintillation
photons within a spherical detection volume filled with liquid neon. We
estimate the radial location of a particular ionizing radiation event based on
the observed count data corresponding to that event. The count data are
collected by detectors mounted at the spherical boundary of the detection
volume. We neglect absorption, but account for Rayleigh scattering. To account
for wavelength-shifting of the scintillation light, we assume that photons are
absorbed and re-emitted at the detectors. Here, we develop spatial Maximum
Likelihood methods for event reconstruction, and study their performance in
computer simulation experiments. We also study a method based on the centroid
of the observed count data. We calibrate our estimates based on training data.
