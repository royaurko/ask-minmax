We study QCD with two Dirac fermions in the adjoint representation at finite
temperature by Monte Carlo simulations.In such a theory the deconfinement and
chiral phase transitions occur at different temperatures. We locate the second
order chiral transition point at beta_c=5.624(2) and show that the scaling
behaviour of the chiral condensate in the vicinity of beta_c is in full
agreeement with that of the 3d O(2) universality class, and to a smaller extent
comparable to the 3d O(6) class. From the previously determined first order
deconfinement transition point beta_d=5.236(3) and the two-loop beta function
we find the ratio T_c/T_d = 7.8(2). In the region between the two phase
transitions we explicitly confirm the quark mass dependence of the chiral
condensate which is expected due to the existence of Goldstone modes like in 3d
O(N) spin models. At the deconfinement transition the condensate shows a gap,
and below beta_d, it is nearly mass-independent for fixed beta.
