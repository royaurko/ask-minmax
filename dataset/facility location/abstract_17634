We present an analysis of the olivine-rich exposures at Bellicia and Arruntia
craters using Dawn Framing Camera (FC) color data. Our results confirm the
existence of olivine-rich materials at these localities as described by
Ammannito et al. (2013a) using Visual Infrared Spectrometer (VIR) data.
Analyzing laboratory spectra of various Howardite-Eucrite-Diogenite meteorites,
high-Ca pyroxenes, olivines and olivine-orthopyroxene mixtures, we derive three
FC spectral band parameters that are indicators of olivine-rich materials.
Combining the three band parameters allows us, for the first time, to reliably
identify sites showing modal olivine contents >40%. The olivine-rich exposures
at Bellicia and Arruntia are mapped using higher spatial resolution FC data.
The exposures are located on the slopes of outer/inner crater walls, on the
floor of Arruntia, in the ejecta, as well as in nearby fresh small impact
craters. The spatial extent of the exposures ranges from a few hundred meters
to few kilometers. The olivine-rich exposures are in accordance with both the
magma ocean and the serial magmatism model (e.g., Righter and Drake 1997;
Yamaguchi et al. 1997). However, it remains unsolved why the olivine-rich
materials are mainly concentrated in the northern hemisphere (~36-42{\deg} N,
46-74{\deg} E) and are almost absent in the Rheasilvia basin.
