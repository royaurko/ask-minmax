We present high-resolution, H-band, imaging observations, collected with
Subaru/HiCIAO, of the scattered light from the transitional disk around SAO
206462 (HD 135344B). Although previous sub-mm imagery suggested the existence
of the dust-depleted cavity at r~46AU, our observations reveal the presence of
scattered light components as close as 0.2" (~28AU) from the star. Moreover, we
have discovered two small-scale spiral structures lying within 0.5" (~70AU). We
present models for the spiral structures using the spiral density wave theory,
and derive a disk aspect ratio of h~0.1, which is consistent with previous
sub-mm observations. This model can potentially give estimates of the
temperature and rotation profiles of the disk based on dynamical processes,
independently from sub-mm observations. It also predicts the evolution of the
spiral structures, which can be observable on timescales of 10-20 years,
providing conclusive tests of the model. While we cannot uniquely identify the
origin of these spirals, planets embedded in the disk may be capable of
exciting the observed morphology. Assuming that this is the case, we can make
predictions on the locations and, possibly, the masses of the unseen planets.
Such planets may be detected by future multi-wavelengths observations.
