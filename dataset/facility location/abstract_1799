We use multiple scattering theory to evaluate the $Q^{2}$ dependence
 of the forward-backward asymmetry, $A_{z}$, of the missing momentum
distribution in quasielstic $A(e,e'p)$ scattering, which is expected to be
affected by color transparency. The novel features of our analysis are a
consistent treatment of the structure of the ejectile state formed after
absorption of the virtual photon by the struck proton and a careful evaluation
of the background asymmetry induced by the nonvanishing real part of the
proton-nucleon scattering amplitude. We find that the absolute magnitude of
$A_{z}$ is dominated by this background at the $Q^{2}$'s attainable at the
Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility. However, the $Q^{2}$ dependence
of the asymmetry is sensitive to the onset of color transparency, whose
observation in high statistics experiments appears to be feasible, particularly
using light targets such as $^{12}C$ or $^{16}O$.
