The effects of two hurricanes (Katrina and Wilma) on protected mangroves in
southwest Florida and two hurricanes (Emily and Dean) on protected mangroves in
the Yucatan Peninsula were assessed paired sets of 20m multispectral SPOT and
16-day 500m MODIS images. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and
enhanced vegetation index (EVI) values were calculated to measure mangrove
canopy reflectance using three methods of analysis- 1) mangrove NDVI sample
point extraction, 2) qualitative assessment of 500m MODIS NDVI and EVI time
series, and 3) transects of NDVI differences before and after storm events.
Results show each method effectively captures changes in mangrove canopies
consistent with storm effects. However, the extent of damage to mangroves in
South Florida and Sian Ka'an was highly variable. Hurricanes Wilma and Katrina
produced a large drop in NDVI although NDVI values recovered within a year,
suggesting remarkable resilience. Hurricane Emily apparently increased mangrove
photosynthetic activity owing to the location of landfall relative to the study
area, the size of the wind field and the apparent lack of storm surge.
Comparison of SPOT NDVI and MODIS NDVI values revealed that the changes pre-
and post-storms were consistent at the different scales of observation.
