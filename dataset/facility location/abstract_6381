Chia and Nakano (2009) introduced the concept of M-decomposability of
probability densities in one-dimension. In this paper, we generalize
M-decomposability to any dimension. We prove that all elliptical unimodal
densities are M-undecomposable. We also derive an inequality to show that it is
better to represent an M-decomposable density via a mixture of unimodal
densities. Finally, we demonstrate the application of M-decomposability to
clustering and kernel density estimation, using real and simulated data. Our
results show that M-decomposability can be used as a non-parametric criterion
to locate modes in probability densities.
