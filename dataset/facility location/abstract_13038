We use density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the electronic
structure and chemical properties of gold nanoparticles. Different structural
families of clusters are compared. For up to 60 atoms we optimize structures
using DFT-based simulated annealing. Cluster geometries are found to distort
considerably, creating large band gaps at the Fermi level. For up to 200 atoms
we consider structures generated with a simple EMT potential and clusters based
on cuboctahedra and icosahedra. All types of cluster geometry exhibit
jellium-like electronic shell structure. We calculate adsorption energies of
several atoms on the cuboctahedral clusters. Adsorption energies are found to
vary abruptly at magic numbers. Using a Newns-Anderson model we find that the
effect of magic numbers on adsorption energy can be understood from the
location of adsorbate-induced states with respect to the cluster Fermi level.
