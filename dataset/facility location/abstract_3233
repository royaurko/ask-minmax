The realization that GRBs release a constant amount of energy implies that
the post jet-break afterglow evolution would be largely universal. For a given
redshift all afterglows should be detected up to a fixed observer angle. We
estimate the observed magnitude and the implied detectability of orphan
afterglows. We show that for reasonable limiting magnitudes ($m_{lim}=25$)
orphan afterglows would typically be detected from small ($\sim 10^\circ$)
angles away from the GRB jet axis. A detected orphan afterglow would generally
correspond to a "near-miss" of the GRB whose jet was pointing just slightly
away from us. With our most optimistic parameters we expect that 15 orphan
afterglows will be recorded in the SDSS and 35 transients will be recorded in a
dedicated 2m class telescope operating full time for a year in an orphan
afterglow search. The rate is smaller by a factor of 15 for our "canonical"
parameters. We show that for a given facility an optimal survey should be
shallower, covering larger area rather than deeper. The limiting magnitude
should not be, however, lower than $\sim$ 23rd as in this case more transients
from on-axis GRBs will be discovered than orphan afterglows. About 15% of the
transients could be discovered with a second exposure of the same area provided
that it follows after 3, 4 and 8 days for $m_{lim}=23$, 25 and 27.
