In this letter we report on the accuracy of the attitude, misalignment, orbit
and time correlation which are used to perform scientific analyses of the
INTEGRAL data. The boresight attitude during science pointings has an accuracy
of 3 arcsec. At the center of the field, the misalignments have been calibrated
leading to a location accuracy of 4 to 40 arcsec for the different instruments.
The spacecraft position is known within 10 meters. The relative timing between
instruments could be reconstructed within 10 microsec and the absolute timing
within 40 microsec.
