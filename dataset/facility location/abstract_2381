2D and 3D numerical simulations with the adaptive mesh refinement Eulerian
radiation-hydrocode RAGE at unprecedented spatial resolution are used to
investigate the connection between drive asymmetry and the generation of
turbulence in the DT fuel in a simplified inertial-confinement fusion (ICF)
implosion. Long-wavelength deviations from spherical symmetry in the pressure
drive lead to the generation of coherent vortical structures in the DT gas and
it is the three-dimensional instability of these structures that in turn leads
to turbulence and mix. The simulations sug-gest that this mechanism may be an
additional important source of mix in ICF implosions. Applications to target
ignition at the National Ignition Facility are briefly discussed.
