The ^18F(p, alpha)^15O reaction is recognized as one of the most important
reaction for nova gamma-ray astronomy as it governs the early =< 511 keV
emission. However, its rate remains largely uncertain at nova temperatures due
to unknown low-energy resonance strengths. In order to better constrain this
reaction rate, we have studied the one-nucleon transfer reaction, D(^18F,p
alpha)^15N, at the CRC-RIB facility at Louvain La Neuve.
