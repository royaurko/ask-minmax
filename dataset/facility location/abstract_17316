Consider a multiuser system where an arbitrary number of users communicate
with a distributed receive array over independent Rayleigh fading paths. The
receive array performs minimum mean squared error (MMSE) or zero forcing (ZF)
combining and perfect channel state information is assumed at the receiver.
This scenario is well-known and exact analysis is possible when the receive
antennas are located in a single array. However, when the antennas are
distributed, the individual links all have different average signal to noise
ratio (SNRs) and this is a much more challenging problem. In this paper, we
provide approximate distributions for the output SNR of a ZF receiver and the
output signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of an MMSE receiver. In
addition, simple high SNR approximations are provided for the symbol error rate
(SER) of both receivers assuming M-PSK or M-QAM modulations. These high SNR
results provide array gain and diversity gain information as well as a
remarkably simple functional link between performance and the link powers.
