The stellar content of the Im galaxy NGC 2366 is discussed on the basis of
CCD BVR photometry. The three brightest blue and red stars have been used to
estimate its distance, obtaining a balue of 2.9 Mpc. The spatial distribution
of the young stellar population is discussed in the light of the integrated
color indices and the color-magnitude diagrams of different zones of the
galaxy. A generalized star formation burst seems to have taken place about 50
Myr ago. The youngest stars are preferentially formed in the South-West part of
the bar, where the giant HII complex NGC 2363 is located, being younger and
bluer. The bar seems to play a role favouring star formation in one of its
extremes. Self-propagation however, does not seem to be triggering star
formation at large scale. A small region, populated by very young stars has
also been found at the East of the galaxy.
