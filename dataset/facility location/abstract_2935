Many localization algorithms and systems have been developed by means of
wireless sensor networks for both indoor and outdoor environments. To achieve
higher localization accuracy, extra hardware equipments are utilized by most of
the existing localization solutions, which increase the cost and considerably
limit the location-based applications. The Internet of Things (IOT) integrates
many technologies, such as Internet, Zigbee, Bluetooth, infrared, WiFi, GPRS,
3G, etc, which can enable different ways to obtain the location information of
various objects. Location-based service is a primary service of the IOT, while
localization accuracy is a key issue. In this paper, a higher accuracy
localization scheme is proposed which can effectively satisfy diverse
requirements for many indoor and outdoor location services. The proposed scheme
composes of two phases: 1) partition phase, in which the target region is split
into small grids; 2) localization refinement phase, in which a higher accuracy
of localization can be obtained by applying an algorithm designed in the paper.
A trial system is set up to verify correctness of the proposed scheme and
furthermore to illustrate its feasibility and availability. The experimental
results show that the proposed scheme can improve the localization accuracy.
