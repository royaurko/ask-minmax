We present a method of analyzing a set of N time signals f_i(t) that consist
of local measurements of the same physical observable taken at N sequential
locations Z_i along the length of an experimental device. The result is an
algorithm for reconstructing an approximation F(z,t) of the field f(z,t) in the
inaccessible regions between the points of measurement. We also explore the
conditions needed for this approximation to hold, and test the algorithm under
a variety of conditions. We apply this method to analyze the magnetic field
measurements taken on the Compact Toroid Injection eXperiment (CTIX) plasma
accelerator; providing a direct means of visualizing experimental data,
quantifying global properties, and benchmarking simulation.
