We present results from the spectral analysis of the Seyfert 1.9 galaxy
MCG-5-23-16, based on ASCA, BeppoSAX, Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. The
spectrum of this object shows a complex iron Kalpha emission line, which is
best modeled by a superposition of a narrow and a broad (possibly relativistic)
iron line, together with a Compton reflection component. Comparing results from
all (six) available observations, we do not find any significant variation in
the flux of both line components. The moderate flux continuum variability
(about 25% difference between the brightest and faintest states), however, does
not permit us to infer much about the location of the line-emitting material.
The amount of Compton reflection is lower than expected from the total iron
line EW, implying either an iron overabundance or that one of the two line
components (most likely the narrow one) originates in Compton-thin matter.
