Determinantal point processes on a compact complex manifold X are considered
in the limit of many particles. The correlation kernels of the processes are
the Bergman kernels associated to a a high power of a given Hermitian
holomorphic line bundle L over X. It is shown that the defining random measure
on X of the process, describing the particle locations, converges in
probability towards a pluripotential equilibrium measure, expressed as a
Monge-Ampere measure. Its smooth fluctuations in the bulk are shown to be
asymptotically normal and the limiting variance is explicitly computed. A
scaling limit of the correlation functions is shown to be universal and
expressed in terms of (the higher dimensional analog of) the Ginibre ensemble.
This setting applies in particular to normal random matrix ensembles and
multivariate orthogonal polynomials. Relation to phase transitions, direct
image bundles and tunneling of ground state fermions in strong magnetic fields
(i.e. exponentially small eigenvalues of the Dolbeault Laplacian) are also
explored.
