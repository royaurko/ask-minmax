As a nonperturbative check on the Q-exact lattice formulation, we demonstrate
that the continuum R-symmetries are recovered. We locate the critical domain of
the lattice theory. Aspects of the continuum nonrenormalization theorems are
found to be respected at finite lattice spacing. Preliminary attempts to
extract critical exponents--another nonperturbative check--are discussed. All
of our results are obtained from Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical
fermions.
