Recently, result diversification has attracted a lot of attention as a means
to improve the quality of results retrieved by user queries. In this paper, we
propose a new, intuitive definition of diversity called DisC diversity. A DisC
diverse subset of a query result contains objects such that each object in the
result is represented by a similar object in the diverse subset and the objects
in the diverse subset are dissimilar to each other. We show that locating a
minimum DisC diverse subset is an NP-hard problem and provide heuristics for
its approximation. We also propose adapting DisC diverse subsets to a different
degree of diversification. We call this operation zooming. We present efficient
implementations of our algorithms based on the M-tree, a spatial index
structure, and experimentally evaluate their performance.
