The dilute magnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As is ferromagnetic in accordance
with the p-d Zener model. Hole density function (HDF) localization has been
previously studied by means of the density functional theory (DFT) and
non-standard DFT methods; however not for dopings near 1%. We have revised
(Ga,Mn)As using the DFT with the pseudopotential self-interaction correction
(pSIC) and maximally-localized Wannier functions (MLWFs), which show the sp3
character of a HDF. Nature of HDF is extended - for low dopings and the pSIC,
70% of the HDF is located within the inter-impurities region, and contribution
of the 3d-Mn states is 3-5% for 1-3% of Mn with the pSIC, and 11% with the DFT.
We found that for dopings below 1%, the spin-unpolarized s-type impurity states
segregate from the conduction band to the energy gap - in contrast to earlier
publications. This implies that donor co-doped dilute samples would be both
insulating and nonmagnetic.
