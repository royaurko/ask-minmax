The new form of the C-metric proposed by Hong and Teo, in which the two
structure functions are factorised, has proved useful in its analysis. In this
paper, we extend this form to the case when a cosmological constant is present.
The new form of this solution has two structure functions which are partially
factorised; moreover, the roots of the structure functions are now regarded as
fundamental parameters. This leads to a natural representation of the solution
in terms of its so-called domain structure, in which the allowed coordinate
range can be visualised as a "box" in a two-dimensional plot. The solution is
then completely parameterised by the locations of the edges of this box, at
least in the uncharged case. We also briefly analyse other possible domain
structures---in the shape of a triangle and trapezoid---that might describe
physically interesting space-times within the AdS C-metric.
