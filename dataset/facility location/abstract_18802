Progress on six dimensional ionization muon cooling with relatively small
rings of magnets is described. Lattices being explored include scaling sector
cyclotrons with edge focusing and strong focusing, fixed field alternating
gradient (FFAG) rings. Ionization cooling is provided by high pressure hydrogen
gas which removes both transverse and longitudinal momentum. Lost longitudinal
momentum is replaced using radio frequency (RF) cavities, giving a net
transverse emittance reduction. The longer path length in the hydrogen of
higher momentum muons decreases longitudinal emittance at the expense of
transverse emittance. Thus emittance exchange allows these rings to cool in all
six dimensions and not just transversely. Alternatively, if the RF is located
after the ring, it may be possible to cool the muons by stopping them as they
spiral adiabatically into a central swarm. As momentum goes to zero, the
momentum spread goes to zero. The resulting cooled muons can lead to an intense
muon beam which could be a source for neutrino factories or muon colliders.
