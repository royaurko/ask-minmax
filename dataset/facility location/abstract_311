This report is the second of two addenda to the CLOUD proposal at CERN
(physics/0104048), which aims to test experimentally the existence a link
between cosmic rays and cloud formation, and to understand the microphysical
mechanism. The document places CLOUD in the framework of a CERN facility for
atmospheric research, and provides further details on the particle beam
requirements.
