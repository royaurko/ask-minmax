The 2-flavor Polyakov-loop extended model is generalized by taking into
account the effective four-quark vector-type interaction with the coupling
strengths, which are endowed with a dependence on the Polyakov field $\Phi$.
The effective vertex generates entanglement interaction between the Polyakov
loop and the chiral condensate. We investigate the influence of an additional
quark vector interaction and the entanglement interaction on the location of
the critical end-point at the given chemical potential or quark density. It is
shown that the finite value of the vector interaction strength $G_{\rm v}$
improves the model agreement with the lattice data. The influence of the
non-zero $G_{\rm v}$ and entanglement on the thermodynamic observables and the
curvature of the crossover boundary in the $T-\mu$ plane is also examined.
