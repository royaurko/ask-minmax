We briefly describe the LANNDD 70-kT liquid argon TPC proposal for the WIPP
underground facility at Carlsbad, New Mexico. We, then, identify the key
backgrounds for the search for p -> K+ nu_bar to 10^35 years lifetime. The most
serious non-neutrino background is due to high-energy neutrons producing
strange particles in the detector. We show that this can be reduced to an
acceptable level by appropriate fiducial volume cuts.
