With more than four billion usage of cellular phones worldwide, mobile
advertising has become an attractive alternative to online advertisements. In
this paper, we propose a new targeted advertising policy for Wireless Service
Providers (WSPs) via SMS or MMS- namely {\em AdCell}. In our model, a WSP
charges the advertisers for showing their ads. Each advertiser has a valuation
for specific types of customers in various times and locations and has a limit
on the maximum available budget. Each query is in the form of time and location
and is associated with one individual customer. In order to achieve a
non-intrusive delivery, only a limited number of ads can be sent to each
customer. Recently, new services have been introduced that offer location-based
advertising over cellular network that fit in our model (e.g., ShopAlerts by
AT&T) .
  We consider both online and offline version of the AdCell problem and develop
approximation algorithms with constant competitive ratio. For the online
version, we assume that the appearances of the queries follow a stochastic
distribution and thus consider a Bayesian setting. Furthermore, queries may
come from different distributions on different times. This model generalizes
several previous advertising models such as online secretary problem
\cite{HKP04}, online bipartite matching \cite{KVV90,FMMM09} and AdWords
\cite{saberi05}. ...
