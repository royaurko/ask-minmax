We study the radial distribution of stars of different stellar generations in
the globular cluster NGC 3201. From recently published multicolour photometry,
a radial dependence of the location of stars on the giant branch was found. We
coupled the photometric information to our sample of 100 red giants with Na, O
abundances and known classification as first or second-generation stars. We
find that giants stars of the second generation in NGC 3201 show a tendency to
be more centrally concentrated than stars of the first generation, supporting
less robust results from our spectroscopic analysis.
