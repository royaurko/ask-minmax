We use an existing laboratory facility for space hardware calibration in
vacuum to study the impact of energetic ions on water ice. The experiment is
intended to simulate the conditions on the surface of Jupiter's icy moons. We
present first results of ion sputtering in a sample of porous ice, including
the first experimental results for sulphur ion sputtering of ice. The results
confirm theoretical predictions and extrapolations from previous sputtering
experiments obtained at different impact angles for non-porous water ice.
