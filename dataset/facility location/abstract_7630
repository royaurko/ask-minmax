A procedure avoiding any integration of the null geodesic equations is used
to derive the direction of light propagation in a three-parameter family of
static, spherically symmetric spacetimes within the post-post-Minkowskian
approximation. Quasi-Cartesian isotropic coordinates adapted to the symmetries
of spacetime are systematically used. It is found that the expression of the
angle formed by two light rays as measured by a static observer staying at a
given point is remarkably simple in these coordinates. The attention is mainly
focused on the null geodesic paths that we call the "quasi-Minkowskian light
rays". The vector-like functions characterizing the direction of propagation of
such light rays at their points of emission and reception are firstly obtained
in the generic case where these points are both located at a finite distance
from the centre of symmetry. The direction of propagation of the
quasi-Minkowskian light rays emitted at infinity is then straightforwardly
deduced. An intrinsic definition of the gravitational deflection angle relative
to a static observer located at a finite distance is proposed for these rays.
The expression inferred from this definition extends the formula currently used
in VLBI astrometry up to the second order in the gravitational constant G.
