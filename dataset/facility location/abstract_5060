We present a numerical strategy to design fiber based dual pulse light
sources exhibiting two predefined spectral peaks in the anomalous group
velocity dispersion regime. The frequency conversion is based on the soliton
fission and soliton self-frequency shift occurring during supercontinuum
generation. The optimization process is carried out by a genetic algorithm that
provides the optimum input pulse parameters: wavelength, temporal width and
peak power. This algorithm is implemented in a Grid platform in order to take
advantage of distributed computing. These results are useful for optical
coherence tomography applications where bell-shaped pulses located in the
second near-infrared window are needed.
