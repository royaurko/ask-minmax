HST images (WFC2) of \pks show that this luminous nearby quasar is
interacting with diffuse (presumably galactic) material. Two thin wisps that
have a total extent of about 20 kpc (for $H_0 = 100$ \kms ${\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and
$\Omega_0 = 1.0$) are observed to approximately surround the quasar. One of the
wisps appears to pass through a companion galaxy that is located at a projected
distance of three~kpc from the center of the quasar light. The companion
galaxy, if located at the distance of \pks, has an intrinsic size and
luminosity similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud. A faint extended nebulosity,
which is detected over a region of 35 kpc by 50 kpc and is centered about 5 kpc
from the quasar nucleus, overlaps the wisps. The immediate environment of \pks
is different from the enivronments of the other eight luminous quasars that we
have studied previously with HST. If the multiple light components of the HST
images are fit to a single de~Vaucouleurs profile, as was done in previous
analyses of ground--based data, then the result obtained for the total
luminosity of the model galaxy is in agreement with the earlier ground-based
studies.
