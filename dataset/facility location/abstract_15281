Morphological disturbances and gas kinematics of the SB0 galaxy NGC 7679=Arp
216 are investigated to get clues to the history of this highly composite
object, where AGN and starburst signatures dominate each other in the X-ray and
optical/IR regime, respectively. Perturbations of the ionized gas velocity
field appear quite mild within 15'' (~5 kpc) from the center, so as it can be
straightforwardly modeled as a circularly rotating disk. On the contrary,
outside that radius, significant disturbances show up. In particular, the
eastern distorted arm as well as the huge neutral hydrogen bridge connecting
NGC 7679 with the nearby Seyfert spiral NGC 7682 unambiguously represent the
vestige of a close encounter of the two objects dating back ~500 Myr ago. The
relationship of such past event with the much more recent, centrally located
starburst (not older than 20 Myr) cannot be easily established. Altogether, the
classification of NGC 7679, turns out to be less extreme than that proposed in
the past, being simply a (disturbed) galaxy where starburst and AGN activity
cohexist with a starburst dominating the bolometric luminosity.
