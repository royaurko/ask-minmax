We give a brief overview of time dilation tests using high-resolution laser
spectroscopy at heavy-ion storage rings. We reflect on the various methods used
to eliminate the first-order Doppler effect and on the pitfalls encountered,
and comment on possible extensions at future facilities providing relativistic
heavy ion beams at $\gamma \gg 1$.
