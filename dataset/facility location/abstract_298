The MACHO Project generated two-color photometric lightcurves for 73 million
stars in the LMC, SMC, and the galactic bulge during its 8 years of observing.
This photometry, along with all images and a catalog of LMC variable stars, is
now available for viewing or download from the MACHO Project websites,
http://wwwmacho.anu.edu.au/ or http://wwwmacho.mcmaster.ca/ . The capabilities
and organization of the new data retrieval facility is described in this paper.
