The annihilation of proton and antiproton to electron-positron pair,
including radiative corrections due to the emission of virtual and real photons
is considered. The results are generalized to leading and next-to leading
approximations. The relevant distributions are derived and numerical
applications are given in the kinematical range accessible to the PANDA
experiment at the FAIR facility.
