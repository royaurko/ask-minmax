We observed 64 newly identified galactic bulge planetary nebulae in the radio
continuum at 3 and 6 cm with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We present
their radio images, positions, flux densities, and angular sizes. The survey
appears to have detected a larger ratio of more extended planetary nebulae with
low surface brightness than in previous surveys. We calculated their distances
according to Van de Steene & Zijlstra (1995). We find that most of the new
sample is located on the near side around the galactic center and closer in
than the previously known bulge PNe. Based on H-alpha images and spectroscopic
data, we calculated the total H-alpha flux. We compare this flux value with the
radio flux density and derive the extinction. We confirm that the distribution
of the extinction values around the galactic center rises toward the center, as
expected.
