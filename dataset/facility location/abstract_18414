The gamma-ray blazar PKS 1510-089 has a highly superluminal milli-arcsecond
jet at a position angle (PA) of -28 degrees and an arcsecond jet with an
initial PA of 155 degrees. With a PA difference of 177 degrees between the
arcsecond and milli-arcsecond jets, PKS 1510-089 is perhaps the most highly
misaligned radio jet ever observed and serves as a graphic example of
projection effects in a highly beamed relativistic jet. Here we present the
results of observations designed to bridge the gap between the milli-arcsecond
and arcsecond scales. We find that a previously detected ``counter-feature'' to
the arcsecond jet is directly fed by the milli-arcsecond jet. This feature is
located 0.3" from the core, corresponding to a de-projected distance of 30
kiloparsecs. The feature appears to be dominated by shocked emission and has an
almost perfectly ordered magnetic field along its outside edge. We conclude
that it is most likely a shocked bend, viewed end-on, where the jet crosses our
line of sight to form the southern arcsecond jet. While the bend appears to be
nearly 180 degrees when viewed in projection, we estimate the intrinsic bending
angle to be between 12 and 24 degrees. The cause of the bend is uncertain;
however, we favor a scenario where the jet is bent after it departs the galaxy,
either by ram pressure due to winds in the intracluster medium or simply by the
density gradient in the transition to the intergalactic medium.
