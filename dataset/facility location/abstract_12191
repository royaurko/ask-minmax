A single target is hidden at a location chosen from a predetermined
probability distribution. Then, a searcher must find a second probability
distribution from which random search points are sampled such that the target
is found in the minimum number of trials. Here it will be shown that if the
searcher must get very close to the target to find it, then the best search
distribution is proportional to the square root of the target distribution. For
a Gaussian target distribution, the optimum search distribution is
approximately a Gaussian with a standard deviation that varies inversely with
how close the searcher must be to the target to find it. For a network, where
the searcher randomly samples nodes and looks for the fixed target along edges,
the optimum is to either sample a node with probability proportional to the
square root of the out degree plus one or not at all.
