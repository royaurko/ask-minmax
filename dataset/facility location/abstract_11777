Using the density functional theory, we perform a full atomic relaxation of
the bulk ferrite with 12.5%-concentration of monoatomic interstitial Cr
periodically located at the edges of the bcc Fe$_\alpha$ cell. We show that
structural relaxation in such artificially engineered alloys leads to
significant atomic displacements and results in the formation of novel highly
stable configurations with parallel chains of octahedrically arranged Fe. The
enhanced magnetic polarization in the low-symmetry metallic state of this type
of alloys can be externally controlled by additional inclusion of nonmagnetic
impurities like nitrogen. We discuss possible applications of generated
interstitial alloys in spintronic devices and propose to consider them as a
basis of novel durable types of stainless steels.
