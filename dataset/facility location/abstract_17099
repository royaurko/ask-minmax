We discuss an approach to obtaining black hole quasinormal modes (QNMs) using
the asymptotic iteration method (AIM), initially developed to solve second
order ordinary differential equations. We introduce the standard version of
this method and present an improvement more suitable for numerical
implementation. We demonstrate that the AIM can be used to find radial QNMs for
Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) and Kerr black holes in a unified way.
An advantage of the AIM over the standard continued fraction method (CFM) is
that for differential equations with more than three regular singular points
Gaussian eliminations are not required. However, the convergence of the AIM
depends on the location of the radial or angular position, choosing the best
such position in general remains an open problem. This review presents for the
first time the spin 0, 1/2 & 2 QNMs of a Kerr black hole and the gravitational
and electromagnetic QNMs of the RN black hole calculated via the AIM, and
confirms results previously obtained using the CFM. We also presents some new
results comparing the AIM to the WKB method. Finally we emphasize that the AIM
is well suited to higher dimensional generalizations and we give an example of
doubly rotating black holes.
