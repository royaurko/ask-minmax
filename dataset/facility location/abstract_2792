To explain \eta-distributions at RHIC energies we consider the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. To account for hadrons produced in the central
region, we assume existence of third source located there (y \approx 0) in
addition to two sources located at the beam and target rapidities (\pm y_{max}
= \pm \ln[\sqrt{s_{NN}}/m_{N}]). This results in better \chi^2/n.d.f. than
those for only two sources when analysing data.
