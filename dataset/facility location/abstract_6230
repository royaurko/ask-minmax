The most recent data of NA49 on hadron production in nuclear collisions at
CERN SPS energies are presented. Anomalies in the energy dependence of pion and
kaon production in central Pb+Pb collisions are observed. They suggest that the
onset of deconfinement is located at about 30 AGeV. Large multiplicity and
transverse momentum fluctuations are measured for collisions of intermediate
mass systems at 158 AGeV. The need for a new experimental programme at the CERN
SPS is underlined.
