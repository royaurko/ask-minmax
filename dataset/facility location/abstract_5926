Using an exactly solvable model, we study low-energy properties of a
one-dimensional spinless electron fluid contained in a quantum-mechanically
moving wire located in a static magnetic field. The phonon and electric current
are coupled via Lorentz force and the eigenmodes are described by two
independent boson fluids. At low energies, the two boson modes are charged
while one of them has excitation gap due to back-reaction of the Lorentz force.
The theory is illustrated by evaluating optical absorption spectra. Our results
are exact and show a non-perturbative regime of electron transport.
