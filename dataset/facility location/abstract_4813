Recent research on pattern discovery has progressed from mining frequent
patterns and sequences to mining structured patterns, such as trees and graphs.
Graphs as general data structure can model complex relations among data with
wide applications in web exploration and social networks. However, the process
of mining large graph patterns is a challenge due to the existence of large
number of subgraphs. In this paper, we aim to mine only frequent complete graph
patterns. A graph g in a database is complete if every pair of distinct
vertices is connected by a unique edge. Grid Complete Graph (GCG) is a mining
algorithm developed to explore interesting pruning techniques to extract
maximal complete graphs from large spatial dataset existing in Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) data. Using a divide and conquer strategy, GCG shows high
efficiency especially in the presence of large number of patterns. In this
paper, we describe GCG that can mine not only simple co-location spatial
patterns but also complex ones. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
algorithm used to exploit the extraction of maximal complete graphs in the
process of mining complex co-location patterns in large spatial dataset.
