Low noise underground environments offer conditions allowing to assess
ultimate performance of high sensitivity sensors such as accelerometers,
gyrometers, seismometers... Such facilities are for instance ideal for
observing the tiny signals of interest for geophysical studies. Laboratoire
Souterrain \`a Bas Bruit (LSBB) in which we have installed our cold atom
gravimeter, provides such an environment. We report here the best short term
sensitivity ever obtained without any ground vibration isolation system with
such an instrument: $10^{-8}$m.s$^{-2}$ in 100 s measurement time.
