MHD jet equilibria that depend on source properties are obtained using a
simplified model for stationary, axisymmetric and rotating magnetized outflows.
The present rotation laws are more complex than previously considered and
include a Keplerian disc. The ensuing jets have a dense, current-carrying
central core surrounded by an outer collar with a return current. The
intermediate part of the jet is almost current-free and is magnetically
dominated. Most of the momentum is located around the axis in the dense core
and this region is likely to dominate the dynamics of the jet. We address the
linear stability and the non-linear development of instabilities for our models
using both analytical and 2.5-D numerical simulation's. The instabilities seen
in the simulations develop with a wavelength and growth time that are well
matched by the stability analysis. The modes explored in this work may provide
a natural explanation for knots observed in astrophysical jets.
