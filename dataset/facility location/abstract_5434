The Astro2010 Decadal Survey recommended a Wide Field Infrared Survey
Telescope (WFIRST) as its top priority for a new large space mission. As
conceived by the decadal survey, WFIRST would carry out a dark energy science
program, a microlensing program to determine the demographics of exoplanets,
and a general observing program utilizing its ultra wide field. In October
2012, NASA chartered a Science Definition Team (SDT) to produce, in
collaboration with the WFIRST Project Office at GSFC and the Program Office at
JPL, a Design Reference Mission (DRM) for an implementation of WFIRST using one
of the 2.4-m, Hubble-quality mirror assemblies recently made available to NASA.
This DRM builds on the work of the earlier WFIRST SDT, reported by Green et al.
(2012). The 2.4-m primary mirror enables a mission with greater sensitivity and
higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-m designs considered
previously, increasing both the science return of the primary surveys and the
capabilities of WFIRST as a Guest Observer facility. The option of adding an
on-axis, coronagraphic instrument would enable imaging and spectroscopic
studies of planets around nearby stars. This document presents the final report
of the SDT.
