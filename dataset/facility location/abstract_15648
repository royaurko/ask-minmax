We have considered a system where the interaction, v(r) = v_IS(r) + xi^2
v_MF(r), is given as a linear combination of two potentials, each of which
being characterized with a well-defined critical behavior: for v_IS(r) we have
chosen the potential of the restricted primitive model which is known to belong
to the Ising 3D (IS) universality class, while for v_MF(r) we have considered a
long-range interaction in the Kac-limit, displaying mean field (MF) behavior.
We study the performance of two theoretical approaches and of computer
simulations in the critical region for this particular system and give a
detailed comparison between theories and simulation of the critical region and
the location of the critical point. Both, theory and simulation give evidence
that the system belongs to the MF universality class for any positive value of
xi and that it shows only non-classical behavior for xi=0. While in this
limiting case theoretical approaches are known to fail, we find good agreement
for the critical properties between the theoretical approaches and the
simulations for xi^2 larger than 0.05.
