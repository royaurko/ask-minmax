The Echo protocol tries to do secure location verification using physical
limits imposed by the speeds of light and sound. While the protocol is able to
guarantee that a certain object is within a certain region, it cannot ensure
the authenticity of further messages from the object without using
cryptography. This paper describes an impersonation attack against the protocol
based on this weakness. It also describes a couple of approaches which can be
used to defend against the attack.
