Collapse models predict the spontaneous collapse of the wave function, in
order to avoid the emergence of macroscopic superpositions. In their
mass-dependent formulation they claim that the collapse of any system's wave
function depends on its mass. Neutral K, D, B mesons are oscillating systems
that are given by Nature as superposition of different mass eigenstates. Thus
they are unique and interesting systems to look at, for analyzing the
experimental implications of such models, so far in agreement with all known
experiments. In this paper we derive - for the single mesons and bipartite
entangled mesons - the effect of the mass-proportional CSL collapse model on
the dynamics on neutral mesons, including the relativistic effects. We compare
the theoretical prediction with experimental data from different accelerator
facilities.
