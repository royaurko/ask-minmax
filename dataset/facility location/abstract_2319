Pioneering efforts aiming at the development of multi-messenger gravitational
wave and electromagnetic astronomy have been made. An electromagnetic
observation follow-up program of candidate gravitational wave events has been
performed (Dec 17 2009 to Jan 8 2010 and Sep 4 to Oct 20 2010) during the
recent runs of the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors. It involved
ground-based and space electromagnetic facilities observing the sky at optical,
X-ray and radio wavelengths. The joint gravitational wave and electromagnetic
observation study requires the development of specific image analysis
procedures able to discriminate the possible electromagnetic counterpart of
gravitational wave triggers from contaminant/background events. The paper
presents an overview of the electromagnetic follow-up program and the image
analysis procedures.
