Unlike the traditional model of information pull, matchmaking is base on a
cooperative partnership between information providers and consumers, assisted
by an intelligent facilitator (the matchmaker). Refer to some experiments, the
matchmaking to be most useful in two different ways: locating information
sources or services that appear dynamically and notification of information
changes. Effective information and services sharing in distributed such as P2P
based environments raises many challenges, including discovery and localization
of resources, exchange over heterogeneous sources, and query processing. One
traditional approach for dealing with some of the above challenges is to create
unified integrated schemas or services to combine the heterogeneous sources.
This approach does not scale well when applied in dynamic distributed
environments and has many drawbacks related to the large numbers of sources.
The main issues in matchmaking are how to represent advertising and request,
and how to calculate possibility matching between advertising and request. The
advertising and request can represent data or services by using many model of
representation. In this paper, we address an approach of matchmaking by
considering semantic agreement between sources.
