We describe the third telescope of the Wise Observatory, a 0.70-m Centurion
28 (C28IL) installed in 2013 and named the Jay Baum Rich telescope to enhance
significantly the wide-field imaging possibilities of the observatory. The
telescope operates from a 5.5-m diameter dome and is equipped with a
large-format red-sensitive CCD camera, offering a ~one square degree imaged
field sampled at 0".83/pixel. The telescope was acquired to provide an
alternative to the existing 1-m telescope for studies such as microlensing,
photometry of transiting exo-planets, the follow-up of supernovae and other
optical transients, and the detection of very low surface brightness extended
features around galaxies.
  The operation of the C28IL is robotic, requiring only the creation of a night
observing plan that is loaded in the afternoon prior to the observations. The
entire facility was erected for a component and infrastructure cost of well
under 300k$ and a labor investment of about two person-year. The successful
implementation of the C28IL, at a reasonable cost, demonstrates the viability
of small telescopes in an age of huge light-collectors.
