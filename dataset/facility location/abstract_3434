An ageing test of three ATLAS production RPC stations is in course at X5-GIF,
the CERN irradiation facility. The chamber efficiencies are monitored using
cosmic rays triggered by a scintillator hodoscope. Higher statistics
measurements are made when the X5 muon beam is available. We report here the
measurements of the efficiency versus operating voltage at different source
intensities, up to a maximum counting rate of about 700Hz/cm^2. We describe the
performance of the chambers during the test up to an overall ageing of 4 ATLAS
equivalent years corresponding to an integrated charge of 0.12C/cm^2, including
a safety factor of 5.
