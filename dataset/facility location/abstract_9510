AL~3 (BH 261), previously classified as a faint open cluster candidate, is
shown to be a new globular cluster in the Milky Way, by means of B, V and I
Color-Magnitude Diagrams. The main feature of AL~3 is a prominent blue extended
Horizontal Branch. Its Color-Magnitude Diagrams match those of the intermediate
metallicity cluster M~5. The cluster is projected in a rich bulge field, also
contaminated by the disk main sequence. The globular cluster is located in the
Galactic bulge at a distance from the Sun d$_{\odot}$ = 6.0$\pm$0.5 kpc. The
reddening is E(B-V)=0.36$\pm$0.03 and the metallicity is estimated to be [Fe/H]
$\approx$ -1.3$\pm$0.25. AL~3 is probably one of the least massive globular
clusters of the Galaxy.
