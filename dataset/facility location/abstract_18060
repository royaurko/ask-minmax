In this study we present a kernel based convolution model to characterize
neural responses to natural sounds by decoding their time-varying acoustic
features. The model allows to decode natural sounds from high-dimensional
neural recordings, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG), that track timing and
location of human cortical signalling noninvasively across multiple channels.
We used the MEG responses recorded from subjects listening to acoustically
different environmental sounds. By decoding the stimulus frequencies from the
responses, our model was able to accurately distinguish between two different
sounds that it had never encountered before with 70% accuracy. Convolution
models typically decode frequencies that appear at a certain time point in the
sound signal by using neural responses from that time point until a certain
fixed duration of the response. Using our model, we evaluated several fixed
durations (time-lags) of the neural responses and observed auditory MEG
responses to be most sensitive to spectral content of the sounds at time-lags
of 250 ms to 500 ms. The proposed model should be useful for determining what
aspects of natural sounds are represented by high-dimensional neural responses
and may reveal novel properties of neural signals.
