The electronic band structure of yttrium sesquicarbide Y2C3(Pu2C3 structural
type) reported by Akimitsu et al. (2003) as a novel 18-K superconductor is
investigated using the first-principle full-potential LMTO method and compared
with those of yttrium mono- and dicarbide: cubic YC and 4-K superconductor YC2
(CaC2 structural type). Our results show that the enhanced Tc of Y2C3 as
compared with YC2 may be interpreted by the electronic factors: the near-Fermi
DOS for Y2C3 was found to be about 70% higher that for YC2, and the
contribution from the C2p states increases. The Fermi level of the "ideal" bcc
Y2C3 is located near the local DOS minimum, and the superconducting properties
of Y2C3-based materials would be very sensitive to synthesis conditions and the
presence of impurities and lattice vacancies. We suppose that by changing these
factors it is possible to vary Tc for the yttrium sesquicarbide.
