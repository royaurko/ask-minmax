We propose to utilize mobile phone technology as a vehicle for people to
report their symptoms and to receive immediate feedback about the health
services readily available, and for predicting spatial disease outbreak risk.
Once symptoms are extracted from the patients text message, they undergo
complex classification, pattern matching and prediction to recommend the
nearest suitable health service. The added benefit of this approach is that it
enables health care facilities to anticipate arrival of new potential Ebola
cases.
