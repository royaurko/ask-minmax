Background: It is of biological interest to make genome-wide predictions of
the locations of DNA melting bubbles using statistical mechanics models.
Computationally, this poses the challenge that a generic search through all
combinations of bubble starts and ends is quadratic.
  Results: An efficient algorithm is described, which shows that the time
complexity of the task is O(NlogN) rather than quadratic. The algorithm
exploits that bubble lengths may be limited, but without a prior assumption of
a maximal bubble length. No approximations, such as windowing, have been
introduced to reduce the time complexity. More than just finding the bubbles,
the algorithm produces a stitch profile, which is a probabilistic graphical
model of bubbles and helical regions. The algorithm applies a probability peak
finding method based on a hierarchical analysis of the energy barriers in the
Poland-Scheraga model.
  Conclusions: Exact and fast computation of genomic stitch profiles is thus
feasible. Sequences of several megabases have been computed, only limited by
computer memory. Possible applications are the genome-wide comparisons of
bubbles with promotors, TSS, viral integration sites, and other melting-related
regions.
