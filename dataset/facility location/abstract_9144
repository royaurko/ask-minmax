We report on the identification of the optical counterpart of the binary
millisecond pulsar PSR J1911-5958A, located in the outskirts of the globular
cluster NGC 6752. At the position of the pulsar we find an object with V=22.08,
B-V=0.38, U-B=-0.49. The object is blue with respect to the cluster main
sequence by 0.8 magnitudes in B-V. We argue that the object is the white dwarf
companion of the pulsar. Comparison with white dwarf cooling models shows that
this magnitude and colors are consistent with a low-mass white dwarf at the
distance of NGC 6752. If associated with NGC 6752, the white dwarf is
relatively young, <2 Gyr, which sets constraints on the formation of the binary
and its ejection from the core of the globular cluster.
