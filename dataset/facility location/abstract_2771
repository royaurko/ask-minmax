Most research on 3D user interfaces aims at providing only a single sensory
modality. One challenge is to integrate several sensory modalities into a
seamless system while preserving each modality's immersion and performance
factors. This paper concerns manipulation tasks and proposes a visuo-haptic
system integrating immersive visualization, tactile force and tactile feedback
with co-location. An industrial application is presented.
