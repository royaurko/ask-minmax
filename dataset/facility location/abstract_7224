HST WFPC2 archival F606W and F300W images obtained within one year prior to
the explosion of the nearby Type II supernova (SN) 2003gd in Messier 74 (NGC
628) have been analyzed to isolate the progenitor star. The SN site was located
using precise astrometry applied to the HST images. Two plausible candidates
are identified within 0.6" of the SN position in the F606W image. Neither
candidate was detected in the F300W image. SN 2003gd appears to be of Type
II-plateau (II-P), with age ~87 d on June 17 UT and with low reddening [E(B-V)
= 0.13 mag]. The most likely of the two progenitor candidates has M_V_0 ~ -3.5
mag (for an extinction-corrected distance modulus of 29.3 mag) and, based on
additional color information derived from a high-quality, archival ground-based
I-band image, we estimate that this star was a red supergiant with initial mass
M_ZAMS ~ 8 -- 9 Msun. This mass estimate is somewhat lower than, but relatively
consistent with, recent limits placed on the progenitor masses of other SNe
II-P, using HST data. Future HST imaging with the Advanced Camera for Surveys,
when the SN has faded considerably, will be extremely useful in pinpointing the
exact SN location and securing identification of the progenitor. If our
proposed candidate is confirmed, it will be only the sixth SN progenitor ever
directly identified.
