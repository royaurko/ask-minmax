We study the statistics of the first passage of a random walker to absorbing
subsets of the boundary of compact domains in different spatial dimensions. We
describe a novel diagnostic method to quantify the trajectory-to-trajectory
fluctuations of the first passage, based on the distribution of the so-called
uniformity index $\omega$, measuring the similarity of the first passage times
of two independent walkers starting at the same location. We show that the
characteristic shape of $P(\omega)$ exhibits a transition from unimodal to
bimodal, depending on the starting point of the trajectories. From the study of
different geometries in one, two and three dimensions, we conclude that this
transition is a generic property of first passage phenomena in bounded domains.
Our results show that, in general, the Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) is a
meaningful characteristic measure of the first passage behaviour only when the
Brownian walkers start sufficiently far from the absorbing boundary.
Strikingly, in the opposite case, the first passage statistics exhibit large
trajectory-to-trajectory fluctuations and the MFPT is not representative of the
actual behaviour.
