The temperature of hot interstellar gas at large radii in elliptical galaxies
can be lower than the mean galactic virial temperature. If so, a nonlinear
cooling wave can form in the hot interstellar gas and propagate slowly toward
the galactic core. If the cooling wave survives hydrodynamic instabilities, it
can intermittently deposit cold gas within about 15 effective radii. For a
bright elliptical the total mass deposited in this manner can approach 10^10
solar masses. The cold gas that drips out at large galactic radii may account
for the young stellar populations and extended gas at $\sim 10^4$ K observed in
many ellipticals, features that are often attributed to galactic mergers.
Galactic drips are expected in relatively isolated (field) ellipticals provided
(i) the galactic stellar velocity ellipsoids are radially oriented at large
galactic radii and (ii) the current Type Ia supernova rate is sufficiently
small to be consistent with interstellar iron abundances found in recent X-ray
studies. Galactic drips are surpressed in ellipticals located within clusters
of galaxies; when the pressure in the ambient cluster gas exceeds that in the
outer parts of the galactic interstellar medium, some cluster gas flows into
the galaxy which surpresses the drips.
