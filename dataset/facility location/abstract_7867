Stokes wave is a finite amplitude periodic gravity wave propagating with
constant velocity in inviscid fluid.
  Complex analytical structure of Stokes wave is analyzed using a conformal
mapping of a free fluid surface of Stokes wave into the real line with fluid
domain mapped into the lower complex half-plane. There is one square root
branch point per spatial period of Stokes located in the upper complex
half-plane at the distance $v_c$ from the real axis. The increase of Stokes
wave height results in approaching $v_c$ to zero with the limiting Stokes wave
formation at $v_c=0.$ The limiting Stokes wave has $2/3$ power law singularity
forming $2\upi/3$ radians angle on the crest which is qualitatively different
from the square root singularity valid for arbitrary small but nonzero $v_c$
making the limit of zero $v_c$ highly nontrivial. That limit is addressed by
crossing a branch cut of square root into the second and higher sheets of
Riemann surface to find coupled square root singularities at the distances $\pm
v_c$ from the real axis at each sheet. The number of sheets is infinite and the
analytical continuation of Stokes wave into all these sheets is found together
with the series expansion in half-integer powers at $\pm v_c$ singular points
within each sheet. It is conjectured that non-limiting Stokes wave at the
leading order consists of the infinite number of nested square root
singularities. These nested square roots form $2/3$ power law singularity of
the limiting Stokes wave as $v_c$ vanishes.
