Community detection is an important tool for exploring and classifying the
properties of large complex networks and should be of great help for spatial
networks. Indeed, in addition to their location, nodes in spatial networks can
have attributes such as the language for individuals, or any other
socio-economical feature that we would like to identify in communities. We
discuss in this paper a crucial aspect which was not considered in previous
studies which is the possible existence of correlations between space and
attributes. Introducing a simple toy model in which both space and node
attributes are considered, we discuss the effect of space-attribute
correlations on the results of various community detection methods proposed for
spatial networks in this paper and in previous studies. When space is
irrelevant, our model is equivalent to the stochastic block model which has
been shown to display a detectability-non detectability transition. In the
regime where space dominates the link formation process, most methods can fail
to recover the communities, an effect which is particularly marked when
space-attributes correlations are strong. In this latter case, community
detection methods which remove the spatial component of the network can miss a
large part of the community structure and can lead to incorrect results.
