We consider a planning problem where the dynamics and rewards of the
environment depend on a hidden static parameter referred to as the context. The
objective is to learn a strategy that maximizes the accumulated reward across
all contexts. The new model, called Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP),
can model a customer's behavior when interacting with a website (the learner).
The customer's behavior depends on gender, age, location, device, etc. Based on
that behavior, the website objective is to determine customer characteristics,
and to optimize the interaction between them. Our work focuses on one basic
scenario--finite horizon with a small known number of possible contexts. We
suggest a family of algorithms with provable guarantees that learn the
underlying models and the latent contexts, and optimize the CMDPs. Bounds are
obtained for specific naive implementations, and extensions of the framework
are discussed, laying the ground for future research.
