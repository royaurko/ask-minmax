We report the detection of 1720 and 1612 MHz OH ground-state satellite line
maser regions in the starburst galaxy NGC253. We find ten compact maser
features all of which are located along the narrow ridge of bright radio
continuum emission within the central 10 square arcseconds of the nucleus. The
compact OH features appear physically associated with regions of dense
molecular gas, supernova remnants, and HII regions. The data for several of the
features are consistent with collisional inversion from the interaction of
supernova remnant shocks with molecular gas, similar to that found for Galactic
supernova remnants (Frail et al. 1996). For many other features near the
nucleus of NGC253, we find conjugate behavior in the 1720 and 1612 MHz lines,
with one line showing stimulated emission and the other showing stimulated
absorption. These results suggest the importance of infrared pumping associated
with the active star formation in NGC253 and is consistent with large column
densities of molecular gas (N[H_2] >~ 10^{22}cm^{-2}).
