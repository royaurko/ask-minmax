We introduce a novel non-minimal coupling between gravity and the inflaton
sector. Remarkably, for large values of this coupling all models asymptote to a
universal attractor. This behavior is independent of the original scalar
potential and generalizes the attractor in the phi^4 theory with non-minimal
coupling to gravity. The attractor is located in the `sweet spot' of Planck's
recent results.
