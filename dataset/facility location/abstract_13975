We investigate the position of the radio core in a blazar by multi-epoch
astrometric observations at 43 GHz. Using the VLBI Exploration of Radio
Astrometry (VERA), we have conducted four adjacent observations in February
2011 and another four in October 2011, and succeeded in measuring the position
of the radio core in the TeV blazar Mrk 501 relative to a distant compact
quasar NRAO 512. During our observations, we find that (1) there is no
positional change within ~0.2 mas or ~2.0 pc de-projected with $\pm1\sigma$
error for the weighted-mean phase-referenced positions of Mrk 501 core relative
to NRAO 512 over four adjacent days, and (2) there is an indication of position
change for 3C 345 core relative to NRAO 512. By applying our results to the
standard internal shock model for blazars, we constrain the bulk Lorenz factors
of the ejecta.
