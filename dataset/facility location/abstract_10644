The refolding from stretched initial conformations of ubiquitin (PDB ID:
1ubq) under the quenched force is studied using the Go model and the Langevin
dynamics. It is shown that the refolding decouples the collapse and folding
kinetics. The force quench refolding times scale as tau_F ~ exp(f_q*x_F/k_B*T),
where f_q is the quench force and x_F = 0.96 nm is the location of the average
transition state along the reaction coordinate given by the end-to-end
distance. This value is close to x_F = 0.8 nm obtained from the force-clamp
experiments. The mechanical and thermal unfolding pathways are studied and
compared with the experimental and all-atom simulation results in detail. The
sequencing of thermal unfolding was found to be markedly different from the
mechanical one. It is found that fixing the N-terminus of ubiquitin changes its
mechanical unfolding pathways much more drastically compared to the case when
the C-end is anchored. We obtained the distance between the native state and
the transition state x_UF=0.24 nm which is in reasonable agreement with the
experimental data.
