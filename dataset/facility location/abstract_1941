The Tore Supra tokamak is the largest superconducting magnetic fusion
facility, has been devoted to long-duration high-performance discharge
research. With a steady-state magnetic field and water cooled plasma facing
components, discharges up to 6 minutes 24 seconds duration with injected /
extracted energy up to 1 GJ have been performed. The Tore Supra real time
measurements and control (RTMC) system has been upgraded to address schemes
dedicated to long pulse operation with simultaneous control of an increasing
number of plasma parameters. This includes plasma equilibrium control with
possible self calibration during the discharge, plasma density control with
possible pellet injection, current profile control to avoid
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities and infrared monitoring of plasma
facing components preventing overheating. Most of these improvements are
relevant to the tokamaks operation in a fully steady state regime.
