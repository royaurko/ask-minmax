We report the discovery of star formation activity in perhaps the most
distant molecular cloud in the extreme outer galaxy. We performed deep near
infrared imaging with the Subaru 8.2 m telescope, and found two young embedded
clusters at two CO peaks of Digel Cloud 1 at the kinematic distance of D = 16
kpc (Galactocentric radius RG = 22 kpc). We identified 18 and 45 cluster
members in the two peaks, and the estimated stellar density are ~ 5 and ~ 3
pc^-2, respectively. The observed K-band luminosity function suggests that the
age of the clusters is less than 1 Myr and also the distance to the clusters is
consistent with the kinematic distance. On the sky, Cloud 1 is located very
close to the H I peak of high-velocity cloud (HVC) Complex H, and there are
some H I intermediate velocity structures between the Complex H and the
Galactic disk, which could indicate an interaction between them. We suggest
possibility that Complex H impacting on the Galactic disk has triggered star
formation in Cloud 1 as well as the formation of Cloud 1 molecular cloud.
