We consider Horava gravity coupled to Maxwell and higher derivative magnetic
terms. We construct static spherically symmetric black hole solutions in the
low-energy approximation. We calculate the horizon locations and temperatures
in the near-extremal limit, for asymptotically flat and (anti-)de Sitter
spaces. We also construct a detailed balanced version of the theory, for which
we find projectable and non-projectable, non-perturbative solutions.
