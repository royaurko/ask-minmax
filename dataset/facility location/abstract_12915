The processes influencing animal movement and resource selection are complex
and varied. Past efforts to model behavioral changes over time used Bayesian
statistical models with variable parameter space, such as reversible-jump
Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches, which are computationally demanding and
inaccessible to many practitioners. We present a continuous-time discrete-space
(CTDS) model of animal movement that can be fit using standard generalized
linear modeling (GLM) methods. This CTDS approach allows for the joint modeling
of location-based as well as directional drivers of movement. Changing behavior
over time is modeled using a varying-coefficient framework which maintains the
computational simplicity of a GLM approach, and variable selection is
accomplished using a group lasso penalty. We apply our approach to a study of
two mountain lions (Puma concolor) in Colorado, USA.
