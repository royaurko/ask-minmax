Three dimensional (3D) Dirac semimetals are 3D analogue of graphene, which
display Dirac points with linear dispersion in k-space, stabilized by crystal
symmetry. Cd3As2 and Na3Bi were predicted to be 3D Dirac semimetals and were
subsequently demonstrated by photoemission experiments. As unveiled by
transport measurements, several exotic phases, such as Weyl semimetals,
topological insulators, and topological superconductors, can be deduced by
breaking time reversal or inversion symmetry. Here, we reported a facile and
scalable chemical vapor deposition method to fabricate high-quality Dirac
semimetal Cd3As2 microbelts, they have shown ultrahigh mobility up to 1.15*10^5
cm^2/V s and pronounced Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. Such extraordinary
features are attributed to the suppression of electron backscattering. This
research opens a new avenue for the scalable fabrication of Cd3As2 materials
towards exciting electronic applications of 3D Dirac semimetals.
