Full exploitation of emittance exchange (EEX) requires aberration-free
performance of a complex imaging system including active radio-frequency (RF)
elements which can add temporal distortions. We investigate the performance of
an EEX line where the exchange occurs between two dimensions with normalized
emittances which differ by multiple orders of magnitude. The transverse
emittance is exchanged into the longitudinal dimension using a double dog-leg
emittance exchange setup with a five cell RF deflector cavity. Aberration
correction is performed on the four most dominant aberrations. These include
temporal aberrations that are corrected with higher order magnetic optical
elements located where longitudinal and transverse emittance are coupled. We
demonstrate aberration-free performance of an EEX line with emittances
differing by four orders of magnitude, \textit{i.e.} an initial transverse
emittance of 1~pm-rad is exchanged with a longitudinal emittance of 10~nm-rad.
