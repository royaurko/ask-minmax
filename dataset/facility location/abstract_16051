We show that the N=8 superconformal Bagger-Lambert theory based on the
Lorentzian 3-algebra can be derived by taking a certain scaling limit of the
recently proposed N=6 superconformal U(N)xU(N) Chern-Simons-matter theories at
level (k, -k). The scaling limit (and Inonu-Wigner contraction) is to scale the
trace part of the bifundamental fields as X_0 -> \lambda^{-1} X_0 and an axial
combination of the two gauge fields as B_{\mu} -> \lambda B_\mu. Simultaneously
we scale the level as k -> \lambda^{-1} k and then take \lambda -> 0 limit.
Interestingly the same constraint equation \partial^2 X_0=0 is derived by
imposing finiteness of the action. In this scaling limit, M2-branes are located
far from the origin of C^4/Z_k compared to their fluctuations and Z_k
identification becomes a circle identification. Hence the scaled theory
describes N=8 supersymmetric theory of 2-branes with dynamical coupling. The
coupling constant is promoted to a space-time dependent SO(8) vector X_0^I and
we show that the scaled theory has a generalized conformal symmetry as well as
manifest SO(8) with the transformation of the background fields X_0^I.
