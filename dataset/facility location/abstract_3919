During 2014 the second experimental area EAR2 was completed at the n-TOF
neutron beam facility at CERN. As the neutrons are produced via spallation, by
means of a high-intensity 20 GeV pulsed proton beam impinging on a thick
target, the resulting neutron beam covers an enormous energy range, from
thermal to several GeV. In this paper we describe two beam diagnostic devices,
designed and built at INFN-LNS, both exploiting silicon detectors coupled with
neutron converter foils containing 6Li. The first one is based on four silicon
pads and allows to monitor the neutron beam flux as a function of the neutron
energy. The second one, based on position sensitive silicon detectors, is
intended for the reconstruction of the beam profile, again as a function of the
neutron energy. Several electronic setups have been explored in order to
overcome the issues related to the gamma flash, namely a huge pulse present at
the start of each neutron bunch which may blind the detectors for some time.
The two devices have been characterized with radioactive sources at INFN-LNS
and then tested at n-TOF. The wide energy and intensity range they proved
capable of sustaining, made them quite attractive and suitable to be used in
both EAR1 and EAR2 n-TOF experimental areas, where they became immediately
operational.
