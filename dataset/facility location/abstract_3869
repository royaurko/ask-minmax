Here we explore the capabilities of NASA's 3.0 meter Infrared Telescope
Facility (IRTF) and SpeX spectrometer and the 5.08 meter Hale telescope with
the TripleSpec spectrometer with near-infrared H, K, and L-band measurements of
HD 209458b's secondary eclipse. Our IRTF/SpeX data are the first absolute
L-band spectroscopic emission measurements of any exoplanet other than the hot
Jupiter HD 189733b. Previous measurements of HD 189733b's L-band indicate
bright emission hypothesized to result from non-LTE CH$_{4}$ $\nu_{3}$
fluorescence. We do not detect a similar bright 3.3 $\mu$m feature to
~3$\sigma$, suggesting that fluorescence does not need to be invoked to explain
HD 209458b's L-band measurements. The validity of our observation and reduction
techniques, which decrease the flux variance by up to 2.8 orders of magnitude,
is reinforced by 1$\sigma$ agreement with existent $Hubble$/NICMOS and
$Spitzer$/IRAC1 observations which overlap the H, K, and L-bands, suggesting
that both IRTF/SpeX and Palomar/TripleSpec can measure an exoplanet's emission
with high precision.
