Supersymmetry analyses will potentially be a central area for experiments at
the LHC and at a future e+ e- linear collider. Results from the two facilities
will mutually complement and augment each other so that a comprehensive and
precise picture of the supersymmetric world can be developed. We will
demonstrate in this report how coherent analyses at LHC and LC experiments can
be used to explore the breaking mechanism of supersymmetry and to reconstruct
the fundamental theory at high energies, in particular at the grand unification
scale. This will be exemplified for minimal supergravity in detailed
experimental simulations performed for the Snowmass reference point SPS1a.
