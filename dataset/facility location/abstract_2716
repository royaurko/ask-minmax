We examine the reliability of the theoretical methods presently used for
analysis and prediction of neutrino oscillation phenomena. Of particular
interest are the limitations imposed by branch points when expansions in one of
the small parameters of the Standard Neutrino Model (SNM) are made to obtain
tractable results. Our evaluation compares the approximate oscillation
probabilities for flavor-changing transitions in the $(\nu_e , \nu_\mu)$ sector
to exact results obtained from of a recently-developed exact analytical
representation of neutrino oscillations in matter within the SNM. From our
numerical comparisons, we are able to identify regions where the existing
approaches can be improved to take full advantage of the higher quality data
expected at future neutrino facilities.
