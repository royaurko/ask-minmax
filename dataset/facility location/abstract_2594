The Dual-Axis Radiographic Hydrotest (DARHT) facility uses bremsstrahlung
radiation source spots produced by the focused electron beams from two linear
induction accelerators (LIAs) to radiograph large hydrodynamic experiments
driven by high explosives. Radiographic resolution is determined by the size of
the source spot, and beam emittance is the ultimate limitation to spot size. On
the DARHT Axis-II LIA we measure an emittance higher than predicted by
theoretical simulations, and even though this axis produces sub-millimeter
source spots, we are exploring ways to improve the emittance. Some of the
possible causes for the discrepancy have been investigated using
particle-in-cell (PIC) codes, although most of these are discounted based on
beam measurements. The most likely source of emittance growth is a mismatch of
the beam to the magnetic transport, which can cause beam halo.
