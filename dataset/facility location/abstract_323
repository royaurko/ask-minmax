Construction of the 12 GeV upgrade to the Continuous Electron Beam
Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator
Facility is presently underway. This upgrade includes doubling the energy of
the electron beam to 12 GeV, the addition of a new fourth experimental hall,
and the construction of upgraded detector hardware. An overview of this upgrade
project is presented, along with highlights of the anticipated experimental
program.
