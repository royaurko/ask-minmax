The main purpose of the paper is the numerical analysis of seismic site
effects in Caracas (Venezuela). The analysis is performed considering the
boundary element method in the frequency domain. A numerical model including a
part of the local topography is considered, it involves a deep alluvial deposit
on an elastic bedrock. The amplification of seismic motion (SH-waves, weak
motion) is analyzed in terms of level, occurring frequency and location. In
this specific site of Caracas, the amplification factor is found to reach a
maximum value of 25. Site effects occur in the thickest part of the basin for
low frequencies (below 1.0 Hz) and in two intermediate thinner areas for
frequencies above 1.0 Hz. The influence of both incidence and shear wave
velocities is also investigated. A comparison with microtremor recordings is
presented afterwards. The results of both numerical and experimental approaches
are in good agreement in terms of fundamental frequencies in the deepest part
of the basin. The boundary element method appears to be a reliable and
efficient approach for the analysis of seismic site effects.
