Samples of high-redshift galaxies are easy to select in the
millimetre/submillimetre (mm/submm) waveband using sensitive telescopes,
because their flux density-redshift relations are expected to be flat, and so
the selection function is almost redshift-independent at redshifts greater than
0.5. Source counts are expected to be very steep in the mm/submm waveband, and
so the magnification bias due to gravitational lensing is expected to be very
large, both for lensing by field galaxies and for lensing by clusters. Recent
submm-wave observations of lensed images in clusters have constrained the
submm-wave counts directly for the first time. In the next ten years our
knowledge of galaxy evolution in this waveband will be greatly enhanced by the
commissioning of sensitive new instruments and telescopes, including the CMBR
imaging space mission Planck Surveyor. This paper highlights the important
features of gravitational lensing in the submm waveband and discusses the
excellent prospects for lens searches using these forthcoming facilities.
