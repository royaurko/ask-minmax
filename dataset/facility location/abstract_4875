We explore fermion RG block-spinning transformations on the lattice with the
aim of studying the IR structure of gauge theories and, in particular, the
existence of IR fixed points for varying fermion content. In the case of light
fermions the main concern and difficulty is ensuring locality of any adopted
blocking scheme. We discuss the problem of constructing a local blocked fermion
action in the background of arbitrary gauge fields. We then discuss the
carrying out of accompanying gauge field blocking. In the presence of the
blocked fermions implementation of MCRG is not straightforward. By adopting
judicious approximations we arrive at an easily implementable approximate RG
recursion scheme that allows quick, inexpensive estimates of the location of
conformal windows for various groups and fermion representations. We apply this
scheme to locate the conformal windows in the case of SU(2) and SU(3) gauge
groups. Some of the reasons for the apparent efficacy of this and similar
decimation schemes are discussed.
