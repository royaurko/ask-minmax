We used 45 orbits of Hubble Space Telescope time in Cycle 9 to obtain deep
STIS/CCD images of the host galaxies of eleven gamma-ray bursts. Our goals are
to study the morphologies of the host galaxies, to obtain precise locations of
gamma-ray bursts within their host galaxies, and to determine star-formation
rates in the hosts. We present preliminary results for GRB 980425/SN1998bw, GRB
980613, and GRB 9809703.
