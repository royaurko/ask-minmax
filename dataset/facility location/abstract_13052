Data from the Galileo Probe, collected during its descent into Jupiter's
atmosphere, is used to obtain a vertical profile of the zonal wind from
$\mathbf{\sim 0.5}$ bar (upper troposphere) to $\mathbf{\sim 0.1\, \mu{bar}}$
(lower thermosphere) at the probe entry site. This is accomplished by
constructing a map of gravity wave Lomb-Scargle periodograms as a function of
altitude. The profile obtained from the map indicates that the wind speed above
the visible cloud deck increases with height to $\mathbf{\sim 150}$
m\,s$\mathbf{^{-1}}$ and then levels off at this value over a broad altitude
range. The location of the turbopause, as a region of wide wave spectrum, is
also identified from the map. In addition, a cross-equatorial oscillation of a
jet, which has previously been linked to the quasi-quadrennial oscillation in
the stratosphere, is suggested by the profile.
