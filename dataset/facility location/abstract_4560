We present a conjecture on the exact location of the multicritical point in
the phase diagram of spin glass models in finite dimensions. By generalizing
our previous work, we combine duality and gauge symmetry for replicated random
systems to derive formulas which make it possible to understand all the
relevant available numerical results in a unified way. The method applies to
non-self-dual lattices as well as to self dual cases, in the former case of
which we derive a relation for a pair of values of multicritical points for
mutually dual lattices. The examples include the +-J and Gaussian Ising spin
glasses on the square, hexagonal and triangular lattices, the Potts and Z_q
models with chiral randomness on these lattices, and the three-dimensional +-J
Ising spin glass and the random plaquette gauge model.
