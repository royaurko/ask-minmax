Low frequency oscillation, typical for Gamma Doradus g-mode type stellar core
sensitive pulsation, as well as higher frequency Delta Scuti type pulsation
typical for p-modes, sensitive to the envelope, make HD 8801 a remarkable
hybrid pulsator with the potential to probe a stellar structure over a wide
range of radius. In addition HD 8801 is a rare pulsating metallic line (Am)
star. We determined the astrophysical fundamental parameters to locate HD 8801
in the HR diagram. We analyzed the element abundances, paying close attention
to the errors involved, and confirm the nature of HD 8801 as a metallic line
(Am) star. We also determined an upper limit on the magnetic field strength.
Our abundance analysis is based on classical techniques, but uses for the final
step a model atmosphere calculated with the abundances determined by us. We
also discuss spectropolarimetric observations obtained for HD 8801. This object
is remarkable in several respects. It is a non-magnetic metallic line (Am)
star, pulsating simultaneously in p- and g-modes, but also shows oscillations
with periods in between these two domains, whose excitation requires
explanation. Overall, the pulsational incidence in unevolved classical Am stars
is believed to be quite low; HD 8801 does not conform to this picture. Finally,
about 75% of Am stars are located in short-period binaries, but there is no
evidence that HD 8801 has a companion.
