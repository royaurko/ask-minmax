We present the observations of penumbra like features (PLFs) near a polarity
inversion line (PIL) of flaring region. The PIL is located at the moat boundary
of active region (NOAA 10960). The PLFs appear similar to sunspot penumbrae in
morphology but occupy small area, about 6$\times10^{7}$ km$^{2}$, and are not
associated with sunspot or pore. We observed a rapid disappearance of the PLFs
after a C1.7 class flare, which occurred close to the PIL. The local
correlation tracking (LCT) of these features shows presence of horizontal flows
directed away from the end-points of the PLFs, similar to the radial outward
flow found around regular sunspots, which is also known as the moat flow. Hard
X-ray emission, coincident with the location of the PLFs, is found in RHESSI
observations, suggesting a spatial correlation between the occurrence of the
flare and decay of the PLFs. Vector magnetic field derived from the
observations obtained by Hinode spectro-polarimeter SOT/SP instrument, before
and after the flare, shows a significant change in the horizontal as well as
the vertical component of the field, after the flare. The weakening of both the
components of the magnetic field in the flare interval suggests that rapid
cancellation and/or submergence of the magnetic field in PLFs occurred during
the flare interval.
