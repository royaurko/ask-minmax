Aims: The Danish 1.54-meter telescope at the La Silla observatory was used
for photometric monitoring of selected eccentric eclipsing binaries located in
the Small Magellanic Cloud. The new times of minima were derived for these
systems, which are needed for accurate determination of the apsidal motion.
Moreover, many new times of minima were derived from the photometric databases
OGLE and MACHO. Eighteen early-type eccentric-orbit eclipsing binaries were
studied.
  Methods: Their (O-C) diagrams of minima timings were analysed and the
parameters of the apsidal motion were obtained. The light curves of these
eighteen binaries were analysed using the program PHOEBE, giving the light
curve parameters. For several systems the additional third light also was
detected.
  Results: We derived for the first time and significantly improved the
relatively short periods of apsidal motion from 19 to 142 years for these
systems. The relativistic effects are weak, up to 10% of the total apsidal
motion rate. For one system (OGLE-SMC-ECL-0888), the third-body hypothesis was
also presented, which agrees with high value of the third light for this system
detected during the light curve solution.
