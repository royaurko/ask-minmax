Designing the user interface (UI) of mobile applications in the enterprise is
performed in many cases by the application users who represent the business
needs. This is based on existing developed enterprise services that can be
accessed by these applications. Design the UI of the mobile applications
require programming environments that are as much as possible codeless and easy
to use. In this paper, we present NitroGen which is a cloud-based
platform-independent tool that provides with no installation, a consumable
integrated set of capabilities to construct mobile solutions aiming at reducing
development and maintenance costs. We further illustrate how to use NitroGen
showing its visual touch-based mostly codeless way of programming. NitroGen can
easily connect to back-end services thus enable fast and facile development in
enterprises.
