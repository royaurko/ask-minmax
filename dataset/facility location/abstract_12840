This short note points out two of the incongruences that I find in the Loredo
(2012) comments on Andreon (2012), i.e. on my chapter written for the book
"Astrostatistical Challenges for the New Astronomy". First, I find illogic the
Loredo decision of putting my chapter among those presenting simple models,
because one of the models illustrated in my chapter is qualified by him as
"impressing for his complexity". Second, Loredo criticizes my chapter at one
location confusing it with another paper by another contributor, because my chapter
do not touch the subject mentioned by Loredo (2012) critics, the comparison
between Bayesian and frequentist fitting models.
