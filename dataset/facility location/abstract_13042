Ground-state two-proton (2p) radioactivity is a decay mode found in isotopes
of elements with even atomic numbers located beyond the two-proton drip line.
So far, this exotic process has been experimentally observed in a few light and
medium-mass nuclides with Z less than or equal to 30. In this study, using
state-of-the-art nuclear density functional theory, we globally analyze 2p
radioactivity and for the first time identify 2p decay candidates in elements
heavier than strontium. We predict a few cases where the competition between 2p
emission and alpha decay may be observed. In nuclei above lead, the alpha decay
mode is found to be dominating and no measurable candidates for the 2p
radioactivity are expected.
