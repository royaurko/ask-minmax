Gamma ray source detection above 30TeV is an encouraging approach for finding
galactic cosmic ray origins. All sky survey for gamma ray sources using wide
field of view detector is essential for population accumulation for various
types of sources above 100GeV. To target the goals, the ARGO-YBJ experiment has
been established. Significant progresses have been made in the experiment. A
large air shower detector array in an area of 1km2 is proposed to boost the
sensitivity. Hybrid detection with multi-techniques will allow a good
discrimination between different types of primary particles, including photons
and protons, thus enable an energy spectrum measurement for individual specie.
Fluorescence light detector array will extend the spectrum measurement above
100PeV where the second knee is located. An energy scale determined by balloon
experiments at 10TeV will be propagated to ultra high energy cosmic ray
experiments.
