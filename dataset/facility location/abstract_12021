In the course of the XMM-Newton survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC),
two new bright X-ray sources were discovered exhibiting the spectral
characteris- tics of High Mass X-ray Binaries - but revealing only weak
evidence for pulsations in just one of the objects(at 153s in
XMMUJ010743.1-715953). The accurate X- ray source locations permit the
identi?cation of these X-ray source with Be stars, thereby strongly suggesting
these systems are new Be/X-ray binaries. From blue spectra the proposed
classi?cation for XMMUJ010633.1-731543 is B0.5-1Ve and for XMMUJ010743.1-715953
it is B2IV-Ve.
