We report the detection of off-pulse emission from two long period pulsars
PSR B0525+21 and PSR B2045-16 using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT).
We recorded high time resolution interferometric data at 325 MHz and gated the
data offline to separate the on- and off-pulse sections of the pulsar. On
imaging the two temporal sections separately, we detected a point source in the
off-pulse images of both the pulsars coincident with the pulsar locations in
the on-pulse images. The long periods (3.75 and 1.96 s respectively) and low
spin-down energies (E ~ 10exp(31) erg s-1) of the two pulsars argue against a
pulsar wind nebula (PWN) origin for the off-pulse emission. The derived
estimates of the ISM particle density required to drive a PWN do not support
such an interpretation. A magnetospheric origin for the off-pulse emission
raises questions regarding the location of the emission region, which is an
important input into pulsar emission models.
