A vertex coloring of a graph $G$ is an assignment of colors to the vertices
of $G$ such that every two adjacent vertices of $G$ have different colors. A
coloring related property of a graphs is also an assignment of colors or labels
to the vertices of a graph, in which the process of labeling is done according
to an extra condition. A set $S$ of vertices of a graph $G$ is a dominating set
in $G$ if every vertex outside of $S$ is adjacent to at least one vertex
belonging to $S$. A domination parameter of $G$ is related to those structures
of a graph satisfying some domination property together with other conditions
on the vertices of $G$. In this article we study several mathematical
properties related to coloring, domination and location of corona graphs.
  We investigate the distance-$k$ colorings of corona graphs. Particularly, we
obtain tight bounds for the distance-2 chromatic number and distance-3
chromatic number of corona graphs, throughout some relationships between the
distance-$k$ chromatic number of corona graphs and the distance-$k$ chromatic
number of its factors. Moreover, we give the exact value of the distance-$k$
chromatic number of the corona of a path and an arbitrary graph. On the other
hand, we obtain bounds for the Roman dominating number and the
locating-domination number of corona graphs. We give closed formulaes for the
$k$-domination number, the distance-$k$ domination number, the independence
domination number, the domatic number and the idomatic number of corona graphs.
