The Relativistic Hartree Bogoliubov theory is applied in the mean-field
approximation to the description of properties of light nuclei with large
neutron excess. Pairing correlations and the coupling to particle continuum
states are described by finite range two-body forces. Using standard parameter
sets for the mean-field Lagrangian and the pairing interaction of Gogny-type,
self-consistent solutions in coordinate space are calculated for the ground
states of a number of neutron-rich nuclei. The model predicts the location of
the neutron drip-line, reduction of the spin-orbit interaction, $rms$ radii,
changes in surface properties, the formation of neutron skin and of neutron
halo.
