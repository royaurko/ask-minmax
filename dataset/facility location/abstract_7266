The Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope is absolutely
calibrated by comparing photometry on a set of A stars near the north ecliptic
pole to predictions based on ground-based observations and a stellar atmosphere
model. The brightness of point sources is calibrated to an accuracy of 3%,
relative to models for A star stellar atmospheres, for observations performed
and analyzed in the same manner as the calibration stars. This includes
corrections for location of the star in the array and the location if the
centroid within the peak pixel. Long-term stability of the IRAC photometry was
measured by monitoring the brightness of A dwarfs and K giants (near the north
ecliptic pole) observed several times per month; the photometry is stable to
1.5% (rms) over a year. Intermediate-time-scale stability of the IRAC
photometry was measured by monitoring at least one secondary calibrator (near
the ecliptic plane) every 12 hr while IRAC is in nominal operations; the
intermediate-term photometry is stable with a 1% dispersion (rms). One of the
secondary calibrators was found to have significantly time-variable (5%)
mid-infrared emission, with period (7.4 days) matching the optical light curve;
it is possibly a Cepheid variable.
