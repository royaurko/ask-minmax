The NGC 1333 region was observed in the H2 1-0 S(1) line. The H2 images cover
a 5' x 7' region around IRAS 4. Numerous H2 emission features were detected.
The northeast-southwest bipolar outflow driven by IRAS 4A was studied by
combining the H2 images with SiO maps published previously. The SiO-H2 outflows
are continuous on the southwestern side but show a gap on the northeastern
side. The southwestern outflow lobe curves smoothly, and the position angle
increases with the distance from the driving source. The base and the outer tip
of the northeastern outflow lobe are located at positions opposite to the
corresponding parts of the southwestern lobe. This point-symmetry suggests that
the outflow axis may be drifting or precessing clockwise in the plane of the
sky and that the cause of the axis drift may be intrinsic to the outflow
engine. The axis drift model is supported by the asymmetric lateral intensity
profile of the SiO outflow. The axis drift rate is about 0.011 deg yr-1. The
middle part of the northeastern outflow does not exactly follow the point
symmetry because of the superposition of two different kinds of directional
variability: the axis drift of the driving source and the deflection by a dense
core. The axis drift model provides a good explanation for the large deflection
angle of the northeastern outflow. Other H2 emission features around the IRAS 4
region are discussed briefly. Some of them are newly found outflows, and some
are associated with outflows already known before.
