The semi-classical regime of standing wave solutions of a Schr\"odinger
equation in presence of non-constant electric and magnetic potentials is
studied in the case of non-local nonlinearities of Hartree type. It is show
that there exists a family of solutions having multiple concentration regions
which are located around the minimum points of the electric potential.
