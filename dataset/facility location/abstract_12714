Conditional autoregressive (CAR) models are commonly used to capture spatial
correlation in areal unit data, and are typically specified as a prior
distribution for a set of random effects, as part of a hierarchical Bayesian
model. The spatial correlation structure induced by these models is determined
by geographical adjacency, so that two areas have correlated random effects if
they share a common border. However, this correlation structure is too
simplistic for real data, which are instead likely to include sub-regions of
strong correlation as well as locations at which the response exhibits a
step-change. Therefore this paper proposes an extension to CAR priors, which
can capture such localised spatial correlation. The proposed approach takes the
form of an iterative algorithm, which sequentially updates the spatial
correlation structure in the data as well as estimating the remaining model
parameters. The efficacy of the approach is assessed by simulation, and its
utility is illustrated in a disease mapping context, using data on respiratory
disease risk in Greater Glasgow, Scotland.
