Object detection is one of the most important challenges in computer vision.
Object detectors are usually trained on bounding-boxes from still images.
Recently, video has been used as an alternative source of data. Yet, for a
given test domain (image or video), the performance of the detector depends on
the domain it was trained on. In this paper, we examine the reasons behind this
performance gap. We define and evaluate different domain shift factors: spatial
location accuracy, appearance diversity, image quality and aspect distribution.
We examine the impact of these factors by comparing performance before and
after factoring them out. The results show that all four factors affect the
performance of the detectors and their combined effect explains nearly the
whole performance gap.
