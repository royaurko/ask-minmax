A novel diagnostic method to detect ordering within one-dimensional ion beams
in a storage ring is presented. The ions are simultaneously excited by a
ultrashort pulsed laser ($\simeq 1$ ps) at two different locations along the
beam and fluorescence is detected by a group of four photo-multipliers.
Correlation in fluorescence signals is a firm indication that the ion beam has
an ordered structure.
