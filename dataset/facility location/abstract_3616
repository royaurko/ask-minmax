LiF:Mg,Ti and LiF:Mg,Cu,P are well known thermoluminescence (TL) dosimetry
materials since many years. A few years ago their properties seemed well known
and it was widely believed that they are not suitable for the measurement of
doses above the saturation level of the TL signal, which for both materials
occur at about 1 kGy. The high-dose high-temperature TL emission of LiF:Mg,Cu,P
observed at the IFJ in 2006, which above 30 kGy takes the form of the so-called
TL peak B, opened the way to use this material for measuring the dose in the
high and ultra-high range, in particular for the monitoring of ionizing
radiation around the essential electronic elements of high-energy accelerators,
also fission and fusion facilities, as well as for emergency dosimetry. This
discovery initiated studies of high and ultra-high dose characteristics of both
of these phosphors, which turned out to be significantly different in many
aspects. These studies not only strive to refine the method for measuring high
doses based on the observed phenomenon, but also, and perhaps above all, bring
us closer to understanding its origin and essence. This manuscript aims to
review existing research data on the high and ultra-high dose features of both
LiF based phosphors.
