We consider a particular Branching Random Walk in Random Environment (BRWRE)
on $\sN_0$ started with one particle at the origin. Particles reproduce
according to an offspring distribution (which depends on the location) and move
either one step to the right (with a probability in $(0,1]$ which also depends
on the location) or stay in the same place. We give criteria for local and
global survival and show that global survival is equivalent to exponential
growth of the moments. Further, on the event of survival the number of
particles grows almost surely exponentially fast with the same growth rate as
the moments.
