The Mozambique Radio Astronomy Observatory (MRAO) will be a first milestone
towards development of radioastronomy in Mozambique. Development of MRAO will
constitute a preparation step towards participation in the upcoming Africa VLBI
Network and the Square Kilometer Array project. The MRAO first antenna is
planned to serve as a capacitation and training facility and will be installed
after the conversion of a 7-meter telecom dish in South Africa. Therefore, this
first radiotelescope design has to comply with local spectral and environmental
constraints. Furthermore, power availability and long term sustainability with
potential inclusion of solar power and control of Radio Frequency Interference
are analyzed. Here we outline some of the design, environmental and power
sustainability constraints.
