The Uranian satellite Miranda presents a high inclination (4.338{\deg}) and
evidences of resurfacing. It is accepted since 20 years (e.g. Tittemore and
Wisdom 1989, Malhotra and Dermott 1990) that this inclination is due to the
past trapping into the 3:1 resonance with Umbriel. These last years there is a
renewal of interest for the Uranian system since the Hubble Space Telescope
permitted the detection of an inner system of rings and small embedded
satellites, their dynamics being of course ruled by the main satellites. For
this reason, we here propose to revisit the long-term dynamics of Miranda,
using modern tools like intensive computing facilities and new chaos indicators
(MEGNO and frequency map analysis). As in the previous studies, we find the
resonance responsible for the inclination of Miranda and the secondary
resonances associated, likely to have stopped the rise of Miranda's inclination
at 4.5{\deg}. Moreover, we get other trajectories in which this inclination
reaches 7{\deg}. We also propose an analytical study of the secondary
resonances associated, based on the study by Moons and Henrard (1993).
