As product complexity and marketing competition increase, a collaborative
product development is necessary for companies which develop high quality
products in short lead-times. To support product actors from different fields,
disciplines, and locations, wishing to exchange and share information, the
representation of the actors' viewpoints is the underlying requirement of the
collaborative product development. The actors' viewpoints approach was designed
to provide an organisational framework following the actors' perspectives in
the collaboration, and their relationships, could be explicitly gathered and
formatted. The approach acknowledges the inevitability of multiple integration
of product information as different views, promotes gathering of actors'
interests, and encourages retrieved adequate information while providing
support for integration through PLM and/or SCM collaboration. In this paper, a
solution for neutral viewpoints representation is proposed. The product,
process, and organisation information models are seriatim discussed. A series
of issues referring to the viewpoints representation are discussed in detail.
Based on XML standard, taking cyclone vessel as an example, an application case
of part of product information modelling is stated.
