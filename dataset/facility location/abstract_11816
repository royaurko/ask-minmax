By using the data for the known geopotential models by means of artificial
satellite, the central moments of inertia of the Earth are determined. For this
purpose, it was used the value $H = 0.00327369\pm9.8\cdot10^{-8}$ for dynamical
flattening of the Earth [I. MIHAILA, A.D. V\^{I}LCU, On the value of the
dynamical flattening of the Earth (to appear)]. The results obtained indicate
that the pole of inertia is located near the Conventional International Origin
(CIO). Also, the orientation of the triaxial ellipsoid of inertia for nine
geopotential models considered is given. Our results improve the ones obtained
by Erzhanov and Kalybaev [General theory of the rotation of the Earth, Nauka,
Moscow, 1984 (in Russian)].
