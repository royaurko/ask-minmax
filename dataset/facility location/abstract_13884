The ROSS method is a new approach in the area of knowledge representation
that is useful for many artificial intelligence and natural language
understanding representation and reasoning tasks. (ROSS stands for
"Representation", "Ontology", "Structure", "Star" language). ROSS is a physical
symbol-based representational scheme. ROSS provides a complex model for the
declarative representation of physical structure and for the representation of
processes and causality. From the metaphysical perspective, the ROSS view of
external reality involves a 4D model, wherein discrete single-time-point
unit-sized locations with states are the basis for all objects, processes and
aspects that can be modeled. ROSS includes a language called "Star" for the
specification of ontology classes. The ROSS method also includes a formal
scheme called the "instance model". Instance models are used in the area of
natural language meaning representation to represent situations. This document
is an in-depth specification of the ROSS method.
