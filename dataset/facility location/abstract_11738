We investigate the effect of the Milky Way's magnetic field in star forming
regions using archived 350 micron polarization data on 52 Galactic star
formation regions from the Hertz polarimeter module. The polarization angles
and percentages for individual telescope beams were combined in order to
produce a large-scale average for each source and for complexes of sources. In
more than 80% of the sources, we find a meaningful mean magnetic field
direction, implying the existence of an ordered magnetic field component at the
scale of these sources. The average polarization angles were analyzed with
respect to the Galactic coordinates in order to test for correlations between
polarization percentage, polarization angle, intensity, and Galactic location.
No correlation was found, which suggests that the magnetic field in dense
molecular clouds is decoupled from the large-scale Galactic magnetic field.
Finally, we show that the magnetic field directions in the complexes are
consistent with a random distribution on the sky.
