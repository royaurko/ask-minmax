This companion paper complements the main DEFT'10 article describing the MARF
approach (arXiv:0905.1235) to the DEFT'10 NLP challenge (described at
http://www.groupes.polymtl.ca/taln2010/deft.php in French). This paper is aimed
to present the complete result sets of all the conducted experiments and their
settings in the resulting tables highlighting the approach and the best
results, but also showing the worse and the worst and their subsequent
analysis. This particular work focuses on application of the MARF's classical
and NLP pipelines to identification tasks within various francophone corpora to
identify decades when certain articles were published for the first track
(Piste 1) and place of origin of a publication (Piste 2), such as the journal
and location (France vs. Quebec). This is the sixth iteration of the release of
the results.
