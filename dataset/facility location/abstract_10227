We investigate signals of the lightest neutral Higgs in an R-parity violating
supersymmetric model through the vector boson fusion mechanism. Assuming that
R-parity is violated through lepton number, and locating regions in the
parameter space where decays of such a neutral scalar into a pair of lightest
neutralinos can be significant, we proceed to calculate the event rates for
final states arising from decays of the neutralinos through both $\lambda$-and
$\lambda'$-type interactions. Regions of the parameter space where each of
these types of interactions can lead to detectable events are identified. The
possibilities where such signals can be faked by other superparticles (squarks,
gluinos, charginos and neutralinos) are also investigated. It is found that
over a sizable region, one can obtain distinguishable signals of an
intermediate mass neutral scalar from a study of the suggested final states at
the Large Hadron Collider.
