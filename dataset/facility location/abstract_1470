A southern hemisphere survey of methanol emission sources has been carried
out using the ATNF Mopra millimetre telescope. 85 sources, the majority of them
masers, have been detected in the 8(0)-7(1)A+ transition of methanol at 95 GHz.
Together with a similar northern hemisphere survey this completes the search
for 95-GHz methanol emission from the Galactic Plane. The previously found
correlation between intensity of methanol emission at 44 and 95 GHz is
confirmed here with the larger sample of sources. The results of LVG
statistical equilibrium calculations confirm the classification of these
sources as class I methanol masers pumped through collisional excitation.
