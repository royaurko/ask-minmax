We present the capabilities of the 2-m robotic Liverpool Telescope (LT),
owned and operated by Liverpool John Moores University and situated at ORM, La
Palma. Robotic control and scheduling of the LT make it especially powerful for
observations in time domain astrophysics including: (i) rapid response to
Targets of Opportunity: Gamma Ray Bursts, novae, supernovae, comets; (ii)
monitoring of variable objects on timescales from seconds to years, and (iii)
observations simultaneous or coordinated with other facilities, both
ground-based and from space. Following a GRB alert from the Gamma Ray
Observatories HETE-2, INTEGRAL and Swift we implement a special over-ride mode
which enables observations to commence in about a minute after the alert,
including optical and near infrared imaging and spectroscopy. In particular,
the combination of aperture, site, instrumentation and rapid response (aided by
its rapid slew and fully-opening enclosure) makes the LT excellently suited to
help solving the mystery of the origin of optically dark GRBs, for the
investigation of short bursts (which currently do not have any confirmed
optical counterparts) and for early optical spectroscopy of the GRB phenomenon
in general. We briefly describe the LT's key position in the RoboNet-1.0
network of robotic telescopes.
