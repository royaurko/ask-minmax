We review the present status of liquid mirror telescopes. Interferometric
tests of liquid mirrors (the largest one having a diameter of 2.5 meters ) show
excellent optical qualities. The basic technology is now sufficiently reliable
that it can be put to work. Indeed, a handful of liquid mirrors have now been
built that are used for scientific work. A 3.7-m diameter LMT is presently
being built in the new Laval upgraded testing facilities. Construction of the
mirror can be followed on the Web site: http://astrosun.phy.ulaval.ca/lmt/lmt-
home.html. Finally we address the issue of the field accessible to LMTs
equipped with novel optical correctors. Optical design work, and some
exploratory laboratory work, indicate that a single LMT should be able to
access, with excellent images, small regions anywhere inside fields as large as
45 degrees.
