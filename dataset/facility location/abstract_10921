A damping strategy for blisks (integrally bladed disks) of turbomachinery
involving a friction ring is investigated. These rings, located in grooves
underside the wheel of the blisks, are held in contact by centrifugal loads and
the energy is dissipated when relative motions between the ring and the disk
occur. A representative lumped parameter model of the system is introduced and
the steady-state nonlinear response is derived using a multi-harmonic balance
method combined with an AFT procedure where the friction force is calculated in
the time domain. Numerical simulations are presented for several damper
characteristics and several excitation configurations. From these results, the
performance of this damping strategy is discussed and some design guidelines
are given.
