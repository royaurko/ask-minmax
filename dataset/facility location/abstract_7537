We present a physical interpretation for the locations of the sources of
radio emission in IM Pegasi (IM Peg, HR 8703), the guide star for the
NASA/Stanford relativity mission Gravity Probe B. This emission is seen in each
of our 35 epochs of 8.4-GHz VLBI observations taken from 1997 to 2005. We found
that the mean position of the radio emission is at or near the projected center
of the primary to within about 27% of its radius, identifying this active star
as the radio emitter. The positions of the radio brightness peaks are scattered
across the disk of the primary and slightly beyond, preferentially along an
axis with position angle, p.a. = (-38 +- 8) deg, which is closely aligned with
the sky projections of the orbit normal (p.a. = -49.5 +- 8.6 deg) and the
expected spin axis of the primary. Comparison with simulations suggests that
brightness peaks are 3.6 (+0.4,-0.7) times more likely to occur (per unit
surface area) near the pole regions of the primary (|latitude| >= 70 deg) than
near the equator (|latitude| <= 20 deg), and to also occur close to the surface
with ~2/3 of them at altitudes not higher than 25% of the radius of the
primary.
