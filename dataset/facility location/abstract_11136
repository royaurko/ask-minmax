The 3D fundamental diagrams and phase portraits for tunnel traffic is
constructed based on the empirical data collected during the last years in the
deep long branch of the Lefortovo tunnel located on the 3rd circular highway in
Moscow. This tunnel of length 3 km is equipped with a dense system of
stationary ra-diodetetors distributed uniformly along it chequerwise at spacing
of 60 m. The data were averaged over 30 s. Each detector measures three
characteristics of the vehicle ensemble; the flow rate, the car velocity, and
the occupancy for three lanes individually. The conducted analysis reveals
complexity of phase states of tunnel traffic. In particular, we show the
presence of cooperative traffic dynamics in this tunnel and the variety of
phase states different in properties. Besides, the regions of regular and
stochastic dynamics are found and the presence of dynamical traps is
demonstrated.
