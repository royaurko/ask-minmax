As devices continue to scale, imperfections in the fabrication process will
have a more substantial impact on the reliability of a system. In Magnetic
Cellular Automata (MCA) data is transferred through the coupling of neighboring
cells via magnetic force fields. Due to the size of the switching cells,
usually of the order of nanometers or smaller, MCA can be sensitive to inherent
fabrication defects such as irregular spacing and non-uniform cell structures.
Here we investigate conventional electron beam lithography fabrication defects
and present a simulation based study on their effects on information
propagation in a wire. The study varies the location of the different types of
defects throughout the MCA wire under the in influence of a spatial moving
clocking field. We demonstrate that with the proposed spatially moving clock
the most probable fabrication defects of MCA do not affect the information
propagation and the location of the defect does not play a significant role in
computation. Thus it is concluded that MCA wires demonstrate significant defect
robustness towards realistic electron beam lithography shortcomings.
