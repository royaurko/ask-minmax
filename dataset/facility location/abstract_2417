This paper summarizes the three-day international workshop "Radio Stars and
Their Lives in the Galaxy", held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Haystack Observatory on 2012 October 3-5. The workshop was organized to provide
a forum for the presentation and discussion of advances in stellar and solar
astrophysics recently (or soon to be) enabled by the latest generation of
state-of-the-art observational facilities operating from meter to submillimeter
wavelengths. The meeting brought together both observers and theorists to
discuss how radio wavelength observations are providing new and unique insights
into the workings of stars and their role in the Galactic ecosystem. Topics
covered included radio emission from hot and cool stars (from the pre- to
post-main-sequence), the Sun as a radio star, circumstellar chemistry,
planetary nebulae, white dwarf binaries and novae, supernova progenitors, and
radio stars as probes of the Galaxy.
