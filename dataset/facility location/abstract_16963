Methods to visualize the two-dimensional distribution of molecules by mass
spectrometric imaging evolve rapidly and yield novel applications in biology,
medicine, and material surface sciences. Most mass spectrometric imagers
acquire high mass resolution spectra spot-by-spot and thereby scan the object's
surface. Thus, imaging is slow and image reconstruction remains cumbersome.
Here we describe an imaging mass spectrometer that exploits the true imaging
capabilities by ion optical means for the time of flight mass separation. The
mass spectrometer is equipped with the ASIC Timepix chip as an array detector
to acquire the position, mass, and intensity of ions that are imaged by MALDI
directly from the target sample onto the detector. This imaging mass
spectrometer has a spatial resolving power at the specimen of (84\pm35) \mu m
with a mass resolution of 45 and locates atoms or organic compounds on a
surface area up to ~2 cm2. Extended laser spots of ~5 mm2 on structured
specimens allowed parallel imaging of selected masses. The digital imaging mass
spectrometer proves high hit-multiplicity, straightforward image reconstruction
and its potential for high-speed readout at 4 kHz or more. This device
demonstrates a simple way of true image acquisition like a digital photographic
camera. The technology may enable a fast analysis of biomolecular samples in
near future.
