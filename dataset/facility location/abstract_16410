Superconductivity up to 30 K in charge neutrally doped BaFe2[As(1-x)P(x)]2
has been ascribed to chemical pressure, caused by the shrinking unit cell. But
the latter induces no superconductivity in [Ba(1-x)Sr(x)]Fe2As2 in spite of the
same volume range. We show that the spin-density-wave (SDW) state of BaFe2As2
becomes suppressed in BaFe2[As(1-x)P(x)]2 by a subtle reorganization of the
crystal structure, where arsenic and phosphorus are located at different
coordinates z(As), z(P). High-resolution X-ray diffraction experiments with
BaFe2[As(1-x)P(x)]2 single crystals reveal almost unchanged Fe-P bonds, but a
contraction of the Fe-As bonds, which remain nearly unchanged in
[Ba(1-x)Sr(x)]Fe2As2. Since the Fe-As bond length is a gauge for the magnetic
moment, our results show why the SDW is suppressed by P-, but not by Sr-doping.
Only the Fe-P interaction increases the width of the iron 3d bands, which
destabilizes the magnetic SDW ground state. The simultaneous contraction of the
Fe{As bonds is rather a consequence of the vanishing magnetism. Ordered
structure models of BaFe2[As(1-x)P(x)]2 obtained by DFT calculations agree
perfectly with the single-crystal X-ray structure determinations. The
contraction of the Fe-As bonds saturates at doping levels above x = 0.3, which
corrects the unreasonable linear decrease of the so-called pnictide height.
