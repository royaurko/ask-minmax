We use the eight year light-curve database from the MACHO (MAssive Compact
Halo Objects) project together with infrared colors and magnitudes from 2MASS
(the Two Micron All Sky Survey) to identify a sample of 22,000 long period
variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud (referred to hereafter as LMC LPVs). A
period-luminosity diagram of these stars reveals six well-defined sequences, in
substantial agreement with previous analyses of samples from OGLE (Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment). In our analysis we identify analogues to
galactic LPVs in the LMC LPV sample. We find that carbon-dominated AGB stars
populate only two of the sequences, one of which includes the Mira variables.
The high-luminosity end of the same two sequences are also the location of the
only stars with $J-K_s > 2$, indicating that they are enshrouded in dust. The
unknown mechanism that drives the variability of stars in the longest period
produces different morphology in the period-luminosity diagram as compared to
the shortest period sequences, which are thought to be caused by pulsation. In
particular, the longest period sequence extends to lower luminosity RGB stars
and the luminosity function does not peak among the AGB stars. We point out
several features which will constrain new models of the period-luminosity
sequences.
