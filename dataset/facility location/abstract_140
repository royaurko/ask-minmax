The Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) and associated
experimental equipment at Jefferson Lab comprise a unique facility for
experimental nuclear physics. This facility is presently being upgraded, which
will enable a new experimental program with substantial discovery potential to
address important topics in nuclear, hadronic, and electroweak physics. Further
in the future, it is envisioned that the Laboratory will evolve into an
electron-ion colliding beam facility.
