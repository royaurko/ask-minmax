We use a multiannulus accretion code to investigate debris disks in the
terrestrial zone, at 0.7-1.3 AU around a 1 solar mass star. Terrestrial planet
formation produces a bright dusty ring of debris with a lifetime of at least 1
Myr. The early phases of terrestrial planet formation are observable with
current facilities; the late stages require more advanced instruments with
adaptive optics.
