We report the discovery of additional 22 RV Tau stars located in the OGLE-II
and OGLE-III fields toward the Galactic bulge, increasing to 357 objects the
OGLE-III catalog of type II Cepheids in the Galactic center. Four of the newly
detected RV Tau stars belong to the RVb class, i.e. they show large-amplitude,
long-period modulation of the mean luminosity. In the updated catalog, the
relative number of RV Tau stars in the whole sample of the Galactic bulge type
II Cepheids is similar to the Magellanic Cloud samples.
