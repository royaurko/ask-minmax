The beam diagnostics system for the Double ElectroStatic Ion Ring ExpEriment
(DESIREE) project under construction is briefly described. A system which can
operate over a wide range of beam intensities and energies for the DESIREE has
been built and tested using the CRYRING facility at MSL. Spatial resolution up
to 2 mm is achieved.
