Exclusive data on both the elementary kaon and antikaon production channels
have been taken at the cooler synchrotron COSY in proton-proton scattering. In
the kaon--hyperon production an enhancement by one order of magnitude of the
Lambda/Sigma0 ratio has been observed at excess energies below Q=13 MeV
compared to data at higher excess energies (Q>300 MeV). New results obtained at
the COSY-11 facility explore the transition region between the regime of this
low-energy Sigma0 suppression and excess energies of 60 MeV. A comparison of
the energy dependence of the Lambda and Sigma0 total cross sections exhibits
distinct qualitative differences between both hyperon production channels.
Studies of kaon-antikaon production have been motivated especially by the
ongoing discussion about the nature of the scalar resonances f0(980) and
a0(980) coupling to the K anti-K channel. For the reaction pp->ppK+K- a first
total cross section value is reported at an excess energy of Q=17 MeV, i.e.
below the phi threshold. Calculations obtained within an OBE model indicate
that the energy dependence of the available total cross section data close to
threshold is rather difficult to reconcile with the assumption of a phase-space
behaviour modified predominantly by the proton-proton final state interaction.
