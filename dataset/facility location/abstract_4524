We study the effect of the stochastic character of supernova explosions on
the anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays below the knee. We conclude that if the
bulk of cosmic rays are produced in supernova explosions the observed small and
nearly energy independent amplitude of the anisotropy and its phase are to the
large extent determined by the history of these explosions in the vicinity of
the solar system, namely by the location and the age of the supernova remnants,
within a few kpc, which give the highest contribution to the total intensity at
the present epoch. Among the most important factors which result in the small
magnitude and the energy independence of the anisotropy amplitude are the mixed
primary mass composition, the effect of the Single Source and the Galactic
Halo. Special attention is given to the phase of the anisotropy. It is shown
that the excessive flux from the Outer Galaxy can be due to the location of the
solar system at the inner edge of the Orion Arm which has the enhanced density
and rate of supernova explosions.
