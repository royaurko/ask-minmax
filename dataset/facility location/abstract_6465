We study spherical functions on the space isomorphic to $U(2n)/(U(n)\times
U(n))$ over a $p$-adic field; those functional equations with respect to the
action of the Weyl group, the location of possible poles and zeros, explicit
formulas, and spherical Fourier transforms. Then, as an application, we give a
functional equation of $p$-adic local hermitian Siegel series.
