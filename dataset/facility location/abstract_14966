We present a catalog of near-infrared surveys of young (<= a few 10^6 yr)
stellar groups and clusters within 1 kpc from the Sun, based on an extensive
search of the literature from the past ten years. We find 143 surveys from 69
published articles, covering 73 different regions. The number distribution of
stars in a region has a median of 28 and a mean of 100. About 80% of the stars
are in clusters with at least 100 members. By a rough classification of the
groups and clusters based on the number of their associated stars, we show that
most of the stars form in large clusters. The spatial distribution of cataloged
regions in the Galactic plane shows a relative lack of observed stellar groups
and clusters in the range 270 deg < l < 60 deg of Galactic longitude,
reflecting our location between the Local and Sagittarius arms. This
compilation is intended as a useful resource for future studies of nearby young
regions of multiple star formation.
