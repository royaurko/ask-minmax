Obtaining accurate photometry of bright stars from the ground remains tricky
because of the danger of overexposure of the target and/or lack of suitable
nearby comparison star. The century-old method of the objective wire mesh used
to produce multiple stellar images seems attractive for precision CCD
photometry of such stars. Our tests on beta Cep and its comparison star
differing by 5 magnitudes prove very encouraging. Using a CCD camera and a 20
cm telescope with objective covered with a plastic wire mesh, located in poor
weather conditions we obtained differential photometry of precision 4.5 mmag
per 2 min exposure. Our technique is flexible and may be tuned to cover as big
magnitude range as 6 - 8 magnitudes. We discuss the possibility of installing a
wire mesh directly in the filter wheel.
