We present Australia Telescope Compact Array radio data of the dwarf
irregular galaxy ESO 324-G024 which is seen in projection against the giant,
northern lobe of the radio galaxy Centaurus A (Cen A, NGC 5128). The distorted
morphology and kinematics of ESO 324-G024, as observed in the 21 cm spectral
line emission of neutral hydrogen, indicate disruptions by external forces. We
investigate whether tidal interactions and/or ram pressure stripping are
responsible for the formation of the HI tail stretching to the northeast of ESO
324-G024 with the latter being most probable. Furthermore, we closely analyze
the sub-structure of Cen A's polarized radio lobes to ascertain whether ESO
324-G024 is located in front, within or behind the northern lobe. Our
multi-wavelength, multi-component approach allows us to determine that ESO
324-G024 is most likely behind the northern radio lobe of Cen A. This result
helps to constrain the orientation of the lobe, which is likely inclined to our
line of sight by approximately 60 degrees if NGC 5128 and ESO 324-G024 are at
the same distance.
