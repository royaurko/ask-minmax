We have performed numerical simulations of the single-polarized e+ e- -->
\vec p anti p process in kinematic conditions under discussion for a possible
upgrade of the existing DAFNE facility. By fitting the cross section and spin
asymmetry angular distributions with typical Born expressions, we can study the
conditions for extracting information on moduli and phases of the proton
electromagnetic form factors in the timelike region, which are poorly known and
whose preliminary data show puzzling features. We have explored also non-Born
contributions by introducing a further component in the angular fit, which is
related to two-photon exchange diagrams. Using a dipole parametrization, we
show that these corrections can be identified if larger than 5% of the Born
contribution; we also explore the conditions for extracting information on the
phase and, consequently, on the relative weight between their real and
imaginary parts, which are presently unknown.
