The EPR spectra along different crystallographic axes for single crystals of
CuGeO3 containing 1% of Fe impurity have been studied in the frequency range
60-360 GHz at temperatures 0.5-30 K. The analysis based on the Oshikawa-Affleck
(OA) theory suggests that the temperature dependences of the line width and
g-factor are formed as a result of the competition between interchain
antiferromagnetic interactions and staggered Zeeman energy. It is found that
staggered magnetic moments in CuGeO3:Fe are located predominantly along b axis.
