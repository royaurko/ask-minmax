Our study shows that the cross-section for fusion improves considerably if
d-d pairs are located in linear (one-dimensional) chainlets or line defects.
Such non-equilibrium defects can exist only in a solid matrix. Further, solids
harbor lattice vibrational modes (quanta, phonons) whose longitudinal-optical
modes interact strongly with electrons and ions. One such interaction,
resulting in potential inversion, causes localization of electron pairs on
deuterons. Thus, we have attraction of D+ D- pairs and strong screening of the
nuclear repulsion due to these local electron pairs (local charged bosons:
acronym, lochons). This attraction and strong coupling permits low-energy
deuterons to approach close enough to alter the standard equations used to
define nuclear-interaction cross-sections. These altered equations not only
predict that low-energy-nuclear reactions (LENR) of D+ D- (and H+ H-) pairs are
possible, they predict that they are probable.
