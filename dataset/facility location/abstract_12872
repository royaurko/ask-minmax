The paper presents our recent results obtained with a new auditory spatial
localization based BCI paradigm in which the ERP shape differences at early
latencies are employed to enhance the traditional P300 responses in an oddball
experimental setting. The concept relies on the recent results in auditory
neuroscience showing a possibility to differentiate early anterior
contralateral responses to attended spatial sources. Contemporary
stimuli-driven BCI paradigms benefit mostly from the P300 ERP latencies in so
called "aha-response" settings. We show the further enhancement of the
classification results in spatial auditory paradigms by incorporating the N200
latencies, which differentiate the brain responses to lateral, in relation to
the subject head, sound locations in the auditory space. The results reveal
that those early spatial auditory ERPs boost online classification results of
the BCI application. The online BCI experiments with the multi-command BCI
prototype support our research hypothesis with the higher classification
results and the improved information-transfer-rates.
