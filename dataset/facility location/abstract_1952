The p(\nuc{11}{Li},\nuc{9}{Li})t reaction has been studied for the first time
at an incident energy of 3$A$ MeV delivered by the new ISAC-2 facility at
TRIUMF. An active target detector MAYA, build at GANIL, was used for the
measurement. The differential cross sectionshave been determined for
transitions to the \nuc{9}{Li} ground andthe first excited states in a wide
range of scattering angles. Multistep transfer calculations using different
\nuc{11}{Li} model wave functions, shows that wave functions with strong
correlations between the halo neutrons are the most successful in reproducing
the observation.
