In the present paper we study chemical potential of the generalized Hubbard
model with correlated hopping. The peculiarity of the model in comparison with
similar generalized Hubbard models is the concentration dependence of hopping
integrals. Chemical potential as a function of the model energy parameters,
electron concentration and temperature is found. It is shown that correlated
hopping and temperature changes essentially the chemical potential location;
these dependencies differ strongly at different values of the electron
concenntration.
