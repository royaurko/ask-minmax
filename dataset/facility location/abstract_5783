Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) have recently been observed in the
distribution of distant galaxies. The height and location of the BAO peak are
strong discriminators of cosmological parameters. Here we consider the ways in
which weak gravitational lensing distorts the BAO signal. We find two effects
that can affect the height of the BAO peak in the correlation function at the
percent level but that do not significantly impact the position of the peak and
the measurement of the sound horizon. BAO turn out to be robust cosmological
standard rulers.
