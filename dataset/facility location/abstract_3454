Measurements have been performed of scintillation light intensities emitted
from various inorganic scintillators irradiated with low-energy beams of
highly-charged ions from an electron beam ion source (EBIS) and an electron
cyclotron resonance ion source (ECRIS). Beams of xenon ions Xe$^{q+}$ with
various charge states between $q$=2 and $q$=18 have been used at energies
between 5 keV and 17.5 keV per charge generated by the ECRIS. The intensity of
the beam was typically varied between 1 and 100 nA. Beams of highly charged
residual gas ions have been produced by the EBIS at 4.5 keV per charge and with
low intensities down to 100 pA. The scintillator materials used are flat
screens of P46 YAG and P43 phosphor. In all cases, scintillation light emitted
from the screen surface was detected by a CCD camera. The scintillation light
intensity has been found to depend linearly on the kinetic ion energy per time
deposited into the scintillator, while up to $q$=18 no significant contribution
from the ions' potential energy was found. We discuss the results on the
background of a possible use as beam diagnostics e.g. for the new HITRAP
facility at GSI, Germany.
