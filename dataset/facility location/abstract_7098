Previous derivations of the BTZ black hole entropy from a dual conformal
description place the degrees of freedom at spatial infinity. Here it is shown
for the non-rotating case that a dual conformal description exists at any
location around the black hole, a result that has a strong physical appeal
considering that in 2+1 dimensions there are no propagating degrees of freedom
in the classical theory. Two copies of the central charge of $3\ell/2G$ are
recovered, and the microcanonical Cardy formula yields the correct
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
