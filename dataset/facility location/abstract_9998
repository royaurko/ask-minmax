We present a microscopic approach to the calculations of thermal conductivity
in unconventional superconductors for a wide range of temperatures and magnetic
fields. Our work employs the non-equilibrium Keldysh formulation of the
quasiclassical theory. We solve the transport equations using a variation of
the Brandt-Pesch-Tewordt (BPT) method, that accounts for the quasiparticle
scattering on vortices. We focus on the dependence of the thermal conductivity
on the direction of the field with the respect to the nodes of the order
parameter, and discuss it in the context of experiments aiming to determine the
shape of the gap from such anisotropy measurements. We consider quasi-two
dimensional Fermi surfaces with vertical line nodes and use our analysis to
establish the location of gap nodes in heavy fermion CeCoIn$_5$ and organic
superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu(NCS)$_2$.
