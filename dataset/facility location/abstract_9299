PSR B0540-69 is one of a small handful of pulsars known to emit giant pulses
and the only extra-galactic pulsar known to do so. We observed the pulsar for a
total of 72 hr over a 6 month interval and detected 141 giant pulses. We have
obtained correct phasing between the radio arrival times of the giant pulses
and the X-ray pulse profile. The giant pulses occur in two phase windows,
located 6.7 ms before and 5.0 ms after the midpoint of the X-ray profile. We
have detected the integrated profile of the pulsar at 1.4 GHz with a flux
density of only 24 micro-Jy. The statistics of the giant pulses are clearly
power-law and it is likely that the giant pulses contribute only a few per cent
to the integrated pulse flux density, similar to other pulsars with giant pulse
emission. Simultaneous X-ray and radio observations show no significant
increase in the X-ray flux at the time of the radio giants. The relative
enhancements in the X-ray emission must be at least 5.5 times smaller than in
the radio.
