We obtain rotating solutions of regular black holes which are constructed of
de Sitter spacetime with the axisymmetric stationary perturbation within the
timelike charged thin shell and the Kerr-Newman geometry with sufficiently
small rotation outside the shell. To treat the slowly rotating thin shell, we
employ the method developed by de la Cruz and Israel. The thin shell is assumed
to be composed of a dust in the zero-rotation limit and located inside the
inner horizon of the black hole solution. We expand the perturbation in powers
of the rotation parameter of the Kerr-Newman metric up to the second order. It
is found that with the present treatment, the stress tensor of the thin shell
in general has anisotropic pressure, i.e., the thin shell cannot be composed of
a dust if the rotational effects are taken into account. However, the thin
shell can be composed of a perfect fluid with isotropic pressure if the degrees
of freedom appearing in the physically acceptable matching of the two distinct
spacetimes are suitably used. We numerically investigate the rotational effects
on the spherically symmetric charged regular black hole obtained by Uchikata,
Yoshida and Futamase in detail.
