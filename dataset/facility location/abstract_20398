The DEAP-3600 experiment is located 2 km underground at SNOLAB, in Sudbury,
Ontario. It is a single-phase detector that searches for dark matter particle
interactions within a 1000-kg fiducial mass target of liquid argon. A first
generation prototype detector (DEAP-1) with a 7-kg liquid argon target mass
demonstrated a high level of pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) for reducing
$\beta$/$\gamma$ backgrounds and helped to develop low radioactivity techniques
to mitigate surface-related $\alpha$ backgrounds. Construction of the DEAP-3600
detector is nearly complete and commissioning is starting in 2014. The target
sensitivity to spin-independent scattering of Weakly Interacting Massive
Particles (WIMPs) on nucleons of 10$^{-46}$ cm$^2$ will allow one order of
magnitude improvement in sensitivity over current searches at 100 GeV WIMP
mass. This paper presents an overview and status of the DEAP-3600 project and
discusses plans for a future multi-tonne experiment, DEAP-50T.
