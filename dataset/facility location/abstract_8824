It is shown that for very rapidly rotating low mass strange stars the
marginally stable orbit is located above the stellar surface. This effect is
explained by the very important role of the oblateness of the rotating strange
star. The comparison with some ``academic'' examples is presented. This feature
is purely Newtonian in its nature and has nothing to do with relativistic
marginally stable orbit. The effect is very large and cannot be treated in a
perturbative way. It seems that strange stars as a very dense self-bound
objects are the only possibility in Nature to represent these toy models.
