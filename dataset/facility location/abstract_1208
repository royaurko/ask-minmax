The results of LSND and MiniBooNE, along with the recent papers on a possible
reactor neutrino flux anomaly give tantalizing hints of new physics. Models
beyond the neutrino-SM have been developed to explain these results and involve
one or more additional neutrinos that are non-interacting or "sterile."
Neutrino beams produced from the decay of muons in a racetrack-like decay ring
provide a powerful way to study this potential new physics. In this Letter of
Intent, we describe a facility, nuSTORM, "Neutrinos from STORed Muons," and an
appropriate far detector for neutrino oscillation searches at short baseline.
We present sensitivity plots that indicated that this experimental approach can
provide over 10 sigma confirmation or rejection of the LSND/MinBooNE results.
In addition we indicate how the facility can be used to make precision neutrino
interaction cross section measurements important to the next generation of
long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.
