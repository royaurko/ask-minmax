Elastic scattering of photons from 12C has been investigated using
quasi-monoenergetic tagged photons with energies in the range 65 - 115 MeV at
laboratory angles of 60 deg, 120 deg, and 150 deg at the Tagged-Photon Facility
at the MAX IV Laboratory in Lund, Sweden. A phenomenological model was employed
to provide an estimate of the sensitivity of the 12C(g,g)12C cross section to
the bound-nucleon polarizabilities.
