Since many environmental processes such as heat waves or precipitation are
spatial in extent, it is likely that a single extreme event affects several
locations and the areal modelling of extremes is therefore essential if the
spatial dependence of extremes has to be appropriately taken into account. This
paper proposes a framework for conditional simulations of max-stable processes
and give closed forms for Brown-Resnick and Schlather processes. We test the
method on simulated data and give an application to extreme rainfall around
Zurich and extreme temperature in Switzerland. Results show that the proposed
framework provides accurate conditional simulations and can handle real-sized
problems.
