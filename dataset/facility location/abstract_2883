In this paper, we investigate methods for interference location in satellite
communication system using satellite multi-beam antenna with subspace based
schemes. A novel MUSIC based approach is proposed for estimating the direction
of arrival of the interfering sources. The proposed method provides super
resolution and asymptotic maximum likelihood estimates of the direction of
arrivals even at low SNR values. Simulations were performed using typical
satellite multi-beam antenna configurations and results show that the proposed
scheme can effectively estimates the direction of arrival in the azimuth and
elevation spectra. Compared to the support vector regression method, the
proposed approach offer improved estimation accuracy at low SNR values.
