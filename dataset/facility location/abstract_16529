We measure rats' ability to detect an oriented visual target grating located
between two flanking stimuli ("flankers"). Flankers varied in contrast,
orientation, angular position, and sign. Rats are impaired at detecting visual
targets with collinear flankers, compared to configurations where flankers
differ from the target in orientation or angular position. In particular, rats
are more likely to miss the target when flankers are collinear. The same
impairment is found even when the flanker luminance was sign-reversed relative
to the target. These findings suggest that contour alignment alters visual
processing in rats, despite their lack of orientation columns in visual cortex.
This is the first report that the arrangement of visual features relative to
each other affects visual behavior in rats. To provide a conceptual framework
for our findings, we relate our stimuli to a contrast normalization model of
early visual processing. We suggest a pattern-sensitive generalization of the
model which could account for a collinear deficit. These experiments were
performed using a novel method for automated high-throughput training and
testing of visual behavior in rodents.
