High precision vector and tensor analyzing powers of elastic deuteron-proton
d+p scattering have been measured at intermediate energies to investigate
effects of three-nucleon forces (3NF). Angular distribution in the range of
70-120 degree in the center-of mass frame for incident-deuteron energies of 130
and 180 MeV were obtained using the RIKEN facility. The beam polarization was
unambiguously determined by measuring the 12C(d,alpha)10B(2+) reaction at 0
degree. Results of the measurements are compared with state-of-the-art
three-nucleon calculations. The present modeling of nucleon-nucleon forces and
its extension to the three-nucleon system is not sufficient to describe the
high precision data consistently and requires, therefore, further
investigation.
