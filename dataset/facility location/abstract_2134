One of the five key science projects for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is
"The Origin and Evolution of Cosmic Magnetism", in which radio polarimetry will
be used to reveal what cosmic magnets look like and what role they have played
in the evolving Universe. Many of the SKA prototypes now being built are also
targeting magnetic fields and polarimetry as key science areas. Here I review
the prospects for innovative new polarimetry and Faraday rotation experiments
with forthcoming facilities such as ASKAP, LOFAR, the ATA, the EVLA, and
ultimately the SKA. Sensitive wide-field polarisation surveys with these
telescopes will provide a dramatic new view of magnetic fields in the Milky
Way, in nearby galaxies and clusters, and in the high-redshift Universe.
