We describe an experiment to measure the mass of the Milky Way galaxy. The
experiment is based on calculated light travel times along orthogonal
directions in the Schwarzschild metric of the Galactic center. We show that the
difference is proportional to the Galactic mass. We apply the result to light
travel times in a 10cm Michelson type interferometer located on Earth. The mass
of the Galactic center is shown to contribute 10^-6 to the flat space component
of the metric. An experiment is proposed to measure the effect.
