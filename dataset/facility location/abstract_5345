Debris dust in the habitable zones of stars - otherwise known as exozodiacal
dust - comes from extrasolar asteroids and comets and is thus an expected part
of a planetary system. Background flux from the Solar System's zodiacal dust
and the exozodiacal dust in the target system is likely to be the largest
source of astrophysical noise in direct observations of terrestrial planets in
the habitable zones of nearby stars. Furthermore, dust structures like clumps,
thought to be produced by dynamical interactions with exoplanets, are a
possible source of confusion. In this paper, we qualitatively assess the
primary impact of exozodical dust on high-contrast direct imaging at optical
wavelengths, such as would be performed with a coronagraph. Then we present the
sensitivity of previous, current, and near-term facilities to thermal emission
from debris dust at all distances from nearby solar-type stars, as well as our
current knowledge of dust levels from recent surveys. Finally, we address the
other method of detecting debris dust, through high-contrast imaging in
scattered light. This method is currently far less sensitive than thermal
emission observations, but provides high spatial resolution for studying dust
structures. This paper represents the first report of NASA's Exoplanet
Exploration Program Analysis Group (ExoPAG).
