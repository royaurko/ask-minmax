Metal-poor massive stars may typically end up their lives as blue supergiants
(BSGs). Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from such progenitors could have ultra-long
duration of relativistic jets. For example Population III (Pop III) GRBs at z ~
10-20 might be observable as X-ray rich events with a typical duration of T_90
~ 10^4(1+z) sec. Recent GRB111209A at z = 0.677 has an ultra long duration of
T_90 ~ 2.5*10^4 sec so that it have been suggested that the progenitor might be
a metal-poor BSGs in the local universe. Here, we suggest luminous
UV/optical/infrared emissions associated with such a new class of GRB from
metal poor BSGs. Before the jet head breaks out the progenitor envelope, the
energy injected by the jet is stored in a hot-plasma cocoon, which finally
emerges and expands as a baryon-loaded fireball. We show that the photospheric
emissions from the cocoon fireball could be intrinsically very bright (L_peak ~
10^(42-44) erg/sec) in UV/optical bands (E_peak ~ 10 eV) with a typical
duration of ~ 100 days in the rest frame. Such cocoon emissions from Pop III
GRB might be detectable in infrared bands at ~ years after Pop III GRBs at up
to z ~ 15 by up-coming facilities like JWST. We also suggest that GRB111209A
might have been rebrightening in UV/optical bands up to an AB magnitude of <
26. The cocoon emissions from local metal-poor BSGs might have been already
observed as luminous supernovae without GRB since they can be seen from the
off-axis direction of the jet.
