This paper addresses the problem of localizing audio sources using binaural
measurements. We propose a supervised formulation that simultaneously localizes
multiple sources at different locations. The approach is intrinsically
efficient because, contrary to prior work, it relies neither on source
separation, nor on monaural segregation. The method starts with a training
stage that establishes a locally-linear Gaussian regression model between the
directional coordinates of all the sources and the auditory features extracted
from binaural measurements. While fixed-length wide-spectrum sounds (white
noise) are used for training to reliably estimate the model parameters, we show
that the testing (localization) can be extended to variable-length
sparse-spectrum sounds (such as speech), thus enabling a wide range of
realistic applications. Indeed, we demonstrate that the method can be used for
audio-visual fusion, namely to map speech signals onto images and hence to
spatially align the audio and visual modalities, thus enabling to discriminate
between speaking and non-speaking faces. We release a novel corpus of real-room
recordings that allow quantitative evaluation of the co-localization method in
the presence of one or two sound sources. Experiments demonstrate increased
accuracy and speed relative to several state-of-the-art methods.
