Complementary angle-resolved photoemission and bulk-sensitive k-resolved
resonant inelastic x-ray scattering of divalent hexaborides reveal a >1 eV
X-point gap between the valence and conduction bands, in contradiction to the
band overlap assumed in several models of their novel ferromagnetism. This
semiconducting gap implies that carriers detected in transport measurements
arise from defects, and the measured location of the bulk Fermi level at the
bottom of the conduction band implicates boron vacancies as the origin of the
excess electrons. The measured band structure and X-point gap in CaB_6
additionally provide a stringent test case for proper inclusion of many-body
effects in quasi-particle band calculations.
