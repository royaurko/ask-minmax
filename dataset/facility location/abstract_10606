The linear instability and nonlinear dynamics of collisional (resistive) and
collisionless (due to electron inertia) double tearing modes (DTMs) are
compared with the use of a reduced cylindrical model of a tokamak plasma. We
focus on cases where two q = 2 resonant surfaces are located a small distance
apart. It is found that regardless of the magnetic reconnection mechanism,
resistivity or electron inertia, the fastest growing linear eigenmodes may have
high poloidal mode numbers m ~ 10. The spectrum of unstable modes tends to be
broader in the collisionless case. In the nonlinear regime, it is shown that in
both cases fast growing high-m DTMs lead to an annular collapse involving small
magnetic island structures. In addition, collisionless DTMs exhibit multiple
reconnection cycles due to reversibility of collisionless reconnection and
strong ExB flows. Collisionless reconnection leads to a saturated stable state,
while in the collisional case resistive decay keeps the system weakly dynamic
by driving it back towards the unstable equilibrium maintained by a source
term.
