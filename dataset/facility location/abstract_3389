The associated strangeness dissociation at threshold has been studied at the
COSY-11 facility measuring the hyperon - and the K+K- meson pair production.
Measurements of the near threshold Lambda and Sigma0 production via the pp ->
pK+ Lambda / Sigma0 reaction at COSY-11 have shown that the Lambda / Sigma0
cross section ratio exceeds the value at high excess energies (Q >= 300 MeV) by
an order of magnitude. For a better understanding additional data have been
taken between 13 MeV and 60 MeV excess energy.
  The near threshold production of the charged kaon-antikaon pair is related to
the discussion about the nature of the scalar states in the 1 GeV/c^2 mass
range, i.e. the f0(980) and a0(980). The interpretation as a K anti-K molecule
is strongly dependent on the K anti-K interaction which can be studied via the
production channel. A first total cross section value on the reaction pp ->
ppK+K- at an excess energy of 17 MeV i.e. below the phi production threshold
was measured.
