We present the radio detection of 18 BL Lac objects from our survey of over
575 square degrees of sky. These 18 objects are located within 20 arcsec of the
X-ray position, of which 11 have a measured red-shift. All candidates are radio
emitters above ~1 mJy and fall within the range of existing samples on the two
colour, alpha_ro vs alpha_ox, diagram with a transitional population of three
(3) evident. Two unusual sources have been identified, a candidate radio quiet
BL Lac, RX J0140.9-4130, and an extreme HBL, RX J0109.9-4020, with
Log(nu_peak)~19.2. The BL Lac Log(N)-Log(S) relation is consistent with other
samples and indicates the ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS) could contain (2000+-400)
BL Lac objects.
