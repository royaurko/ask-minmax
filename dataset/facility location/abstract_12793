Molecular dynamics simulations of two-dimensional soft Yukawa fluids are
performed to analyze the effect that the range of interaction has on coexisting
densities and line tension. The attractive one-component fluid and equimolar
mixtures containing positive and negative particles are studied at different
temperatures to locate the region where the vapor-solid and vapor-liquid phases
are stable. When the range of interaction decreases, the critical temperature
of the attractive one-component systems decreases. However, for the charged
mixtures it increases, and this opposite behaviour is understood in terms of
the repulsive interactions which are dominant for these systems. The stable
phase diagram of two-dimensional fluids is defined for smaller values of the
decay parameter \lambda\ than that of fluids in three dimensions. The
two-dimensional attractive one-component fluid has stable liquid-vapor phase
diagram for values of \lambda<3, in contrast to the three-dimensional case,
where stability has been observed even for values of \lambda<15. The same trend
is observed in equimolar mixtures of particles carrying opposite charges.
