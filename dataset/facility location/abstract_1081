Upgrades to the J-PARC accelerators and the neutrino experimental facility
are of vital importance to the Tokai to Hyper-Kamiokande project (T2HK), which
aims to explore CP asymmetry by the $\nu_e$ appearance. In this talk I present
overview of the T2HK project, current status of the beam operation at J-PARC,
and prospect to realize the rated 750 kW operation in coming years.
