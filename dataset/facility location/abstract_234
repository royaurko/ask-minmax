PILOT (the Pathfinder for an International Large Optical Telescope) is a
proposed 2.5 m optical/infrared telescope to be located at Dome C on the
Antarctic plateau. Conditions at Dome C are known to be exceptional for
astronomy. The seeing (above ~30 m height), coherence time, and isoplanatic
angle are all twice s good as at typical mid-latitude sites, while the
water-vapour column, and the atmosphere and telescope thermal emission are all
an order of magnitude better. These conditions enable a unique scientific
capability for PILOT, which is addressed in this series of papers. The current
paper presents an overview of the optical and instrumentation suite for PILO
and its expected performance, a summary of the key science goals and
observational approach for the facility, a discussion of the synergies between
the science goals for PILOT and other telescopes, and a discussion of the
future of Antarctic astronomy. Paper II and Paper III present details of the
science projects divided, respectively, between the distant Universe (i.e.,
studies of first light, and the assembly and evolution of structure) and the
nearby Universe (i.e., studies of Local Group galaxies, the Milky Way, and the
Solar System).
