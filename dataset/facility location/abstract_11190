Generation of wave structures by a two-dimensional object (laser beam) moving
in a two-dimensional two-component Bose-Einstein condensate with a velocity
greater than both sound velocities of the mixture is studied by means of
analytical methods and systematic simulations of the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii
equations. The wave pattern features three regions separated by two Mach cones.
Two branches of linear patterns similar to the so-called "ship waves" are
located outside the corresponding Mach cones, and oblique dark solitons are
found inside the wider cone. An analytical theory is developed for the linear
patterns. A particular dark-soliton solution is also obtained, its stability is
investigated, and two unstable modes of transverse perturbations are
identified. It is shown that, for a sufficiently large flow velocity, this
instability has a convective character in the reference frame attached to the
moving body, which makes the dark soliton effectively stable. The analytical
findings are corroborated by numerical simulations.
