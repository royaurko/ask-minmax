Using radio sources from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm
(FIRST) survey, and optical counterparts in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS), we have identified a large number of galaxy clusters. The radio sources
within these clusters are driven by active galactic nuclei, and our cluster
samples include clusters with bent, and straight, double-lobed radio sources.
We also included a single-radio-component comparison sample. We examine these
galaxy clusters for evidence of optical substructure, testing the possibility
that bent double-lobed radio sources are formed as a result of large-scale
cluster mergers. We use a suite of substructure analysis tools to determine the
location and extent of substructure visible in the optical distribution of
cluster galaxies, and compare the rates of substructure in clusters with
different types of radio sources. We found no preference for significant
substructure in clusters hosting bent double-lobed radio sources compared to
those with other types of radio sources.
