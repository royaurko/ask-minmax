The harmonic balance method (HBM) was originally developed for finding
periodic solutions of electronical and mechanical systems under a periodic
force, but has later been adapted to self-sustained musical instruments. Unlike
time-domain methods, this frequency-domain method does not capture transients
and so is not adapted for sound synthesis. However, its independence of time
makes it very useful for studying every periodic solution of the model, whether
stable or unstable without care of initial conditions. A computer program for
solving general problems involving nonlinearly coupled exciter and resonator,
Harmbal, has been developed based on the HBM. The method as well as convergence
improvements and continuations facilities are thorougly presented and discussed
in the present paper. Application of the method is demonstrated on various
problems related to a common model of the clarinet: a reed modelled as a simple
spring with and without mass and damping, a nonlinear coupling and a cubic
simplification of it, and a cylindrical bore with or without dissipation and
dispersion as well as a bore formed as a stepped cone.
