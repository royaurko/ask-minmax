In 2006 February, shortly after its launch, Swift began monitoring the center
of the Milky Way with the onboard X-Ray Telescope using short 1-ks exposures
performed every 1-4 days. Between 2006 and 2014, over 1200 observations have
been obtained, amounting to ~1.2 Ms of exposure time. This has yielded a wealth
of information about the long-term X-ray behavior of the supermassive black
hole Sgr A*, and numerous transient X-ray binaries that are located within the
25'x25' region covered by the campaign. In this review we highlight the
discoveries made during these first nine years, which includes 1) the detection
of seven bright X-ray flares from Sgr A*, 2) the discovery of the magnetar SGR
J1745-29, 3) the first systematic analysis of the outburst light curves and
energetics of the peculiar class of very-faint X-ray binaries, 4) the discovery
of three new transient X-ray sources, 5) exposing low-level accretion in
otherwise bright X-ray binaries, and 6) the identification of a candidate X-ray
binary/millisecond radio pulsar transitional object. We also reflect on future
science to be done by continuing this Swift's legacy campaign of the Galactic
center, which includes high-cadence monitoring of how the interaction between
the gaseous object `G2' and Sgr A* plays out in the future.
