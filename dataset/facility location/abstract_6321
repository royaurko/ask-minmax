An analysis is presented of the phase vortices generated in the far field, by
an arbitrary arrangement of three monochromatic point sources of complex
spherical waves. In contrast with the case of three interfering plane waves, in
which an infinitely-extended vortex lattice is generated, the spherical sources
generate a finite number of phase vortices. Analytical expressions for the
vortex core locations are developed and shown to have a convenient
representation in a discrete parameter space. Our analysis may be mapped onto
the case of a coherently-illuminated Young's interferometer, in which the
screen is punctured by three rather than two pinholes.
