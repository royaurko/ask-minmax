The use of artificial defects is known to enhance the superconducting
critical parameters of thin films. In the case of conventional superconductors,
regular arrays of submicron holes (antidots) substantially increase the
critical temperature Tc(H) and critical current Ic(H) for all fields. Using
electrical transport measurements, we study the effect of placing an additional
small antidot in the unit cell of the array. This composite antidot lattice
consists of two interpenetrating antidot square arrays with a different antidot
size and the same lattice period. The smaller antidots are located exactly at
the centers of the cells of the array of large antidots. We show that the
composite antidot lattice can trap a higher number of flux quanta per unit cell
inside the antidots, compared to a reference antidot film without the
additional small antidots in the center of the cells. As a consequence, the
field range in which an enhanced critical current is observed is considerably
expanded. Finally, the possible stable vortex lattice patterns at several
matching fields are determined by molecular dynamics simulations.
