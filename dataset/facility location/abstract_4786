The small mission A-STAR (All-Sky Transient Astrophysics Reporter) aims to
locate the X-ray counterparts to ALIGO and other gravitational wave detector
sources, to study the poorly-understood low luminosity gamma-ray bursts, and to
find a wide variety of transient high-energy source types, A-STAR will survey
the entire available sky twice per 24 hours. The payload consists of a coded
mask instrument, Owl, operating in the novel low energy band 4-150 keV, and a
sensitive wide-field focussing soft X-ray instrument, Lobster, working over
0.15-5 keV. A-STAR will trigger on ~100 GRBs/yr, rapidly distributing their
locations.
