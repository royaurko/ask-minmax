We conducted the astrometry of H2O masers in the Galactic star-forming region
Onsala 1 (ON1) with VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA). We measured a
trigonometric parallax of 0.404+/-0.017 mas, corresponding to a distance of
2.47+/-0.11 kpc. ON1 is appeared to be located near the tangent point at the
Galactic longitude of 69.54 deg. We estimate the angular velocity of the
Galactic rotation at Sun, the ratio of the distance from Sun to the Galactic
center and the Galactic rotation velocity at Sun, to be 28.7+/-1.3 km/s/kpc
using the measured distance and proper motion of ON1. This value is larger than
the IAU recommended value of 25.9 km/s/kpc, but consistent with other results
recently obtained with the VLBI technique.
