We proposed the agent-based model of financial markets where agents (or
traders) are represented by three-state spins located on the plane lattice or
social network. The spin variable represents only the individual opinion
(advice) that each trader gives to his nearest neighbors. In the model the
agents can be considered as cunning. For instance, although agent having
currently a maximal value of the spin advises his nearest neighbors to buy some
stocks he, perfidiously, will sell some stocks in the next Monte Carlo step or
will occupy a neutral position. In general, the trader has three possibilities:
he can buy some stocks if his opinion change within a single time step is
positive, sell some stocks if this change is negative, or remain inactive if
his opinion is unchanged. The predictions of our model, found by simulations,
well agree with the empirical universal distribution of interoccurrence times
between daily losses below negative thresholds following the Tsallis
q-exponential.
