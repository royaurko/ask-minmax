A new dynamic line, the Frenkel line, has recently been proposed to separate
the supercritical state into rigid-liquid and non-rigid gas-like uid. The
location of Frenkel line on the phase diagram is unknown for real uids. Here,
we map the Frenkel line for three important systems: CO2, H2O and CH4. This
provides an important demarcation on the phase diagram of these systems, the
demarcation that separates two distinct physical states with liquid-like and
gas-like properties. We ?nd that the Frenkel line can have similar trend as the
melting line above the critical pressure. Moreover, we discuss the relationship
between unexplained solubility maxima and Frenkel line, and propose that the
Frenkel line corresponds to the optimal conditions for solubility.
