This is a paper on young jet material in a frustratingly complex environment.
  NGC 1052 has a compact, flat- or GHz-peaked-spectrum radio nucleus consisting
of bi-symmetric jets, oriented close to the plane of the sky. Many features on
both sides move away at v_app~0.26c (H_0=65 km/s/Mpc). VLBI at seven
frequencies shows a wide range of spectral shapes and brightness temperatures;
there is clearly free-free absorption, probably together with synchrotron
self-absorption, on both sides of the core. The absorbing structure is likely
to be geometrically thick and oriented roughly orthogonal to the jets, but it
is patchy.
  HI VLBI shows atomic gas in front of the approaching as well as the receding
jet. There appear to be three velocity systems, at least two of which are local
to the AGN environment. The "high velocity system", 125 to 200 km/s redward of
systemic, seems restricted to a shell 1 to 2 pc away from the core. Closer to
the centre, this gas might be largely ionised; it could cause the free-free
absorption.
  WSRT spectroscopy shows 1667 and 1665 MHz OH absorption over a wide velocity
range. OH and HI profile similarity suggests co-location of molecular and
atomic ``high velocity'' gas; the connection to H2O masing gas is unclear.
Further, at ``high velocity'' we detected the OH 1612 MHz satellite line in
absorption and the 1720 MHz line in emission, with complementary strengths.
