During the Astro-1 and Astro-2 Space Shuttle missions in 1990 and 1995, far
ultraviolet (FUV) images of five 40' diameter fields around the rim of the
Cygnus Loop supernova remnant were observed with the Ultraviolet Imaging
Telescope (UIT). These fields sampled a broad range of conditions including
both radiative and nonradiative shocks in various geometries and physical
scales. In these shocks, the UIT B5 band samples predominantly CIV 1550 and the
hydrogen two-photon recombination continuum. Smaller contri- butions are made
by emission lines of HeII 1640 and OIII] 1665. We present these new FUV images
and compare them with optical Halpha and [OIII], and ROSAT HRI X-ray images.
Comparing the UIT images with those from the other bands provides new insights
into the spatial variations and locations of these different types of emission.
By comparing against shock model calculations and published FUV spectroscopy at
select locations, we surmise that resonance scattering in the strong FUV
permitted lines is widespread in the Cygnus Loop, especially in the bright
optical filaments typically selected for observation in most previous studies.
