We discuss how knowledge of the whole evolutionary history of dwarf galaxies,
including details on the early star formation events, can provide insight on
the origin of the different dwarf galaxy types. We suggest that these types may
be imprinted by the early conditions of formation rather than being only the
result of a recent morphological transformation driven by environmental
effects. We present precise star formation histories of a sample of Local Group
dwarf galaxies, derived from colour-magnitude diagrams reaching the oldest
main-sequence turnoffs. We argue that these galaxies can be assigned to two
basic types: fast dwarfs that started their evolution with a dominant and short
star formation event, and slow dwarfs that formed a small fraction of their
stars early and have continued forming stars until the present time (or
almost). These two different evolutionary paths do not map directly onto the
present-day morphology (dwarf spheroidal vs dwarf irregular). Slow and fast
dwarfs also differ in their inferred past location relative to the Milky Way
and/or M31, which hints that slow dwarfs were generally assembled in lower
density environments than fast dwarfs. We propose that the distinction between
a fast and slow dwarf galaxy reflects primarily the characteristic density of
the environment where they form. At a later stage, interaction with a large
host galaxy may play a role in the final gas removal and ultimate termination
of star formation.
