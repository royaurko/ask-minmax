The current status of the search for the critical end point on the lattice
and in experiments is discussed. A naive extrapolation is given of lattice
results on the location of the critical end point to the continuum limit with
the correct pion mass. An interpretation of current results on fluctuations is
provided. A new method of analysis of experimental data is discussed, which
provides a check on the removal of backgrounds, comparisons with QCD, and
signals an approach to the critical end point.
