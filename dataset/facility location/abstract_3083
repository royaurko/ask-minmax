A recent way to model and analyze downlink cellular networks is by using
random spatial models. Assuming user equipment (UE) distribution to be uniform,
the analysis is performed at a typical UE located at the origin. While this
method of sampling UEs provides statistics averaged over the UE locations, it
is not possible to sample cell interior and cell edge UEs separately. This
complicates the problem of analyzing deployment scenarios involving non-uniform
distribution of UEs, especially when the locations of the UEs and the base
stations (BSs) are dependent. To facilitate this separation, we propose a new
tractable method of sampling UEs by conditionally thinning the BS point process
and show that the resulting framework can be used as a tractable generative
model to study cellular networks with non-uniform UE distribution.
