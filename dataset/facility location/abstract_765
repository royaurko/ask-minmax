The time anomaly of neutrino events observed in the KARMEN detector at the
ISIS facility is discussed. We show that beam-correlated neutron events are not
completely suppressed by the KARMEN lower energy cut and could cause the
observed deviation of the measured time distribution from an exponential curve
with tau = 2.2 microseconds.
