PSR J1910-5959A is a binary pulsar with a helium white dwarf companion
located about 6 arcmin from the center of the globular cluster NGC6752. Based
on 12 years of observations at the Parkes radio telescope, the relativistic
Shapiro delay has been detected in this system. We obtain a companion mass Mc =
0.180+/-0.018Msun (1sigma) implying that the pulsar mass lies in the range
1.1Msun <= Mp <= 1.5Msun. We compare our results with previous optical
determinations of the companion mass, and examine prospects for using this new
measurement for calibrating the mass-radius relation for helium white dwarfs
and for investigating their evolution in a pulsar binary system. Finally we
examine the set of binary systems hosting a millisecond pulsar and a low mass
helium white dwarf for which the mass of both stars has been measured. We
confirm that the correlation between the companion mass and the orbital period
predicted by Tauris & Savonije reproduces the observed values but find that the
predicted Mp - Pb correlation over-estimates the neutron star mass by about
0.5Msun in the orbital period range covered by the observations. Moreover, a
few systems do not obey the observed Mp - Pb correlation. We discuss these
results in the framework of the mechanisms that inhibit the accretion of matter
by a neutron star during its evolution in a low-mass X-ray binary.
