We present the results of the asteroseismic analysis of the red-giant star
KIC 4351319 (TYC 3124-914-1), observed for 30 days in short-cadence mode with
the Kepler satellite. The analysis has allowed us to determine the large and
small frequency separations, and the frequency of maximum oscillation power.
The high signal-to-noise ratio of the observations allowed us to identify 25
independent pulsation modes whose frequencies range approximately from 300 to
500 muHz. The observed oscillation frequencies together with the accurate
determination of the atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, gravity and
metallicity), provided by additional ground-based spectroscopic observations,
enabled us to theoretically interpret the observed oscillation spectrum. KIC
4351319 appears to oscillate with a well defined solar-type p-modes pattern due
to radial acoustic modes and non-radial nearly pure p modes. In addition,
several non-radial mixed modes have been identified. Theoretical models well
reproduce the observed oscillation frequencies and indicate that this star,
located at the base of the ascending red-giant branch, is in the hydrogen-shell
burning phase, with a mass of about 1.3 solar masses, a radius of about 3.4
solar radii and an age of about 5.6 Gyr. The main parameters of this star have
been determined with an unprecedent level of precision for a red-giant star,
with uncertainties of 2% for mass, 7% for age, 1% for radius, and 4% for
luminosity.
