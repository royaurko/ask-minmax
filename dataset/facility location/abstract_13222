The newly released Orange D4D mobile phone data base provides new insights
into the use of mobile technology in a developing country. Here we perform a
series of spatial data analyses that reveal important geographic aspects of
mobile phone use in Cote d'Ivoire. We first map the locations of base stations
with respect to the population distribution and the number and duration of
calls at each base station. On this basis, we estimate the energy consumed by
the mobile phone network. Finally, we perform an analysis of inter-city
mobility, and identify high-traffic roads in the country.
