It is generally assumed that weakly bound (trapped) electrons in organic
solids come only from radiolytical (or photochemical) processes like ionization
caused by an excited positron entering the sample. This paper presents an
evidence for the presence of these electrons in non-irradiated samples of
docosane. We argue that these electrons can be located (trapped) either in
interlamellar gaps or in spaces made by non-planar conformers. The electrons
from the former ones are bound more weakly than those from the latter ones. The
origin of Vis absorption for the samples is explained. These spectra can be
used as a probe indicating differences in the solid structures of hydrocarbons.
