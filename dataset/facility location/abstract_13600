We study the weak anchoring condition for nematic liquid crystals in the
context of the Landau-De Gennes model. We restrict our attention to two
dimensional samples and to nematic director fields lying in the plane, for
which the Landau-De Gennes energy reduces to the Ginzburg--Landau functional,
and the weak anchoring condition is realized via a penalized boundary term in
the energy. We study the singular limit as the length scale parameter
$\varepsilon\to 0$, assuming the weak anchoring parameter
$\lambda=\lambda(\varepsilon)\to\infty$ at a prescribed rate. We also consider
a specific example of a bulk nematic liquid crystal with an included oil
droplet and derive a precise description of the defect locations for this
situation, for $\lambda(\varepsilon)=K\varepsilon^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha\in
(0,1]$. We show that defects lie on the weak anchoring boundary for $\alpha\in
(0,\frac12)$, or for $\alpha=\frac12$ and $K$ small, but they occur inside the
bulk domain $\Omega$ for $\alpha>\frac12$ or $\alpha=\frac12$ with $K$ large.
