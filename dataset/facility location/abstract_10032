We present two versions of a grid job submission system produced for the
BaBar experiment. Both use globus job submission to process data spread across
various sites, producing output which can be combined for analysis. The
problems encountered with contributorisation and authentication, data location, job
submission, and the input and output sandboxes are described, as are the
solutions. The total system is still some way short of the aims of enterprises
such as the EDG, but represent a significant step along the way.
