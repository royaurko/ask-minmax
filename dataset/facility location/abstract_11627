We use the "General Gauge Mediation" formalism to describe a 5D setup with an
$S^{1}/Z_{2}$ orbifold. We first consider a model independent SUSY breaking
hidden sector on one boundary and generic chiral matter on another. Using the
definition of GGM, the effects of the hidden sector are contained in a set of
global symmetry current correlator functions and is mediated through the bulk.
We find the gaugino, sfermion and hyperscalar mass formulas for minimal and
generalised messengers in different regimes of a large, small and intermediate
extra dimension. Then we use the 5D GGM formalism to construct a model in which
an SU(5) ISS model is located on the hidden boundary. We weakly gauge a global
symmetry of the ISS model and associate it with the bulk vector superfield.
Compared to 4D GGM, there is a natural way to adjust the gaugino versus
sfermion mass ratio by a factor $(M l)^{2}$, where M is a characteristic mass
scale of the SUSY breaking sector and l is the length of the extra dimension.
