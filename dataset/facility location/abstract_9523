Current observational constraints on the dynamical evolution of star clusters
are reviewed. Theory and observations now agree nicely on the mass dependency
and time scales for disruption of young star clusters in galactic disks, but
many problems still await resolution. The origin of the mass function of old
globular clusters, and its (near) invariance with respect to host galaxy
properties and location within the host galaxy remain prominent puzzles. Most
current models fail to reproduce the globular cluster mass function as a result
of dynamical evolution from an initial power-law, except under very specific
conditions which are not generally consistent with observations. How well do we
actually know the proper initial conditions? The cluster initial mass function
(CIMF) seems to be consistent with a power-law with exponent alpha~ -2 in most
present-day star forming galaxies, but the limits of the mass range over which
this approximation is valid remain poorly constrained both observationally and
theoretically. Furthermore, there are hints that some dwarf galaxies may have
CIMFs which deviate from a power-law.
