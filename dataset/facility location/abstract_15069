We present Chandra observations of the galaxy cluster AC114, which shows a
strongly irregular morphology, with signs of multiple merging activity. We
report the discovery of a soft X-ray filament originating close to the core of
the cluster. We confirm that X-ray emission is associated with two of three
mass concentrations identified in previous gravitational lensing studies of
this object. These two mass concentrations are located at opposite ends of the
soft filament, evidence for interaction between them. In the northern part, the
cluster shows two sharp discontinuities, both in surface brightness and in
temperature, evincing another, more recent merger event which took place in, or
close, to the cluster core. In spite of the merger activity, a combined mass
and lensing analysis shows remarkably good agreement between lensing and X-ray
masses. We therefore advocate for the robustness of the X-ray mass estimates,
and conclude that the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium can yield accurate
mass estimates even in clusters as dynamically active as AC 114, once the gas
density distribution is properly mapped.
