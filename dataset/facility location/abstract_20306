Results are presented for an initial survey of the Norma Arm gathered with
the focusing hard X-ray telescope NuSTAR. The survey covers 0.2 deg$^2$ of sky
area in the 3-79 keV range with a minimum and maximum raw depth of 15 ks and
135 ks, respectively. Besides a bright black-hole X-ray binary in outburst (4U
1630-47) and a new X-ray transient (NuSTAR J163433-473841), NuSTAR locates
three sources from the Chandra survey of this region whose spectra are extended
above 10 keV for the first time: CXOU J163329.5-473332, CXOU J163350.9-474638,
and CXOU J163355.1-473804. Imaging, timing, and spectral data from a broad
X-ray range (0.3-79 keV) are analyzed and interpreted with the aim of
classifying these objects. CXOU J163329.5-473332 is either a cataclysmic
variable or a faint low-mass X-ray binary. CXOU J163350.9-474638 varies in
intensity on year-long timescales, and with no multi-wavelength counterpart, it
could be a distant X-ray binary or possibly a magnetar. CXOU J163355.1-473804
features a helium-like iron line at 6.7 keV and is classified as a nearby
cataclysmic variable. Additional surveys are planned for the Norma Arm and
Galactic Center, and those NuSTAR observations will benefit from the lessons
learned during this pilot study.
