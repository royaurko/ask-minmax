The identification of celestial gamma-ray sources with astronomical objects
or object classes has remained the initial and most fundamental key for
understanding their physical nature. The observational characteristic of a
gamma-ray emitter and the conditions under which an astronomical object is able
to produce energetic gamma-ray emission defines the range of candidates
available for source identifications. The main obstacle must be seen in the
fact that a gamma-ray source location is often imprecise, a flux history could
only be established on the basis of weeks, and uncertainties in the gamma-ray
observables are considerably large. Therefore coordinated multifrequency
follow-up campaigns or spatial-statistical methods are required to assign
proper counterpart identifications. Although Active Galactic Nuclei and pulsars
are uniquely identified EGRET sources, many other gamma-ray sources still
remain unidentified. I will review properties of the population and highlight
the characteristics of potential counterparts of the still unidentified
gamma-ray sources detected by EGRET.
