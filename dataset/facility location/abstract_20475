A Li-rich red giant star (2M19411367+4003382) recently discovered in the
direction of NGC 6819 belongs to the rare subset of Li-rich stars that have not
yet evolved to the luminosity bump, an evolutionary stage where models predict
Li can be replenished. The currently favored model to explain Li enhancement in
first-ascent red giants like 2M19411367+4003382 requires deep mixing into the
stellar interior. Testing this model requires a measurement of 12C/13C, which
is possible to obtain from APOGEE spectra. However, the Li-rich star also has
abnormal asteroseismic properties that call into question its membership in the
cluster, even though its radial velocity and location on color-magnitude
diagrams are consistent with membership. To address these puzzles, we have
measured a wide array of abundances in the Li-rich star and three comparison
stars using spectra taken as part of the APOGEE survey to determine the degree
of stellar mixing, address the question of membership, and measure the surface
gravity. We confirm that the Li-rich star is a red giant with the same overall
chemistry as the other cluster giants. However, its log g is significantly
lower, consistent with the asteroseismology results and suggestive of a very
low mass if the star is indeed a cluster member. Regardless of the cluster
membership, the 12C/13C and C/N ratios of the Li-rich star are consistent with
standard first dredge-up, indicating that Li dilution has already occurred, and
inconsistent with internal Li enrichment scenarios that require deep mixing.
