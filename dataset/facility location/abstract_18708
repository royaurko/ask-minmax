Photometric transit surveys promise to complement the currently known sample
of extra-solar planets by providing additional information on the planets and
especially their radii. Here we present extra-solar planet (ESP) candidates
from one such survey called, the Wide Angle Search for Planets (WASP) obtained
with the SuperWASP wide-field imaging system. Observations were taken with
SuperWASP-North located in La Palma during the April to October 2004 observing
season. The data cover fields between 23hr and 03hr in RA at declinations above
+12. This amounts to over $\approx$400,000 stars with V magnitudes 8 to 13.5.
For the stars brighter than 12.5, we achieve better than 1 percent photometric
precision. Here we present 41 sources with low amplitude variability between
$\approx$ 1 and 10 mmag, from which we select 12 with periods between 1.2 and
4.4 days as the most promising extrasolar planet candidates. We discuss the
properties of these ESP candidates, the expected fraction of transits recovered
for our sample, and implications for the frequency and detection of
hot-Jupiters.
