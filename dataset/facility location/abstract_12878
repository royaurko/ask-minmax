We perform a statistical study of permanent changes in longitudinal fields
associated with solar flares by tracking magnetic features. The YAFTA feature
tracking algorithm is applied to GONG++ one-minute magnetograms for 77 X-class
and M-class flares to analyze the evolution and interaction of the magnetic
features and to estimate the amount of canceled magnetic flux. We find that
significantly more magnetic flux decreases than increases occurred during the
flares, consistent with a model of collapsing loop structure for flares.
Correlations between both total (unsigned) and net (signed) flux changes and
the GOES peak X-ray flux are dominated by X-class flares at limb locations. The
flux changes were accompanied in most cases by significant cancellation, most
of which occurred during the flares. We find that the field strength and
complexity near the polarity inversion line are approximately equally important
in the flux cancellation processes that accompany the flares. We do not find a
correlation between the flux cancellation events and the stepwise changes in
the magnetic flux in the region.
