Does three-dimensional incompressible Euler flow with smooth initial
conditions develop a singularity with infinite vorticity after a finite time?
This blowup problem is still open. After briefly reviewing what is known and
pointing out some of the difficulties, we propose to tackle this issue for the
class of flows having analytic initial data for which hypothetical real
singularities are preceded by singularities at complex locations. We present
some results concerning the nature of complex space singularities in two
dimensions and propose a new strategy for the numerical investigation of
blowup.(A version of the paper with higher-quality figures is available at
