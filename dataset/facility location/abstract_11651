We discuss a very peculiar subgroup of gamma-ray bursts among the BATSE
sources. These bursts are very short ($T_{90} \le $0.1 s), hard, and came
predominantly from a restricted direction of the sky (close to the Galactic
anti-center). We analyze their arrival times and possible correlations, as well
as the profiles of individual bursts. We find no peculiarities in the arrival
times of Very Short Bursts (VSBs) despite their highly non-uniform spatial
distribution. There is no dependence in the burst shapes on location. Bursts
coming both from the burst-enhancement Galactic Anticenter region and from all
other directions show considerable dispersion in their rise and fall times.
Significant fraction of VSBs have multiple peaks despite their extremely short
duration. Burst time properties are most likely to be consistent with two
origin mechanisms: either with binary NS-NS mergers with low total masses
passing through a phase of hypermassive neutron star, or with evaporation of
the primordial black holes in the scenario of no photosphere formation.
