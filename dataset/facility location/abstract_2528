Several laboratory facilities were used to benchmark theoretical spectral
models those extensively used by astronomical communities. However there are
still many differences between astrophysical environments and laboratory
miniatures that can be archived. Here we setup a spectral analysis system for
astrophysical and laboratory (SASAL) plasmas to make a bridge between them, and
investigate the effects from non-thermal electrons, contribution from
metastable level-population on level populations and charge stage distribution
for coronal-like, photoionized, and geocoronal plasmas. Test applications to
laboratory measurement (i.e. EBIT plasma) and astrophysical observation (i.e.
Comet, Cygnus X-3) are presented. Time evolution of charge stage and level
population are also explored for collisional and photoionized plasmas.
