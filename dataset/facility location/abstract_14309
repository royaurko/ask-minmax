We consider the problem of modeling, estimating, and controlling the latent
state of a spatiotemporally evolving continuous function using very few sensor
measurements and actuator locations. Our solution to the problem consists of
two parts: a predictive model of functional evolution, and feedback based
estimator and controllers that can robustly recover the state of the model and
drive it to a desired function. We show that layering a dynamical systems prior
over temporal evolution of weights of a kernel model is a valid approach to
spatiotemporal modeling that leads to systems theoretic, control-usable,
predictive models. We provide sufficient conditions on the number of sensors
and actuators required to guarantee observability and controllability. The
approach is validated on a large real dataset, and in simulation for the
control of spatiotemporally evolving function.
