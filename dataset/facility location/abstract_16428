This is the first of four papers that study algebraic and analytic structures
associated to the Lerch zeta function. This paper studies "zeta integrals"
associated to the Lerch zeta function using test functions, and obtains
functional equations for them. Special cases include a pair of symmetrized
four-term functional equations for combinations of Lerch zeta functions, found
by A. Weil, for real parameters (a,c) with 0< a, c< 1. It extends these
functions to real a, and c, and studies limiting cases of these functions where
at least one of a and c takes the values 0 or 1. A main feature is that as a
function of three variables (s, a, c), with a, c being real variables, the
Lerch zeta function has discontinuities at integer values of a and c. For fixed
s, the function is discontinuous on part of the boundary of the closed unit
square in the (a,c)-variables, and the location and nature of these
discontinuities depend on the real part of s. Analysis of this behavior is used
to determine membership of these functions in L^p([0,1]^2, da dc) for 1 \le p <
\infty, as a function of the real part of s. The paper also defines generalized
Lerch zeta functions associated to the oscillator representation, and gives
analogous four-term functional equations for them.
