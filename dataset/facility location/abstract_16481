In this proceedings we summarize our calculation of the phase diagram of QCD
at non-zero temperature and chemical potential on S^1 x S^3 from one-loop
perturbation theory [1], which is valid in the limit R << 1/Lambda, where R is
the radius of S^3. We calculate several observables including the Polyakov
lines and the quark number, for large number of colors N and large number of
quark flavors Nf, on S^1 x S^3, and compare with results for the same system
with N = 3, and with results for N=2 lattice QCD. For N > 2 the action is
complex and the dominant contributions to the path integral occur in the space
of complexified gauge field configurations. This results in the expectation
values of the eigenvalues of the Polyakov line lying off the unit circle and
out in the complex plane. This is an important issue for the lattice, and also
for the calculation on S^1 x S^3 in the large N limit where we obtain
analytical results using the saddle point approximation. It is thus necessary
to adapt available techniques to locate the stationary solutions in the
complexified gauge field configuration space.
