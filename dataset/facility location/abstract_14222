Actin is a globular protein which forms long polar filaments in the
eukaryotic cytoskeleton. Actin networks play a key role in cell mechanics and
cell motility. They have also been implicated in information transmission and
processing, memory and learning in neuronal cells. The acting filaments have
been shown to support propagation of voltage pulses. Here we apply a coupled
nonlinear transmission line model of actin filaments to study interactions
between voltage pulses. By assigning a logical {\sc Truth} to the presence of a
voltage pulses in a given location of the actin filament, and {\sc False} to
the pulse's absence we represent digital information transmission along these
filaments. When two pulses, representing Boolean values of input variables,
interact, then they can facilitate or inhibit further propagation of each
other. We explore this phenomenon to construct Boolean logical gates and a
one-bit half-adder with interacting voltage pulses. We discuss implications of
these findings on cellular process and technological applications.
