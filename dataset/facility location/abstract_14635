We present a new geometrical method which uses weak gravitational lensing
effects in clusters to constrain the cosmological parameters Omega and Lambda.
On each background galaxy, a cluster induces a convergence and a shear terms,
which depend on the cluster projected potential, and on the cosmological
parameters (Omega,Lambda), through the angular distance ratio D_{LS}/D_{OS}. To
disentangle the effects of these three quantities, we compare the relative
values of the ellipticities for each triplet of galaxies located at about the
same position in the lens plane, but having different color redshifts. The
simultaneous knowledge of the ellipticities and photometric redshifts enable to
build a purely geometrical estimator of (Omega,Lambda) which does not depend on
the lens potential.A calculation and comparison of each source of statistical
noise is performed. We also analyzed the systematics.Simulations lead to
encouraging constraints on the curvature of the Universe and can discriminate
an open from a flat Universe. The test can also provide constraints on Lambda.
By using 20 VLT nights to observe 100 clusters, we can reach
Lambda_{-0.2}^{+0.3} for \Omega+\Lambda=1, or Omega_{-0.25}^{+0.3} for
\Lambda=0. The method is even better adapted to a large program on the NGST.
