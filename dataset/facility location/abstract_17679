We explore the use of spectro-polarimetry as a remote sensing tool for
asteroids in addition to traditional reflectance measurements. In particular we
are interested in possible relationships between the wavelength-dependent
variation of linear polarization and the properties of the surfaces, including
albedo and composition.
  We have obtained optical spectro-polarimetric measurements of a dozen
asteroids of different albedo and taxonomic classes and of two small regions at
the limb of the Moon.
  We found that objects with marginally different relative reflectance spectra
(in the optical) may have totally different polarization spectra. This suggests
that spectro-polarimetry may be used to refine the classification of asteroids.
We also found that in some cases the Umov law may be violated, that is, in
contrast to what is expected from basic physical considerations, the fraction
of linear polarization and the reflectance may be positively correlated. In
agreement with a few previous studies based on multi-colour broadband
polarimetry, we found that the variation of linear polarization with wavelength
and with phase-angle is correlated with the albedo and taxonomic class of the
objects. Finally, we have serendipitously discovered that spinel-rich asteroid
(599) Luisa, located very close to the Watsonia family, is a member of the rare
class of Barbarian asteroids.
  We suggest that future modelling attempts of the surface structure of
asteroids should be aimed at explaining both reflectance and polarization
spectra.
