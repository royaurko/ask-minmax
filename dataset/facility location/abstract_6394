We show the existence of a critical endpoint in the phase diagram of
unzipping of an adsorbed double-stranded (ds) polymer like DNA. The competition
of base pairing, adsorption and stretching by an external force leads to the
critical end point. From exact results, the location of the critical end point
is determined and its classical nature established.
