We have explored the ideas that parametric resonance affects nearly geodesic
motion around a black hole or a neutron star, and that it may be relevant to
the high frequency (twin) quasi-periodic oscillations occurring in some
low-mass X-ray binaries. We have assumed the particles or fluid elements of an
accretion disc to be subject to an isotropic perturbation of a hypothetical but
rather general form. We find that the parametric resonance is indeed excited
close to the radius where epicyclic frequencies of radial and meridional
oscillations are in a 2:3 ratio. The location and frequencies of the highest
amplitude excitation vary with the strength of the perturbation. These results
agree with actual frequency ratios of twin kHz QPOs that have been reported in
some black hole candidates, and they may be consistent also with correlation of
the twin peaks in Sco X-1.
