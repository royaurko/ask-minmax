General purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) is
dramatically changing the landscape of high performance computing in astronomy.
In this paper, we identify and investigate several key decision areas, with a
goal of simplyfing the early adoption of GPGPU in astronomy. We consider the
merits of OpenCL as an open standard in order to reduce risks associated with
coding in a native, vendor-specific programming environment, and present a GPU
programming philosophy based on using brute force solutions. We assert that
effective use of new GPU-based supercomputing facilities will require a change
in approach from astronomers. This will likely include improved programming
training, an increased need for software development best-practice through the
use of profiling and related optimisation tools, and a greater reliance on
third-party code libraries. As with any new technology, those willing to take
the risks, and make the investment of time and effort to become early adopters
of GPGPU in astronomy, stand to reap great benefits.
