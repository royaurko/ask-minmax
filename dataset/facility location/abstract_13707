The idea of synthesis, i.e., the process of automatically computing
implementations from their specifications, has recently gained a lot of
momentum in the contexts of software engineering and reactive system design.
While it is widely believed that, due to complexity/undecidability issues,
synthesis cannot completely replace manual engineering, it can assist the
process of designing the intricate pieces of code that most programmers find
challenging, or help with orchestrating tasks in reactive environments. The
SYNT workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in synthesis to
discuss and present ongoing and mature work on all aspects of automated
synthesis and its applications.
  The third iteration of the workshop took place in Vienna, Austria, and was
co-located with the 26th International Conference on Computer Aided
Verification, held in the context of the Vienna Summer of Logic in July 2014.
The workshop included eight contributed talks and four invited talks. In
addition, it featured a special session about the Syntax-Guided Synthesis
Competition (SyGuS) and the SyntComp Synthesis competition.
