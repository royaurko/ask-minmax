The theory of relativistic {\em location systems} is sketched. An interesting
class of these systems is that of relativistic {\em positioning systems,} which
consists in sets of four clocks broadcasting their proper time. Among them, the
more important ones are the {\em auto-located positioning systems,} in which
every clock broadcasts not only its proper time but the proper times that it
receives from the other three. At this level, no reference to any exterior
system (the Earth surface, for example) and no synchronization are needed. Some
properties are presented. In the SYPOR project, such a structure is proposed,
eventually anchored to a classical reference system on the Earth surface, as
the best relativistic structure for Global Navigation Satellite Systems.
