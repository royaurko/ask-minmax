An original experimental method for determining the empirical probability
distribution function (PDF) of the quality factor (Q) of a mode-stirred
reverberation chamber is presented. Spectral averaging of S-parameters across a
relatively narrow frequency interval at a single pair of locations for the
transmitting and receiving antennas is applied to estimate the stored and
dissipated energy in the cavity, avoiding the need for spatial scanning to
obtain spatial volume or surface averages. The effective number of
simultaneously excited cavity modes per stir state, M, can be estimated by
fitting the empirical distribution to the parametrized theoretical
distribution. The measured results support a previously developed theoretical
model for the PDF of Q and show that spectral averaging over a bandwidth as
small as a few hundred kHz is sufficient to obtain accurate results.
