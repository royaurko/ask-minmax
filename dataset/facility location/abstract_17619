The open cluster NGC 6791 has been the focus of much recent study due to its
intriguing combination of old age and high metallicity ($\sim$8 Gyr,
[Fe$/$H]=$+$0.30), as well as its location within the Kepler field. As part of
the WIYN Open Cluster Study, we present precise ($\sigma=0.38$ km s$^{-1}$)
radial velocities for proper-motion candidate members of NGC 6791 from Platais
et al. Our survey, extending down to $g^\prime\sim16.8$, is comprised of the
evolved cluster population, including blue stragglers, giants, and horizontal
branch stars. Of the 280 proper-motion-selected stars above our magnitude
limit, 93% have at least one radial-velocity measurement and 79% have three
measurements over the course of at least 200 days, sufficient for secure
radial-velocity-determined membership of non-velocity-variable stars. The
Platais et al. proper-motion catalog includes twelve anomalous horizontal
branch candidates blueward of the red clump, of which we find only four to be
cluster members. Three fall slightly blueward of the red clump and the fourth
is consistent with being a blue straggler. The cleaned color-magnitude diagram
shows a richly populated red giant branch and a blue straggler population. Half
of the blue stragglers are in binaries. From our radial-velocity measurement
distribution we find the cluster's radial-velocity dispersion to be
$\sigma_c=0.62\pm0.10$ km s$^{-1}$. This corresponds to a dynamical mass of
$\sim$4600 $M_\odot$.
