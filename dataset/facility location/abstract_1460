We compare the spectral properties of the millisecond and slow pulsars
detected in the Parkes 70 cm survey. The mean spectral index for the
millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is -1.9 +/- 0.1 whereas the mean spectral index for
the slow pulsars is a surprisingly steep -1.72 +/- 0.04. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test indicates that there is only a 72% probability that the two distributions
differ. As a class, MSPs are therefore only fractionally steeper-spectrum
objects than slow pulsars, as recent literature would suggest. We then model
the expected distribution of millisecond pulsars in the Galaxy and find that
high-frequency surveys, with sensitivities similar to the current Parkes
multibeam survey, are likely to detect MSPs in large numbers. The observed
distribution of MSPs will be much less isotropic than that resulting from
low-frequency surveys, with 50% of detectable MSPs residing within 11 degrees
of the Galactic plane in an all-sky survey.
