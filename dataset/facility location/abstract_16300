Recent observation of microlensing technique reveals two giant planets at 2.3
AU and 4.6 AU around the star OGLE-06-109L. The eccentricity of the outer
planet (ec) is estimated to be 0.11(+0.17,-0.04), comparable to that of Saturn
(0.01-0.09). The similarities between the OGLE-06-109L system and the solar
system indicate that they may have passed through similar histories during
their formation stage. In this paper we investigate the dynamics and formation
of the orbital architecture in the OGLE-06-109L system. For the present two
planets with their nominal locations, the secular motions are stable as long as
their eccentricities (eb; ec) fulfill eb^2 + ec^2 < = 0.3^2. Earth-size bodies
might be formed and are stable in the habitable zone (0.25AU-0.36AU) of the
system. Three possible scenarios may be accounted for formation of eb and ec:
(i) convergent migration of two planets and the 3:1 MMR trapping; (ii)
planetary scattering; (iii) divergent migration and the 3:1 MMR crossing. As we
showed that the probability for the two giant planets in 3:1 MMR is low (~3%),
scenario (i) is less likely. According to models (ii) and (iii), the final
eccentricity of inner planet (eb) may oscillate between [0-0.06], comparable to
that of Jupiter (0.03-0.06). An inspection of eb, ec secular motion may be
helpful to understand which model is really responsible for the eccentricity
formation.
