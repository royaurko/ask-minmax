We report the ASCA results of the bursting X-ray pulsar \gro, which was
observed in February 1996 and March 1997. The source flux in the 2--10 keV band
was $2.0\times10^{-8}$ erg/sec/cm$^2$ in 1996 and $5.0\times10^{-9}$
erg/sec/cm$^2$ in 1997. We detected 12 and 17 Type II bursts during the two
observations with mean bursting intervals of about 27 min and 37 min. Each
burst is followed by an intensity dip with the depleted flux depending on the
burst fluence. The energy spectra are approximated by an absorbed power law
with additional structure around 6--7 keV\@. Constant absorption column,
$(5-6)\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, independent of the observation dates and
emission phases (persistent, burst and dip) is interpreted as an interstellar
absorption. The source may be actually located near the Galactic center, at a
distance of 8.5 kpc. The structure in the energy spectrum at 6--7 keV is most
probably due to iron and maybe reproduced by a disk line model with additional
broadening mechanism.
