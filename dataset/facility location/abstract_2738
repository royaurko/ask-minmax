We discuss plausible locations of radiating regions in the magnetospheres of
pulsars and argue that the mechanisms of pulsar radiation at different
frequencies are closely connected with the locations of the radiating regions,
especially in the radio range. If the region that is responsible for the bulk
of the non-thermal radiation at some frequency is localized in the pulsar
magnetosphere then the nature of this radiation will be either determined or,
at least, restricted significantly.
