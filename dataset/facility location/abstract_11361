It is shown that the projective measurements made by Bob who locates near the
event horizon of the Schwarzschild black hole will create entangled particles
detected by Alice who stays stationary at the asymptotically flat region. It is
found that the degree of entanglement decreases as the frequency of the
detected particles increases and approaches to zero as the frequency
$\omega_\mathbf{k} \to\infty$. It is also noted that the degree of entanglement
increases as the Hawking temperature increases. Especially, the particle state
is unentangled when the Hawking temperature is zero and approaches a maximally
entangled Bell state when the black hole evaporates completely.
