We demonstrate a scanning force microscope, based upon a quartz tuning fork,
that operates below 100 mK and in magnetic fields up to 6 T. The microscope has
a conducting tip for electrical probing of nanostructures of interest, and it
incorporates a low noise cryogenic amplifier to measure both the vibrations of
the tuning fork and the electrical signals from the nanostructures. At
millikelvin temperatures the imaging resolution is below 1 um in a 22 um x 22
um range, and a coarse motion provides translations of a few mm. This scanned
probe is useful for high bandwidth measurement of many high impedance
nanostructures on a single sample. We show data locating an SET within an array
and measure its coulomb blockade with a sensitivity of 2.6 x 10^-5 e/Hz^1/2.
