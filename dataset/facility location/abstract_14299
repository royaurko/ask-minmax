We study gaze estimation on tablets; our key design goal is uncalibrated gaze
estimation using the front-facing camera during natural use of tablets, where
the posture and method of holding the tablet is not constrained. We collected
the first large unconstrained gaze dataset of tablet users, labeled Rice
TabletGaze dataset. The dataset consists of 51 subjects, each with 4 different
postures and 35 gaze locations. Subjects vary in race, gender and in their need
for prescription glasses, all of which might impact gaze estimation accuracy.
Driven by our observations on the collected data, we present a TabletGaze
algorithm for automatic gaze estimation using multi-level HoG feature and
Random Forests regressor. The TabletGaze algorithm achieves a mean error of
3.17 cm. We perform extensive evaluation on the impact of various factors such
as dataset size, race, wearing glasses and user posture on the gaze estimation
accuracy and make important observations about the impact of these factors.
