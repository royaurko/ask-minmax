The plasma panel sensor is an ionizing photon and particle radiation detector
derived from PDP technology with high gain and nanosecond response.
Experimental results in detecting cosmic ray muons and beta particles from
radioactive sources are described along with applications including high energy
and nuclear physics, homeland security and cancer therapeutics
