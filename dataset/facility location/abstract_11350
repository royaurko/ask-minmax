We perform a theoretical investigation on the Goos-H\"achen (GH) shift in
one-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPCs) containing left-handed metamaterials
(LHMs). We find an unusal effect of the GH shift near the photonic
band-crossing structure, which is located at the condition, $%
-k_{z}^{(A)}d_{A}=k_{z}^{(B)}d_{B}=m\pi $ $(m=1,2,3...)$, under the inclined
incident angle, here A denotes the LHM layer and B denotes the dielectric
layer. Above the frequency of the band-crossing point (BCP), the GH shift
changes from negative to positive as the incident angle increases, while the GH
shift changes reversely below the BCP frequency. This effect is explained in
terms of the phase property of the band-crossing structure.
