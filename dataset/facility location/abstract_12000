Critical dynamics of an ultracold Bose gas far from equilibrium is studied in
two spatial dimensions. Superfluid turbulence is created by quenching the
equilibrium state close to zero temperature. Instead of immediately
re-thermalizing, the system approaches a meta-stable transient state,
characterized as a non-thermal fixed point. A focus is set on the vortex
density and vortex-antivortex correlations which characterize the evolution
towards the non-thermal fixed point and the departure to final
(quasi-)condensation. Two distinct power-law regimes in the vortex-density
decay are found and discussed in terms of a vortex binding-unbinding transition
and a kinetic description of vortex scattering. A possible relation to decaying
turbulence in classical fluids is pointed out. By comparing the results to
equilibrium studies of a two-dimensional Bose gas, an intuitive understanding
of the location of the non-thermal fixed point in a reduced phase space is
developed.
