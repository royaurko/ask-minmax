Stochastic cooling of trapped atoms is considered for a laser-beam
configuration with beam waists equal or smaller than the extent of the atomic
cloud. It is shown, that various effects appear due to this transverse
confinement, among them heating of transverse kinetic energy. Analytical
results of the cooling in dependence on size and location of the laser beam are
presented for the case of a non-degenerate vapour.
