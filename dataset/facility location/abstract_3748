The noble gas radionuclides, including 81Kr (half-life = 229,000 yr), 85Kr
(11 yr), and 39Ar (269 yr), possess nearly ideal chemical and physical
properties for studies of earth and environmental processes. Recent advances in
Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA), a laser-based atom counting method, have
enabled routine measurements of the radiokrypton isotopes, as well as the
demonstration of the ability to measure 39Ar in environmental samples. Here we
provide an overview of the ATTA technique, and a survey of recent progress made
in several laboratories worldwide. We review the application of noble gas
radionuclides in the geosciences and discuss how ATTA can help advance these
fields, specifically determination of groundwater residence times using 81Kr,
85Kr, and 39Ar; dating old glacial ice using 81Kr; and an 39Ar survey of the
main water masses of the oceans, to study circulation pathways and estimate
mean residence times. Other scientific questions involving deeper circulation
of fluids in the Earth's crust and mantle also are within the scope of future
applications. We conclude that the geoscience community would greatly benefit
from an ATTA facility dedicated to this field, with instrumentation for routine
measurements, as well as for research on further development of ATTA methods.
