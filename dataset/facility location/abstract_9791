We describe the design and current performance of the high-flux
backscattering spectrometer located at the NIST Center for Neutron Research.
The design incorporates several state-of-the-art neutron optical devices to
achieve the highest flux on sample possible while maintaining an energy
resolution of less than 1mueV. Foremost among these is a novel phase-space
transformation chopper that significantly reduces the mismatch between the beam
divergences of the primary and secondary parts of the instrument. This resolves
a long-standing problem of backscattering spectrometers, and produces a
relative gain in neutron flux of 4.2. A high-speed Doppler-driven monochromator
system has been built that is capable of achieving energy transfers of up to
+-50mueV, thereby extending the dynamic range of this type of spectrometer by
more than a factor of two over that of other reactor-based backscattering
instruments.
