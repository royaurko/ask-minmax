Gamma-ray astronomy will play a crucial role in the investigation of
nonthermal processes in the large scale structure of the universe.
Particularly, galaxy clusters (GC) observations at this photon energy will help
us understand the origin of radio emitting high energy particles, the possible
level of cosmic-ray (CR) pressure in intracluster environment, and the strength
of intracluster magnetic fields. In addition here we point out the importance
of these observations for a possible detection of cluster accretion shocks and
for constraining their CR acceleration efficiency. We model spatial and
spectral properties of gamma-ray emission due to shock accelerated CRs in GC
and emphasize the importance of imaging capability of upcoming gamma-ray
facilities for a correct interpretation of observational results.
