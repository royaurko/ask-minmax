We prove the existence of a family of initial data for the Einstein vacuum
equation which can be interpreted as the data for two Kerr-like black holes in
arbitrary location and with spin in arbitrary direction. This family of initial
data has the following properties: (i) When the mass parameter of one of them
is zero or when the distance between them goes to infinity, it reduces exactly
to the Kerr initial data. (ii) When the distance between them is zero, we
obtain exactly a Kerr initial data with mass and angular momentum equal to the
sum of the mass and angular momentum parameters of each of them. The initial
data depends smoothly on the distance, the mass and the angular momentum
parameters.
