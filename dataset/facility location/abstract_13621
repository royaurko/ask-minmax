We investigate the ballistic electron transport in a monolayer graphene with
configurational averaged impurities, located between two clean graphene leads.
It is shown that the electron transmission are strongly dependent on the
concentration of impurities and the incident energy. In turn, the conductance
computed using the Landauer formalism shows a similar behavior to those found
in experimental works as a function of the applied voltage for different
concentrations of impurities in the limit of low temperatures. In the limit of
zero bias voltage, the conductance shows a minimum value which reduces to zero
for high concentration of impurities which disentangle graphene sublattices.
These results can be very helpful for exploring the tunneling mechanism of
electrons through doped thermodynamically stable graphene.
