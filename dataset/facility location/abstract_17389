A sequence of apparently coupled eruptions was observed on 2010 August 1-2 by
SDO and STEREO. The eruptions were closely synchronized with one another, even
though some of them occurred at widely separated locations. In an attempt to
identify a plausible reason for such synchronization, we study the large-scale
structure of the background magnetic configuration. The coronal field was
computed from the photospheric magnetic field observed at the appropriate time
period by using the potential field source-surface model.
  We investigate the resulting field structure by analyzing the so-called
squashing factor calculated at the photospheric and source-surface boundaries,
as well as at different coronal cross-sections. Using this information as a
guide, we determine the underlying structural skeleton of the configuration,
including separatrix and quasi-separatrix surfaces. Our analysis reveals, in
particular, several pseudo-streamers in the regions where the eruptions
occurred. Of special interest to us are the magnetic null points and separators
associated with the pseudo-streamers. We propose that magnetic reconnection
triggered along these separators by the first eruption likely played a key role
in establishing the assumed link between the sequential eruptions. The present
work substantiates our recent simplified magnetohydrodynamic model of
sympathetic eruptions and provides a guide for further deeper study of these
phenomena. Several important implications of our results for the S-web model of
the slow solar wind are also addressed.
