This paper presents real-time guidance strategies for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) that can be used to enhance their flight endurance by utilizing
{\sl insitu} measurements of wind speeds and wind gradients. In these
strategies, periodic adjustments would be made in the airspeed and/or heading
angle command for the UAV to minimize a projected power requirement at some
future time. In this paper, UAV flights are described by a three-dimensional
dynamic point-mass. Onboard closed-loop trajectory tracking logics that follow
airspeed vector commands are modeled using the method of feedback
linearization. A generic wind field model is assumed that consists of a
constant term plus terms that vary sinusoidally with respect to the location.
To evaluate the benefits of these strategies in enhancing UAV flight endurance,
a reference strategy is introduced in which the UAV would seek to follow the
desired airspeed in a steady level flight under zero wind. A performance
measure is defined as the average power consumption both over a specified time
interval and over different initial heading angles of the UAV. A relative
benefit criterion is then defined as the percentage improvement of the
performance measure of a proposed strategy over that of the reference strategy.
Extensive numerical simulations are conducted. Results demonstrate the benefits
and trends of power savings of the proposed real-time guidance strategies.
