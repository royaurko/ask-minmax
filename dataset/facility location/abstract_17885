We report on third epoch VLBI observations of the radio-bright supernova SN
2011dh located in the nearby galaxy (7.8 Mpc) M51. The observations took place
at $t=453$ d after the explosion and at a frequency of 8.4 GHz. We obtained a
fairly well resolved image of the shell of SN 2011dh, making it one of only six
recent supernovae for which resolved images of the ejecta are available. By
fitting a spherical shell model directly to the visibility measurements we
determine the angular radius of SN 2011dh's radio emission to be $636 \pm 29$
$\mu$as . At a distance of 7.8 Mpc, this angular radius corresponds to a linear
radius of $(7.4 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{16}$ cm and an average expansion velocity
since the explosion of $18900^{+2800}_{-2400}$ kms$^{-1}$. We also calculated
more precise radius measurements for the earlier VLBI observations and we show
that all the measured values of the radius of the emission region, up to
$t=453$ d, are still almost perfectly consistent with those derived from
fitting synchrotron self-absorbed models to the radio spectral energy
distribution. We find that SN 2011dh's radius evolves in a power-law fashion,
with $R \sim t^{0.961\pm0.011}$, implying almost free expansion.
