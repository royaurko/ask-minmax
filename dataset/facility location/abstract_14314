Following the development of a scheme to bosonize and debosonize consistently
[N. Shah and C.J. Bolech, companion paper], we present in detail the
Toulouse-point analytic solution of the two-lead Kondo junction model. The
existence and location of the solvable point is not modified, but the
calculational methodology and the final expressions for observable quantities
change markedly as compared to the existent results. This solvable point is one
of the remarkably few exact results for non-equilibrium transport in correlated
systems. It yields relatively simple analytical expressions for the current in
the full range of temperature, magnetic field and voltage. It also shows
precisely, within the limitations of the Toulouse fine-tuning, how the
transport evolves depending on the relative strengths of inter-lead and
intra-lead Kondo exchange couplings ranging from weak to strong. Thus its
improved understanding is an important stepping stone for future research.
