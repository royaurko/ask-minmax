The propagation of cosmic-ray protons in the Galaxy is discussed under the
framework of a three dimensional convection-diffusion model. Starting with the
assumption of a uniform and continuous distribution of cosmic-ray sources
injecting CRs continuously in the Galaxy and by invoking a supernova explosion
at various distances from the Earth, it is found that only those sources
located within a distance of ~ 1.5 kpc can produce appreciable temporal
fluctuations in the CR proton flux observed at the Earth. So, the construction
of the local CR proton spectrum is discussed by seperating the contributions of
the distant sources from that of the nearby sources. The contribution from the
distant sources is treated in the framework of a continuous source distribution
model both in space as well as time, but that of the nearby sources in a
discrete space-time source model. The study predicts the presence of at least
one old nearby source with a characteristic age of ~ 10^5 yrs located at a
distance of ~ 0.1 kpc to explain the observed proton flux below ~ 100 GeV.
