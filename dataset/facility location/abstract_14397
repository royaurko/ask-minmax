In the framework of the concordance cosmological model the first-order scalar
and vector perturbations of the homogeneous background are derived without any
supplementary approximations in addition to the weak gravitational field limit.
The sources of these perturbations (inhomogeneities) are presented in the
discrete form of a system of separate point-like gravitating masses. The
obtained expressions for the metric corrections are valid at all (sub-horizon
and super-horizon) scales and converge in all points except the locations of
the sources, and their average values are zero (thus, first-order backreaction
effects are absent). Both the Minkowski background limit and the Newtonian
cosmological approximation are reached under certain well-defined conditions.
An important feature of the velocity-independent part of the scalar
perturbation is revealed: up to an additive constant it represents a sum of
Yukawa potentials produced by inhomogeneities with the same finite
time-dependent Yukawa interaction range. The suggesting itself connection
between this range and the homogeneity scale is briefly discussed along with
other possible physical implications.
