We investigate the threshold widths of some symmetric properties which range
asymptotically between 1/\sqrt{n} and 1/(log n). These properties are built
using a combination of failure sets arising from reliability theory. This
combination of sets is simply called a product. Some general results on the
threshold width of the product of two sets A and B in terms of the threshold
locations and widths of A and B are provided.
