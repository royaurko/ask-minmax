Helioseismic data from the HMI instrument have revealed a sunquake associated
with the X1 flare SOL2014-03-29T17:48 in active region NOAA 12017. We try to
discover if acoustic-like impulses or actions of the Lorentz force caused the
sunquake. We analyze spectro-polarimetric data obtained with the Facility
Infrared Spectrometer (FIRS) at the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST). Fortuitously
the FIRS slit crossed the flare kernel close to the acoustic source, during the
impulsive phase. The infrared FIRS data remain unsaturated throughout the
flare. Stokes profiles of lines of Si I 1082.7 nm and He I 1083.0 nm are
analyzed. At the flare footpoint, the Si I 1082.7 nm core intensity increases
by a factor of several, the IR continuum increases by 4 +/- 1%. Remarkably, the
Si I core resembles the classical Ca II K line's self-reversed profile. With
nLTE radiative models of H, C, Si and Fe these properties set the penetration
depth of flare heating to 100 +/- 100 km, i.e. photospheric layers. Estimates
of the non-magnetic energy flux are at least a factor of two less than the
sunquake energy flux. Milne-Eddington inversions of the Si I line show that the
local magnetic energy changes are also too small to drive the acoustic pulse.
Our work raises several questions: Have we "missed" the signature of downward
energy propagation? Is it intermittent in time and/or non-local? Does the 1-2 s
photospheric radiative damping time discount compressive modes?
