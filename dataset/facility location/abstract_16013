We have studied the partition of shear, compressional and kinetic energies in
the coda of ten earthquakes recorded on a dense array, located at Pinyon Flats
Observatory (PFO), California. We observe a clear stabilization of the shear to
compressional ($W^s/W^p$) energy ratio in the coda, with an average value of
about 2.8. The ratio between the vertical and horizontal kinetic energies
($V^2/H^2$) can be measured from 5 to 25Hz and shows an abrupt transitionfrom
0.1 in the 5-10Hz band, to about 0.8 in the 15-25Hz band. These measured values
are in sharp contrast with the theoretical prediction for equipartitioned
elastic waves in a homogeneous half-space. To explain these observations, we
have developed a theory of equipartition in a layered elastic half-space. Using
a rigorous spectral decomposition of the elastic wave equation, we define
equipartition as a white noise distributed over the complete set of
eigenfunctions. The theory predicts that close to the resonance frequency of a
low-velocity layer, the ratio between shear and compressional energies strongly
decreases. Using a detailed model of the subsurface at PFO, this
conterintuitive result is found to be in good qualitative and quantitative
agreement with the observations.
