Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) have evolved into a wireless communication
technology of immense interest. But technological advancements in WMNs have
inadvertently spawned a plethora of network performance bottlenecks, caused
primarily by the rise in prevalent interference. Conflict Graphs are
indispensable tools used to theoretically represent and estimate the
interference in wireless networks. We propose a generic algorithm to generate
conflict graphs which is independent of the underlying interference model.
Further, we propose the notion of radio co-location interference, which is
caused and experienced by spatially co-located radios in multi-radio
multi-channel (MRMC) WMNs. We experimentally validate the concept, and propose
a new all-encompassing algorithm to create a radio co-location aware conflict
graph. Our novel conflict graph generation algorithm is demonstrated to be
significantly superior and more efficient than the conventional approach,
through theoretical interference estimates and comprehensive experiments. The
results of an extensive set of ns-3 simulations run on the IEEE 802.11g
platform strongly indicate that the radio co-location aware conflict graphs are
a marked improvement over their conventional counterparts. We also question the
use of total interference degree as a reliable metric to predict the
performance of a Channel Assignment scheme in a given WMN deployment.
