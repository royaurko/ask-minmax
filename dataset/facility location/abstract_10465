We revisit the globally coupled map lattice (GCML). We use a family of
universal 'curves of balance' between two conflicting tendencies in the model-
the randomness in each map and the coherence due to an averaging interaction -
and we locate the posi-nega switch region in the parameter space of the model.
We clarify the mechanism of a basic posi-nega switch in the two-cluster regime,
which guarantees no mixing of maps across their mean field in the chaotic
transient process. We stress that a special attention must be paid for
rounding-off errors; otherwise, there fatally occurs an artifitial numerical
degeneracy of maps in a cluster due to a highly negative Lyapunov exponent of
the clustor attractor.
