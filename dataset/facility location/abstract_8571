We report redshift measurements of 5 X-ray emitting blue stellar objects
(BSO's) located less than 12 arc min from the X-ray Seyfert galaxy, NGC 3516.
We find these quasars to be distributed along the minor axis of the galaxy and
to show a very good correlation between their redshift and their angular
distance from NGC 3516. Moreover the redshifts of these 5 quasars are: 0.33,
0.69, 0.93, 1.40 and 2.10 which are very near the peaks of the redshift
periodicity distribution (i.e. z=0.3, 0.6, 0.96, 1.41 and 1.96). All these
observed properties strikingly confirm, around this single example of a
Seyfert, the composite picture derived from previous physical associations of
quasars with low redshift, active galaxies.
