Clusters of galaxies may contain cluster-wide, centrally located, diffuse
radio sources, called halos. They have been found to show morphologies similar
to those of the X-ray emission. To quantify this qualitative statement we
performed a point-to-point comparison of the radio and the X-ray emission for
four clusters of galaxies containing radio halos: Coma, Abell 2255, Abell 2319,
Abell 2744. Our study leads to a linear relation between the radio and the
X-ray surface brightness in two clusters, namely Abell 2255 and Abell 2744. In
Coma and A2319 the radio and the X-ray brightnesses seem to be related with a
sub-linear power law. Implications of these findings within simple radio halo
formation models are briefly discussed.
