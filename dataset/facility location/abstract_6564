Here we show that the ~10 Myr Beta Pictoris system hosts a massive giant
planet, Beta Pictoris b, located 8 to 15 AU from the star. This result confirms
that gas giant planets form rapidly within disks and validates the use of disk
structures as fingerprints of embedded planets. Among the few planets already
imaged, Beta Pictoris b is the closest to its parent star. Its short period
could allow recording the full orbit within 17 years.
