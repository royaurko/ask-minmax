The Double Chooz reactor neutrino experiment will be the next detector to
search for a non vanishing theta(13) mixing angle with unprecedented
sensitivity, which might open the way to unveiling CP violation in the leptonic
sector. The measurement of this angle will be based on a precise comparison of
the antineutrino spectrum at two identical detectors located at different
distances from the Chooz nuclear reactor cores in France. Double Chooz is
particularly attractive because of its capability to measure sin^2(2theta(13))
to 3 sigma significance if sin^2(2theta(13)) > 0.05 or to exclude
sin^2(2theta(13)) down to 0.03 at 90% C.L. for Dm^2 = 2.5 x 10^(-3) eV^2 in
three years of data taking with both detectors. The installation of the far
detector started in May 2008 and the first neutrino results are expected in
2009. The advantages of reactor neutrino experiments to measure the theta(13)
mixing angle are described in this article and in particular, the design,
current status and expected performance of the Double Chooz detector.
