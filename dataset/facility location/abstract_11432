This article describes the assembly of an optical (RGB) all-sky mosaic image
with an image scale of 36 arcsec/pixel, a limiting magnitude of approx. 14 mag
and an 18 bit dynamic range. Using a portable low-cost system, 70 fields (each
covering 40 deg x 27 deg) were imaged over a time span of 21 months from
dark-sky locations in South Africa, Texas and Michigan. The fields were
photometrically calibrated against standard catalog stars. Using sky background
data from the Pioneer 10 and 11 space probes, gradients resulting from
artificial light pollution, airglow and zodiacal light were eliminated, while
the large-scale galactic and extragalactic background resulting from unresolved
sources was preserved. The 648 Megapixel image is a valuable educational tool,
being able to fully utilize the resolution and dynamic range of modern
full-dome planetarium projection systems.
