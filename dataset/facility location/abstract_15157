The current realization of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF)
comprises a total of 717 extragalactic radio sources distributed over the
entire sky. An observing program has been developed to densify the ICRF in the
northern sky using the European VLBI network (EVN) and other radio telescopes
in Spitsbergen, Canada and USA. Altogether, 150 new sources selected from the
Jodrell Bank-VLA Astrometric Survey were observed during three such EVN+
experiments conducted in 2000, 2002 and 2003. The sources were selected on the
basis of their sky location in order to fill the "empty" regions of the frame.
A secondary criterion was based on source compactness to limit structural
effects in the astrometric measurements. All 150 new sources have been
successfully detected and the precision of the estimated coordinates in right
ascension and declination is better than 1 milliarcsecond (mas) for most of
them. A comparison with the astrometric positions from the Very Long baseline
Array Calibrator Survey for 129 common sources indicates agreement within 2 mas
for 80% of the sources.
