A clue to finding the long-sought sources of cosmic rays is the recent
observation of an astrophysical flux of high-energy neutrinos by the IceCube
detector, since these possibly originate in hadronic interactions at cosmic-ray
accelerators. While the neutrino sky map shows no significant indication of
point sources so far, it is possible to utilize the sensitivity of Imaging Air
Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) arrays, such as VERITAS, to search for hadronic
gamma-ray emission from the neutrino directions.
  Over the last 2 years, the positions of neutrino events detected by IceCube
have been observed using the VERITAS array. Observations have been limited to
muon neutrino events, since their typical angular reconstruction uncertainty is
below 1 degree, smaller than the 3.5-degree diameter of the VERITAS field of
view. The location of VERITAS further constrains the neutrino event positions
that can be observed to those located in the northern sky, or at moderate
southern declinations. The list of observed positions was selected from
published results and a set of high-energy muon tracks provided by IceCube. We
present the current status and some preliminary results from this program.
