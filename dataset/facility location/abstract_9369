We report the serendipitous discovery of several unresolved X-ray sources
lying in the prominent spiral arms of the galaxy KUG 0214-057 in XMM-Newton
observations. The location of these X-ray sources strongly suggests that at
least three, and possibly four, of these may be physically related to the
galaxy. The luminosity of each of these sources at the distance of KUG 0214-057
is > 5 x 10^39 erg/s (0.3-10 keV), making each a strong candidate ultraluminous
X-ray source (ULX). Using the ULXs as a metric implies that this relatively
low-mass galaxy may be experiencing rather intense starburst activity. The
serendipitous discovery of these ULXs suggests that such objects are not a
negligible component of the overall extragalactic X-ray source population.
