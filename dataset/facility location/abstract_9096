Most powerful jets are observed to emanate from accreting black hole systems.
Recent quasi-stationary radiative MHD calculations reveal that jet-launching
start in the innermost region of a transition layer (:TL), which is located
between the disk and the corona. The plasma in the TL is dominated by
virial-hot protons, advective, highly magnetic-diffusive and rotates
super-Keplerian. The amplified toroidal magnetic field (TMF) in the TL reach
values beyond equipartition with respect to the electron thermal energy,
thereby considerably enhancing the Poynting energy flux and yielding
gravitationally unbound electron-proton outflows with a positive Bernoulli
number.
  We speculate that beaming jets in GRBs may possess similar properties,
provided that the GRB-progenitors have rotational energy sufficient for forming
a nearly Keplerian and massive disk.
