The T2K near detectors provide a rich facility for measuring neutrino
interactions in a high-flux environment. This talk will discuss the near
detector CC-inclusive normalization analysis for the T2K oscillation result in
detail, along with the present result, and describe the plan for its extension
to more sophisticated measurements. Selection criteria for CCQE interactions
will be presented, as will a strategy for calculating cross-section difference
between plastic scintillator and water. The unique capacities of the near
detectors to measure other exclusive CC and NC channels in a narrow-band
off-axis beam will also be explored.
