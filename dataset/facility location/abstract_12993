We study theoretically light propagations at the zigzag edge of a honeycomb
photonic crystal consisting of dielectric rods in air, analogous to graphene.
Within the photonic band gap of the honeycomb photonic crystal, a unimodal edge
state may exist with a sharp confinement of optical fields. Its dispersion can
be tuned simply by adjusting the radius of the edge rods. For the edge rods
with a graded variation in radius along the edge direction, we show numerically
that light beams of different frequencies can be trapped sharply in different
spatial locations, rendering wideband trapping of light.
