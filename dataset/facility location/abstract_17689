The behavior of lipid bilayer is important to understand the functionality of
cells like the trafficking of ions between cells. Standard procedures to
explore the properties of lipid bilayer and hemifused states typically use
either supported membranes or vesicles. Both techniques have several
shortcoming in terms of bio relevance or accessibility for measurements. In
this article the formation of individual free standing hemifused states between
model cell membranes is studied using an optimized microfluidic scheme which
allows for simultaneous optical and electrophysiological measurements. In a
first step, two model membranes are formed at a desired location within a
microfluidic device using a variation of the droplet interface bilayer (DiB)
technique. In a second step, the two model membranes are brought into contact
forming a single hemifused state. For all tested lipids, the hemifused state
between free standing membranes form within hundreds of milliseconds, i.e.
several orders of magnitude faster than reported in literature. The formation
of a hemifused state is observed as a two stage process, whereas the second
stage can be explained as a dewetting process in no-slip boundary condition.
The formed hemifusion states are long living and a single fusion event can be
observed when triggered by an applied electric field as demonstrated for
monoolein.
