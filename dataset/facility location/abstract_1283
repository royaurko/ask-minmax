In this paper, we analyze the achievable rate of the uplink of a single-cell
multi-user distributed massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system.
The multiple users are equipped with single antenna and the base station (BS)
is equipped with a large number of distributed antennas. We derive an
analytical expression for the asymptotic ergodic achievable rate of the system
under zero-forcing (ZF) detector. In particular, we consider circular antenna
array, where the distributed BS antennas are located evenly on a circle, and
derive an analytical expression and closed-form tight bounds for the achievable
rate of an arbitrarily located user. Subsequently, closed-form bounds on the
average achievable rate per user are obtained under the assumption that the
users are uniformly located in the cell. Based on the bounds, we can understand
the behavior of the system rate with respect to different parameters and find
the optimal location of the circular BS antenna array that maximizes the
average rate. Numerical results are provided to assess our analytical results
and examine the impact of the number and the location of the BS antennas, the
transmit power, and the path-loss exponent on system performance. It is shown
that circularly distributed massive MIMO system largely outperforms centralized
massive MIMO system.
