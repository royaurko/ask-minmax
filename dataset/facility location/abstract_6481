We consider a processor shared $M/M/1$ queue that can accommodate at most a
finite number $K$ of customers. We give an exact expression for the sojourn
time distribution in the finite capacity model, in terms of a Laplace
transform. We then give the tail behavior, for the limit $K\to\infty$, by
locating the dominant singularity of the Laplace transform.
