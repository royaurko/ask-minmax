In this paper, we present for the first time a proper-motion-selected white
dwarf (WD) sample of the old Galactic open cluster M 67, down to the bottom of
the WD cooling sequence (CS). The color-magnitude diagram is based on data
collected with the LBC-Blue camera at the prime focus of LBT. As first epoch
data, we used CFHT-archive images collected 10 years before LBC data. We
measured proper motions of all the identified sources. Proper motions are then
used to separate foreground and background objects from the cluster stars,
including WDs. Finally, the field-object cleaned WD CS in the V vs. B-I
color-magnitude diagram is compared with the models. We confirm that the age
derived from the location of the bottom of the WD CS is consistent with the
turn off age.
