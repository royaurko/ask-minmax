Coherent population transfer between nuclear states using x-ray laser pulses
is studied. The laser pulses drive two nuclear transitions between three
nuclear states in a setup reminding of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage used
for atomic coherent population transfer. To compensate for the lack of
$\gamma$-ray laser sources, we envisage accelerated nuclei interacting with two
copropagating or crossed x-ray laser pulses. The parameter regime for nuclear
coherent population transfer using fully coherent light generated by future
X-Ray Free-Electron Laser facilities and moderate or strong acceleration of
nuclei is determined. We find that the most promising case requires laser
intensities of $10^{17}$-$10^{19}$ W/cm$^{2}$ for complete nuclear population
transfer. As relevant application, the controlled pumping or release of energy
stored in long-lived nuclear states is discussed.
