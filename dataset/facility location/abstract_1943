The reaction mechanisms for $K\Sigma(1385)$ photoproduction from the reaction
$\gamma p \to K^+\Sigma^{0}(1385)$ in the resonance energy region are
investigated in a hadronic model. Both contributions from $N$ and $\Delta$
resonances of masses around 2 GeV as given in the Review of Particle Data Group
and by the quark model predictions are included. The Lagrangians for describing
the decays of these resonances into $K\Sigma(1385)$ are constructed with the
coupling constants determined from the decay amplitudes predicted by a quark
model. Comparing the resulting total cross section for the reaction $\gamma p
\to K^+\Sigma^{0}(1385)$ with the preliminary data from the Thomas Jefferson
National Accelerator Facility, we find that the most important contributions
are from the two-star rated resonances $\Delta(2000) F_{35}$, $\Delta(1940)
D_{33}$, and $N(2080) D_{13}$, as well as the missing resonance
$N\frac32^-(2095)$ predicted in the quark model. Predictions on the
differential cross section and photon asymmetry in this reaction are also
given.
