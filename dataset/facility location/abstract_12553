A modified phase field crystal model in which the free energy may be
minimised by an order parameter profile having isolated bumps is investigated.
The phase diagram is calculated in one and two dimensions and we locate the
regions where modulated and uniform phases are formed and also regions where
localised states are formed. We investigate the effectiveness of the phase
field crystal model for describing fluids and crystals with defects. We further
consider a two component model and elucidate how the structure transforms from
hexagonal crystalline ordering to square ordering as the concentration changes.
Our conclusion contains a discussion of possible interpretations of the order
parameter field.
