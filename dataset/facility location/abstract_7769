We develop revised theoretical ideas on the mechanism by which the
transcription factor proteins locate their specific binding sites on DNA faster
than the three-dimensional (3D) diffusion controlled rate limit. We demonstrate
that the 3D-diffusion controlled rate limit can be enhanced when the protein
molecule reads several possible binding stretches of the template DNA via
one-dimensional (1D) diffusion upon each 3D-diffusion mediated collision or
nonspecific binding event. The overall enhancement of site-specific association
rate is directly proportional to the maximum possible sliding length (LA,
square root of (6Do/kr) where Do is the 1D-diffusion coefficient and kr is the
dissociation rate constant associated with the nonspecific DNA-protein complex)
associated with the 1D-diffusion of protein molecule along DNA. Upon
considering several possible mechanisms we find that the DNA binding proteins
can efficiently locate their cognate sites on DNA by switching across
fast-moving, slow-moving and reading states of their DNA binding domains in a
cyclic manner. Irrespective of the type of mechanism the overall rate
enhancement factor asymptotically approaches a limiting value which is directly
proportional to LA as the total length of DNA that contains the cognate site
increases. These results are consistent with the in vitro experimental
observations.
