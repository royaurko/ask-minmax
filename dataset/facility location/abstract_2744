The location of the images in a multiple-image gravitational lens system are
strongly dependent on the orientation angle of the mass distribution. As such,
we can use the location of the images and the photometric properties of the
visible matter to constrain the properties of the dark halo. We apply this to
the optical Einstein Ring system 0047-2808 and find that the dark halo is
almost spherical and is aligned in the same direction as the stars to within a
few degrees.
