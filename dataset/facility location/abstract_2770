Text mining is about looking for patterns in natural language text, and may
be defined as the process of analyzing text to extract information from it for
particular purposes. In previous work, we claimed that compression is a key
technology for text mining, and backed this up with a study that showed how
particular kinds of lexical tokens---names, dates, locations, etc.---can be
identified and located in running text, using compression models to provide the
leverage necessary to distinguish different token types (Witten et al., 1999)
