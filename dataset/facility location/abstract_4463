We report the discovery of possible infrared counterparts to SGR 1806-20. We
use archival {\it Chandra} observations to determine the location of SGR
1806-20 to $<1 \arcsec$ accuracy. We then locate 2 infrared objects within this
error circle in K-band ($2.2 \mu$m) images of this field. Based on the X-ray
absorption towards SGR 1806-20 and the extinction towards the nearby star
cluster, we discuss the likelihood of association for the possible
counterparts, and the implications for SGR 1806-20's physical properties and
origins.
