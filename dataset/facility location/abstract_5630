We present follow-up observations of a gravitational microlensing candidate
found by the MACHO collaboration in the Galactic bulge. The photometric data
cover a period near the maximum of the event and may be used to construct
complete light curve. The position of the lensed star in the color magnitude
diagram suggests that it is a Galactic bulge star located on the subgiant
branch.
