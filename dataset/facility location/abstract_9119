Four different data sets pertaining to the neutral atom environment at 1 AU
are presented and discussed. These data sets include neutral solar wind and
interstellar neutral atom data from IMAGE/LENA, energetic hydrogen atom data
from SOHO/HSTOF and plasma wave data from the magnetometer on ISEE-3.
Surprisingly, these data sets are centered between 262 degrees and 292 degrees
ecliptic longitude, about 10 degrees - 40 degrees from the upstream
interstellar neutral flow direction at 254 degrees resulting from the motion of
the Sun relative to the local interstellar cloud. Some possible explanations
for this offset, none of which is completely satisfactory, are discussed.
