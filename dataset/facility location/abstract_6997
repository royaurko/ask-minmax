We present a theory of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in a doped Weyl
semimetal, or Weyl metal, including both intrinsic and extrinsic (impurity
scattering) contributions. We demonstrate that a Weyl metal is distinguished
from an ordinary ferromagnetic metal by the absence of the extrinsic and the
Fermi surface part of the intrinsic contributions to the AHE, as long as the
Fermi energy is sufficiently close to the Weyl nodes. The AHE in a Weyl metal
is thus shown to be a purely intrinsic, universal property, fully determined by
the location of the Weyl nodes in the first Brillouin zone.
