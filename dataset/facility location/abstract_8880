We report on the identification of the optical/IR counterpart of the 29.5-s
transient X-ray pulsar GS 1843+009. We re-analysed an archival ROSAT HRI
observation of GS 1843+009, obtaining a new refined position. The optical and
IR follow-up observations carried out for the new error circle allowed us to
find a relatively faint (V=20.9) and variable early type reddened star
(V-R=2.1). The optical spectra show the Balmer and Paschen series in emission,
while the IR observations confirm the presence of a flux excess (H=13.2,
J-H=0.54), suggesting that the star is surrounded by a circumstellar envelope.
Spectroscopic and photometric data together indicate a B0-B2 IV-Ve
spectral-type star located at a distance of > 10kpc confirming the
Be-star/X-ray binary nature of GS 1843+009.
