A problem of vibration control of smart beams was addressed in various
publications which primarily utilize collocated sensors and actuators and
neglect the effect of measurement noise in the observer design. This paper
develops a natural design of an output controller which utilizes an
eigenfunction approximation of initial continuous model, eliminates control
spillover, and consequently leads to an efficient controller which marginalizes
effect of bounded system and measurement disturbances while reducing beam
vibrations. It is demonstrated that this control approach can be attained by a
non-collocated actuator and a point-sensor of velocity located nearly anywhere
on the beam. We show in simulations that the proposed methodology leads to an
efficient reduction of beam vibrations enforced by unknown bounded
disturbances.
