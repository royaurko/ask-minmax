In some scenarios, the peculiar gravitational potential of linear and mildly
nonlinear structures depends on time and, as a result of this dependence, a
late integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect appears. Here, an appropriate formalism is
used which allows us to improve on the analysis of the spatial scales and
locations of the main cosmological inhomogeneities producing this effect. The
study is performed in the framework of the currently preferred flat model with
cosmological constant, and it is also developed in an open model for
comparisons. Results from this analysis are used to discuss the contribution of
Great Attractor-like objects, voids, and other structures to the CMB
anisotropy.
