We present the first observational evidence of the evolution of sausage-pinch
instability in Active Region 11295 during a prominence eruption using data
recorded on 12 September 2011 by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard
the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We have identified a magnetic flux tube
visible in AIA 304 \AA\ that shows curvatures on its surface with variable
cross-sections as well as enhanced brightness. These curvatures evolved and
thereafter smoothed out within a time-scale of a minute. The curved locations
on the flux tube exhibit a radial outward enhancement of the surface of about
1-2 Mm (factor of 2 larger than the original thickness of the flux tube) from
the equilibrium position. AIA 193 \AA\ snapshots also show the formation of
bright knots and narrow regions inbetween at the four locations as that of 304
\AA\ along the flux tube where plasma emission is larger compared to the
background. The formation of bright knots over an entire flux tube as well as
the narrow regions in < 60 s may be the morphological signature of the sausage
instability. We also find the flows of the confined plasma in these bright
knots along the field lines, which indicates the dynamicity of the flux tube
that probably causes the dominance of the longitudinal field component over
short temporal scales. The observed longitudinal motion of the plasma frozen in
the magnetic field lines further vanishes the formed curvatures and plasma
confinements as well as growth of instability to stablize the flux tube.
