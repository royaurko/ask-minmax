We discuss the energy dependence of hadron production in relativistic
nucleus-nucleus collisions. Several `anomalies' in the energy dependence have
been predicted as signals of the deconfinement phase transition and three of
these signals are observed at the CERN SPS indicating that the onset of
deconfinement in Pb+Pb collisions is located at about 30 A GeV.
