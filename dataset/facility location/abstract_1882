We present recent results of an extensive aging test, performed at the CERN
Gamma Irradiation Facility on two single--gap RPC prototypes, developed for the
LHCb Muon System. With a method based on a model describing the behaviour of an
RPC under high particle flux conditions, we have periodically measured the
electrode resistance R of the two RPC prototypes over three years: we observe a
large spontaneous increase of R with time, from the initial value of about 2
MOhm to more than 250 MOhm. A corresponding degradation of the RPC rate
capabilities, from more than 3 kHz/cm2 to less than 0.15 kHz/cm2 is also found.
