The problem is to determine which processors are reliable in a remote
location by asking "Yes or No" questions. The processors are of three types:
those that always tell the truth, those that always lie, and those the
sometimes tell the truth and sometimes lie. Using self-referential reasoning,
along with earlier techniques, we can regard both the truth-tellers and liars
as reliable and thus the tackle situations when fewer than half the processors
are truth-tellers.
