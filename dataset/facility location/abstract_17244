The temporal variation of the horizontal velocity in subsurface layers
beneath three different types of active regions is studied using the technique
of ring diagrams. In this study, we select active regions (ARs) 10923, 10930,
10935 from three consecutive Carrington rotations: AR 10930 contains a
fast-rotating sunspot in a strong emerging active region while other two have
non-rotating sunspots with emerging flux in AR 10923 and decaying flux in AR
10935. The depth range covered is from the surface to about 12 Mm. In order to
minimize the influence of systematic effects, the selection of active and quiet
regions is made so that these were observed at the same heliographic locations
on the solar disk. We find a significant variation in both components of the
horizontal velocity in active regions as compared to quiet regions. The
magnitude is higher in emerging-flux regions than in the decaying-flux region,
in agreement with earlier findings. Further, we clearly see a significant
temporal variation in depth profiles of both zonal and meridional flow
components in AR 10930, with the variation in the zonal component being more
pronounced. We also notice a significant influence of the plasma motion in
areas closest to the rotating sunspot in AR 10930 while areas surrounding the
non-rotating sunspots in all three cases are least affected by the presence of
the active region in their neighborhood.
