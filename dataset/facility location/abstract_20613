On May 31, 2011 UT a supernova (SN) exploded in the nearby galaxy M51 (the
Whirlpool Galaxy). We discovered this event using small telescopes equipped
with CCD cameras, as well as by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) survey, and
rapidly confirmed it to be a Type II supernova. Our early light curve and
spectroscopy indicates that PTF11eon resulted from the explosion of a
relatively compact progenitor star as evidenced by the rapid shock-breakout
cooling seen in the light curve, the relatively low temperature in early-time
spectra and the prompt appearance of low-ionization spectral features. The
spectra of PTF11eon are dominated by H lines out to day 10 after explosion, but
initial signs of He appear to be present. Assuming that He lines continue to
develop in the near future, this SN is likely a member of the cIIb (compact
IIb; Chevalier and Soderberg 2010) class, with progenitor radius larger than
that of SN 2008ax and smaller than the eIIb (extended IIb) SN 1993J progenitor.
Our data imply that the object identified in pre-explosion Hubble Space
Telescope images at the SN location is possibly a companion to the progenitor
or a blended source, and not the progenitor star itself, as its radius (~10^13
cm) would be highly inconsistent with constraints from our post-explosion
photometric and spectroscopic data.
