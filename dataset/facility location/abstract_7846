We report the discovery of a new young stellar cluster in the outer Galaxy
located at the position of an IRAS PSC source that has been previously
mis-identified as an external galaxy. The cluster is seen in our near-infrared
imaging towards IRAS 04186+5143 and in archive Spitzer images confirming the
young stellar nature of the sources detected. There is also evidence of
sub-clustering seen in the spatial distributions of young stars and of gas and
dust.
  Near- and mid-infrared photometry indicates that the stars exhibit colours
compatible with reddening by interstellar and circumstellar dust and are likely
to be low- and intermediate-mass YSOs with a large proportion of Class I YSOs.
  Ammonia and CO lines were detected, with the CO emission well centred near
the position of the richest part of the cluster. The velocity of the CO and
NH$_3$ lines indicates that the gas is Galactic and located at a distance of
about 5.5 kpc, in the outer Galaxy.
  Herschel data of this region characterise the dust environment of this
molecular cloud core where the young cluster is embedded. We derive masses,
luminosities and temperatures of the molecular clumps where the young stars
reside and discuss their evolutionary stages.
