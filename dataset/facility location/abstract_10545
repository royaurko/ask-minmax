Beam instabilities in the strongly magnetized electron-positron plasma of
pulsar magnetospheres are considered. We analyze the resonance conditions and
estimate the growth rates of the Cherenkov and cyclotron instabilities of the
ordinary (O), extraordinary (X) and Alfv\'{e}n modes in two limiting regimes:
kinetic and hydrodynamic. As a preliminary step, we reconsider wave dispersion
and polarization properties in a one dimensional pair plasma taking into
account relativistic thermal effects. We then find the location of the
Cherenkov and cyclotron resonance of the X, O and Alfv\'{e}n waves with the
particles from the primary beam. The importance of the different instabilities
as a source of the coherent pulsar radiation generation is then estimated
taking into account the angular dependence of the growth rates and the
limitations on the length of the coherent wave-particle interaction imposed by
the curvature of the magnetic field lines. We conclude, that in the pulsar
magnetosphere the Cherenkov-type instabilities occur in the hydrodynamic
regimes, while the cyclotron-type instabilities occur in the kinetic regime. We
argue, that electromagnetic cyclotron-type instabilities on the X, O and
probably Alfv\'{e}n waves are more likely to develop in the pulsar
magnetosphere.
