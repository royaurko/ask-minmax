A series of MnO2 unique nanostructures were synthesized by a facile
hydrothermal method with microwave-assisted procedures. A novel nanostructure
formation mechanism has been proposed, that MnO6 octahedral nuclei and
molecular layers can be rearranged into different nanostructured morphologies
by restacking and splitting, and then clasping, which is associated with tunnel
structure phase transformation. Systematic macrostructure observations and
magnetic property measurements have been conducted on these nanostructures,
which demonstrate that engineering layered structures has the potential to
create many unique nanostructures and unusual physicochemical behaviours.
