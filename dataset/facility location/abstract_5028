The 2x3 channel pseudo Vertex Position Detector (pVPD) in the STAR experiment
at RHIC has been upgraded to a 2x19 channel detector in the same acceptance,
called the Vertex Position Detector (VPD). This detector is fully integrated
into the STAR trigger system and provides the primary input to the minimum-bias
trigger in Au+Au collisions. The information from the detector is used both in
the STAR Level-0 trigger and offline to measure the location of the primary
collision vertex along the beam pipe and the event "start time" needed by other
fast-timing detectors in STAR. The offline timing resolution of single detector
channels in full-energy Au+Au collisions is ~100 ps, resulting in a start time
resolution of a few tens of picoseconds and a resolution on the primary vertex
location of ~1 cm.
