We present an analytical approach to the out of equilibrium dynamics of a
class of kinetic lattice gases under gravity. The location of the jamming
transition, the critical exponents, and the scaling functions characterizing
the relaxation processes are determined. In particular, we find that
logarithmic compaction and simple aging are intimately related to the
Vogel-Fulcher law, while power-law compaction and super-aging behavior occur in
presence of a power-law diffusion.
