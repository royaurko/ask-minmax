We quantify the importance of the mechanical energy released by
radio-galaxies inside galaxy groups. We use scaling relations to estimate the
mechanical energy released by 16 radio-AGN located inside X-ray detected galaxy
groups in the COSMOS field. By comparing this energy output to the host groups'
gravitational binding energy, we find that radio galaxies produce sufficient
energy to unbind a significant fraction of the intra-group medium. This
unbinding effect is negligible in massive galaxy clusters with deeper potential
wells. Our results correctly reproduce the breaking of self-similarity observed
in the scaling relation between entropy and temperature for galaxy groups.
