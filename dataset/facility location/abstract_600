In order to develop an RF cavity that is applicable for a muon beam cooling
channel, a new facility, called Mucool Test Area (MTA) has been built at
Fermilab. MTA is a unique facility whose purpose is to test RF cavities in
various conditions. There are 201 and 805 MHz high power sources, a 4-Tesla
solenoid magnet, a cryogenic system including a Helium liquifier, an explosion
proof apparatus to operate gaseous/liquid Hydrogen, and a beam transport line
to send an intense H- beam from the Fermilab Linac accelerator to the MTA hall.
Recent activities at MTA will be discussed in this document.
