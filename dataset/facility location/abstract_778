There will be a review of the history of polarized proton beams, and a
discussion of the unexpected and still unexplained large transverse spin
effects found in several high energy proton-proton spin experiments at the ZGS,
AGS and Fermilab. Next, there will be a discussion of present and possible
future experiments on the violent elastic collisions of polarized protons at
the 70 GeV U-70 accelerator at IHEP-Protvino in Russia and the new high
intensity 50 GeV J-PARC facility being built at Tokai in Japan.
