We develop a semi-analytical approach to calculate the polarizability tensors
of an arbitrary individual scatterer. The approach is based on the calculation
of induced electric and/or magnetic dipole moments on the scatterer. By taking
the advantages of the present approach, we calculate the individual
polarizability tensors of an isolated scatterer in a homogeneous isotropic
medium. Moreover, we obtain the polarizability tensors of scatterers located
between two different isotropic media. Furthermore, due to the nature of the
proposed method, we may determine the effective polarizability of a scatterer
in a periodic array. To this end and for comparison reasons, we investigate two
other methods for calculating effective polarizability tensors of scatterers in
a two-dimensional periodic array. The proposed approach, in comparison to other
reported approaches, is simpler, easily implemented, and does not require
spherical harmonic expansion or complicated far-field calculations. We examine
the validity of the proposed approach using several examples and compare the
results with other approaches.
