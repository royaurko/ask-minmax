Quadrupole electromagnets have been developed with a hollow coil produced
using an improved periodic reverse electroforming. These will be installed in
each of the drift tubes of the DTL (324 MHz) as part of the JAERI/KEK Joint
Project at the high-intensity proton accelerator facility. Measurements of the
magnets' properties were found to be consistent with computer-calculated
estimated. The details of the design, the fabrication process, and the
measurement results for the quadrupole magnet are described.
