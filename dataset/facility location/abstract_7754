Data for a number of OH maser lines have been collected from surveys. The
posi- tions are compared to recent mid-infrared (MIR) surveys such as
Spitzer-GLIMPSE and WISE, restricting the comparison to point sources. The
colors and intensities of the IR sources are compared. There are many 18 cm OH
masers, but far fewer in lines arising from higher energy levels. We also make
a comparison with the 5 cm Class II methanol masers. We have divided the
results into 3 subsamples: those associated with OH masers only, those
associated with OH masers and Class II methanol masers, and those only
associated with Class II methanol masers. There are no obvious dif- ferences in
the color-color or color-magnitude results for the GLIMPSE point sources.
However, according to the results from the WISE 22 {\mu}m survey, the sources
associ- ated with OH masers are brighter than those associated with methanol
masers. We interpret the presence of OH and methanol masers mark the locations
of regions where stars are forming. The OH masers are located on the borders of
sharp features found in the IR. These are referred to as bubbles. If the OH
masers mark the positions of protostars, the result provides indirect evidence
for triggered star formation caused by the expansion of the bubbles.
