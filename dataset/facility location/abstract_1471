SAFIRE is a versatile imaging Fabry-Perot spectrograph covering 145 to 655
microns, with spectral resolving powers ranging over 5-10,000. Selected as a
"PI" instrument for the airborne Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared
Astronomy (SOFIA), SAFIRE will apply two-dimensional pop-up bolometer arrays to
provide background-limited imaging spectrometry. Superconducting transition
edge bolometers and SQUID multiplexers are being developed for these detectors.
SAFIRE is expected to be a "First Light" instrument, useable during the initial
SOFIA operations. Although a PI instrument rather than a "Facility Class"
science instrument, it will be highly integrated with the standard SOFIA
planning, observation, and data analysis tools.
