We study at perturbative level the correlation functions of a general class
of 1/8 BPS Wilson loops and chiral primaries in N = 4 Super Yang-Mills theory.
The contours and the location of operator insertions share a sphere S^2
embedded into spacetime and the system preserves at least two supercharges. We
perform explicit two-loop computations, for some particular but still rather
general configuration, that confirm the elegant results expected from
localization procedure. We find notably full consistency with the multi-matrix
model averages, obtained from 2D Yang-Mills theory on the sphere, when
interacting diagrams do not cancel and contribute non-trivially to the final
answer.
