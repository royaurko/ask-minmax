The evidence is reviewed that the Broad Line Region (BLR) probably has two
distinct components located at about the same distance from the central black
hole. One component, BLR II, is optically-thick, low-ionization emission at
least some of which arises from a disc and the other, BLR I, is probably
optically-thin emission from a more spherically symmetric halo or atmosphere.
The high Fe II/H-beta ratios seen in Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) are
not due to strong Fe II emission, as is commonly thought, but to unusually weak
Balmer emission, probably caused by higher densities. NLS1s probably differ
from non-NLS1s because of the higher density of gas near the black hole. This
produces a higher accretion rate, a denser BLR, and a view of the central
regions that is more face-on.
