In this paper, we study a Lienard system of the form dot{x}=y-F(x),
dot{y}=-x, where F(x) is an odd polynomial. We introduce a method that gives a
sequence of algebraic approximations to the equation of each limit cycle of the
system. This sequence seems to converge to the exact equation of each limit
cycle. We obtain also a sequence of polynomials R_n(x) whose roots of odd
multiplicity are related to the number and location of the limit cycles of the
system.
