Understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of people within a city is
crucial to many planning applications. Obtaining data to create required
knowledge, currently involves costly survey methods. At the same time
ubiquitous mobile sensors from personal GPS devices to mobile phones are
collecting massive amounts of data on urban systems. The locations,
communications, and activities of millions of people are recorded and stored by
new information technologies. This work utilizes novel dynamic data, generated
by mobile phone users, to measure spatiotemporal changes in population. In the
process, we identify the relationship between land use and dynamic population
over the course of a typical week. A machine learning classification algorithm
is used to identify clusters of locations with similar zoned uses and mobile
phone activity patterns. It is shown that the mobile phone data is capable of
delivering useful information on actual land use that supplements zoning
regulations.
