Charge symmetry breaking (CSB) observables are a suitable experimental tool
to examine effects induced by quark masses on the nuclear level. Previous high
precision data from TRIUMF and IUCF are currently used to develop a consistent
description of CSB within the framework of chiral perturbation theory. In this
work the experimental studies on the reaction dd->4He{\pi}0 have been extended
towards higher excess energies in order to provide information on the
contribution of p-waves in the final state. For this, an exclusive measurement
has been carried out at a beam momentum of p=1.2 GeV/c using the WASA-at-COSY
facility. The total cross section amounts to sigma(tot) = (118 +- 18(stat) +-
13(sys) +- 8(ext)) pb and first data on the differential cross section are
consistent with s-wave pion production.
