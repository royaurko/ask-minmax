Scalar mesons are a key expression of the infrared regime of QCD. The
lightest of these is the $\sigma$. Now that its pole in the complex energy
plane has been precisely located, we can ask whether this state is transiently
${\bar q}q$ or ${\bar {qq}} qq$ or a multi-meson molecule or largely glue? The
two photon decay of the $\sigma$ can, in principle, discriminate between these
possibilities. We review here how the $\gamma\gamma\to\pi^+\pi^-$, $\pi^0\pi^0$
cross-sections can be accurately computed. The result not only agrees with
experiment, but definitively fixes the radiative coupling of the $\sigma$. This
equates to a two photon width of $(4.1 \pm 0.3)$ keV, which accords with the
simple non-relativistic quark model expectation for a ${\bar u}u, {\bar d}d$
scalar. Nevertheless, robust predictions from relativistic strong coupling QCD
are required for each of the possible compositions before we can be sure which
one really delivers the determined $\gamma\gamma$ coupling.
