In this paper we determine a formula for calculating the refractive index
${\bf n}$ for the acoustic equation from the partial Dirichlet to Neumann
map(DN) associated to ${\bf n}$. We apply these results to identify locations
and values of small volume perturbations of this refractive index at fixed
frequency $\omega$.
