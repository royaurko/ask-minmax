We discovered independently the shell-type supernova remnant G12.82-0.02,
recently reported by Brogan et al. (2005), which is coincident with the
unidentified TeV gamma-ray source revealed in the HESS survey of the Galactic
plane. Estimating the ambient starlight at the location of this source from the
integrated Ly alpha luminosity of the nearby H II region W33, we conclude that
inverse Compton emission is a viable explanation for the observed TeV emission.
Examining remnants in the survey of Aharonian et al. (2005a) including those
detected above 200 Gev and those not detected, we find a strikingly large range
of more than three orders of magnitude in the radio to TeV flux ratios. We
briefly explore the possible explanations of this range and the implications
for the TeV emission mechanism.
