We survey the methods proposed in the literature for detecting moons of
extrasolar planets in terms of their ability to distinguish between prograde
and retrograde moon orbits, an important tracer of moon formation channel. We
find that most moon detection methods, in particular, sensitive methods for
detecting moons of transiting planets, cannot observationally distinguishing
prograde and retrograde moon orbits. The prograde and retrograde cases can only
be distinguished where dynamical evolution of the orbit due to e.g. three body
effects is detectable, where one of the two cases is dynamically unstable or
where new observational facilities which can implement a technique capable of
differentiating the two cases, come on line. In particular, directly imaged
planets are promising targets as repeated spectral and photometric
measurements, required to determine moon orbit direction, could also be
conducted with the primary interest of characterising the planet itself.
