The reaction gamma p -> p pi0 gamma' has been measured with the Crystal Ball
/ TAPS detectors using the energy-tagged photon beam at the electron
accelerator facility MAMI-B. Energy and angular differential cross sections for
the emitted photon gamma' and angular differential cross sections for the pi0
have been determined with high statistics in the energy range of the
Delta+(1232) resonance. Cross sections and the ratio of the cross section to
the non-radiative process gamma p -> p pi0 are compared to theoretical reaction
models, having the anomalous magnetic moment kappa_Delta+ as free parameter. As
the shape of the experimental distributions is not reproduced in detail by the
model calculations, currently no extraction of kappa_Delta+ is feasible.
