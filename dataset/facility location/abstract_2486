The properties of charmed mesons in nuclear matter and nuclei are reviewed.
Different frameworks are discussed paying a special attention to unitarized
coupled-channel approaches which incorporate heavy-quark spin symmetry. Several
charmed baryon states with negative parity are generated dynamically by the
s-wave interaction between pseudoscalar and vector meson multiplets with
$1/2^+$ and $3/2^+$ baryons. These states are compared to experimental data.
Moreover, the properties of open-charm mesons in matter are analyzed. The
in-medium solution accounts for Pauli blocking effects, and for the meson
self-energies in a self-consistent manner. The behavior in the nuclear medium
of the rich spectrum of dynamically-generated baryon states is studied as well
as their influence in the self-energy and, hence, the spectral function of open
charm. The possible experimental signatures of the in-medium properties of open
charm are finally addressed, such as the formation of charmed nuclei, in
connection with the future FAIR facility.
