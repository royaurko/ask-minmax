Founded in 2010, the Taiwan Extragalactic Astronomical Data Center (TWEA-DC)
has for goal to propose access to large amount of data for the Taiwanese and
International community, focusing its efforts on Extragalactic science. In
continuation with individual efforts in Taiwan over the past few years, this is
the first steppingstone towards the building of a National Virtual Observatory.
Taking advantage of our own fast indexing algorithm (BLINK), based on a
octahedral meshing of the sky coupled with a very fast kd-tree and a clever
parallelization amongst available resources, TWEA-DC will propose from spring
2013 a service of "on-the-fly" matching facility, between on-site and
user-based catalogs. We will also offer access to public and private raw and
reducible data available to the Taiwanese community. Finally, we are developing
high-end on-line analysis tools, such as an automated photometric redshifts and
SED fitting code (APz), and an automated groups and clusters finder (APFoF).
