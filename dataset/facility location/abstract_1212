Since there are several ways planets can survive the giant phase of the host
star, we examine the habitability and detection of planets orbiting white
dwarfs. As a white dwarf cools from 6000 K to 4000 K, a planet orbiting at 0.01
AU would remain in the Continuous Habitable Zone (CHZ) for ~8 Gyr. We show that
photosynthetic processes can be sustained on such planets. The DNA-weighted UV
radiation dose for an Earth-like planet in the CHZ is less than the maxima
encountered on Earth, hence non-magnetic white dwarfs are compatible with the
persistence of complex life. Polarisation due to a terrestrial planet in the
CHZ of a cool white dwarf is 10^2 (10^4) times larger than it would be in the
habitable zone of a typical M-dwarf (Sun-like star). Polarimetry is thus a
viable way to detect close-in rocky planets around white dwarfs. Multi-band
polarimetry would also allow reveal the presence of a planet atmosphere,
providing a first characterisation. Planets in the CHZ of a 0.6 M_sun white
dwarf will be distorted by Roche geometry, and a Kepler-11d analogue would
overfill its Roche lobe. With current facilities a Super-Earth-sized
atmosphereless planet is detectable with polarimetry around the brightest known
cool white dwarf. Planned future facilities render smaller planets detectable,
in particular by increasing the instrumental sensitivity in the blue.
