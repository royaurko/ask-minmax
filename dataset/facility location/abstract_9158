I review selected current observations of distant galaxies and our
interpretation of the fragile (and occasionally contradictory) data. Galaxies
at the ``contemporary limit'' of technology and redshift (z~6) are difficult to
locate in the first place. Moreover, the large redshift may push some critical
confirming and/or interpretative analysis toward unfamiliar IR wavelengths. I
will concentrate on observational means and results to explore the early
evolution of galaxies. We also note the biases that intrude on plans for the
interpretative aspects of distant galaxy photometry and spectroscopy. We
discuss the best methods of selection for those very distant systems; these
methods include utilizing strong sub-mm emission from dust, photometry
indicating a UV "spectral break," and finally the signal of a strong Lyman
alpha emission line. This feature has now carried us to a galaxy redshift in
excess of z = 6.57!
