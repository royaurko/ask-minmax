We present a coarse molecular-dynamics (CMD) approach for the study of
stress-induced structural transformations in crystals at finite temperatures.
The method relies on proper choice of a coarse variable (order parameter,
observable), which parameterizes the changes in effective free energy during
the transformation. Results are reported for bcc-to-hcp lattice transitions
under pressure. We explore coarse-variable space to reconstruct an effective
free-energy landscape quantifying the relative stability of different
metastable basins and locate the onset, at a critical pressure, of the
bcc-to-hcp transformation.
