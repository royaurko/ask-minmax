In order to investigate the influence of the environment on the supernova
(SN) production we have performed a statistical investigation of the SNe
discovered in isolated galaxies, in pairs and in groups of galaxies. 22 SNe in
18 isolated galaxies, 48 SNe in 40 galaxies members of 37 pairs and 211 SNe in
170 galaxies members of 116 groups have been selected and studied. We found
that the radial distributions of core-collapse SNe in galaxies located in
different environments are similar, and consistent with that reported by
Bartunov, Makarova & Tsvetkov (1992). SNe discovered in pairs do not privilege
a particular direction with respect to the companion galaxy. Also the azimuthal
distributions inside the hosts members of galaxy groups are consistent with
being isotropics. The fact that SNe are more frequent in the brighter
components of the pairs and groups is expected from the dependence of the SN
rates on the galaxy luminosity. There is an indication that the SN rate is
higher in galaxy pairs compared with that in groups. This can be related to the
enhanced star formation rate in strongly interacting systems. It is concluded
that, with the possible exception of strongly interacting system, the parent
galaxy environment has no direct influence on the SN production
