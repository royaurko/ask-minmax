In this paper, a fully coherent radiation option with controllable
polarization is proposed for Shanghai deep ultraviolet free electron laser
(FEL) test facility. Intensive start-to-end simulation suggests that, the two
crossed planar undulators which generate the horizontal and vertical linear
polarized FEL respectively, should be placed as close as possible for avoiding
the polarization performance degradation of the final combined FEL radiation.
With the existence of the phase-shifter between the two crossed radiators,
Fourier-Transform-Limited output radiation with 100 nJ order pulse energy, 5 ps
full pulse length and circular polarization degree above 90% could be achieved.
