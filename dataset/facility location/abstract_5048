Fuel moisture has a major influence on the behavior of wildland fires and is
an important underlying factor in fire risk assessment. We propose a method to
assimilate dead fuel moisture content observations from remote automated
weather stations (RAWS) into a time-lag fuel moisture model. RAWS are spatially
sparse and a mechanism is needed to estimate fuel moisture content at locations
potentially distant from observational stations. This is arranged using a trend
surface model (TSM), which allows us to account for the effects of topography
and atmospheric state on the spatial variability of fuel moisture content. At
each location of interest, the TSM provides a pseudo-observation, which is
assimilated via Kalman filtering. The method is tested with the time-lag fuel
moisture model in the coupled weather-fire code WRF-SFIRE on 10-hr fuel
moisture content observations from Colorado RAWS in 2013. We show using
leave-one-out testing that the TSM compares favorably with inverse squared
distance interpolation as used in the Wildland Fire Assessment System. Finally,
we demonstrate that the data assimilation method is able to improve fuel
moisture content estimates in unobserved fuel classes.
