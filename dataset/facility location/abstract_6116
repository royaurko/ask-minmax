We study the scaling regime of nucleon-anti-nucleon annihilation into a
deeply virtual photon and a photon or meson, \bar p N -> gamma ^* pi, \bar p N
-> gamma ^* gamma, in the forward direction. The leading twist amplitude
factorizes into an antiproton distribution amplitude, a short-distance matrix
element and a long-distance dominated transition distribution amplitude (TDA)
which describes the nucleon to meson or photon transition. The impact
representation of this TDA maps out the transverse locations of the small size
core and the meson or photon cloud inside the proton.
