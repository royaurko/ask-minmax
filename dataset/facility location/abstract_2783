We study the branching ratios of the lepton flavor violating processes \mu ->
e\gamma, \tau -> e\gamma and \tau -> \mu\gamma in the split fermion scenario,
with the assumption that the new Higgs doublet is restricted to the 4D brane
(thin bulk) in one and two extra dimensions, in the framework of the two Higgs
doublet model. We observe that the branching ratios are sensitive to the
location of the 4D brane and, in the second case, the width of the thin bulk,
especially for the \mu -> e\gamma decay.
