In the quest of understanding how star formation occurs and propagates in the
low metallicity environment of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), we acquired
deep F555W (~V), and F814W (~I) HST/ACS images of the young and massive star
forming region NGC 346. These images and their photometric analysis provide us
with a snapshot of the star formation history of the region. We find evidence
for star formation extending from ~10 Gyr in the past until ~150 Myr in the
field of the SMC. The youngest stellar population (~3 +/- 1 Myr) is associated
with the NGC 346 cluster. It includes a rich component of low mass pre-main
sequence stars mainly concentrated in a number of sub-clusters, spatially co-
located with CO clumps previously detected by Rubio et al. (2000). Within our
analysis uncertainties, these sub-clusters appear coeval with each other. The
most massive stars appear concentrated in the central sub-clusters, indicating
possible mass segregation. A number of embedded clusters are also observed.
This finding, combined with the overall wealth of dust and gas, could imply
that star formation is still active. An intermediate age star cluster, BS90,
formed ~4.3 +/-0.1 Gyr ago, is also present in the region. Thus, this region of
the SMC has supported star formation with varying levels of intensity over much
of the cosmic time.
