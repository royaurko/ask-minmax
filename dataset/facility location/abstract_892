New facilities and technologies have advanced our understanding of massive
stars significantly over the past 30 years. Here I introduce a new large survey
of massive stars using VLT-FLAMES, noting the target fields and observed binary
fractions. These data have been used for the first empirical test of the
metallicity dependence of the intensity of stellar winds, finding good
agreement with theory -- an important result for the evolutionary models that
are used to interpret distant clusters, starbursts, and star-forming galaxies.
Looking ahead, plans for future Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) are now
undergoing significant development, and offer the exciting prospect of
observing spatially-resolved massive stars well beyond the Local Group.
