The seismic potential maps for Greece, particularly for the years 2005 and
2010 (end of 2009), have been calculated following the methodology of the
"lithospheric seismic energy flow model". The compiled, for the year 2005, map
is compared to the observed large seismicity of 2005 - 2010 period.
Furthermore, a comparison is made of the seismic charge status regarding the
year 2005 to the one of 2000. It is revealed that there exists an increase of
the seismic potential which results into triggering, in the next five years
period (2005 - 2010), almost double the number of large EQs, compared to the
ones observed during 2000 - 2005 period of time. Finally, estimation is made
about the seismic accelerating deformation status of the entire Greek
territory. It is shown that, since 2004, accelerated deformation monotonically
increases and it is speculated that some large seismic events is possible to
occur within the next 1 - 3 years. The average "virtual" magnitude of these
seismic events, considering the entire Greek territory as a single unit
seismogenic area, has been calculated as Ms = 8.18R. In practice, these events
will be decomposed into a number of smaller in magnitude, but still large too,
seismic events located at normally different seismogenic areas.
