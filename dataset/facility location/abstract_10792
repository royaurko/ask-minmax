Newtonian dynamics is derived from prior information codified into an
appropriate statistical model. The basic assumption is that there is an
irreducible uncertainty in the location of particles so that the state of a
particle is defined by a probability distribution. The corresponding
configuration space is a statistical manifold the geometry of which is defined
by the information metric. The trajectory follows from a principle of
inference, the method of Maximum Entropy. No additional "physical" postulates
such as an equation of motion, or an action principle, nor the concepts of
momentum and of phase space, not even the notion of time, need to be
postulated. The resulting entropic dynamics reproduces the Newtonian dynamics
of any number of particles interacting among themselves and with external
fields. Both the mass of the particles and their interactions are explained as
a consequence of the underlying statistical manifold.
