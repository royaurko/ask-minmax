Yttrium can be loaded with hydrogen up to high concentrations causing
dramatic structural and electronic changes of the host lattice. We report on
angle-resolved photoemission experiments of the Y trihydride phase. Most
importantly, we find the absence of metal d-bands at the Fermi level and a set
of flat, H-induced bands located at much higher binding energy than predicted,
indicating an increased electron affinity at H sites.
