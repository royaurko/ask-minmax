The history and the main results of the energy scan program at the CERN SPS
are reviewed. Several anomalies in energy dependence of hadron production
predicted as signals of deconfinement phase transition are observed and they
indicate that the onset of deconfinement is located at about 30 A GeV. For the
first time we seem to have clear evidence for the existence of a deconfined
state of matter in nature.
