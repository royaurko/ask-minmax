Correlation analysis of Swift gamma-ray burst coordinates and nearby star
locations (catalog Gliese) reveals 4 coincidences with good angular accuracy.
The random probability is 4\times 10^{-5}, so evidencing that coincident stars
are indeed gamma-ray burst sources. Some additional search of stellar gamma-ray
bursts is discussed.
