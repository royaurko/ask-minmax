The general relativistic gravitomagnetic clock effect consists in the fact
that two massive test bodies orbiting a central spinning mass in its equatorial
plane along two identical circular trajectories, but in opposite directions,
take different times in describing a full revolution with respect to an
asymptotically inertial observer. In the field of the Earth such time shift
amounts to 10^{-7} s. Detecting it by means of a space based mission with
artificial satellites is a very demanding task because there are severe
constraints on the precision with which the radial and azimuthal positions of a
satellite must be known: delta r= 10^{-2} cm and delta phi= 10^{-2}
milliarcseconds per revolution. In this paper we assess if the systematic
errors induced by various non-gravitational perturbations allow to meet such
stringent requirements. A couple of identical, passive laser-ranged satellites
of LAGEOS type with their spins aligned with the Earth's one is considered. It
turns out that all the non vanishing non-gravitational perturbations induce
systematic errors in r and phi within the required constraints for a reasonable
assumption of the mismodeling in some satellite's and Earth's parameters and/or
by using dense satellites with small area-to-mass ratio. However, the error in
the Earth's GM is by far the largest source of uncertainty in the azimuthal
location which is affected at a level of 1.2 milliarcseconds per revolution.
