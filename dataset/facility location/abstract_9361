In this Letter we derive the SZ effect (SZE) observable in the direction of
the giant X-ray cavities found in the atmospheres of galaxy clusters. We
explore specifically the case of the cluster MS0735.6+7421. The SZE produced in
the cavities embedded in the cluster thermal atmosphere is of non-thermal
nature: it dominates the overall cluster SZE at the frequency x_{0,th} - at
which the thermal SZE from the cluster vanishes - and appears, at mm and sub-mm
frequencies, as a negative SZE located only in the regions of the intracluster
space occupied by the cavities. We show that SZ observations, combined with
X-ray and radio data, are able to shed light on the morphology, on the physical
structure, on the dynamics and the origin of these recently discovered
non-thermal features of galaxy clusters. These studies will be also relevant to
determine the impact of specific events of the nature of cavities on the use of
SZ and X-ray clusters as probes for cosmology and for the large scale structure
of the universe.
