We report on narrowband CN imaging of Comet 103P/Hartley 2 obtained at Lowell
Observatory on 39 nights from 2010 July until 2011 January. We observed two
features, one generally to the north and the other generally to the south. The
CN morphology varied during the apparition: no morphology was seen in July; in
August and September the northern feature dominated and appeared as a mostly
face-on spiral; in October, November, and December the northern and southern
features were roughly equal in brightness and looked like more side-on
corkscrews; in January the southern feature was dominant but the morphology was
indistinct due to very low signal. The morphology changed smoothly during each
night and similar morphology was seen from night to night. However, the
morphology did not exactly repeat each rotation cycle, suggesting that there is
a small non-principal axis rotation. Based on the repetition of the morphology,
we find evidence that the fundamental rotation period was increasing: 16.7 hr
from August 13-17, 17.2 hr from September 10-13, 18.2 hr from October 12-19,
and 18.7 hr from October 31-November 7. We conducted Monte Carlo jet modeling
to constrain the pole orientation and locations of the active regions based on
the observed morphology. Our preliminary, self-consistent pole solution has an
obliquity of 10 deg relative to the comet's orbital plane (i.e., it is centered
near RA = 257 deg and Dec=+67 deg with an uncertainty around this position of
about 15 deg) and has two mid-latitude sources, one in each hemisphere.
