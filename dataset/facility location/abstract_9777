Social networks have the surprising property of being "searchable": Ordinary
people are capable of directing messages through their network of acquaintances
to reach a specific but distant target person in only a few steps. We present a
model that offers an explanation of social network searchability in terms of
recognizable personal identities: sets of characteristics measured along a
number of social dimensions. Our model defines a class of searchable networks
and a method for searching them that may be applicable to many network search
problems, including the location of data files in peer-to-peer networks, pages
on the World Wide Web, and information in distributed databases.
