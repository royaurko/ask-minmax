A full spectral survey was carried out towards the Giant Molecular Cloud
complex, Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2), using the ISO Long Wavelength Spectrometer
Fabry-Perot mode. This provided complete wavelength coverage in the range
47-196 um (6.38-1.53 THz) with a spectral resolution of 30-40 km/s. This is an
unique dataset covering wavelengths inaccessible from the ground. It is an
extremely important region of the spectrum as it contains both the peak of the
thermal emission from dust, and crucial spectral lines of key atomic (OI, CII,
OIII, NII and NIII) and molecular species (NH3, NH2, NH, H2O, OH, H3O+, CH,
CH2, C3, HF and H2D+). In total, 95 spectral lines have been identified and 11
features with absorption depth greater than 3 sigma remain unassigned. Most of
the molecular lines are seen in absorption against the strong continuum,
whereas the atomic and ionic lines appear in emission (except for absorption in
the OI 63 um and CII 158 um lines). Sgr B2 is located close to the Galactic
Centre and so many of the features also show a broad absorption profile due to
material located along the line of sight. A full description of the survey
dataset is given with an overview of each detected species and final line lists
for both assigned and unassigned features.
