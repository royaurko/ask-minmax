The kinematical features of the Sagittarius (R=5.7 kpc), Carina (R=6.5 kpc),
Cygnus (R=6.8 kpc), and Perseus (R=8.2 kpc) arm fragments suggest the existence
of two spiral patterns rotating at different angular velocities in the Galaxy.
The inner spiral pattern represented by the Sagittarius arm rotates at the
angular velocity of the bar, Omega=60(+/-5) km s-1 kpc-1. The outer spiral
pattern, which consists of the Carina, Cygnus and Perseus arms, rotates at a
smaller angular velocity, Omega=12-22 km s-1 kpc-1. The existence of the outer
slow tightly wound spiral pattern and the inner fast spiral pattern can be
explained in terms of the results of numerical simulations of the dynamics of
the outer pseudoring. The OLR of the bar must be located between the
Sagittarius and Carina arms. The Cygnus arm appears as a connecting link
between the fast and slow spiral patterns.
