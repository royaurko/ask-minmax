Aims: ``Compact ellipticals'' are so rare that a search for M32 analogs is
needed to ensure the very existence of this class. Methods: We report here the
discovery of A496cE, a M32 twin in the cluster Abell 496, located in the halo
of the central cD. Results: Based on CFHT and HST imaging we show that the
light profile of A496cE requires a two component fit: a Sersic bulge and an
exponential disc. The spectrum of A496cE obtained with the ESO-VLT
FLAMES/Giraffe spectrograph can be fit by a stellar synthesis spectrum
dominated by old stars, with high values of [Mg/Fe] and velocity dispersion.
Conclusions: The capture of A496cE by the cD galaxy and tidal stripping of most
of its disc are briefly discussed.
