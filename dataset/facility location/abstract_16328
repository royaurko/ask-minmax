The velocity of the inner ejecta of stripped-envelope core-collapse
supernovae (CC-SNe) is studied by means of an analysis of their nebular
spectra. Stripped-envelope CC-SNe are the result of the explosion of bare cores
of massive stars ($\geq 8$ M$_{\odot}$), and their late-time spectra are
typically dominated by a strong [O {\sc i}] $\lambda\lambda$6300, 6363 emission
line produced by the innermost, slow-moving ejecta which are not visible at
earlier times as they are located below the photosphere. A characteristic
velocity of the inner ejecta is obtained for a sample of 56 stripped-envelope
CC-SNe of different spectral types (IIb, Ib, Ic) using direct measurements of
the line width as well as spectral fitting. For most SNe, this value shows a
small scatter around 4500 km s$^{-1}$. Observations ($< 100$ days) of
stripped-envelope CC-SNe have revealed a subclass of very energetic SNe, termed
broad-lined SNe (BL-SNe) or hypernovae, which are characterised by broad
absorption lines in the early-time spectra, indicative of outer ejecta moving
at very high velocity ($v \geq 0.1 c$). SNe identified as BL in the early phase
show large variations of core velocities at late phases, with some having much
higher and some having similar velocities with respect to regular CC-SNe. This
might indicate asphericity of the inner ejecta of BL-SNe, a possibility we
investigate using synthetic three-dimensional nebular spectra.
