We discuss the prospects of studying lepton number violating processes in
order to identify Majorana neutrinos from low scale seesaw mechanisms at
lepton-proton colliders. In particular, we consider the scenarios of colliding
electrons with LHC energy protons and, motivated by the efforts towards the
construction of a muon collider, the prospects of muon-proton collisions. We
find that present constraints on the mixing of the Majorana neutrinos still
allow for a detectable signal at these kind of facilities given the smallness
of the Standard Model background. We discuss possible cuts in order to further
increase the signal over background ratio and the prospects of reconstructing
the neutrino mass from the kinematics of the final state particles.
