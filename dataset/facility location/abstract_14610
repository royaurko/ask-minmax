We have used the ASCA satellite to make the first X-ray spectra of Markarian
6, a bright Seyfert 1.5 galaxy with complex and variable permitted lines, an
ionization cone, and remarkable radio structures. Our 0.6--9.5 keV spectra
penetrate to the black hole core of this Seyfert and reveal heavy and complex
intrinsic X-ray absorption. Both total covering and single partial covering
models fail to acceptably fit the observed absorption, and double partial
covering or partial covering plus warm absorption appears to be required. The
double partial covering model provides the best statistical fit to the data,
and we measure large column densities of ~ (3-20) * 10^{22} cm^{-2}
irrespective of the particular spectral model under consideration. These X-ray
columns are over an order of magnitude larger than expected based on
observations at longer wavelengths. Our data suggest that most of the X-ray
absorption occurs either in gas that has a relatively small amount of dust or
in gas that is located within the Broad Line Region. The X-ray absorber may
well be the putative `atmosphere' above the torus that collimates the
ionization cone. We also detect an apparently broad 6.4 keV iron K-alpha line,
and we present optical spectra demonstrating that the optical emission lines
were in a representative state during our ASCA observation.
