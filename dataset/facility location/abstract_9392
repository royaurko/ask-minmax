We present new results from an ongoing survey of carbon-rich asymptotic giant
(AGB) stars in the halo of our Galaxy. After selecting candidates primarily
through their 2MASS colours, slit spectroscopy was achieved at the ESO NTT
telescope. Twenty-one new AGB carbon stars were discovered, increasing the
total of presently known similar AGB C stars to about 120. A further four were
observed again in order to confirm their carbon-rich nature and measure radial
velocities. Two main findings emerge from this work. First, we found a C star
located at about 130 kpc from the Sun and at b = -62 degrees. This distant star
is remarkably close (5 kpc) to the principal plane of the Stream of the
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and is likely to be a tracer of a distant poorly
populated southern warp of the Stream. etc etc
