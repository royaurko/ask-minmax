This paper describes a system for supporting coarse-grained location-based
synchronisation. This type of synchronisation may occur when people need only
some awareness about the location of others within the specific context of an
on-going activity. We have identified a number of reference scenarios for this
type of synchronisation and we have implemented and deployed a prototype to
evaluate the type of support provided. The results of the evaluation suggest a
good acceptance of the overall concept, indicating that this might be a
valuable approach for many of the indicated scenarios, possibly replacing or
complementing existing synchronisation practices.
