In this paper we propose a new optical architecture for the laser optical
feedback imaging (LOFI) technique which makes it possible to avoid the adverse
effect of the optical parasitic backscattering introduced by all the optical
interfaces located between the laser source and the studied object. This
proposed setup need no specific or complex alignment, that why we can consider
the proposed setup as self aligned. We describe the principle used to avoid the
parasitic backscattering contributions which deteriorate dramatically amplitude
and phase information contained in the LOFI images. Finally, we give successful
demonstration of amplitude and phase images obtained with this self aligned
setup in presence of a parasitic reflection.
