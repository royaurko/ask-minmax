I review the current capabilities of small, medium and large telescopes in
the study of minor bodies of the Solar System (MBOSS), with the goal of
identifying those areas where the next generation of Extremely Large Telescopes
(ELTs) are required to progress. This also leads to a discussion of the
synergies between large and small telescopes. It is clear that the new
facilities that will become available in the next decades will allow us to
discover smaller and more distant objects (completing size distributions) and
to characterise and even resolve larger individual bodies and multiple systems,
however we must also recognise that there is still much to be learned from wide
surveys that require more time on more telescopes than can ever be available on
ELTs. Smaller telescopes are still required to discover and characterise large
samples of MBOSS.
