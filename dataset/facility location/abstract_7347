The electron doping of undoped high-$T_c$ cuprates via the transfer of charge
from manganites (or other oxides) using heterostructure geometries is here
theoretically discussed. This possibility is mainly addressed via a detailed
analysis of photoemission and diffusion voltage experiments, which locate the
Fermi level of manganites above the bottom of the upper Hubbard band of some
cuprate parent compounds. A diagram with the relative location of Fermi levels
and gaps for several oxides is presented. The procedure discussed here is
generic, allowing for the qualitative prediction of the charge flow direction
at several oxide interfaces. The addition of electrons to antiferromagnetic Cu
oxides may lead to a superconducting state at the interface with minimal
quenched disorder. Model calculations using static and dynamical mean-field
theory, supplemented by a Poisson equation formalism to address charge
redistribution at the interface, support this view. The magnetic state of the
manganites could be antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic. The former is better to
induce superconductivity than the latter, since the spin-polarized charge
transfer will be detrimental to singlet superconductivity. It is concluded that
in spite of the robust Hubbard gaps, the electron doping of undoped cuprates at
interfaces appears possible, and its realization may open an exciting area of
research in oxide heterostructures.
