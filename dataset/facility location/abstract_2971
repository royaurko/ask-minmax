We study the dependence of the location of the Cosmic Microwave Background
Radiation (CMBR) peaks on the parameters of the generalized Chaplygin gas
model, whose equation of state is given by $p = - A/\rho^{\alpha}$, where $A$
is a positive constant and $0 < \alpha \le 1$. We find, in particular, that
observational data arising from Archeops for the location of the first peak,
BOOMERANG for the location of the third peak, supernova and high-redshift
observations allow constraining significantly the parameter space of the model.
Our analysis indicates that the emerging model is clearly distinguishable from
the $\alpha = 1$ Chaplygin case and the $\Lambda$CDM model.
