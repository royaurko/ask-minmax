In an effort to locate the cause(s) of high electric-field breakdown in
x-band accelerating structures, we have cleanly-autopsied (no debris added by
post-operation structure disassembly) an RF-processed structure. Macroscopic
localization provided operationally by RF reflected wave analysis and acoustic
sensor pickup was used to connect breakdowns to autopsied crater damage areas.
Surprisingly, the microscopic analyses showed breakdown craters in areas of low
electric field. High currents induced by the magnetic field on sharp corners of
the input coupler appears responsible for the extreme breakdown damage
observed.
