We review and extend a previous study on the symmetry of the superconducting
state, stimulated by recent tunneling and Andreev reflection measurements
giving robust evidences for the existence of a $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ order
parameter in the overdoped regime of two different cuprates. Looking for a
possible second-order phase transition from a standard $d_{x^2-y^2}$ to a mixed
and time reversal breaking state, we confirm the results of our previous
analysis on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$. In the case of
Y$_{1-y}$Ca$_y$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ as well, among all the allowed symmetries,
the $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ is the most favored one and the unconventional state
is likely to occur in a small dome of the phase diagram located in the
optimal-overdoped region and at very low temperatures.
