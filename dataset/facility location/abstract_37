This project addressed the conceptual fundamentals of data storage,
investigating techniques for provision of highly generic storage facilities
that can be tailored to produce various individually customised storage
infrastructures, compliant to the needs of particular applications. This
requires the separation of mechanism and policy wherever possible. Aspirations
include: actors, whether users or individual processes, should be able to bind
to, update and manipulate data and programs transparently with respect to their
respective locations; programs should be expressed independently of the storage
and network technology involved in their execution; storage facilities should
be structure-neutral so that actors can impose multiple interpretations over
information, simultaneously and safely; information should not be discarded so
that arbitrary historical views are supported; raw stored information should be
open to all; where security restrictions on its use are required this should be
achieved using cryptographic techniques. The key advances of the research were:
1) the identification of a candidate set of minimal storage system building
blocks, which are sufficiently simple to avoid encapsulating policy where it
cannot be customised by applications, and composable to build highly flexible
storage architectures 2) insight into the nature of append-only storage
components, and the issues arising from their application to common storage
use-cases.
