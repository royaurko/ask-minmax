VERITAS (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System) is an array
of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes sensitive to very high energy (VHE)
gamma-rays above 100 GeV. Located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in
southern Arizona, USA, the VERITAS array of four 12m-diameter telescopes began
full operation in September 2007. Two major upgrades, the relocation of
telescope 1 in Summer 2009 and the upgrade of the level-2 trigger in Fall 2011,
made VERITAS the most sensitive VHE instrument in the northern hemisphere. The
VERITAS Collaboration consists of scientists from institutions in the USA,
Canada, Germany and Ireland. VERITAS is performing observations that cover a
broad range of science topics, including the study of galactic and
extragalactic astrophysical sources of VHE radiation and the study of particle
astrophysics, such as the indirect search for dark matter in astrophysical
environments. The VERITAS observational campaigns resulted in the detection of
40 VHE sources, including the discovery of 20 new VHE gamma-ray emitting
sources. Here we summarize the current status of the observatory, describe the
recent scientific highlights and outline plans for the future.
