We present a multilevel study of the emission of methanol, detected for the
first time in this galaxy, and discuss the origin of its emission. The high
observed methanol abundance of a few 10^-9 can only be explained if injection
of methanol from dust grains is taken into account. While the overall
[CH3OH]/[NH3] ratio is much larger than observed towards other starbursts, the
dense high excitation component shows a similar value to that found in NGC 253
and Maffei 2. Our observations suggest the molecular material in M 82 to be
formed by dense warm cores, shielded from the UV radiation and similar to the
molecular clouds in other starbursts, surrounded by a less dense
photodissociated halo. The dense warm cores are likely the location of recent
and future star formation within M 82.
