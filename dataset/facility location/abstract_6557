The CKM paradigm has been proven to be successful in explaining the flavour
structure of the standard model and the non-trivial imaginary phase of the CKM
matrix is the only know source of CP-violation. B-meson decays allow us to
precisely determine the fundamental parameters of the CKM matrix and put
stringent constraints on the models of New Physics. I present some of the most
recent measurements related to the CKM Unitarity Triangle performed by the
BaBar experiment, located at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. Most
results are based on the final BaBar dataset, consisting of 467 M BB pairs.
