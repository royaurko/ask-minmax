The transport properties of carriers in semiconducting graphene nanoribbons
are studied by comparing the effects of phonon, impurity, and line-edge
roughness scattering. It is found that scattering from impurities located at
the surface of nanoribbons, and from acoustic phonons are as important as line
edge roughness scattering. The relative importance of these scattering
mechanisms varies with the temperature, Fermi level location, and the width of
the ribbons. Based on the analysis, strategies for improvement of low-field
mobility are described.
