We develop a new theoretical model for the spectral formation process in
accretion-powered X-ray pulsars based on a detailed treatment of the bulk and
thermal Comptonization occurring in the accreting, shocked gas. A rigorous
eigenfunction expansion method is employed to obtain the analytical solution
for the Green's function describing the scattering of radiation injected into
the column from a monochromatic source located at an arbitrary height above the
stellar surface. The emergent spectrum is calculated by convolving the Green's
function with source terms corresponding to bremsstrahlung, cyclotron, and
blackbody emission. The energization of the photons in the shock, combined with
cyclotron absorption, naturally produces an X-ray spectrum with a relatively
flat continuum shape and a high-energy quasi-exponential cutoff. We demonstrate
that the new theory successfully reproduces the phase-averaged spectra of the
bright pulsars Her X-1, LMC X-4, and Cen X-3. In these luminous sources, it is
shown that the emergent spectra are dominated by Comptonized bremsstrahlung
emission.
