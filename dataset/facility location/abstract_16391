We present new optical broadband colors, obtained with the Keck 1 and Vatican
Advanced Technology telescopes, for six objects in the inner classical Kuiper
Belt. Objects in the inner classical Kuiper Belt are of interest as they may
represent the surviving members of the primordial Kuiper Belt that formed
interior to the current position of the 3:2 resonance with Neptune, the current
position of the plutinos, or, alternatively, they may be objects formed at a
different heliocentric distance that were then moved to their present
locations. The six new colors, combined with four previously published, show
that the 10 inner belt objects with known colors form a neutral clump and a
reddish clump in B-R color. Nonparametric statistical tests show no significant
difference between the B-R color distribution of the inner disk objects
compared to the color distributions of Centaurs, plutinos, or scattered disk
objects. However, the B-R color distribution of the inner classical Kuiper belt
objects does differ significantly from the distribution of colors in the cold
(low inclination) main classical Kuiper belt. The cold main classical objects
are predominately red, while the inner classical belt objects are a mixture of
neutral and red. The color difference may reveal the existence of a gradient in
the composition and /or surface processing history in the primordial Kuiper
Belt, or indicate that the inner disk objects are not dynamically analogous to
the cold main classical belt objects.
