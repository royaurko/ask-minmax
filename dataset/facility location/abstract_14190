We report on the optical identification of the neutron star burster EXO
1745-248 in Terzan 5. The identification was performed by exploiting HST/ACS
images acquired in Director's Discretionary Time shortly after (approximately 1
month) the Swift detection of the X-ray burst. The comparison between these
images and previous archival data revealed the presence of a star that
currently brightened by ~3 magnitudes, consistent with expectations during an
X-ray outburst. The centroid of this object well agrees with the position, in
the archival images, of a star located in the Turn-Off/Sub Giant Branch region
of Terzan 5. This supports the scenario that the companion should has recently
filled its Roche Lobe. Such a system represents the pre-natal stage of a
millisecond pulsar, an evolutionary phase during which heavy mass accretion on
the compact object occurs, thus producing X-ray outbursts and re-accelerating
the neutron star.
