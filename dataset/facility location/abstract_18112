We present a few newly found old sunspot observations from the years AD 1708,
1709, and 1710, which were obtained by Peter Becker from Rostock, Germany. For
1709, Becker gave a detailed drawing: he observed a sunspot group made up of
two spots on Jan 5, 6, and 7, and just one of the two spots was observed on Jan
8 and 9. We present his drawing and his explanatory text. We can measure the
latitude and longitude of these two spots and estimate their sizes for all five
days. While the spots and groups in 1708 and the spot on four of the five days
in January 1709 were known before from other observers (e.g. Hoyt & Schatten
1998), the location of the spots in early January 1709 were not known before,
so that they can now be considered in reconstructed butterfly diagrams. The
sunspots detected by Becker on 1709 Jan 5 and 1710 Sep 10 were not known before
at all, as the only observer known for those two dates, La Hire, did not detect
that spot (group). We estimate new group sunspot numbers for the relevant days,
months, and years. The time around 1708--1710 is important, because it
documents the recovery of solar activity towards the end of the Maunder Grand
Minimum. We also show two new spot observations from G. Kirch for 1708 Sep 13
\& 14 as described in his letter to Wurzelbaur (dated Berlin AD 1708 Dec 19).
