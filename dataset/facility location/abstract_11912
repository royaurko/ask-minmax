We present a theoretical model that explains the high energy phenomenology of
the neighborhood of SNR IC 443, as observed with the Major Atmospheric Gamma
Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescope and the Energetic Gamma-Ray Experiment
Telescope (EGRET). We also discuss how the model can be tested with
observations by the Fermi Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope. We interpret
MAGIC J0616+225 as delayed TeV emission of cosmic-rays diffusing from IC 443
and interacting with a known cloud located at a distance of about 20 pc in the
foreground of the remnant. This scenario naturally explains the displacement
between EGRET and MAGIC sources, their fluxes, and their spectra. Finally, we
predict how this context can be observed by Fermi.
