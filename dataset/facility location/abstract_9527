The premise that Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) exist beyond the optical
extent of nearby galaxies is investigated. A published catalog containing 41
ULX candidates located between 1 and ~3 times the standard D_{25} isophotal
radius of their putative host galaxies is examined. Twenty-one of these sources
have spectroscopically-confirmed distances. All 21 are background objects
giving a 95% probability that at least 37 of the 41 candidates are background
sources. Thirty-nine of the 41 sources have X-ray-to-optical flux ratios,
-1.6<log(F_{X}/F_{O})<+1.3, consistent with those of background active galactic
nuclei. (The remaining two are not detected in optical to a weak limit of
m_{B}~21.5$ mag corresponding to log(F_{X}/F_{O})\gtrsim 1.6.) The uniform
spatial distribution of the sample is also consistent with a background
population. This evidence suggests that ULXs rarely, if at all, exist beyond
the distribution of luminous matter in nearby galaxies and, as a consequence,
there is no correlation between the population of ULXs and halo objects such as
old globular clusters or Pop~III remnants.
