In this paper, we report on observations of the CoRoT LRa1 field with the
Berlin Exoplanet Search Telescope (BEST). The current paper is part of a series
of papers describing the results of our stellar variability survey. The BEST is
a small aperture telescope with a wide field of view (FOV). It is dedicated to
searching for stellar variability within the target fields of the CoRoT space
mission to aid in minimizing false-alarm rates and identify potential targets
for additional science. The LRa1 field is CoRoT's second long run field located
in the galactic anticenter direction. We observed the LRa1 stellar field on 23
nights between November and March 2005/2006. From 6099 stars marked as
variable, 39 were classified as periodic variable stars and 27 of them are
within the CoRoT FOV. We also confirmed the variability for four stars listed
in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars (GCVS).
