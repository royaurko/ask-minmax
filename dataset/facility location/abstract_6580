Theoretical calculations locate the critical point of strongly interacting
matter (CP) at energies accessible at the CERN SPS. Event-by-event transverse
momentum and multiplicity fluctuations are considered as one of the most
important tools to search for the CP. Pilot studies of the energy dependence
and the system size dependence of both $p_T$ and multiplicity fluctuations were
performed by the NA49 experiment. The NA61/SHINE ion program is a continuation
of these efforts. After briefly recalling the essential NA49 results on
fluctuations we will discuss the technical methods (removing Non-Target
interactions) which we plan to apply for future transverse momentum and
multiplicity fluctuation analyses.
