The aim of this work is to design a semi-automatic application that can be
used as an aid by the doctors for smoothly conducting Hammersmith Infant
Neurological Examination (IDNE). A simplified version of the examination which
provides a quantitative neurological assessment is used to design the
application. The application includes a methodology of conducting IDNE
examination suited to inexperienced staff, applicable to both neonatal and
post-neonatal infants. It also provides a facility to go through the previous
records of a patient that can help in diagnosing patients with high risk of
neurological disorder. A semi-automatic approach is proposed for skeleton
generation. The application has been installed in hospitals and currently in
operation. It is expected to increase the efficiency of conducting HINE using
the proposed application.
