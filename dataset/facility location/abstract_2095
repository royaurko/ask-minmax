Testing is one of the most indispensable tasks in software engineering. The
role of testing in software development has grown significantly because testing
is able to reveal defects in the code in an early stage of development. Many
unit test frameworks compatible with C/C++ code exist, but a standard one is
missing. Unfortunately, many unsolved problems can be mentioned with the
existing methods, for example usually external tools are necessary for testing
C++ programs.
  In this paper we present a new approach for testing C++ programs. Our
solution is based on C++ template metaprogramming facilities, so it can work
with the standard-compliant compilers. The metaprogramming approach ensures
that the overhead of testing is minimal at runtime. This approach also supports
that the specification language can be customized among other advantages.
Nevertheless, the only necessary tool is the compiler itself.
