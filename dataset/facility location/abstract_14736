ATCA 21 cm HI observations of the rich galaxy cluster ACO 3627 in the Great
Attractor region are presented. Three fields of 30' diameter located within one
Abell radius of ACO 3627 were observed with a resolution of 15'' and an rms
noise of \sim 1 mJy/beam. Only two galaxies were detected in these fields. We
compare their HI distribution to new optical R-band images and discuss their
velocity fields. The first galaxy is a gas-rich unperturbed spiral whereas the
second shows a peculiar HI distribution. The estimated 3-sigma HI mass limit of
our observations is \sim 7 x 10^8 M_{\odot} for a line width of 150 km s^{-1}.
The non-detection of a considerable number of luminous spiral galaxies
indicates that the spiral galaxies are HI deficient. The low detection rate is
comparable to the HI deficient Coma cluster (Bravo-Alfaro et al. 2000). ACO
3627 is a bright X-ray cluster. We therefore suspect that ram pressure
stripping is responsible for the HI deficiency of the bright cluster spirals.
