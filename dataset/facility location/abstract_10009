The invaded cluster approach is extended to 2D Potts model with annealed
vacancies by using the random-cluster representation. Geometrical arguments are
used to propose the algorithm which converges to the tricritical point in the
two-dimensional parameter space spanned by temperature and the chemical
potential of vacancies. The tricritical point is identified as a simultaneous
onset of the percolation of a Fortuin-Kasteleyn cluster and of a percolation of
"geometrical disorder cluster". The location of the tricritical point and the
concentration of vacancies for q = 1, 2, 3 are found to be in good agreement
with the best known results. Scaling properties of the percolating scaling
cluster and related critical exponents are also presented.
