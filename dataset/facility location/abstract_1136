We point out that the new exotic resonances recently reported by LHCb in the
$J/\psi p$ channel are excellent candidates for photoproduction off a proton
target, and estimate their cross section using vector dominance. The relevant
photon energies and fluxes are well within the capabilities of the GlueX and
CLAS12 detectors at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLAB). A
corresponding calculation is also performed for photoproduction of analogous
resonances which are predicted to exist in the $\Upsilon p$ channel.
