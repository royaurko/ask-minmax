We present a detailed X-ray study of the Broad Line Radio Galaxy 3C382,
observed with the BeppoSAX satellite in a very bright state. The continuum
emission is well modeled with a power law that steepens at high energies, with
an e-folding energy of about 120 keV. At soft energies a clear excess of
emission is detected, which can not be explained solely by the extended thermal
halo seen in a ROSAT HRI image. A second, more intense soft X-ray component,
possibly related to an accretion disk, is required by the data. Both a
reflection component (R=0.3) and an iron line (EW \sim 50) are detected, at
levels much weaker than in Seyfert galaxies, suggesting a common origin.
Combining our measurements with results from the literature we find that the
iron line has remained approximately constant over 9 years while the continuum
varied by a factor of 5. Thus the fluorescent gas does not respond promptly to
the variations of the X-ray primary source, suggesting that the reprocessing
site is located away, likely at parsec distances. While the continuum shape
indicates that X-rays derive from a thermal Comptonization process, the
weakness of other spectral features implies that either the upper layers of the
optically thick accretion disk are completely ionized or the corona above the
disk is outflowing with mildly relativistic velocity.
