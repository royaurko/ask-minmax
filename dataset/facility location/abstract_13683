To remain useful for their users, software systems need to continuously
enhance and extend their functionality. Nevertheless, in many object-oriented
applications, features are not represented explicitly. The lack of
modularization is known to make application features difficult to locate, to
comprehend and to modify in isolation from one another. In our work, we
implement restructuring using Featureous plug-in where we can change the
classes between packages. In the previous literature works, lot of complexities
arises while using the tool due to dependencies. Changes to the code without
knowing the root cause of the problem leads to further production of new
errors. So, we aim in finding the restructuring candidates which have to be
rearranged, thereby applying changes to the code on those parts using the tool
helps in ordered arrangement of the source code. Applying modularization to the
restructuring candidates will lead to decrease in the human effort as well as
tool effort in restructuring. Unwanted evolution of new errors will be
eliminated
