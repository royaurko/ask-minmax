With the attempt to find the holographic description of the usual acoustic
black hole in fluid, we construct an acoustic black hole formed in the
$d$-dimensional fluid located at the timelike cutoff surface of an neutral
black brane in asymptotically AdS$_{d+1}$ spacetime, the bulk gravitational
dual of the acoustic black hole is presented at first order of the hydrodynamic
fluctuation. Moreover, the Hawking-like temperature of the acoustic black hole
horizon is showed to be connected to the Hawking temperature of the real AdS
black brane in the bulk, and the duality between the phonon propagating in the
acoustic black hole and the sound channel quasinormal mode is analyzed. We thus
point out that, the acoustic black hole in fluid, which was originally proposed
as an analogous model to simulate Hawking radiation of the real black hole, is
not merely an analogy, it can indeed be used to describe specific properties of
the real black hole, in the spirits of the fluid/gravity duality.
