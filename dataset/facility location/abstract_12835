The study of environmental problems usually requires the description of
variables with different nature and the assessment of relations between them.
In this work, an algorithm for flexible estimation of the joint density for a
circular-linear variable is proposed. The method is applied for exploring the
relation between wind direction and SO2 concentration in a monitoring station
close to a power plant located in Galicia (NW-Spain), in order to compare the
effectiveness of precautionary measures for pollutants reduction in two
different years.
