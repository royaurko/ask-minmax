Research and development at the nanoscale requires a large degree of
integration, from convergence of research disciplines in new fields of enquiry
to new linkages between start-ups, regional actors and research facilities.
Based on the analysis of two clusters in nanotechnologies (MESA+ (Twente) and
other centres in The Netherlands and Minatec in Grenoble in France), the paper
discusses the phenomenon of technological agglomeration: co-located scientific
and technological fields associated to coordinated technology platforms to some
extent actively shaped by institutional entrepreneurs. Such co-location and
coordination are probably a prerequisite for the emergence of strong
nanoclusters
