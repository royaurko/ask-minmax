Earth-mass planets embedded in gaseous protoplanetary disks undergo Type I
orbital migration. In radiative disks an additional component of the corotation
torque scaling with the entropy gradient across the horseshoe region can
counteract the general inward migration, Type I migration can then be directed
either inward or outward depending on the local disk properties. Thus, special
locations exist in the disk toward which planets migrate in a convergent way.
  Here we present N-body simulations of the convergent migration of systems of
low-mass (M=1-10 m_earth) planets. We show that planets do not actually
converge in convergence zones. Rather, they become trapped in chains of mean
motion resonances (MMRs). This causes the planets' eccentricities to increase
to high enough values to affect the structure of the horseshoe region and
weaken the positive corotation torque. The zero-torque equilibrium point of the
resonant chain of planets is determined by the sum of the attenuated corotation
torques and unattenuated differential Lindblad torques acting on each planet.
  The effective convergence zone is shifted inward. Systems with several
planets can experience stochastic migration as a whole due to continuous
perturbations from planets entering and leaving resonances.
