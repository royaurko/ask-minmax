A two-band (B and V) wide-field imaging survey of a complete, all-sky X-ray
selected sample of 78 clusters in the redshift range z=0.04-0.07 is presented.
The aim of this survey is to provide the astronomical community with a complete
set of homogeneous, CCD-based surface photometry and morphological data of
nearby cluster galaxies located within 1.5 Mpc from the cluster center. The
data collection has been completed in seven observing runs at the INT and
ESO-2.2m telescopes. For each cluster, photometric data of about 2500 galaxies
(down to V~23) and detailed morphological information of about 600 galaxies
(down to V~21) are obtained by using specially designed automatic tools.
  As a natural follow up of the photometric survey, we also illustrate a long
term spectroscopic program we are carrying out with the WHT-WYFFOS and AAT-2dF
multifiber spectrographs. Star formation rates and histories, as well as
metallicity estimates will be derived for about 350 galaxies per cluster from
the line indices and equivalent widths measurements, allowing us to explore the
link between the spectral properties and the morphological evolution in high-
to low-density environments, and across a wide range in cluster X-ray
luminosities and optical properties.
