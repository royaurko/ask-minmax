We report on the search for a CPT and Lorentz invariance violating coupling
of the 3He and 129Xe nuclear spins (each largely determined by a valence
neutron) to background tensor fields which permeate the universe. Our
experimental approach is to measure the free precession of nuclear spin
polarized 3He and 129Xe atoms in a homogeneous magnetic guiding field of about
400 nT using LTC SQUIDs as low-noise magnetic flux detectors. As the laboratory
reference frame rotates with respect to distant stars, we look for a sidereal
modulation of the Larmor frequencies of the co-located spin samples. As a
result we obtain an upper limit on the equatorial component of the background
field interacting with the spin of the bound neutron bn< 6.7*10^-34 GeV (68%
C.L.). Our result improves our previous limit (data measured in 2009) by a
factor of 30 and the world's best limit by a factor of 5.
