We report on our analysis of a 20 ksec Chandra X-ray observation of the
quasi-persistent neutron star soft X-ray transient (SXT) 1M1716-315 in
quiescence. Only one source was detected in the HEAO-I error region. Its
luminosity is 1.6E32-1.3E33 erg s-1. In this the range is dominated by the
uncertainty in the source distance. The source spectrum is well described by an
absorbed soft spectrum, e.g. a neutron star atmosphere or black body model. No
optical or near-infrared counterpart is present at the location of the X-ray
source, down to a magnitude limit of I> 23.5 and K_s> 19.5. The positional
evidence, the soft X-ray spectrum together with the optical and near-infrared
non-detections provide strong evidence that this source is the quiescent
neutron star SXT. The source is 10-100 times too bright in X-rays in order to
be explained by stellar coronal X-ray emission. Together with the interstellar
extinction measured in outburst and estimates for the source distance, the
reported optical and near-infrared limit give an upper limit on the absolute
magnitude of the counterpart of I>8.6 and K_s>5.1. This implies that the system
is either an ultra-compact X-ray binary having P_orb<1 hr or the companion star
is an M-dwarf. We reconstructed the long term X-ray lightcurve of the source.
1M1716-315 has been active for more than 12 years before returning to
quiescence, the reported Chandra observation started 16.9+-4.1 years after the
outburst ended.
