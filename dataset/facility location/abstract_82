In this paper I show that the coolest $\sigma$Orionis cluster planet S Ori 70
is still a strong candidate member despite recent claims by Burgasser et al.
that it could be a brown dwarf interloper. The main point of my argument is
that the colors of S Ori 70 are significantly different to those of field
dwarfs. This object has in fact the reddest $H-K$ color of all known T dwarfs,
a clear indication of low gravity according to all published models. In a $J-H$
versus $H-K$ diagram, S Ori 70 lies in the region where models of ultracool
dwarfs predict that low gravity objects should be located. I conclude that S
Ori 70 is still a strong candidate member of the $\sigma$Orionis open cluster.
I briefly discuss additional observational tests that can be carried out with
existing facilities to verify the $\sigma$Orionis membership of this cluster
planet candidate.
