Aims. A transient astrophysical event observed in both gravitational wave
(GW) and electromagnetic (EM) channels would yield rich scientific rewards. A
first program initiating EM follow-ups to possible transient GW events has been
developed and exercised by the LIGO and Virgo community in association with
several partners. In this paper, we describe and evaluate the methods used to
promptly identify and localize GW event candidates and to request images of
targeted sky locations.
  Methods. During two observing periods (Dec 17 2009 to Jan 8 2010 and Sep 2 to
Oct 20 2010), a low-latency analysis pipeline was used to identify GW event
candidates and to reconstruct maps of possible sky locations. A catalog of
nearby galaxies and Milky Way globular clusters was used to select the most
promising sky positions to be imaged, and this directional information was
delivered to EM observatories with time lags of about thirty minutes. A Monte
Carlo simulation has been used to evaluate the low-latency GW pipeline's
ability to reconstruct source positions correctly.
  Results. For signals near the detection threshold, our low-latency algorithms
often localized simulated GW burst signals to tens of square degrees, while
neutron star/neutron star inspirals and neutron star/black hole inspirals were
localized to a few hundred square degrees. Localization precision improves for
moderately stronger signals. The correct sky location of signals well above
threshold and originating from nearby galaxies may be observed with ~50% or
better probability with a few pointings of wide-field telescopes.
