SPHERES (SPectrometer with High Energy RESolution) is a third-generation
neutron backscattering spectrometer, located at the 20 MW German neutron source
FRM II and operated by the Juelich Centre for Neutron Science. It offers an
energy resolution (fwhm) better than 0.65 micro-eV, a dynamic range of +-31
micro-eV, and a signal-to-noise ratio of up to 1750:1.
