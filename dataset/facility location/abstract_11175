It is well-known that magnetic impurities can change the symmetry class of
disordered metallic systems by breaking spin and time-reversal symmetry. At low
temperature these symmetries can be restored by Kondo screening. It is also
known that at the Anderson metal-insulator transition, wave functions develop
multifractal fluctuations with power law correlations. Here, we consider the
interplay of these two effects. We show that multifractal correlations open
local pseudogaps at the Fermi energy at some random positions in space. When
dilute magnetic impurities are at these locations, Kondo screening is strongly
suppressed. We find that when the exchange coupling J is smaller than a certain
value J*, the metal-insulator transition point extends to a critical region in
the disorder strength parameter and to a band of critical states. The width of
this critical region increases with a power of the concentration of magnetic
impurities.
