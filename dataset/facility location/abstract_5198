We have built an 80-mega pixels (10240 X 8192) mosaic CCD camera, called
Suprime-Cam, for the wide-field prime focus of the 8.2 m Subaru telescope.
Suprime-Cam covers a field of view 34' X 27', a unique facility among the the
8-10 m class telescopes, with a resolution of 0.''202 per pixel. The focal
plane consists of ten high-resistivity 2k X 4k CCDs developed by MIT Lincoln
Laboratory, which are cooled by a large stirling-cycle cooler. The CCD readout
electronics was designed to be scalable, which allows the multiple read-out of
tens of CCDs. It takes 50 seconds to readout entire arrays. We designed a
filter-exchange mechanism of the jukebox type that can hold up to ten large
filters (205 X 170 X 15 mm^3). The wide-field corrector is basically a
three-lens Wynne-type, but has a new type of atmospheric dispersion corrector.
The corrector provides a flat focal plane and an un-vignetted field of view of
30' in diameter. The achieved co-planarity of the focal array mosaic is smaller
than 30 micron peak-to-peak, which realizes mostly the seeing limited image
over the entire field. The median seeing in the Ic-band, measured over one year
and a half, is 0.''61. The PSF anisotropy in Suprime-Cam images, estimated by
stellar ellipticities, is about 2% under this median seeing condition. At the
time of commissioning, Suprime-Cam had the largest survey speed, which is
defined as the field of view multiplied by the primary mirror area of the
telescope, among those cameras built for sub-arcsecond imaging.
