In this paper we obtain the Fourier Transform of a continuous gravitational
wave. We have analysed the data set for (i) one year observation time and (ii)
arbitrary observation time, for arbitrary location of detector and source
taking into account the effects arising due to rotational as well as orbital
motion of the earth. As an application of the transform we considered spin down
and N-component signal analysis.
