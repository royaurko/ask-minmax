We consider a standard model singlet which is accessible to a single extra
dimension and its zero mode is localized with Gaussian profile around a point
different than the origin. This zero mode scalar is a possible candidate for
the dark matter and its annihilation rate is sensitive to the compactification
radius of the extra dimension, the localization width and the position. For the
case of non resonant annihilation, we estimated the dark matter scalar location
around a point, at a distance \sim 3 \times localization width from the origin,
by using the annihilation rate which is based on the current relic density.
