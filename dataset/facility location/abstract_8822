We have obtained spectral and timing data on GX 3+1 and Ser X-1. Both sources
were observed simultaneously with BeppoSAX and RXTE. The RXTE data is used to
provide power spectra and colour-colour diagrams in order to constrain the
state (and thus track $\dot M$) the sources are in. The BeppoSAX data provide
the broad-band spectra. The spectra of both sources are reasonably well-fit
using a model consisting of a disk-blackbody, a comptonized component and a Fe
line, absorbed by interstellar absorption. The electron temperature (kT$_{\rm
e}$) of the Comptonizing plasma is in both cases $\sim$2.5 keV. This implies
that no strong high-energy tail from the Comptonized component is present in
either of the sources. We discuss the similarities between these burst sources
and the luminous X-ray sources located in globular clusters. We find that the
spectral parameters of the comptonized component provide information about the
mass-accretion rate, which agrees well with estimates from the timing and
spectral variations.
