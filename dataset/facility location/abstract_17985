We investigate the multiple stellar populations in one of peculiar globular
clusters (GCs) M22 using new ground-based wide-field Ca by and HST/WFC3
photometry with equivalent passbands, confirming our previous result that M22
has a distinctive red-giant branch (RGB) split mainly due to difference in
metal abundances. We also make use of radial velocity measurements of the large
number of cluster membership stars by other. Our main results are followings.
(i) The RGB and the subgiant branch (SGB) number ratios show that the
calcium-weak (Ca-w) group is the dominant population of the cluster. However,
an irreconcilable difference can be seen in the rather simple two horizontal
branch (HB) classification by other. (ii) Each group has its own CN-CH
anti-correlation. However, the alleged CN-CH positive correlation is likely
illusive. (iii) The location of the RGB bump of the calcium-strong (Ca-s) group
is significantly fainter, which may pose a challenge to the helium enhancement
scenario in the Ca-s group. (iv) The positions of the center are similar. (v)
The Ca-w group is slightly more centrally concentrated, while the the Ca-s is
more elongated at larger radii. (vi) The mean radial velocities for both groups
are similar, but the Ca-s group has a larger velocity dispersion. (vii) The
Ca-s group rotates faster. The plausible scenario for the formation of M22 is
that it formed via a merger of two GCs in a dwarf galaxy environment and
accreted later to our Galaxy.
