The onset and bifurcation points of the $n$-cycles of a polynomial map are
located through a characteristic equation connecting cyclic polynomials formed
by periodic orbit points. The minimal polynomials of the critical parameters of
the logistic, H\'enon, and cubic maps are obtained for $n$ up to 13, 9, and 8,
respectively.
