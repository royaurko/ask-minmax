We show by detailed model computation how much the Pre-Main Sequence (PMS)
Lithium depletion depends on the treatment of over-adiabaticity, by taking
advantage of the results of new models by Montalb\'an et al., which apply
different treatments of convection to non-grey PMS models. In order to
reproduce both the PMS lithium depletion (inferred from the lithium depletion
patterns in young open clusters), and the location of PMS tracks in the HR
diagram (inferred from the study of young PMS stars), convection both in the
atmosphere and in a good fraction of the stellar envelope must be highly
inefficient: e.g., in the Mixing Length Theory approximation, it must have a
very low alpha=l/H_p. Unfortunately, the radii of these models are at variance
with the solar radius, possibly indicating t hat there is some additional
physical input, generally not taken into account in the stellar models, which
affects the efficiency of convection in PMS stars, but probably not in the main
sequence stars nor in evolved red giants. We stress the importance of
determining precisely masses and lithium abundance in PMS binaries such as the
important spectroscopic and eclipsing binary RXJ0529.4+0041.
