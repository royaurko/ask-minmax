We calculate the first six non-normalized moments of particle multiplicity
within the framework of the hadron resonance gas model. In terms of the lower
order moments and corresponding correlation functions, general expressions of
higher order moments are derived. Thermal evolution of the first four
normalized moments and their products (ratios) are studied at different
chemical potentials {\mu}, so that it is possible to evaluate them at chemical
freeze out curve. It is found that a non-monotonic behavior, reflecting the
dynamical fluctuation and strong correlation of particles starts to appear from
the normalized third order moment. We introduce novel conditions for describing
the chemical freeze out curve. Although the hadron resonance gas model does not
contain any information on the criticality related to the chiral dynamics and
singularity in some physical observables, we are able find out the location of
the QCD critical endpoint at $\mu\sim 350 $MeV and temperature $T \sim 162
$MeV.
