Low-energy excited states in 71,73Ni populated via the {\beta} decay of
71,73Co were investigated in an experiment performed at the National
Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University (MSU).
Detailed analysis led to the construction of level schemes of 71,73Ni, which
are interpreted using systematics and analyzed using shell model calculations.
The 5/2- states attributed to the the f5/2 orbital and positive parity 5/2+ and
7/2+ states from the g9/2 orbital have been identified in both 71,73Ni. In 71Ni
the location of a 1/2- {\beta}-decaying isomer is proposed and limits are
suggested as to the location of the isomer in 73Ni. The location of positive
parity cluster states are also identified in 71,73Ni. Beta-delayed neutron
branching ratios obtained from this data are given for both 71,73Co.
