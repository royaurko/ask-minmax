High energy astrophysics is one of the most active branches in contemporary
astrophysics. It studies astrophysical objects that emit X-ray and gamma-ray
photons, such as accreting super-massive and stellar-size black holes, and
various species of neutron stars. With the operations of many space-borne and
ground-based observational facilities, high energy astrophysics has enjoyed a
rapid development in the past decades. It is foreseen that the field will
continue to advance rapidly in the coming decade, with possible ground-breaking
discoveries of astrophysical sources in the high-energy neutrino and
gravitational wave channels. This Special Issue of Frontiers of Physics is
dedicated to a systematic survey of the field of high energy astrophysics as it
stands in 2013.
