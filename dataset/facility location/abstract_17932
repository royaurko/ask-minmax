Coronal-Line Forest Active Galactic Nuclei (CLiF AGN) are remarkable in the
sense that they have a rich spectrum of dozens of coronal emission lines (e.g.
[FeVII], [FeX] and [NeV]) in their spectra. Rose, Elvis & Tadhunter (2015)
suggest that the inner obscuring torus wall is the most likely location of the
coronal line region in CLiF AGN, and the unusual strength of the forbidden high
ionization lines is due to a specific AGN-torus inclination angle. Here we test
this suggestion using mid-IR colours (4.6$\mu$m-22$\mu$m) from the Wide-Field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) for the CLiF AGN. We use the Fischer et al.
(2014) result that showed that as the AGN-torus inclination becomes more face
on, the Spitzer 5.5$\mu$m to 30$\mu$m colours become bluer. We show that the
[W2-W4] colours for the CLiF AGN ($\langle$[W2-W4]$\rangle$ = 5.92$\pm$0.12)
are intermediate between SDSS type 1 ($\langle$[W2-W4]$\rangle$ =
5.22$\pm$0.01) and type 2 AGN ($\langle$[W2-W4]$\rangle$ = 6.35$\pm$0.03). This
implies that the AGN-torus inclinations for the CLiF AGN are indeed
intermediate, supporting the work of Rose, Elvis \& Tadhunter (2015). The
confirmed relation between CLiF AGN and their viewing angle shows that CLiF AGN
may be useful for our understanding of AGN unification.
