We investigate using direct numerical simulations with grids up to 1536^3
points, the rate at which small scales develop in a decaying three-dimensional
MHD flow both for deterministic and random initial conditions. Parallel current
and vorticity sheets form at the same spatial locations, and further
destabilize and fold or roll-up after an initial exponential phase. At high
Reynolds numbers, a self-similar evolution of the current and vorticity maxima
is found, in which they grow as a cubic power of time; the flow then reaches a
finite dissipation rate independent of Reynolds number.
