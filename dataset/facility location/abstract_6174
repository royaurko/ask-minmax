We construct M-theory on the orbifold C^2/Z_N by coupling 11-dimensional
supergravity to a seven-dimensional Yang-Mills theory located on the orbifold
fixed plane. It is shown that the resulting action is supersymmetric to leading
non-trivial order in the 11-dimensional Newton constant. This action provides
the starting point for a reduction of M-theory on G_2 spaces with co-dimension
four singularities.
