Planet-planet collisions are expected during the early stages of the
formation of extra-solar planets, and are also possible in mature planetary
systems through secular planet-planet perturbations. We investigate the
electromagnetic signals accompanied with these planetary collisions and their
event rate, and explore the possibility of directly detecting such events. A
typical Earth-Jupiter collision would give rise to a prompt EUV-soft-X-ray
flash lasting for hours and a bright IR afterglow lasting for thousands of
years. It is suggested that with the current and forthcoming observational
technology and facilities, some of these collisional flashes or the
post-collision remnants could be discovered.
