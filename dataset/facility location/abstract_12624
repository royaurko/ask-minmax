In the present paper, we observed both two-photon and three-photon induced
distinct photoluminescence from GO nanoparticles under fs laser excitation.
Conjugated with PEG molecules, GO nanoparticles exhibited high chemical
stability, and could effectively label HeLa cells. Imaged with a two-photon
scanning microscope, GO nanoparticles were observed to localize in the
mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi and lysosome of HeLa cells.
Furthermore, GO nanoparticles were micro-injected into the brain of a black
mouse, and in vivo two-photon luminescence imaging illustrated that GO
nanoparticles located at 300 {\mu}m depth in the brain could be clearly
distinguished.
