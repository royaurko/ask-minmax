We discuss the capabilities of a future neutrino factory based on intense
neutrino beams from a muon storage ring to explore the non-standard neutrino
matter interactions, which are assumed to be sub-leading effects in the
standard mass induced neutrino oscillations. The conjunction of these two
mechanisms will magnify fake CP violating effect in the presence of matter
which is not coming from the CP phase in the neutrino mixing matrix. We show
that such fake CP violation can be observed in neutrino factory experiments by
measuring the difference between the neutrino and anti-neutrino probabilities.
In order to perform such test, we consider three neutrino flavors, admitting
the mixing parameters in the range consistent with the oscillation solution to
the atmospheric and the solar neutrino problems, as well as with the
constraints imposed by the reactor neutrino data. We show that with a 10 kt
detector with 5 years of operation, a stored muon energy E_\mu \ge 20 GeV, 2
\times 10^{20} muon decays per year, and a baseline L \sim 732 km, such a
neutrino facility can probe the non-standard flavor changing neutrino
interactions down to the level of (10^{-3}-10^{-2})~G_F, in both \nu_\mu \to
\nu_\tau/ \bar \nu_\mu \to \bar \nu_\tau and \nu_e \to \nu_\tau/\bar \nu_e \to
\bar \nu_\tau modes.
