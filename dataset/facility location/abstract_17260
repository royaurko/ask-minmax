We derived the luminosity function (LF) of dwarf galaxies in the Coma Cluster
down to M_R=-10 at three fields located at the center, intermediate, and
outskirt. The LF (-19<M_R<-10) shows no significant differences among the three
fields. It shows a clear dip at M_R\sim-13, and is composed of two distinct
components of different slopes; the bright component with -19<M_R<-13 has a
flatter slope than the faint component with -13<M_R<-10 which has a steep
slope. The bright component (-19<M_R<-13) consists of mostly red extended
galaxies including few blue galaxies whose colors are typical of late-type
galaxies. On the other hand, the faint component (-13<M_R<-10) consists of
largely PSF-like compact galaxies. We found that both these compact galaxies
and some extended galaxies are present in the center while only compact
galaxies are seen in the outskirt. In the faint component, the fraction of blue
galaxies is larger in the outskirt than in the center. We suggest that the
dwarf galaxies in the Coma Cluster, which make up the two components in the LF,
are heterogeneous with some different origins.
