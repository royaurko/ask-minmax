In order to search for new VLBI sources in the Galactic plane that can be
used as phase reference sources in differential VLBI, we have conducted 22 GHz
observations of radio sources in the Galactic plane using the Japanese VLBI
Network (J-Net). We have observed 267 VLBI source candidates selected from
existing radio surveys and have detected 93 sources at the signal-to-noise
ratio larger than 5. While 42 of the 93 detected sources had already been
detected with VLBI at relatively lower frequency (typically 2 to 8 GHz), the
remaining 51 are found to be new VLBI sources detected for the first time.
These VLBI sources are located within $|b|\le 5^\circ$, and have a large number
of Galactic maser sources around them. Thus, they are potential candidates for
phase reference sources for VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA), which
is the first VLBI array dedicated to the phase referencing VLBI astrometry
aiming at measuring the parallax and proper motion of maser sources in the
whole Galaxy.
