ATF2 is a final-focus test beam line which aims to focus the low emittance
beam from the ATF damping ring to a vertical size of about 37 nm and to
demonstrate nanometer level beam stability. Several advanced beam diagnostics
and feedback tools are used. In December 2008, construction and installation
were completed and beam commissioning started, supported by an international
team of Asian, European, and U.S. scientists. The present status and first
results are described.
