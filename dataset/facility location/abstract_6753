We report trigonometric parallaxes for three massive star forming regions,
corresponding to distances of $2.34^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$ kpc for G12.89+0.49 (also
known as IRAS 18089-1732),$1.98^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$ kpc for G15.03-0.68 (in the
M17 region), and $8.0^{+4.0}_{-2.0}$ kpc for G27.36-0.16. Both G12.89+0.49 and
G15.03-0.68 are located in the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm.
