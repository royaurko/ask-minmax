This paper extends results obtained by [15] for the annealed Ising model
coupled to two-dimensional causal dynamical triangulations. We employ the
Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) representation in order to determine a region in the
quadrant of parameters $\beta,\mu>0$ where the critical curve for the annealed
model is possibly located. This is done by outlining a region where the model
has a unique infinite-volume Gibbs measure, and a region where the
finite-volume Gibbs measure does not have weak limit (in fact, does not exist
if the volume is large enough). We also improve the region of subcritical
behaviour of the model, and provide a better approximation of the free energy.
