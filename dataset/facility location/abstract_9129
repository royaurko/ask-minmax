Observations with the Green Bank Telescope of 21cm HI emission from the
high-velocity cloud Complex H suggest that it is interacting with the Milky
Way. A model in which the cloud is a satellite of the Galaxy in an inclined,
retrograde circular orbit reproduces both the cloud's average velocity and its
velocity gradient with latitude. The model places Complex H at approximately 33
kpc from the Galactic Center on a retrograde orbit inclined about 45 degrees to
the Galactic plane. At this location it has an HI mass > 6 10^6 Msun and
dimensions of at least 10 by 5 kpc. Some of the diffuse HI associated with the
cloud has apparently been decelerated by interaction with Galactic gas. Complex
H has similarities to the dwarf irregular galaxy Leo A and to some compact
high-velocity clouds, and has an internal structure nearly identical to parts
of the Magellanic Stream, with a pressure P/k about 100 cm^{-3} K.
