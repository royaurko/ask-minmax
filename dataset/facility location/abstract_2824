We demonstrate a simple capacitive based method to quickly and efficiently
locate micron size conductive samples on insulating substrates in a scanning
tunneling microscope (STM). By using edge recognition the method is designed to
locate and identify small features when the STM tip is far above the surface
allowing for crash-free search and navigation. The method can be implemented in
any STM environment even at low temperatures and in strong magnetic field, with
minimal or no hardware modifications.
