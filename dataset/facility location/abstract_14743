This paper presents multi-passband optical data obtained from observations of
the Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S), located at alpha ~ 3h 32m, delta ~ -27d
48m. The observations were conducted at the ESO/MPG 2.2m telescope at La Silla
using the 8kx8k Wide-Field Imager (WFI). This data set, taken over a period of
one year, represents the first field to be completed by the ongoing Deep Public
Survey (DPS) being carried out by the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS) project. This
paper describes the optical observations, the techniques employed for
un-supervised pipeline processing and the general characteristics of the final
data set. The paper includes data taken in six different filters U'UBVRI. The
data cover an area of about 0.25 square degrees reaching 5 sigma limiting
magnitudes of U'_AB=26.0, U_AB=25.7, B_AB=26.4$, V_AB=25.4, R_AB=25.5 and I_AB=
24.7 mag, as measured within a 2xFWHM aperture. The optical data covers the
area of ~ 0.1
