We present state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations for the
Co$_2$MnSn full-Heusler alloy. We show that in its bulk form it is a
half-metallic ferromagnet with the Fermi level being located within a tiny gap
of the minority-spin density of states. Moreover the alloy shows the
Slater-Pauling behavior with a total spin magnetic moment in the unit cell of 5
$\mu_B$. In the case of the (001) surfaces, the broken bonds at the surface
form a minority band pinned exactly at the Fermi level destroying the
half-metallicity. Our calculations reveal that both the interfaces with the
non-magnetic metal V and the semiconductor InAs are no more half-metallic due
to the different environment of the atoms of the half-metal at the interface.
These interface states although localized only at the first few interface
layers can become conducting when coupled to defect states and kill the
spin-polarization of the current injected from the half-metal into the
semiconductor or the non-magnetic metallic spacer.
