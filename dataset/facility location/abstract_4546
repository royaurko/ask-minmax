We investigate the number of inverted repeats observed in 37 complete genomes
of bacteria. The number of inverted repeats observed is much higher than
expected using Markovian models of DNA sequences in most of the eubacteria. By
using the information annotated in the genomes we discover that in most of the
eubacteria the inverted repeats of stem length longer than 8 nucleotides
preferentially locate near the 3' end of the nearest coding regions. We also
show that IRs characterized by large values of the stem length locate
preferentially in short non-coding regions bounded by two 3' ends of convergent
genes. By using the program TransTerm recently introduced to predict
transcription terminators in bacterial genomes, we conclude that only a part of
the observed inverted repeats fullfills the model requirements characterizing
rho-independent termination in several genomes.
