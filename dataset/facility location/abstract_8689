We apply a statistical method to derive very precise locations for soft gamma
repeaters using data from the interplanetary network. We demonstrate the
validity of the method by deriving a 600 arcsec^2 error ellipse for SGR1900+14
whose center agrees well with the VLA source position. We then apply it to
SGR1806-20, for which we obtain a 230 arcsec^2 error ellipse, the smallest
burst error box to date. We find that the most likely position of the source
has a small but significant displacement from that of the non-thermal core of
the radio supernova remnant G10.0-0.3, which was previously thought to be the
position of the repeater. We propose a different model to explain the changing
supernova remnant morphology and the positions of the luminous blue variable
and the bursting source.
