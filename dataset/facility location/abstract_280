The paper introduces simple bibliometric-enhanced search facilities which are
derived from the famous stratagems by Bates. Moves, tactics and stratagems are
revisited from a Digital Library perspective. The potential of extended
versions of "journal run" or "citation search" for interactive information
retrieval is outlined. The contributors elaborate on the future implementation and
evaluation of new bibliometric-enhanced search services.
