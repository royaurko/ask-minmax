The concept of local isotropy in a chemically reacting turbulent wall-jet
flow is addressed using direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. Different DNS
databases with isothermal and exothermic reactions are examined. The chemical
reaction and heat release effects on the turbulent velocity, passive scalar and
reactive species fields are studied using their probability density functions
(PDF) and higher order moments for velocities and scalar fields, as well as
their gradients. With the aid of the anisotropy invariant maps for the Reynolds
stress tensor the heat release effects on the anisotropy level at different
wall-normal locations are evaluated and found to be most accentuated in the
near-wall region. It is observed that the small-scale anisotropies are
persistent both in the near-wall region and inside the jet flame. Two
exothermic cases with different Damkohler number are examined and the
comparison revealed that the Damkohler number effects are most dominant in the
near-wall region, where the wall cooling effects are influential. In addition,
with the aid of PDFs conditioned on the mixture fraction, the significance of
the reactive scalar characteristics in the reaction zone is illustrated. We
argue that the combined effects of strong intermittency and strong persistency
of anisotropy at the small scales in the entire domain can affect mixing and
ultimately the combustion characteristics of the reacting flow.
