Exploiting the monotone property of the gradient dynamics of the
Frenkel-Kontorova model, we locate in the space of (p,q)-configurations the
ordered and unordered stationary states, as well as forbidden regions for such
states. Moreover we show that some generalized Frenkel--Kontorova models
(associated to multiharmonic standard maps) can have ordered
(p,q)--configurations that are neither action minimizing nor minimaximizing,
and give their location with respect to the set of (p,q)--minimizers and
minimaximizers.
