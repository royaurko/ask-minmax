Point-contact spectroscopy is applied to study the energy dependence of
paramagnetic impurities in noble metals. The samples are in the form of the
so-called "mechanically controllable break-junctions" where the investigated
piece of alloy makes a nanowire connecting two bulk electrodes.The lateral
dimensions of the bridge are of the order of a few nm and can be continuously
changed. Three qualitative dependences manifest the size effect while
decreasing the contact diameter: 1) Intensity of Kondo peak due to Kondo
scattering in point-contact spectra decreases slower than the nonlinearities
due to phonon scatterings, 2) The width of the Kondo peak becomes broder, and
3) Due to the Zeeman energy, the splitting of Kondo peak in external and
internal (for a spin glass) fields, is suppressed. Explanation of the phenomena
is given in terms of the theory of Zarand and Udvardi where the local density
of states (LDOS) of conduction electron fluctuates strongly inside a nanowire
due to interference of electronic states. Since Kondo effect is a local probe
of LDOS, the impurities located close to the maxima of LDOS show the increase
of the Kondo temperature and give the primary contribution to the contact
resistance.
