We investigate the dual roles of a cobalt impurity in the Ba-122
ferropnictide superconductor in the state with coexisting collinear spin
density wave (SDW) order as a dopant and as a scattering center, using first
principles electronic structure methods. The Co atom is found to dope the FeAs
plane where it is located with a single delocalized electron as expected, but
also induces a strong perturbation of the SDW ground state of the system. This
in turn induces a stripe-like modulation of the density of states in nearby
planes which may be observable in STM experiments. The defect is found to have
an intermediate strength nonmagnetic scattering potential with a range of
roughly 1 Angstrom, and the Co gives rise to a smaller but longer range
magnetic scattering potential. The impurity potential in both channels is
highly anisotropic, reflecting the broken symmetry of the SDW ground state. We
give values for the effective Co potentials for each d orbital on the impurity
and nearby sites. The calculation also shows a clear local resonance comprised
of Co states about 200meV above the Fermi level, in quantitative agreement with
a recent report from STM. Finally, we discuss the issue of the effective
dimensionality of the 122 materials, and show that the hybridization of the
out-of-phase As atoms leads to a higher density of states between the FeAs
planes relative to the 1111 counterparts.
