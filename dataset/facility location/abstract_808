We examine the potential for detecting and studying Higgs bosons at a
photon-photon collider facility associated with a future linear collider. Our
study incorporates realistic $\gam\gam$ luminosity spectra based on the most
probable available laser technology. Results include detector simulations. We
study the cases of: a) a SM-like Higgs boson; b) the heavy MSSM Higgs bosons;
c) a Higgs boson with no $WW/ZZ$ couplings from a general two Higgs doublet
model.
