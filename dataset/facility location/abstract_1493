The first results of a study of the the dwarf spheroidal galaxy, Leo I, using
the new Japanese-South African Infrared Survey Facility (IRSF) are presented.
J,H,K_{s} observations show that most, if not all, of at least the top one
magnitude of the AGB is populated by carbon stars. These objects form a tight
sequence in the K_{s} - (J-K_{s}) plane. In addition there are five very red
objects which are believed to be dust enshrouded AGB stars. They have Mbol near
-5.0 and are at the AGB tip. Comparison with carbon Miras in Magellanic Cloud
clusters and taking into account other evidence on the ages and metallicities
of Leo I populations suggests that these obscured stars belong to the youngest
significant population of Leo I and have ages of ~2 Gyr. Some of them can be
shown to be variable.
