We present here a pattern sensitive PowerPoint presentation scheme. The
presentation is actuated by simple patterns drawn on the presentation screen by
a laser pointer. A specific pattern corresponds to a particular command
required to operate the presentation. Laser spot on the screen is captured by a
RGB webcam with a red filter mounted, and its location is identified at the
blue layer of each captured frame by estimating the mean position of the pixels
whose intensity is above a given threshold value. Measured Reliability,
Accuracy and Latency of our system are 90%, 10 pixels (in the worst case) and
38 ms respectively.
