We present the first light commissioning results from the Physical Research
Laboratory (PRL) optical fiber-fed high resolution cross-dispersed Echelle
Spectrograph. It is capable of a single- shot spectral coverage of 3700A to
8600A at R ~ 63,000 and is under very stable conditions of temperature
(0.04{\deg}C at 23{\deg}C). In the very near future pressure control will also
be achieved by enclosing the entire spectrograph in a low-pressure vacuum
chamber (~0.01mbar). It is attached to a 1.2m telescope using two 50micron core
optical fibers (one for the star and another for simultaneous Th-Ar spectral
calibration). The 1.2m telescope is located at Mt. Abu, India, and we are
guaranteed about 80 to 100 nights a year for observations with the
spectrograph. The instrument will be ultimately used for radial-velocity
searches of exoplanets around 1000 dwarf stars, brighter than 10th magnitude,
for the next 5 years with a precision of 3 to 5m/s using the simultaneous Th-Ar
spectral lamp reference technique. The spectrograph has already achieved a
stability of 3.7m/s in short-term time scale and in the near future we expect
the stability to be at 1m/s once we install the spectrograph inside the vacuum
chamber.
