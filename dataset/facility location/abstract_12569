Cells in a developing embryo have no direct way of "measuring" their physical
position. Through a variety of processes, however, the expression levels of
multiple genes come to be correlated with position, and these expression levels
thus form a code for "positional information." We show how to measure this
information, in bits, using the gap genes in the Drosophila embryo as an
example. Individual genes carry nearly two bits of information, twice as much
as expected if the expression patterns consisted only of on/off domains
separated by sharp boundaries. Taken together, four gap genes carry enough
information to define a cell's location with an error bar of ~1% along the
anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. This precision is nearly enough for each
cell to have a unique identity, which is the maximum information the system can
use, and is nearly constant along the length of the embryo. We argue that this
constancy is a signature of optimality in the transmission of information from
primary morphogen inputs to the output of the gap gene network.
