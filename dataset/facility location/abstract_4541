A one-dimensional model of interacting electrons with on-site $U$,
nearest-neighbor $V$, and correlated-hopping interaction $T^{\ast}$ is studied
at half-filling using the continuum-limit field theory approach. The ground
state phase diagram is obtained for a wide range of coupling constants. In
addition to the insulating spin- and charge-density wave phases for large $U$
and $V$, respectively, we identify bond-located ordered phases corresponding to
an enhanced Peierls instability in the system for $T^\ast>0$,
$|U-2V|<8T^\ast/\pi$ and to a staggered magnetization located on bonds between
sites for $T^\ast<0$, $|U-2V|<8|T^\ast|/\pi$. The general ground state phase
diagram including insulating, metallic, and superconducting phases is
discussed.
