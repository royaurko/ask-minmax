In recent years several pairs of extrasolar planets have been discovered in
the vicinity of mean-motion commensurabilities. In some cases, such as the
Gliese 876 system, the planets seem to be trapped in a stationary solution, the
system exhibiting a simultaneous libration of the resonant angle theta_1 = 2
lambda_2 - lambda_1 - varpi_1 and of the relative position of the pericenters.
  In this paper we analyze the existence and location of these stable
solutions, for the 2/1 and 3/1 resonances, as function of the masses and
orbital elements of both planets. This is undertaken via an analytical model
for the resonant Hamiltonian function. The results are compared with those of
numerical simulations of the exact equations.
  In the 2/1 commensurability, we show the existence of three principal
families of stationary solutions: (i) aligned orbits, in which theta_1 and
varpi_1 - varpi_2 both librate around zero, (ii) anti-aligned orbits, in which
theta_1=0 and the difference in pericenter is 180 degrees, and (iii) asymmetric
stationary solutions, where both the resonant angle and varpi_1 - varpi_2 are
constants with values different of 0 or 180 degrees. Each family exists in a
different domain of values of the mass ratio and eccentricities of both
planets. Similar results are also found in the 3/1 resonance.
  We discuss the application of these results to the extrasolar planetary
systems and develop a chart of possible planetary orbits with apsidal
corotation. We estimate, also, the maximum planetary masses in order that the
stationary solutions are dynamically stable.
