An operator theoretic approach to orthogonal rational functions on the unit
circle with poles in its exterior is presented in this paper. This approach is
based on the identification of a suitable matrix representation of the
multiplication operator associated with the corresponding orthogonality
measure. Two different alternatives are discussed, depending whether we use for
the matrix representation the standard basis of orthogonal rational functions,
or a new one with poles alternatively located in the exterior and the interior
of the unit circle. The corresponding representations are linear fractional
transformations with matrix coefficients acting respectively on Hessenberg and
five-diagonal unitary matrices.
  In consequence, the orthogonality measure can be recovered from the spectral
measure of an infinite unitary matrix depending uniquely on the poles and the
parameters of the recurrence relation for the orthogonal rational functions.
Besides, the zeros of the orthogonal and para-orthogonal rational functions are
identified as the eigenvalues of matrix linear fractional transformations of
finite Hessenberg and five-diagonal matrices.
  As an application of this operator approach, we obtain new relations between
the support of the orthogonality measure and the location of the poles and
parameters of the recurrence relation, generalizing to the rational case known
results for orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle.
  Finally, we extend these results to orthogonal polynomials on the real line
with poles in the lower half plane.
