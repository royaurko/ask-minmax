The South Pole Telescope (SPT) is a 10 m diameter, wide-field, offset
Gregorian telescope with a 966-pixel, multi-color, millimeter-wave, bolometer
camera. It is located at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole station in Antarctica.
The design of the SPT emphasizes careful control of spillover and scattering,
to minimize noise and false signals due to ground pickup. The key initial
project is a large-area survey at wavelengths of 3, 2 and 1.3 mm, to detect
clusters of galaxies via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and to measure the
small-scale angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
The data will be used to characterize the primordial matter power spectrum and
to place constraints on the equation of state of dark energy. A
second-generation camera will measure the polarization of the CMB, potentially
leading to constraints on the neutrino mass and the energy scale of inflation.
