Sampling information using timing is a new approach in sampling theory. The
question is how to map amplitude information into the timing domain. One such
encoder, called time encoding machine, was introduced by Lazar and Toth in [23]
for the special case of band-limited functions. In this paper, we extend their
result to the general framework of shift-invariant subspaces. We prove that
time encoding machines may be considered as non-uniform sampling devices, where
time locations are unknown a priori. Using this fact, we show that perfect
representation and reconstruction of a signal with a time encoding machine is
possible whenever this device satisfies some density property. We prove that
this method is robust under timing quantization, and therefore can lead to the
design of simple and energy efficient sampling devices.
