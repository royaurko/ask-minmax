LeoTask is a Java library for computation-intensive and time-consuming
research tasks. It automatically executes tasks in parallel on multiple CPU
cores on a computing facility. It uses a configuration file to enable automatic
exploration of parameter space and flexible aggregation of results, and
therefore allows researchers to focus on programming the key logic of a
computing task. It also supports reliable recovery from interruptions, dynamic
and cloneable networks, and integration with the plotting software Gnuplot.
