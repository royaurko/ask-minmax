We have transported gaseous Bose-Einstein condensates over distances up to 44
cm. This was accomplished by trapping the condensate in the focus of an
infrared laser and translating the location of the laser focus with controlled
acceleration. Condensates of order 1 million atoms were moved into an auxiliary
chamber and loaded into a magnetic trap formed by a Z-shaped wire. This
transport technique avoids the optical and mechanical access constraints of
conventional condensate experiments and creates many new scientific
opportunities.
