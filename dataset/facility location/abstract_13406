This article describes a high-power and narrow-linewidth laser source at 399
nm useful for cooling and trapping of ytterbium atoms. A continuous-wave
titanium-sapphire laser at 798 nm is frequency doubled using a lithium
triborate crystal in an enhancement cavity. Up to 1.0 W of light at 399 nm has
been obtained from 1.3 W of infrared light, with an efficiency of 80 %
