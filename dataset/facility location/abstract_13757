A network covert channel is created that uses resource names such as
addresses to convey information, and that approximates typical user behavior in
order to blend in with its environment. The channel correlates available
resource names with a user defined code-space, and transmits its covert message
by selectively accessing resources associated with the message codes. In this
paper we focus on an implementation of the channel using the Hypertext Transfer
Protocol (HTTP) with Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) as the message names,
though the system can be used in conjunction with a variety of protocols. The
covert channel does not modify expected protocol structure as might be detected
by simple inspection, and our HTTP implementation emulates transaction level
web user behavior in order to avoid detection by statistical or behavioral
analysis.
