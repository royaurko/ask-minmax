We studied the stellar population and star clusters around six regions in the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in order to understand the correlation between
star formation and cluster formation episodes. We used the stellar data base of
OGLE II LMC survey and the star cluster catalogues. The analysis of the
colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) were used to estimate the ages of the stellar
population. It is found that most of the regions have undergone three major
star formation episodes. The star formation which began about 4 Gyr ago,
continued upto 1 Gyr, or continued further. The other two events have taken
place around 300 Myr, and 100 Myr. A few star clusters were formed during the
first of the three star formation events in 5 regions. On all the six regions,
a good correlation is seen between the star and cluster formation events which
occurred at 300 Myr and 100 Myr. The cluster formation events and the fraction
of star clusters formed were found to be very similar for two regions located
to the south-east of the Bar, suggesting similar cluster formation triggers at
almost similar instances. The two recent star formation events seem to
correlate with the interaction of LMC with Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and
Galaxy. Hence it is quite likely that the young populous star clusters in the
LMC are formed as a result of the star formation events started due to
galaxy-galaxy interactions and the further propagation of such star formation.
