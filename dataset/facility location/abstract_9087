We present BeppoSAX observations of the two radio galaxies PKS 1934-63 and S5
1946+708. Strong Iron Kalpha lines are detected in both objects indicating that
the two sources are absorbed by column densities higher than 10^24 cm^(-2).
  Combining radio continuum, HI absorption and X-ray data we can constrain the
physical state and the dimensions of the absorber. We find that the putative
obscuring torus is molecular and located at a distance higher than 20 pc from
the center in S5 1946+70. In PKS 1934-63 no radio nucleus has been observed. If
this is due to free-free absorption a radius of only a few pc is inferred.
Since the Kalpha lines have been detected only at 90% confidence, we also
discuss the implications if they would be not as strong as found from our data.
  From our results it appears that the combination of hard X-ray data and
spatially resolved HI absorption measurements provides a powerful diagnostic
for conditions in the absorbing ``torus''.
