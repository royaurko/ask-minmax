Indications of the existence of quasi-bound states in the N-Nbar system are
presented. Measurements by BES discovered a broad enhancement close to the
p-pbar threshold in the S wave, isospin 0 state formed in radiative decays of
J/psi. Another enhancement located about 50 MeV below the threshold was found
in mesonic decays of J/psi. In terms of the Paris potential model it was shown
that these are likely to represent the same state. Antiprotonic atomic data
provide some support for this interpretation and indicate the existence of
another fairly narrow quasi-bound state in a P wave.
