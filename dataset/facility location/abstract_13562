We present an extension of Voronoi diagrams where not only the distance to
the site is taken into account when considering which site the client is going
to use, but additional attributes (i.e., prices) are also considered. A cell in
this diagram is then the locus of all points (i.e. clients) that consider the
same set of sites to be relevant. In particular, the precise site a client
might use from this candidate set depends on parameters that might change
between usages, and the candidate set lists all of the relevant sites. The
resulting diagram is significantly more expressive than Voronoi diagrams, but
naturally has the drawback that its complexity, even in the plane, might be
quite high.
  Nevertheless, we show that if the attributes of the sites are drawn from the
same distribution (note that the locations are fixed), then the expected
complexity of the candidate diagram is near linear. To derive this result, we
derive several new technical results, which are of independent interest.
