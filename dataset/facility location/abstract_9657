We investigate numerically the influence of Dirichlet boundary conditions on
the nearest neighbor level spacing distribution $P(s)$ of a two-dimensional
disordered tight-binding model in the presence of a strong perpendicular
magnetic field. From the calculation of the second moment of $P(s)$ it is shown
that for Dirichlet boundary conditions, due to the presence of edge states, the
position of the critical energy shifts with increasing system size to the
location of the critical energy for periodic boundary conditions. An
extrapolation to infinite system size results in different critical (scale
independent) $P(s)$ distributions for periodic and Dirichlet boundary
conditions.
