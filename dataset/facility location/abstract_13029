The electron-phonon interaction and related transport properties are
investigated in monolayer silicene and MoS2 by using a density functional
theory calculation combined with a full-band Monte Carlo analysis. In the case
of silicene, the results illustrate that the out-of-plane acoustic phonon mode
may play the dominant role unlike its close relative - graphene. The small
energy of this phonon mode, originating from the weak sp2 bonding between Si
atoms, contributes to the high scattering rate and significant degradation in
electron transport. In MoS2, the longitudinal acoustic phonons show the
strongest interaction with electrons. The key factor in this material appears
to be the Q valleys located between the {\Gamma} and K points in the first
Brillouin zone as they introduce additional intervalley scattering. The
analysis also reveals the potential impact of extrinsic screening by other
carriers and/or adjacent materials. Subsequent decrease in the actual
scattering rate can be drastic, warranting careful consideration. Finally, the
effective deformation potential constants are extracted for all relevant
intrinsic electron-phonon scattering processes in both materials.
