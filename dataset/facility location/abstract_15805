Solitary waves bifurcated from edges of Bloch bands in two-dimensional
periodic media are determined both analytically and numerically in the context
of a two-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a periodic
potential. Using multi-scale perturbation methods, envelope equations of
solitary waves near Bloch bands are analytically derived. These envelope
equations reveal that solitary waves can bifurcate from edges of Bloch bands
under either focusing or defocusing nonlinearity, depending on the signs of
second-order dispersion coefficients at the edge points. Interestingly, at edge
points with two linearly independent Bloch modes, the envelope equations lead
to a host of solitary wave structures including reduced-symmetry solitons,
dipole-array solitons, vortex-cell solitons, and so on -- many of which have
never been reported before. It is also shown analytically that the centers of
envelope solutions can only be positioned at four possible locations at or
between potential peaks. Numerically, families of these solitary waves are
directly computed both near and far away from band edges. Near the band edges,
the numerical solutions spread over many lattice sites, and they fully agree
with the analytical solutions obtained from envelope equations. Far away from
the band edges, solitary waves are strongly localized with intensity and phase
profiles characteristic of individual families.
