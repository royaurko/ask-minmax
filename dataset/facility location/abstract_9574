Several QSO pairs have been reported and their redshifts determined, where
the two objects in each pair are located {\it across} an active galaxy. The
usually accepted explanation of such occurrences is that the pair is ejected
from the active galaxy. Currebtly interpreted redshifted spectra for both the
QSOs imply that both the objects are receding from the observer. However,
ejection can occur towards and away from the observer with equal probability.
We argue that for a system with two QSOs {\it across} the parent galaxy,
ejection should have occurred in opposite directions, whereby one object will
be approaching us and the other will be receding from us. The former would be
exhibiting a blueshifted spectrum. We analyse here a sample of four such pairs
and show that the observed spectrum of one QSO in each pair can be interpreted
as blueshifted. The other exhibits the ususal redshifted spectrum.A scenario
based on the 'sling-shot' mechanism of ejection is presented to explain the
ocurrences of the pairs in opposite sides of the active galaxies moving in
opposite durections.
