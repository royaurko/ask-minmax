We investigate a pair creation cascade in the magnetosphere of a rapidly
rotating neutron star. We solve the set of the Poisson equation for the
electro-static potential and the Boltzmann equations for electrons, positrons,
and gamma-ray photons simultaneously. In this paper, we first examine the
time-dependent nature of particle accelerators by solving the non-stationary
Boltzmann equations on the two-dimensional poloidal plane in which both the
rotational and magnetic axes reside. Evaluating the temperature of the heated
polar cap surface, which is located near the magnetic pole, by the bombardment
of gap-accelerated particles, and applying the scheme to millisecond pulsar
parameters, we demonstrate that the solution converges to a stationary solution
of which pair-creation cascade is maintained by the heated polar-cap emission,
in a wide range of three-dimensional parameter space (period, period
derivative, magnetic inclination angle). We also present the deathlines of
millisecond pulsars.
