We present the implementation of turbulence transport equations in addition
to the Reynolds-averaged MHD equations within the Cronos framework. The model
is validated by comparisons with earlier findings before it is extended to be
applicable to regions in the solar wind that are not highly super-Alfv\'enic.
We find that the respective additional terms result in absolute normalized
cross-helicity to decline more slowly, while a proper implementation of the
mixing terms can even lead to increased cross-helicities in the inner
heliosphere. The model extension allows to place the inner boundary of the
simulations closer to the Sun, where we choose its location at 0.1 AU for
future application to the Wang-Sheeley-Arge model. Here, we concentrate on
effects on the turbulence evolution for transient events by injecting a coronal
mass ejection (CME). We find that the steep gradients and shocks associated
with these structures result in enhanced turbulence levels and reduced
cross-helicity. Our results can now be used straightforwardly for studying the
transport of charged energetic particles, where the elements of the diffusion
tensor can now benefit from the self-consistently computed solar wind
turbulence. Furthermore, we find that there is no strong back-reaction of the
turbulence on the large-scale flow so that CME studies concentrating on the
latter need not be extended to include turbulence transport effects.
