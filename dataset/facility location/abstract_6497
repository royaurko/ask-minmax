SciBooNE, located in the Booster Neutrino Beam at Fermilab, collected data
from June 2007 to August 2008 to accurately measure muon neutrino and
anti-neutrino cross sections on carbon below 1 GeV neutrino energy. SciBooNE is
studying charged current interactions. Among them, neutral pion production
interactions will be the focus of this poster. The experimental signature of
neutrino-induced neutral pion production is constituted by two electromagnetic
cascades initiated by the conversion of the neutral pion decay photons, with an
additional muon in the final state for CC processes.
  In this poster, I will present how we reconstruct and select charged-current
muon neutrino interactions producing neutral pions in SciBooNE.
