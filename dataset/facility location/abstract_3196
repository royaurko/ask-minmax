We have obtained 63 rotation measures (RMs) from polarization observations of
southern pulsars, of which 54 are new measurements and 3 are varied from
previous values. The new pulsar RM data at high Galactic latitudes are mostly
consistent with the antisymmetric RM distribution found previously. For the
Galactic disc, evidence for a field reversal near the Perseus arm, and possibly
another beyond it, is presented. Inside the Solar Circle, in addition to the
two known field reversals in or near the Carina-Sagittartus arm and the
Crux-Scutum arm, a further reversal in the Norma arm is tentatively identified.
These reversals, together with the pitch angle derived from pulsar RM and
stellar polarization distributions, are consistent with bisymmetric spiral
(BSS) models for the large-scale magnetic field structure in the disc of our
Galaxy. However, discrimination between models is complicated by the presence
of smaller-scale irregularities in the magnetic field, as well as uncertainties
in the theoretical modelling.
