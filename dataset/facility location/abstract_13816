We report 1.3 cm and 6 cm continuum observations toward the massive
proto-stellar candidate G11.11-0.12P1 using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array
(VLA). We detect a string of four unresolved radio continuum sources coincident
with the mid-IR source in G11P1. The continuum sources have positive spectral
indices consistent with a thermal (free-free) ionized jet. The most likely
origin of the ionized gas are shocks due to the interaction of a stellar wind
with the surrounding high-density material. We also present NIR United Kingdom
Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) archival data which show an extended structure
detected only at K-band (2.2 $\mu$m), which is oriented perpendicular to the
jet, and that may be scattered light from a circumstellar disk around the
massive protostar. Our observations plus the UKIRT archival data thus provide
new evidence that a disk/jet system is present in the massive protostellar
candidate located in the G11.11-0.12P1 core.
