Behavior of supercritical fluids attracts a lot of attention nowadays. It is
important both from the point of view of fundamental science and technological
applications. However, up to now the progress in the field is rather moderate.
In this article we report a computational study of supercritical carbon dioxide
which is one of the most important fluids for chemical industry. We study the
response functions of $CO_2$ in supercritical regime and calculate the
locations of their maxima (Widom lines). We also make preliminary calculations
of the line of crossover of microscopic dynamics of particles (Frenkel line).
The conclusions on the Frenkel line location can be applied to study of the
atmosphere of Venus.
