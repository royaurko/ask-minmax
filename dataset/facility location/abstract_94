We report observations from the (p,n) reaction on 12C at 135 MeV. The
experiment was performed with the beam-swinger neutron time-of-flight system at
the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility. Neutrons were detected in
large-volume plastic scintillation detectors located in three detector stations
at 0 deg, 24 deg, and 45 deg with respect to the undeflected beam line; the
flight paths were 91 m, 91 m, and 74 m, respectively. Overall time resolutions
of about 825 ps provided energy resolutions of about 350 keV in the first two
stations and about 425 keV in the third station. The angular distributions for
states with excitation energies up to 10 MeV are presented and comparisons are
made with DWIA calculations that use one-body density matrices from 0hw and 1hw
shell-model calculations. New information is deduced on the excitation
energies, widths and spin-parity assignments for several energy levels of 12N.
