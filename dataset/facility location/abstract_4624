Exact structure function equations are an efficient means of obtaining
asymptotic laws such as inertial range laws, as well as all measurable effects
of inhomogeneity and anisotropy that cause deviations from such laws. "Exact"
means that the equations are obtained from the Navier-Stokes equation or other
hydrodynamic equations without any approximation. A pragmatic definition of
local homogeneity lies within the exact equations because terms that explicitly
depend on the rate of change of measurement location appear within the exact
equations; an analogous statement is true for local stationarity. An exact
definition of averaging operations is required for the exact equations. Careful
derivations of several inertial range laws have appeared in the literature
recently in the form of theorems. These theorems give the relationships of the
energy dissipation rate to the structure function of acceleration increment
multiplied by velocity increment and to both the trace of and the components of
the third-order velocity structure functions. These laws are efficiently
derived from the exact velocity structure function equations. In some respects,
the results obtained herein differ from the previous theorems. The
acceleration-velocity structure function is useful for obtaining the energy
dissipation rate in particle tracking experiments provided that the effects of
inhomogeneity are estimated by means of displacing the measurement location.
