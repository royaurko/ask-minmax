Large computer codes are widely used in engineering to study physical
systems. Nevertheless, simulations can sometimes be time-consuming. In this
case, an approximation of the code input/output relation is made using a
metamodel. Actually, a computer code can often be run at different levels of
complexity and a hierarchy of levels of code can hence be obtained. For
example, it can be a finite element model with a more or less fine mesh. The
aim of our research is to study the use of several levels of a code to predict
the output of a costly computer code. The presented multi-stage metamodel is a
particular case of co-kriging which is a well-known geostatistical method. We
first describe the construction of the co-kriging model and we focus then on a
sequential experimental design strategy. Indeed, one of the strengths of
co-kriging is that it provides through the predictive co-kriging variance an
estimation of the model error at each point of the input space parameter.
Therefore, to improve the surrogate model we can sequentially add points in the
training set at locations where the predictive variances are the largest ones.
Nonetheless, in a multi-fidelity framework, we also have to choose which level
of code we have to run. We present here different strategies to choose this
level. They are based on an original result which gives the contribution of
each code on the co-kriging variance.
