The recent large EQ that occurred in Greece (April 1st, 2011, Ms = 6.7R) is
investigated as far as it concerns regional geophysical features of the Greek
territory. In particular, the EQ location is compared to the deep lithospheric
fracture zones and faults, derived from the analysis of the corresponding
earth's gravity field; to the current seismic potential map determined from the
study of the past seismicity, while its time of occurrence is compared to the
peaks of the M1 and diurnal tidal waves. The detailed investigation of the
earth's electric field that was recorded by the ATH monitoring site, located in
Athens, revealed the presence of short train like pulses type electric seismic
precursory signals which were generated short (1 - 2 days) before the EQ
occurrence time. Moreover, the analysis (for T = 1 day) of the earth's
oscillating electric field, that was simultaneously recorded at PYR and ATH
monitoring sites, revealed that the "strange attractor like" seismic electric
precursor preceded for 1 - 2 days the EQ occurrence time. A similar behavior
was observed from the large EQ of the East Kythira (Ms = 6.9R, January, 8th,
2006). It is concluded that the same regional tectonic mechanism controlled and
generated both the analyzed EQs while the adopted geophysical earth models have
been validated.
