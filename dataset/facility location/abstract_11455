We investigate in this note the dynamics of a one-dimensional Keller-Segel
type model on the half-line. On the contrary to the classical configuration,
the chemical production term is located on the boundary. We prove, under
suitable assumptions, the following dichotomy which is reminiscent of the
two-dimensional Keller-Segel system. Solutions are global if the mass is below
the critical mass, they blow-up in finite time above the critical mass, and
they converge to some equilibrium at the critical mass. Entropy techniques are
presented which aim at providing quantitative convergence results for the
subcritical case. This note is completed with a brief introduction to a more
realistic model (still one-dimensional).
