IRIS data allow us to study the solar transition region (TR) with an
unprecedented spatial resolution of 0.33 arcsec. On 2013 August 30, we observed
bursts of high Doppler shifts suggesting strong supersonic downflows of up to
200 km/s and weaker, slightly slower upflows in the spectral lines Mg II h and
k, C II 1336 \AA, Si IV 1394 \AA, and 1403 \AA, that are correlated with
brightenings in the slitjaw images (SJIs). The bursty behavior lasts throughout
the 2 hr observation, with average burst durations of about 20 s. The locations
of these short-lived events appear to be the umbral and penumbral footpoints of
EUV loops. Fast apparent downflows are observed along these loops in the SJIs
and in AIA, suggesting that the loops are thermally unstable. We interpret the
observations as cool material falling from coronal heights, and especially
coronal rain produced along the thermally unstable loops, which leads to an
increase of intensity at the loop footpoints, probably indicating an increase
of density and temperature in the TR. The rain speeds are on the higher end of
previously reported speeds for this phenomenon, and possibly higher than the
free-fall velocity along the loops. On other observing days, similar bright
dots are sometimes aligned into ribbons, resembling small flare ribbons. These
observations provide a first insight into small-scale heating events in
sunspots in the TR.
