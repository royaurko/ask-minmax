A representation of the genetic code as a six-dimensional Boolean hypercube
is described. This structure is the result of the hierarchical order of the
interaction energies of the bases in codon-anticodon recognition. In this paper
it is applied to study molecular evolution in vivo and in vitro. In the first
case we compared aligned positions in homologous protein sequences and found
two different behaviors: a) There are sites in which the different amino acids
may be explained by one or two "attractor nodes" (coding for the dominating
amino acid(s)) and their one-bit neighbors in the codon hypercube, and b) There
are sites in which the amino acids correspond to codons located in closed paths
in the hypercube. In the second case we studied the "Sexual PCR" experiment
described by Stemmer and found that the success of this combination of usual
PCR and recombination is in part due to the Gray code structure of the genetic
code.
