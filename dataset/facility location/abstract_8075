The extended X-ray emission from 'the Cap' region located 11' (11.6 kpc)
above the disk of the starburst galaxy M82 has been observed with Suzaku and
XMM-Newton. Owing to the good energy resolution and the large collecting area
of the XIS on Suzaku, combined with similar properties of the EPIC instrument
on XMM-Newton, we have clearly detected K-shell emission lines from O VII, O
VIII, Ne X, Mg XI, Mg XII and the Fe-L complex. Two optically-thin thermal
plasma components are required to fit the observed X-ray spectra. We have
determined the metal abundances of O, Ne, Mg, Si and Fe in this region for the
first time. Their metal abundance ratios agree well with those of metal-poor
stars and the model prediction of metals synthesized by type-II supernovae, but
they are not consistent with the metallicities of type-Ia supernovae. This
result is support for the idea that the origin of the metals in the Cap is
type-II supernovae explosions occurring in the starburst regions in the M82
galaxy. We discuss the possible contribution from sputtered dust grains to the
metals in the Cap. An emission line consistent with the C VI transition of n=4
to 1 at 0.459 keV is marginally detected, although it is not statistically
significant at the 99% confidence level; the presence of this line would
suggest charge-exchange processes in the Cap.
