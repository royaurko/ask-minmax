The electric field of the Earth registered by three monitoring sites (ATH,
PYR, HIO) located in Greece, is investigated and analyzed after the occurrence
of the Methoni EQ (14th of February, 2008, Ms =6.7R). The period of analysis is
performed for 2 days (21st-22nd of February) and 7 days after the occurrence of
the main seismic event. The obtained results suggest that the seismogenic area
generates electrical signals denoting a specific epicentral area. This area
coincides with the already seismically activated area. An estimate for the time
of occurrence of this EQ is made by the application of the Oscillating
Lithospheric Plate Model. The analysis of the seismic potential of the regional
area suggests that the remaining stored seismic energy is capable of producing
a large earthquake in the same area. The expected maximum magnitude (Ms) of a
future earthquake which could take place in the same seismogenic area is
estimated as Ms = 7.24R by the application of the Lithospheric Seismic Energy
flow model.
