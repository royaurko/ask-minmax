The existence of eta-mesic nuclei in which the eta meson is bound in a
nucleus by means of the strong interaction was postulated already in 1986,
albeit not yet confirmed it by experiment. The discovery of this new kind of an
exotic nuclear matter would be very important as it might allow for a better
understanding of the eta meson structure and its interaction with nucleons. The
search for eta-mesic helium 4He-eta is carried out with high statistics and
high acceptance with the WASA detector, installed at the cooler synchrotron
COSY of the Research Center Juelich. The search is conducted via the
measurement of the excitation function for selected decay channels of the
4He-eta system. In the experiment, performed in November 2010, two reactions
dd->(4He-eta)bs ->3He p pi- and dd->(4He-eta)bs ->3He p pi0 were measured with
a beam momentum ramped from 2.127GeV/c to 2.422GeV/c. The report includes the
description of the experimental method and status of the measurement.
