The large number of detected giant exoplanets offers the opportunity to
improve our understanding of the formation mechanism, evolution, and interior
structure of gas giant planets. The two main models for giant planet formation
are core accretion and disk instability. There are substantial differences
between these formation models, including formation timescale, favorable
formation location, ideal disk properties for planetary formation, early
evolution, planetary composition, etc. First, we summarize the two models
including their substantial differences, advantages, and disadvantages, and
suggest how theoretical models should be connected to available (and future)
data. We next summarize current knowledge of the internal structures of solar-
and extrasolar- giant planets. Finally, we suggest the next steps to be taken
in giant planet exploration.
