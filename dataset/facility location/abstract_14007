The sign structure of correlations of conserved charges are investigated in a
QCD like model: the (2+1) flavor Polyakov Quark Meson model. We compute all
susceptibilities of the conserved charges on the $(\mu_{B}-T)$ plane up to
fourth order and a few at higher order as well. By varying the mass of the
sigma meson, we are able to study and compare scenarios with as well as without
a critical point. In the hadron-quark transition regime we identify certain
correlations that turn negative unlike expectation from ideal hadron resonance
gas calculations. The striking feature being that these remain negative deep
into the hadronic side and thus could be measured in experiments. Measurement
of such quantities in heavy ion collision experiments can elucidate the
location of the QCD transition curve and possibly the critical point.
