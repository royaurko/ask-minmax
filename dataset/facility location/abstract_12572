Spectral properties of the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain in a
magnetic field are investigated by using exact Bethe-ansatz solutions. We argue
that not only quasiparticles called psinon and antipsinon but also a
quasiparticle representing a 2-string in the Bethe ansatz plays an important
role for dynamical properties in a magnetic field. Combined with psinon and
antipsinon, the quasiparticle for a 2-string forms a continuum in the
high-energy regime for transverse dynamical structure factor
$S^{+-}(k,\omega)$. In the zero-field limit, the continuum is located on the
mode of the lowest excited states in zero field called the des
Cloizeaux-Pearson mode. In a magnetic field, the continuum separates from other
low-energy continua, and reduces to the mode of bound states of overturned
spins from the fully polarized state near the saturation field. We confirm the
relevance through comparisons with available experimental results on the
quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet CuCl$_2\cdot$2N(C$_5$D$_5$).
