We look for wide, faint companions around members of the 5 Myr Lambda Orionis
open cluster. We used optical, near-infrared, and Spitzer/IRAC photometry. We
report the discovery of a very wide very low mass visual binary, LOri167,
formed by a brown dwarf and a planetary-mass candidate located at 5 arcsec,
which seems to belong to the cluster. We derive Teff of 2125 and 1750 K. If
they are members, comparisons with theoretical models indicate masses of 17
(20-15) Mjup and 8 (13-7) Mjup, with a projected separation of 2000 AU. Such a
binary system would be difficult to explain in most models, particularly those
where substellar objects form in the disks surrounding higher mass stars.
