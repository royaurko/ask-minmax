We present the discovery of four X-ray quasars (z_em = 0.26, 0.53, 0.61,
1.63) located behind the Large Magellanic Cloud; three of them are located
behind the bar of the LMC. The quasars were identified via spectroscopy of
optical counterparts to X-ray sources found serendipitously by the Chandra
X-ray Observatory satellite. All four quasars have archival VI photometry from
the OGLE-II project; one of them was found by OGLE to be variable. We present
the properties of the quasars and discuss their possible applications.
