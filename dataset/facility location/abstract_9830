Gene regulation in Eukaryotes is mainly effected through transcription
factors binding to rather short recognition motifs generally located upstream
of the coding region. We present a novel computational method to identify
regulatory elements in the upstream region of Eukaryotic genes. The genes are
grouped in sets sharing an overrepresented short motif in their upstream
sequence. For each set, the average expression level from a microarray
experiment is determined: if this level is significantly higher or lower than
the average taken over the whole genome, then the overrepresented motif shared
by the genes in the set is likely to play a role in their regulation. We
illustrate the method by applying it to the genome of {\it S. cerevisiae}, for
which many datasets of microarray experiments are publicly available. Several
known binding motifs are correctly recognized by our algorithm, and a new
candidate is suggested for experimental verification.
