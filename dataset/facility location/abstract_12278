Since their discovery, Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) have attracted
attention due to their combination of extreme luminosities and extra-nuclear
locations. However, they are a fairly rare phenomenon, and attempts to
investigate the general properties of the population have been hindered by a
relative lack of known sources. Here, we present a large catalogue of ULX
candidates including 655 detections of 475 discrete sources, based on the 2XMM
Serendipitous Survey. To demonstrate the potential of such a resource, we
present some scientific analysis of this population, focusing on the spectral
turnover seen, often at ~6 keV, in the highest quality ULX data. We also
demonstrate how the recent reflection and Comptonisation interpretations of
this feature may be distinguished observationally in the future, specifically
using NGC 4517 ULX1, a previously unanalysed source with high quality data, as
an example case.
