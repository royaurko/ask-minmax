Quantum teleportation is investigated between Alice who is far from the
horizon and Bob locates near the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole.
The results show that the fidelity of the teleportation is reduced in this
curved space-time. However, high fidelity can still be reached outside a
massive black hole.
