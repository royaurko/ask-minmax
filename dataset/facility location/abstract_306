At the Kernfysisch Vensneller Institiutr (KVI) in Groningen, NL, a new
facility (TRImP) is under development. It aims for producing, slowing down, and
trapping of radioactive isotopes in order to perform accurate measurements on
fundamental symmetries and interactions. A production target station and a dual
magnetic separator installed and commissioned. We will slow down the isotopes
of interest using an ion catcher and in a further stage a radiofrequency
quadropole gas cooler (RFQ). The isotopes will finally be trapped in an atomic
trap for precision studies.
