In controlled X-ray irradiation experiments, the formation of trap states in
the prototypical van der Waals bonded semiconductor Rubrene is studied
quantitatively for doses up to 82 Gy (Gy = J/kg). About 100 electronic trap
states, located around 0.3 eV above the valence band, are created by each
absorbed 8 keV photon which is 2-3 orders of magnitude more than 1 MeV protons
produce. Thermal annealing is shown to reduce these traps. Local structural
disorder, which has also been induced by other means in different studies, is
thus identified as a common origin of trap states in van der Waals bonded
molecular organic semiconductors.
