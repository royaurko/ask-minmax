Nanocrystalline metals with average grain sizes of only a few nanometers have
recently been observed to fail through the formation of shear bands. Here, we
investigate this phenomenon in nanocrystalline Ni which has had its grain
structure stabilized by doping with W, with a specific focus on understanding
how strain localization drives evolution of the nanoscale grain structure.
Shear banding was initiated with both microcompression and nanoindentation
experiments, followed by site-specific transmission electron microscopy to
characterize the microstructure. Grain growth and texture formation were
observed inside the shear bands, which had a wide variety of thicknesses. These
evolved regions have well-defined edges, which rules out local temperature rise
as a possible formation mechanism. No structural evolution was found in areas
away from the shear bands, even in locations where significant plastic
deformation had occurred, showing that plastic strain alone is not enough to
cause evolution. Rather, intense strain localization is needed to induce
mechanically-driven grain growth in a thermally-stable nanocrystalline alloy.
