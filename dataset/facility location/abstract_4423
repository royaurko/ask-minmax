We have observed the 13CO J=2-1, 12CO J=2-1 and 12CO J=3-2 lines at a few
locations in the dwarf irregular galaxies IC 10 and NGC 6822 using the James
Clerk Maxwell Telescope. In addition, we report the first detection of the 13CO
J=3-2 transition in a Local Group galaxy. These low metallicity environments
appear to be porous to UV radiation and allow for more efficient heating of
molecular gas by nearby HII regions. The high 12CO J=3-2/J=2-1 ratio in NGC
6822 suggests that the 12CO emission is optically thin in this region. This
high line ratio is likely the result of its location inside a large HII region
with low metallicity and low gas content. In IC 10 we observe structures on a
variety of size scales that all appear to be gravitationally bound. This effect
may help explain the rather high star formation rate in IC 10.
