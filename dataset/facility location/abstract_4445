Deep I-band imaging to approximately I = 26.5 of the soft gamma-ray repeater
SGR 1900+14 region has revealed a compact cluster of massive stars located only
a few arcseconds from the fading radio source thought to be the location of the
SGR (Frail, Kulkarni, & Bloom 1999). This cluster was previously hidden in the
glare of the pair of M5 supergiant stars (whose light was removed by PSF
subtraction) proposed by Vrba et al. (1996) as likely associated with the SGR
1900+14. The cluster has at least 13 members within a cluster radius of
approximately 0.6 pc, based on an estimated distance of 12-15 kpc. It is
remarkably similar to a cluster found associated with SGR 1806-20 (Fuchs et al.
1999). That similar clusters have now been found at or near the positions of
the two best-studied SGRs suggests that young neutron stars, thought to be
responsible for the SGR phenomenon, have their origins in proximate compact
clusters of massive stars.
