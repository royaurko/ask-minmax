We investigate the properties of two stellar concentrations in a
low-absorption disk zone in Centaurus, located respectively at
$\ell=306.47^{\circ}$, $b=-0.61 ^{\circ}$, and $\ell=307.01^{\circ}$, $b=-0.74
^{\circ}$. The present analysis is based mostly on 2MASS photometry, as well as
optical photometry. Based on colour-magnitude diagrams and stellar radial
density profiles, we show that these concentrations are not open star clusters.
Instead, they appear to be field stars seen through a differentially-reddened
window. We estimate that the bulk of the stars in both stellar concentrations
is located at $\sim1.5$ kpc from the Sun, a distance consistent with that of
the Sgr-Car arm in that direction. This low-absorption window allows one to
probe into distant parts of the disk besides the Sgr-Car arm, probably the
tangent part of the Sct-Cru arm, and/or the far side of the Sgr-Car arm in that
direction. The main sequence associated to the Sgr-Car arm is reddened by
$\ebv\sim0.5$, so that this window through the disk is comparable in reddening
to Baade's window to the bulge. We also investigate the nature of the open
cluster candidate Ru 166. The presently available data do not allow us to
conclude whether Ru 166 is an actual open cluster or field stars seen through a
small-scale low-absorption window.
