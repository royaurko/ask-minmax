This submission includes the overview, science timeline, reference design,
WBS, and mine status sections of the Homestake collaboration's Reference Design
Project Book. The Project Book describes the specific plan for converting the
Homestake Gold Mine into a facility for physics, earth science, and
engineering. The proposed developments on the 7400- and 4850-ft levels are
presented, along with the plans for adapting Homestake's existing
infrastructure for science. The plan differs substantially from the conceptual
design for the National Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory proposed
in June, 2001.
