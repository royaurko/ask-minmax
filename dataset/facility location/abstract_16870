With available Virtual Observatory tools, we looked for new bright blue high
proper motion objects in the entire sky: white dwarfs, hot subdwarfs, runaway
OB stars, and early-type stars in nearby young moving groups. We performed an
all-sky cross-match between the optical Tycho-2 and near-infrared 2MASS
catalogues with Aladin, and selected objects with proper motions >50mas/yr and
colours Vt-Ks<-0.5mag with TOPCAT. We also collected multi-wavelength
photometry, constructed the spectral energy distributions and estimated
effective temperatures from fits to atmospheric models with VOSA for the most
interesting targets. We assembled a sample of 32 bright blue high proper motion
objects, including ten sdO/B subdwarfs, nine DA white dwarfs, five young
early-type stars (two of which are runaway stars), two blue horizontal branch
stars, one star with poor information, and five objects reported for the first
time in this work. These last five objects have magnitudes Bt~11.0-11.6mag,
effective temperatures ~24,000-30,000K, and are located in the region of known
white dwarfs and hot subdwarfs in a reduced proper motion-colour diagram. We
confirmed the hot subdwarf nature of one of the new objects, Albus 5, with
public far-ultraviolet spectroscopic data obtained with FUSE.
