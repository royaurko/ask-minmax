The high-resolution pictures of the solar photosphere from space based 50 cm
Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on-board Hinode spacecraft, are now routinely
observed. Such images of a delta-sunspot in NOAA 10930 were obtained by Hinode
during 13 December 2006 while a X-class flare occurred in this active region.
Two bright ribbons were visible even in white light and G-band images apart
from chromospheric Ca II H images. We register the sunspot globally using
cross-correlation technique and analyse local effects during flare interval. We
find that during flare the penumbral filaments show lateral motion. Also, we
locate two patches, one in either polarity, which show converging motion
towards the polarity inversion line (PIL). In Ca II H images we find kernel
with pre-flare brightening which lie along the PIL.
