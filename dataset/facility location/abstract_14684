We present results from a BeppoSAX observation of the rich cluster Abell
2319. The broad band spectrum (2-50 keV) of the cluster can be adequately
represented by an optically thin thermal emission model with a temperature of
9.6+/-0.3 keV and a metal abundance of 0.25+/-0.03 in solar units, and with no
evidence of a hard X-ray excess in the PDS spectrum. From the upper limit to
the hard tail component we derive a lower limit of ~0.04 \muG for the
volume-averaged intracluster magnetic field. By performing spatially resolved
spectroscopy in the medium energy band (2-10 keV), we find that the projected
radial temperature and metal abundance profiles are constant out to a radius of
16 arcmin (1.4 Mpc). A reduction of the temperature of 1/3, when going from the
cluster core out to 16 arcmin, can be excluded in the present data at the 99%
confidence level. From the analysis of the temperature and abundance maps we
find evidence of a temperature enhancement and of an abundance decrement in a
region localized 6 arcmin--8 arcmin NE of the core, where a merger event may be
taking place. Finally, the temperature map indicates that the subcluster
located NW of the main cluster may be somewhat cooler than the rest of the
cluster.
