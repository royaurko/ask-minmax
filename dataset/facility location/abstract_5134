When modeling geostatistical or areal data, spatial structure is commonly
accommodated via a covariance function for the former and a neighborhood
structure for the latter. In both cases the resulting spatial structure is a
consequence of implicit spatial grouping in that observations near in space are
assumed to behave similarly. It would be desirable to develop spatial methods
that explicitly model the partitioning of spatial locations providing more
control over resulting spatial structures and being able to better balance
global vs local spatial dependence. To this end, we extend product partition
models to a spatial setting so that the partitioning of locations into
spatially dependent clusters is explicitly modeled. We explore the spatial
structures that result from employing a spatial product partition model and
demonstrate its flexibility in accommodating many types of spatial
dependencies. We illustrate the method's utility through simulation studies and
an education application.
