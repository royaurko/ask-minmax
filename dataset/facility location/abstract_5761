We discuss the contribution of proton photoproduction interactions on the
isotropic infrared/optical background to the cosmic neutrino fluxes. This
contribution has a strong dependence on the proton injection energy spectrum,
and is essential at high redshifts.
  It is thus closely correlated with the cosmological evolution of the ultra
high energy proton sources and of the inrared background itself. These
interactions may also contribute to the source fluxes of neutrinos if the
proton sources are located in regious of high infrared emission and magnetic
fields.
