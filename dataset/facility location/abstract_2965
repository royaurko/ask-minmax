We investigate the angular distribution of gamma-ray bursts using the largest
catalog of well-localized events that is currently available---combined
BATSE/Ulysses burst locations. We present the preliminary spatial analysis of
415 BATSE/Ulysses bursts included in the BATSE 4B catalog. We find that the
locations are consistent with large- and small-scale isotropy, with no
significant clustering or repetition. We also search for cross-correlation
between the BATSE/Ulysses bursts and known extragalactic objects---such as
Abell galaxy clusters, radio-quiet QSO, AGN and supernovae---and place limits
on the fraction of bursts that could originate from these objects.
