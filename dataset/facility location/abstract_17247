The young O9.5 V spectroscopic binary Theta 2 Ori A shows moderately hard
X-ray emission and relatively narrow X-ray lines, suggesting that it may be a
Magnetically Confined Wind Shock (MCWS) source, similar to its more massive
analogue Theta 1 Ori C. X-ray flares occurring near periastron led to the
suggestion that the flares are produced via magnetic reconnection as
magnetospheres on both components of the Theta 2 Ori A binary interact at
closest approach.
  We use a series of high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of Theta
2 Ori A to place an upper limit on the magnetic field strength of 135 G (95%
credible region). Such a weak dipole field would not produce magnetic
confinement, or a large magnetosphere. A sub-pixel analysis of the Chandra ACIS
images of Theta 2 Ori A obtained during quiescence and flaring show that the
hard, flaring X-rays are offset from the soft, quiescent emission by 0.4
arcsec. If the soft emission is associated with the A1/A2 spectroscopic binary,
the offset and position angle of the hard, flaring source place it at the
location of the intermediate-mass A3 companion, discovered via speckle
interferometry. The spectropolarimetric and X-ray results taken together point
to the A3 companion, not the massive A1/A2 binary, as the source of hard,
flaring X-ray emission.
  We also discuss a similar analysis performed for the magnetic Bp star Sigma
Ori E. We find a similar origin for its X-ray flaring.
