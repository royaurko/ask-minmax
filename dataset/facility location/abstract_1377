In this paper we address the question: where in configuration space is the
entanglement between two particles located? We present a thought-experiment,
equally applicable to discrete or continuous-variable systems, in which one or
both parties makes a preliminary measurement of the state with only enough
resolution to determine whether or not the particle resides in a chosen region,
before attempting to make use of the entanglement. We argue that this provides
an operational answer to the question of how much entanglement was originally
located within the chosen region. We illustrate the approach in a spin system,
and also in a pair of coupled harmonic oscillators. Our approach is
particularly simple to implement for pure states, since in this case the
sub-ensemble in which the system is definitely located in the restricted region
after the measurement is also pure, and hence its entanglement can be simply
characterised by the entropy of the reduced density operators. For our spin
example we present results showing how the entanglement varies as a function of
the parameters of the initial state; for the continuous case, we find also how
it depends on the location and size of the chosen regions. Hence we show that
the distribution of entanglement is very different from the distribution of the
classical correlations.
