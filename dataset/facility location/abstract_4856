A variety of neutrino flavour conversion phenomena occur in core-collapse
supernova, due to the large neutrino density close to the neutrinosphere, and
the importance of the neutrino-neutrino interaction. Three different regimes
have been identified so far, usually called the synchronization, the bipolar
oscillations and the spectral split. Using the formalism of polarization
vectors, within two-flavours, we focus on the spectral split phenomenon and we
show for the first time that the physical mechanism underlying the neutrino
spectral split is a magnetic resonance phenomenon. In particular, we show that
the precession frequencies fulfill the magnetic resonance conditions. Our
numerical calculations show that the neutrino energies and the location at
which the resonance takes place in the supernova coincide well with the
neutrino energies at which a spectral swap occurs. The corresponding
adiabaticity parameters present spikes at the resonance location.
