IHEP, China is constructing a 100 MeV / 100 kW electron Linac for NSC KIPT,
Ukraine. This linac will be used as the driver of a neutron source based on a
subcritical assembly. In 2012, the injector part of the accelerator was
pre-installed as a testing facility in the experimental hall #2 of IHEP. The
injector beam and key hardware testing results were met the design goal.
Recently, the injector testing facility was disassembled and all of the
components for the whole accelerator have been shipped to Ukraine from China by
ocean shipping. The installation of the whole machine in KIPT will be started
in June, 2013. The construction progress, the design and testing results of the
injector beam and key hardware are presented.
