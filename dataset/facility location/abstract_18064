This paper is devoted to determining the nature of the hard X-ray source IGR
J17463-2854 located toward the Galactic bulge. Using data from the INTEGRAL and
Chandra X-ray observatories, we show that five point X-ray sources with
approximately identical fluxes in the 2-10 keV energy band are detected in the
error circle of the object under study. In addition, significant absorption at
low energies has been detected in the spectra of all these sources. Based on
data from the VVV (VISTA/ESO) infrared Galactic Bulge Survey, we have
unambiguously identified three of the five sources, determined the J, H and K
magnitudes of the corresponding stars, and obtained upper limits on the fluxes
for the remaining two sources. Analysis of the color-magnitude diagrams has
shown that one of these objects most likely belongs to a class of rarely
encountered objects, symbiotic binary systems (several tens are known with
certainty), i.e., low-mass binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a red
giant. Note that all our results were obtained using improved absorption values
and an extinction law differing in this direction from the standard one.
