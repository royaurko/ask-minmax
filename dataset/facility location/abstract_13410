The entire graphene field-effect-transistor (FET) devices first fabricated on
SiO2/Si are peeled from the surface and placed on a different wafer. Both
longitudinal and transverse resistivity measurements of the devices before and
after the transfer are measured to calculate the mobility for a direct
comparison. After transferred to different SiO2/Si wafers, the mobility
generally is comparable and the defect density does not show any significant
increase, which indicates the degradation due to the transfer process itself is
minimal. The same method can be applied to transfer graphene devices to any
arbitrary substrates (e.g. SrTiO3 or STO). The transfer method developed here
not only eliminates the need to locate single-layer graphene on non-SiO2/Si
substrates for patterning, but also provides a convenient way to study the
effects of various substrates on graphene electronic properties.
