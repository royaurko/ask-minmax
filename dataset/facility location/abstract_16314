We investigate the precision with which the parameters describing the
characteristics and location of nonspinning black hole binaries can be measured
with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). By using complete waveforms
including the inspiral, merger and ringdown portions of the signals, we find
that LISA will have far greater precision than previous estimates for
nonspinning mergers that ignored the merger and ringdown. Our analysis covers
nonspinning waveforms with moderate mass ratios, q >= 1/10, and total masses
10^5 < M/M_{Sun} < 10^7. We compare the parameter uncertainties using the
Fisher matrix formalism, and establish the significance of mass asymmetry and
higher-order content to the predicted parameter uncertainties resulting from
inclusion of the merger. In real-time observations, the later parts of the
signal lead to significant improvements in sky-position precision in the last
hours and even the final minutes of observation. For comparable mass systems
with total mass M/M_{Sun} = ~10^6, we find that the increased precision
resulting from including the merger is comparable to the increase in
signal-to-noise ratio. For the most precise systems under investigation, half
can be localized to within O(10 arcmin), and 10% can be localized to within O(1
arcmin).
