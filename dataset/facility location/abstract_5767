The Virtual Observatory (VO) will revolutionise the way we do Astronomy, by
allowing easy access to all astronomical data and by making the handling and
analysis of datasets at various locations across the globe much simpler and
faster. I report here on the need for the VO and its status in Europe,
including the first ever VO-based astronomical paper, and then give two
specific applications of VO tools to open problems of A-stars research.
