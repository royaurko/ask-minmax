NEMO 3 is a currently running experiment to search for the neutrinoless
double beta decay and to study the two-neutrino double beta decay with 10kg of
enriched isotopes. On the basis of the first two years of data taking, a limit
on the neutrinoless decay $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} > 5.8\cdot10^{23}$ y at 90% CL was
obtained with $^{100}Mo$. The two-neutrino double beta decay half-lives were
measured for all seven $\beta\beta$ isotopes located in NEMO 3. New results are
obtained for two of these isotopes: $^{48}Ca T_{1/2}^{2\nu}=[4.4 ^{+0.5}_{-0.4}
(stat) \pm 0.4 (syst)]\cdot10^{19}$ y, $^{96}Zr T_{1/2}^{2\nu}=[2.3 \pm 0.2
(stat) \pm 0.3 (syst)]\cdot10^{19}$ y.
