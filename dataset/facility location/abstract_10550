During strong magnetic storms, the errors of determination of the range,
frequency Doppler shift and angles of arrival of transionospheric radio signals
exceeds the one for magnetically quiet days by one order of magnitude as a
minimum. This can be the cause of performance degradation of current satellite
radio engineering navigation, communication and radar systems as well as of
superlong-baseline radio interferometry systems. The relative density of phase
slips at mid-latitudes exceeds its mean value for magnetically quiet days at
least by the order of 1 or 2, that makes a few percent of the total density of
GPS observations. Furthermore, the level of phase slips for the GPS satellites
located at the sunward side of the Earth was 5-10 times larger compared to the
opposite side of the Earth.
