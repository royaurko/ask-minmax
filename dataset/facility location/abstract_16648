In an earlier study, we reported on the excitation of large-scale vortices in
Cartesian hydrodynamical convection models subject to rapid enough rotation. In
that study, the conditions of the onset of the instability were investigated in
terms of the Reynolds (Re) and Coriolis (Co) numbers in models located at the
stellar North pole. In this study, we extend our investigation to varying
domain sizes, increasing stratification and place the box at different
latitudes. The effect of the increasing box size is to increase the sizes of
the generated structures, so that the principal vortex always fills roughly
half of the computational domain. The instability becomes stronger in the sense
that the temperature anomaly and change in the radial velocity are observed to
be enhanced. The model with the smallest box size is found to be stable against
the instability, suggesting that a sufficient scale separation between the
convective eddies and the scale of the domain is required for the instability
to work. The instability can be seen upto the co-latitude of 30 degrees, above
which value the flow becomes dominated by other types of mean flows. The
instability can also be seen in a model with larger stratification. Unlike the
weakly stratified cases, the temperature anomaly caused by the vortex
structures is seen to depend on depth.
