We report on an infrared 1 to 17 micron study of the nearby (cz = 4600 km/s)
interacting spiral galaxy system, UGC 12914/12915, using the ground-based
Palomar 200" telescope and PFIRCAM near-infrared detector and space-based
mid-infrared imaging and spectral observations using ISOCAM and Phot-S on the
Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). Strong line emission from aromatic band
features at 6.2, 7.7 and 11.3 microns are seen in both the mid-IR imaging and
Phot-S spectro-photometry centered on the nuclei. In the connecting bridge, the
mid-infrared imaging reveals dust grains intermixed with the atomic hydrogen
gas. The heating mechanism for the hot dust is likely to be UV photons
diffusing out from the galactic disks and the H II complex located along the
extreme northeastern portion of the bridge: The dust emission, or mid-infrared
intensity per atomic hydrogen column density ratio, is consistent with heating
from the local (bridge) interstellar radiation field.
