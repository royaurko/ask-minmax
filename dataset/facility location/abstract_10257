We present a new brane solution in the (1+5)-dimensional space-time with an
increasing warp factor, which localizes the zero modes of all kinds of matter
fields and Newtonian gravity. The interesting features of this solution are: 1)
In contrast to the Gogberashvili-Singleton case the effective wave function of
the zero mode spinor field confined on the brane is finite at a position of
brane; 2) There is exactly one zero mode for each matter field and the
gravitational field confined on the brane with a finite probability and
infinitely many zero modes (labelled by the angular momentum corresponding to
extra space) are located in the bulk at different localization radii.
