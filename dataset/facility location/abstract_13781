Abandoning the assumption that light traces mass, I seek the location of the
center of the Local Group of galaxies based solely on kinematic data and the
plausible assumption of infall. The available set of positions and radial
velocities is shown to be a misleading indicator of Local Group motions, giving
a direction to the center offset from the true one; statistical techniques of
moderate sophistication do not catch the offset. Corrected calculations show
the center to lie in the direction to M31 within the uncertainty of the method,
a few degrees. The distance to the center is not well determined, lying about
0.5 Mpc from the Milky Way. The pattern of observed (galactocentric) radial
velocities excludes both dynamically important `orphan haloes' and any extended
dark matter halo for the Group as a whole, and shows the Group to have formed
from a much more extended volume than it presently occupies. Kinematics alone
indicates that the mass of the Group is concentrated effectively in M31 and the
Milky Way.
