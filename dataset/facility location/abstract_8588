New high quality Keck and ESO images of PKS 1830-211 are presented. Applying
a powerful new deconvolution algorithm to these optical and infrared data, both
images of the flat spectrum core of the radio source have been identified. An
extended source is also detected in the optical images, consistent with the
expected location of the lensing galaxy. The source counterparts are very red
at I-K~7, suggesting strong Galactic absorption with additional absorption by
the lensing galaxy at z=0.885, and consistent with the detection of high
redshift molecules in the lens.
