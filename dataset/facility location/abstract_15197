We report on four Chandra grating observations of the oblique magnetic
rotator theta^1 Ori C (O5.5 V) covering a wide range of viewing angles with
respect to the star's 1060 G dipole magnetic field. We employ line-width and
centroid analyses to study the dynamics of the X-ray emitting plasma in the
circumstellar environment, as well as line-ratio diagnostics to constrain the
spatial location, and global spectral modeling to constrain the temperature
distribution and abundances of the very hot plasma. We investigate these
diagnostics as a function of viewing angle and analyze them in conjunction with
new MHD simulations of the magnetically channeled wind shock mechanism on
theta^1 Ori C. This model fits all the data surprisingly well, predicting the
temperature, luminosity, and occultation of the X-ray emitting plasma with
rotation phase.
