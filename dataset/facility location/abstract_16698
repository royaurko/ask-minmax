Spectropolarimetric observations of a sunspot were carried out with the
Tenerife Infrared Polarimeter at Observatorio del Teide, Tenerife, Spain. Maps
of the physical parameters were obtained from an inversion of the Stokes
profiles observed in the infrared Fe i line at 15648 angstrom. The regular
sunspot consisted of a light bridge which separated the two umbral cores of the
same polarity. One of the arms of the light bridge formed an extension of a
penumbral filament which comprised weak and highly inclined magnetic fields. In
addition, the Stokes V profiles in this filament had an opposite sign as the
sunspot and some resembled Stokes Q or U. This penumbral filament terminated
abruptly into another at the edge of the sunspot, where the latter was
relatively vertical by about 30 degrees. Chromospheric H-alpha and He 304
angstrom filtergrams revealed three superpenumbral fibrils on the limb-side of
the sunspot, in which one fibril extended into the sunspot and was oriented
along the highly inclined penumbral counterpart of the light bridge. An
intense, elongated brightening was observed along this fibril that was
co-spatial with the intersecting penumbral filaments in the photosphere. Our
results suggest that the disruption in the sunspot magnetic field at the
location of the light bridge could be the source of reconnection that led to
the intense chromospheric brightening and facilitated the supply of cool
material in maintaining the overlying superpenumbral fibrils.
