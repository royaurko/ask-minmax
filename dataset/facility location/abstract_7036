We show that the dynamical screening of the Coulomb interaction among Cu-d
electrons in high-Tc cuprates is very strong and that a proper treatment of
this effect is essential for a consistent description of the electronic
structure. In particular, we find that ab-initio calculations for undoped
La2CuO4 yield an insulator only if the frequency dependence of the Coulomb
interaction is taken into account. We also identify a collective excitation in
the screened interaction at 9 eV which is rather localized on the copper site,
and which is responsible for a satellite structure at energy -13 eV, located
below the p bands.
