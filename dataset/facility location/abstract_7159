In this paper we demonstrate for the first time the connection between the
spatial and temporal progression of star formation and the changing locations
of the very dense regions in the gas of a massive disk galaxy (NGC 1144) in the
aftermath of its collision with a massive elliptical (NGC 1143). These two
galaxies form the combined object Arp 118, a collisional ring galaxy system.
The results of 3D, time-dependent, numerical simulations of the behavior of the
gas, stars, and dark matter of a disk galaxy and the stars and dark matter in
an elliptical during a collision are compared with multiwavelength observations
of Arp 118. The collision that took place approximately 22 Myr ago generated a
strong, non-linear density wave in the stars and gas in the disk of NGC 1144,
causing the gas to became clumped on a large scale. This wave produced a series
of superstarclusters along arcs and rings that emanate from the central point
of impact in the disk. The locations of these star forming regions match those
of the regions of increased gas density predicted the time sequence of models.
The models also predict the large velocity gradients observed across the disk
of NGC 1144. These are due to the rapid radial outflow of gas coupled to large
azimuthal velocities in the expanding ring, caused by the impact of the massive
intruder.
