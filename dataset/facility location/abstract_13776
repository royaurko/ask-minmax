Significant beam loss caused by the charge exchange processes and ions impact
induced outgassing play a crucial role in the limitation of the maximum number
of accumulated heavy ions during the high intensity operation in the
accelerators. With the aim to control beam loss due to charge exchange
processes and to confine the generated desorption gas, the tracking of the loss
positions and installing the absorber blocks with low-desorption rate material
at appropriate locations in the CSRm ring will be taken. The loss simulation of
U ions having lost an electron will be presented in this report and the
calculation of the collimation efficiency of the CSRm ring will be continued in
the future.
