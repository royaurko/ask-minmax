With the puncture method for black hole simulations, the second infinity of a
wormhole geometry is compactified to a single "puncture point" on the
computational grid. The region surrounding the puncture quickly evolves to a
trumpet geometry. The computational grid covers only a portion of the trumpet
throat. It ends at a boundary whose location depends on resolution. This raises
the possibility that perturbations in the trumpet geometry could propagate down
the trumpet throat, reflect from the puncture boundary, and return to the black
hole exterior with a resolution--dependent time delay. Such pathological
behavior is not observed. This is explained by the observation that some
perturbative modes propagate in the conformal geometry, others propagate in the
physical geometry. The puncture boundary exists only in the physical geometry.
The modes that propagate in the physical geometry are always directed away from
the computational domain at the puncture boundary. The finite difference
stencils ensure that these modes are advected through the boundary with no
coupling to the modes that propagate in the conformal geometry. These results
are supported by numerical experiments with a code that evolves spherically
symmetric gravitational fields with standard Cartesian finite difference
stencils. The code uses the Baumgarte--Shapiro--Shibata--Nakamura formulation
of Einstein's equations with 1+log slicing and gamma--driver shift conditions.
