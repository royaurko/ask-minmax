We describe a new and distinctive interferometry in which a probe particle
scatters off a superposition of locations of a single free target particle. In
one dimension, probe particles incident on superposed locations of a single
"mirror" can interfere as if in a Fabry-Perot interferometer; in two
dimensions, probe particles scattering off superposed locations of a single
"slit" can interfere as if in a two-slit Young interferometer. The condition
for interference is loss of orthogonality of the target states and reduces, in
simple examples, to transfer of orthogonality from target to probe states. We
analyze experimental parameters and conditions necessary for interference to be
observed.
