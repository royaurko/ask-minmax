We present initial results from a Magellan telescope program to image
galaxies that give rise to damped Lyman absorbers (DLAs) at 1.63 < z_DLA <
2.37. Our program differs from previous efforts in that we target quasars with
intervening Lyman limit systems (LLS) along the line of sight at redshift z_LLS
> 3.5. The higher-redshift LLS is applied as a blocking filter to remove the
glare of the background quasar at the rest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths of the
foreground galaxy. The complete absence of quasar light offers an unimpeded
view along the sightline to the redshift of the LLS, allowing an exhaustive
search for the DLA galaxy to the sensitivity limit of the imaging data (at or
better than 0.25L*). In both of our pilot fields (PKS2000-330, z_DLA=2.033 and
SDSS0322-0558, z_DLA=1.69), we identify an L* galaxy within 5" of the sightline
which has optical colors consistent with star-forming galaxies at z~2. We
examine the correlation between absorption-line properties and galaxy
luminosity and impact distance, and compare the high-redshift galaxy and
absorber pairs with those known at z<1.
