We investigate the high-energy scattering in the spontaneously broken Yang -
Mills gauge theory in 2+1 space--time dimensions and present the exact solution
of the leading $\ln s$ BFKL equation. The solution is constructed in terms of
special functions using the earlier results of two of us (L.N.L. and L.S.). The
analytic properties of the $t$-channel partial wave as functions of the angular
momentum and momentum transfer have been studied. We find in the angular
momentum plane: (i) a Regge pole whose trajectory has an intercept larger than
1 and (ii) a fixed cut with the rightmost singularity located at $j=1$. The
massive Yang - Mills theory can be considered as a theoretical model for the
(non-perturbative) Pomeron. We study the main structure and property of the
solution including the Pomeron trajectory at momentum transfer different from
zero. The relation to the results of M. Li and C-I. Tan for the massless case
is discussed.
