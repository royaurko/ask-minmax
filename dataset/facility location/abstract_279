In Japan, China and Russia, there are several test beam lines available or
will become available in near future. Those are open for users who need
electron, muon and charged pion beams with energies of 1-50 GeV for any tests
of small-size detectors. In this manuscript I present a current status of those
test beam facilities in the Asian region.
