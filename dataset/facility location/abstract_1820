We explore some of the rich structure of the polarization observables
recently developed for processes like $\gamma N\to\pi\pi N$ and $\gamma N\to K
\bar{K} N$ in the framework of a specific model for the latter process.
Emphasis is placed on observables that may be accesible at existing facilities
in the near future. The sensitivity of the observables to the details of the
model indicate that they will be a very useful tool in differentiating between
different models for reactions like these. In the framework of a model for
$\gamma N\to K \bar{K} N$, we examine the sensitivity of the observables to
coupling constants of the $\phi$, to the properties of the $\Lambda(1405)$, and
to the existence of the $\Theta^+$.
