We study the thermodynamic behavior of nonpolar liquid mixtures in the
vicinity of curved charged objects, such as electrodes or charged colloids. For
small enough charge on the object, or equivalently, small potential, the
dielectrophoretic force leads to enrichment of the more polar liquid close the
colloid. However, there is a critical value of charge (or potential), above
which a phase-separation transition occurs, and the interface between high- and
low-dielectric constant components becomes sharp. Analytical and numerical
composition profile are given, and the equilibrium front location as a function
of charge or voltage is found. We further employ a simple Cahn-Hilliard type
equation to study the dynamics of phase-separation in spatially nonuniform
electric fields. We find an exponential relaxation of the composition front
location, with a characteristic time depending on the charge, mixture
composition and ambient temperature.
