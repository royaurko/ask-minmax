A galactic supernova remnant (SNR) Vela Jr. (RX J0852.0$-$4622, G266.6$-$1.2)
shows sharp filamentary structure on the north-western edge of the remnant in
the hard X-ray band. The filaments are so smooth and located on the most outer
side of the remnant. We measured the averaged scale width of the filaments
($w_u$ and $w_d$) with excellent spatial resolution of {\it Chandra}, which are
in the order of the size of the point spread function of {\it Chandra} on the
upstream side and 49.5 (36.0--88.8) arcsec on the downstream side,
respectively. The spectra of the filaments are very hard and have no line-like
structure, and were well reproduced with an absorbed power-law model with
$\Gamma = $2.67 (2.55--2.77), or a {\tt SRCUT} model with $\nu_{rolloff}$ = 4.3
(3.4--5.3)$\times 10^{16}$ Hz under the assumption of $p=0.3$. These results
imply that the hard X-rays are synchrotron radiation emitted by accelerated
electrons, as mentioned previously. Using a correlation between a function
${\cal B} \equiv \nu_{rolloff}/w_d^2$ and the SNR age, we estimated the
distance and the age of Vela Jr.: the estimated distance and age are 0.33
(0.26--0.50) kpc and 660 (420--1400) years, respectively. These results are
consistent with previous reports, implying that ${\cal B}$--age relation may be
a useful tool to estimate the distance and the age of synchrotron X-ray
emitting SNRs.
