LHCb will commence data taking as the first dedicated heavy flavour
experiment at a hadron collider in 2008. A very high hit precision from its
vertex detector (VELO) is essential to meet the tight requirements of vertex
reconstruction in B-physics. The single hit precision of the VELO is better
than 10 micron. However, the VELO is operated only 8 mm from the beam and must
be retracted and reinserted each LHC fill. Hence, the detector places unique
demands on its alignment algorithm. The partially assembled VELO system has
already been tested in a beam test. The novel software alignment methods are
presented together with their interplay with the metrology measurements.
Results from Monte Carlo simulation studies are discussed and recent beam test
results are shown that prove the method's precision at the micron level.
