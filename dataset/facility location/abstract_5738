The results of an extensive numerical study of the orbital dynamics of small
bodies ranging from micron-sized dust grains to 1 km objects subject to gas
drag and also the gravitational attraction of a non-uniform gaseous nebula are
presented. The results indicate that it is possible for small bodies to migrate
rapidly toward the locations of the maxima of the gas density where the
probabilities of collisions and coagulations are enhanced.
