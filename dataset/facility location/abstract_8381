In this work we examine how volume exclusion caused by regions of high
chromatin density might influence the time required for proteins to find
specific DNA binding sites. The spatial variation of chromatin density within
mouse olfactory sensory neurons is determined from soft X-ray tomography
reconstructions of five nuclei. We show that there is a division of the nuclear
space into regions of low-density euchromatin and high-density heterochromatin.
Volume exclusion experienced by a diffusing protein caused by this varying
density of chromatin is modeled by a repulsive potential. The value of the
potential at a given point in space is chosen to be proportional to the density
of chromatin at that location. The constant of proportionality, called the
volume exclusivity, provides a model parameter that determines the strength of
volume exclusion. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the mean time for a
protein to locate a binding site localized in euchromatin is minimized for a
finite, non-zero volume exclusivity. For binding sites in heterochromatin, the
mean time is minimized when the volume exclusivity is zero (the protein
experiences no volume exclusion). An analytical theory is developed to explain
these results. The theory suggests that for binding sites in euchromatin there
is an optimal level of volume exclusivity that balances a reduction in the
volume searched in finding the binding site, with the height of effective
potential barriers the protein must cross during the search process.
