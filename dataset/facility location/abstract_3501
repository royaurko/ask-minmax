gamma-rays following the B and B-n decay of the very neutron rich 84Ga
produced by photo-fission of 238U have been studied at the newly built ISOL
facility of IPN Orsay: ALTO. Two activities were observed and assigned to two
B-decaying states: 84gGa, I = (0\^-) and 84mGa, I = (3\^-, 4\^-). Excitation
energies of the 2+1 and 4+1 excited states of 84Ge were measured at E(2+1) =
624.3 keV and E(4+1) = 1670.1 keV. Comparison with HFB+GCM calculations allows
to establish the collective character of this nucleus indicating a substantial
N=50 core polarization. The excitation energy of the 1/2+1 state in 83Ga known
to carry a large part of the neutron 3s1/2 strength was measured at 247.8keV.
Altogether these data allow to confirm the new single particle state ordering
which appears immediately after the double Z=28 and N=50 shell closure and to
designate 78Ni as a fragile and easily polarized doubly-magic core.
