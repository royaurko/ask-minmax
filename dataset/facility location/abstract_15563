We consider the anisotropic three dimensional XXZ Heisenberg ferromagnet in a
cylinder with axis along the 111 direction and boundary conditions that induce
ground states describing an interface orthogonal to the cylinder axis. Let $L$
be the linear size of the basis of the cylinder. Because of the breaking of the
continuous symmetry around the $\hat z$ axis, the Goldstone theorem implies
that the spectral gap above such ground states must tend to zero as $L\to
\infty$. In \cite{BCNS} it was proved that, by perturbing in a sub--cylinder
with basis of linear size $R\ll L$ the interface ground state, it is possible
to construct excited states whose energy gap shrinks as $R^{-2}$. Here we prove
that, uniformly in the height of the cylinder and in the location of the
interface, the energy gap above the interface ground state is bounded from
below by $\text{const.}L^{-2}$. We prove the result by first mapping the
problem into an asymmetric simple exclusion process on $\Z^3$ and then by
adapting to the latter the recursive analysis to estimate from below the
spectral gap of the associated Markov generator developed in \cite{CancMart}.
Along the way we improve some bounds on the equivalence of ensembles already
discussed in \cite{BCNS} and we establish an upper bound on the density of
states close to the bottom of the spectrum.
