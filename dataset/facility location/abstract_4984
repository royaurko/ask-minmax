Ubiquitous healthcare has become one of the prominent areas of research
inorder to address the challenges encountered in healthcare environment. In
contribution to this area, this study developed a system prototype that
recommends diagonostic services based on physiological data collected in real
time from a distant patient. The prototype uses WBAN body sensors to be worn by
the individual and an android smart phone as a personal server. Physiological
data is collected and uploaded to a Medical Health Server (MHS) via
GPRS/internet to be analysed. Our implemented prototype monitors the activity,
location and physiological data such as SpO2 and Heart Rate (HR) of the elderly
and patients in rehabilitation. The uploaded information can be accessed in
real time by medical practitioners through a web application.
