After carefully cross-identifying a previously discovered GALEX-selected
Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) candidates one-to-one with their optical counterparts
in the field of the CDF-S, we re-estimate their photometric redshifts using
multi-wavelength data from UV, optical to NIR. We refine a new updated sample
of 383 LBGs at $0.7\la z \la 1.4$.
  Most LBGs are classified as starburst and irregular types. Ages spread from
several Myr to 1.5Gyr. Their dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) and
stellar masses ($M_*$) are from $4\my$ to $220\my$ and from $2.3\times 10^8
\msun$ to $4 \times 10^{11} \msun$. The rest-frame FUV luminosity function of
LBGs are presented. LBGs of irregular types mainly distribute along the "main
sequence" of star forming galaxies while most LBGs of starburst types locate in
the starburst region. A "downsizing" effect is clearly found and LBGs
distribute in the "blue" cloud.
  HST images in F606W ($V$ band) and F850LP ($z$ band) are taken from the GEMS
and GOODS-S surveys. SExtractor and GALFIT are applied to get their
morphological parameters. A morphological sample of 142 LBGs with reliable
results of $\sersic$ and sizes in both bands is defined. We find that LBGs at
$z\sim 1 $ are dominated by disk-like galaxies. Correlations between
photometric and morphological properties of LBGs are investigated. Strong
correlations between their half-light radii and $M_*$, i.e., size-stellar mass
relations, are found in both bands. Physical connections between correlations
and the "downsizing" effect are discussed.
