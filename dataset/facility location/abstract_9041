The proposed SuperNova/Acceleration Probe (SNAP) mission will have a
two-meter class telescope delivering diffraction-limited images to an
instrumented 0.7 square-degree field sensitive in the visible and near-infrared
wavelength regime. We describe the requirements for the instrument suite and
the evolution of the focal plane design to the present concept in which all the
instrumentation -- visible and near-infrared imagers, spectrograph, and star
guiders -- share one common focal plane.
