We report on photocurrent and photoconductance processes in a freely
suspended p-doped single GaAs nanowire. The nanowires are grown by molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE), and they are electrically contacted by a focused ion beam
(FIB) deposition technique. The observed photocurrent is generated at the
Schottky contacts between the nanowire and metal source-drain electrodes, while
the observed photoconductance signal can be explained by a photogating effect
induced by optically generated charge carriers located at the surface of the
nanowire. Both optoelectronic effects are sensitive to the polarization of the
exciting laser field, enabling polarization dependent photodetectors.
