Habitability varies dramatically with location and time in the universe. This
was recognized centuries ago, but it was only in the last few decades that
astronomers began to systematize the study of habitability. The introduction of
the concept of the habitable zone was key to progress in this area. The
habitable zone concept was first applied to the space around a star, now called
the Circumstellar Habitable Zone. Recently, other, vastly broader, habitable
zones have been proposed. We review the historical development of the concept
of habitable zones and the present state of the research. We also suggest ways
to make progress on each of the habitable zones and to unify them into a single
concept encompassing the entire universe.
