A critical point in the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), if
established either theoretically or experimentally, would be as profound a
discovery as the good-old gas-liquid critical point. Unlike the latter,
however, first-principles based approaches are being employed to locate it
theoretically. Due to the short lived nature of the concerned phases, novel
experimental techniques are needed to search for it. The Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC) in USA has an experimental program to do so. This short review
is an attempt to provide a glimpse of the race between the theorists and the
experimentalists as well as that of the synergy between them.
