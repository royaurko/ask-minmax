In order to explore CP asymmetry in the lepton sector, a power upgrade to the
neutrino experimental facility at J-PARC is a key requirement for both the
Tokai to Kamioka (T2K) long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment and a
future project with Hyper-Kamiokande. Based on five years of operational
experience, the facility has achieved stable operation with 230 kW beam power
without significant problems on the beam-line apparatus. After successful
maintenance works in 2013-2014 to replace all electromagnetic horns and a
production target, the facility is now ready to accomodate a 750-kW-rated beam.
Also, the possibility of achieving a few to multi-MW beam operation is
discussed in detail.
