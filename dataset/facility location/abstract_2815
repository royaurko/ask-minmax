We present a technique designed to automatically compute predicate
abstractions for dense real-timed models represented as networks of timed
automata.
  We use the CIPM algorithm in our previous work which computes new invariants
for timed automata control locations and prunes the model, to compute a
predicate abstraction of the model. We do so by taking information regarding
control locations and their newly computed invariants into account.
