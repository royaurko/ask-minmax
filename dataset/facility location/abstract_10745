The emergence and maintenance of cooperation within sizable groups of
unrelated humans offer many challenges for our understanding. We propose that
the humans' capacity of communication, such as how many and how far away the
fellows can build up mutual communications, may affect the evolution of
cooperation. We study this issue by means of the public goods game (PGG) with a
two-layered network of contacts. Players obtain payoffs from five-person public
goods interactions on a square lattice (the interaction layer). Also, they
update strategies after communicating with neighbours in learning layer, where
two players build up mutual communication with a power law probability
depending on their spatial distance. Our simulation results indicate that the
evolution of cooperation is indeed sensitive to how players choose others to
communicate with, including the amount as well as the locations. The tendency
of localised communication is proved to be a new mechanism to promote
cooperation.
