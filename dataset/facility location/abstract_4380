The energetic evaluations of graphite-to-diamond transition by electron
irradiation are performed. The heat conduction problem is solved for the
diamond synthesis when a pulse-periodic source of energy is located within a
graphite cylinder; time dependences of temperature and pressure are found. It
is shown, that the temperatures and pressures implemented in graphite are
sufficient for graphite-to-diamond transition under electron bombardment.
