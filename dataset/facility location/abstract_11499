First-principles calculations are used to investigate the electronic
properties of neutral and negatively charged n-pyrrole oligomers with n= 2-18.
Chains of neutral oligomers are bent while the negatively charged oligomers
become almost flat due to accumulation of negative charge at the end monomers.
Several isomers of the short oligomers (n < 5) display negative electron
affinity, although they are energetically stable. For longer oligomers with n >
5, the electron affinity turns positive, increasing with oligomer length. The
doping of 12-pyrrole with lithium atoms is studied, showing that negative
oxidation states are possible due to charge transfer from dopant to oligomer at
locations close to dopant. These molecular regions support extra negative
charge and exhibit a local structural change from benzenoid to quinoid in the
C-C backbone conjugation. Additional calculations of neutral and doped
polypyrrole are conducted showing that the doped infinite polymer chain
displays a substantial reduction of the energy band gap and the appearance of
dopant-based bands in the gap.
