In this article, I examine several observational trends regarding
protoplanetary disks, debris disks and exoplanets in binary systems in an
attempt to constrain the physical mechanisms of planet formation in such a
context. Binaries wider than about 100 AU are indistinguishable from single
stars in all aspects. Binaries in the 5-100 AU range, on the other hand, are
associated with shorter-lived but (at least in some cases) equally massive
disks. Furthermore, they form planetesimals and mature planetary systems at a
similar rate as wider binaries and single stars, albeit with the peculiarity
that they predominantly produce high-mass planets. I posit that the location of
a stellar companion influences the relative importance of the core accretion
and disk fragmentation planet formation processes, with the latter mechanism
being predominant in binaries tighter than 100 AU.
