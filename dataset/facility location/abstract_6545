The process of ionization of a hydrogen atom by a short infrared laser pulse
is studied in the regime of very large pulse intensity, in the dipole
approximation. Let $A$ denote the integral of the electric field of the pulse
over time at the location of the atomic nucleus. It is shown that, in the limit
where $|A| \to \infty$, the ionization probability approaches unity and the
electron is ejected into a cone opening in the direction of $-A$ and of
arbitrarily small opening angle. Asymptotics of various physical quantities in
$|A|^{-1}$ is studied carefully. Our results are in qualitative agreement with
experimental data reported in \cite{1,2}.
