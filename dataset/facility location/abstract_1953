Ontario (Canada) Health System stakeholders support the idea and necessity of
the integrated source of data that would include both clinical (e.g. diagnosis,
intervention, length of stay, case mix group) and financial (e.g. cost per
weighted case, cost per diem) characteristics of the Ontario healthcare system
activities at the patient-specific level. At present, the actual patient-level
case costs in the explicit form are not available in the financial databases
for all hospitals. The goal of this research effort is to develop financial
models that will assign each clinical case in the patient-specific data
warehouse a dollar value, representing the cost incurred by the Ontario health
care facility which treated the patient. Five mathematical models have been
developed and verified using real dataset. All models can be classified into
two groups based on their underlying method: 1. Models based on using relative
intensity weights of the cases, and 2. Models based on using cost per diem.
