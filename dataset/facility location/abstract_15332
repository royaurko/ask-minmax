We derive the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the nucleus of the
Seyfert galaxy NGC4565. Despite its classification as a Seyfert2, the nuclear
source is substantially unabsorbed. The absorption we find from Chandra data
(N_H=2.5 X 10^21 cm^-2) is consistent with that produced by material in the
galactic disk of the host galaxy. HST images show a nuclear unresolved source
in all of the available observations, from the near-IR H band to the optical U
band. The SED is completely different from that of Seyfert galaxies and QSO, as
it appears basically ``flat'' in the IR-optical region, with a small drop-off
in the U-band. The location of the object in diagnostic planes for low
luminosity AGNs excludes a jet origin for the optical nucleus, and its
extremely low Eddington ratio L_o/L_Edd indicates that the radiation we observe
is most likely produced in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF).
This would make NGC4565 the first AGN in which an ADAF-like process is
identified in the optical. We find that the relatively high [OIII] flux
observed from the ground cannot be all produced in the nucleus. Therefore, an
extended NLR must exist in this object. This may be interpreted in the
framework of two different scenarios: i) the radiation from ADAFs is sufficient
to give rise to high ionization emission-line regions through photoionization,
or ii) the nuclear source has recently ``turned-off'', switching from a
high-efficiency accretion regime to the present low-efficiency state.
