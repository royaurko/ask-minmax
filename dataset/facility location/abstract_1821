We study the $A$ dependence of the $\phi$ meson production cross section in
proton nucleus reactios at energies just above threshold, which are accessible
in an experimental facility like COSY. This $A$ dependence has two sources: the
distortion of the incident proton and the absorption of the $\phi$ in its way
out of the nucleus. This second process reduces the cross section in about a
factor two in heavy nuclei. Thus we show that the $A$ dependence of the cross
section contains valuable information on the $\phi$ width in the nuclear
medium.
