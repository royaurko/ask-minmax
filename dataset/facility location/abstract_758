A measurement of the longitudinal polarization of the electron beam at HERA
utilizing coherent interactions of high energy photons in crystals is proposed.
Modification of existing facilities would allow an independent polarization
measurement and a verification of birefringence phenomena in crystals for
20--30~GeV photons. Relevant experimental issues and systematic uncertainties
are also presented.
