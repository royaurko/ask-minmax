The structure of the photospheric magnetic field during solar flares is
examined using echelle spectropolarimetric observations. The study is based on
several Fe I and Cr I lines observed at locations corresponding to brightest
H$\alpha$ emission during thermal phase of flares. The analysis is performed by
comparing magnetic field values deduced from lines with different magnetic
sensitivities, as well as by examining the fine structure of $I\pm V$ Stokes
profiles splitting. It is shown that the field has at least two components,
with stronger unresolved flux tubes embedded in weaker ambient field. Based on
a two-component magnetic field model, we compare observed and synthetic line
profiles and show that the field strength in small-scale flux tubes is about
$2-3$ kG. Furthermore, we find that the small-scale flux tubes are associated
with flare emission, which may have implications for flare phenomenology.
