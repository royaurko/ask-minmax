The recent astronomical observations indicate that the expanding universe
having a finite particle horizon is homogeneous, isotropic and asymptotically
flat. The Euclidean geometry of the universe enables to determine the total
kinetic and gravitational energies of the universe within the framework of the
Newtonian mechanics. It has been shown that almost the entire kinetic energy of
the universe ensues from the cosmological expansion. Both, the total kinetic
and gravitational energies of the universe have been determined in relation to
an observer at arbitrary location. It is amazing that the modulus of the total
gravitational energy differs from the total kinetic energy with a multiplier
close to a unit. Thus, the total mechanical energy of the universe has been
found close to zero. Both, the total kinetic energy and the modulus of total
gravitational energy of the universe are estimated to 3/10 of its total rest
energy M*c^2.
