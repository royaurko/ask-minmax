The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate ($1/T_{1}$) has been measured in the
single crystals of hole doped two-leg ladder compounds
Sr$_{14-x}$Ca$_{x}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ and in the undoped parent material
La$_6$Ca$_8$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$. Comparison of $1/T_{1}$ at the Cu and the two
distinct oxygen sites revealed that the major spectral weight of low frequency
spin fluctuations is located near $q \sim (\pi, \pi)$ for most of the
temperature and doping ranges investigated. Remarkable difference in the
temperature dependence of $1/T_1$ for the two oxygen sites in the heavily doped
$x$=12 sample revealed reduction of singlet correlations between two legs in
place of growing antiferromagnetic correlations along the leg direction with
increasing temperature. Such behavior is most likely caused by the dissociation
of bound hole pairs.
