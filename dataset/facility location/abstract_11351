We report new photometric observations of the 200000 year old naked weak-line
run-away T Tauri star Par 1724, located north of the Trapezium cluster in
Orion. We observed in the broad band filters B, V, R, and I using the 90cm
Dutch telescope on La Silla, the 80cm Wendelstein telescope, and a 25cm
telescope of the University Observatory Jena in Grossschwabhausen near Jena.
The photometric data in V and R are consistent with a 5.7 day rotation period
due to spots, as observed before between 1960ies and 2000. Also, for the first
time, we present evidence for a long-term 9 or 17.5 year cycle in photometric
data (V band) of such a young star, a cycle similar to that to of the Sun and
other active stars.
