We have conducted multi-epoch EVN observations of the 22.2 GHz water masers
towards the high-mass young stellar object in AFGL 5142. With four observing
epochs, spanning a time of ~1 year, 12 distinct maser features have been
detected, 7 out of these detected in more than one epoch. The positions and the
velocities of the VLBI features agree well with those of the emission centers
previously identified by means of VLA observations. For a few features,
persistent over three or four epochs, accurate values of the proper motions are
derived. On the basis of their spatial distribution, the observed maser
features can be divided into two groups. A model fit to the positions and
velocities of the maser features of Group I, detected in the same region
(within ~500 mas) where the massive YSO should be located, demonstrates that
these might arise on the surface of a nearly edge-on Keplerian disk, rotating
around a massive young stellar object. The maser features of Group II, found at
large distances from the YSO (> 1 arcsec), have positions and line-of-sight
velocities in agreement with the blue-shifted lobe of a large scale molecular
outflow (traced by the HCO+ and SiO emission), and might result from the
interaction between the gas flowing away from the young stellar object and the
ambient gas of the progenitor molecular core.
