We present an analysis of the papers published in the journals Nature and
Science in the years from 2006 to 2010. During this period, a total of 7788
papers were published in the two journals. This includes 544 astronomy papers
that comprise 7.0% of the papers in `all' research fields and 18.9% of those in
the fields of `physical sciences'. The sub-fields of research of the astronomy
papers are distributed, in descending order of number of papers, in Solar
System, stellar astronomy, galaxies and the universe, the Milky Way Galaxy, and
exoplanets. The observational facilities used for the studies are mainly
ground-based telescopes (31.1%), spacecrafts (27.0%), and space telescopes
(22.8%), while 16.0% of papers did not use any noticeable facilities and 1.7%
used other facilities. Korean scientists have published 86 papers (33 in Nature
and 53 in Science), which is 1.10% of all the papers (N=7788) in the two
journals. The share of papers by Korean astronomers among the scientific papers
by Koreans is 8.14%, slightly higher than the contribution of astronomy papers
(7.0%) in both journals.
