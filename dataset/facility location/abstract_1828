Isospin effects on the optical potentials of kaons and antikaons in dense
hadronic matter are investigated using a chiral SU(3) model. These effects are
important for asymmetric heavy ion collision experiments. In the present work
the dispersion relations are derived for kaons and antikaons, compatible with
the low energy scattering data, within our model approach. The relations result
from the kaonic interactions with the nucleons, vector mesons and scalar mesons
in the asymmetric nuclear matter. The isospin asymmetry effects arising from
the interactions with the vector-isovector $\rho$- meson as well as the scalar
isovector $\delta$ mesons are considered. The density dependence of the isospin
asymmetry is seen to be appreciable for the kaon and antikaon optical
potentials. This can be particularly relevant for the future accelerator
facility FAIR at GSI, where experiments using neutron rich beams are planned to
be used in the study of compressed baryonic matter.
