The results of precise analysis of elements and isotopes in meteorites,
comets, the Earth, the Moon, Mars, Jupiter, the solar wind, solar flares, and
the solar photosphere since 1960 reveal fingerprints of a local supernova (SN),
undiluted by interstellar material. Heterogeneous SN debris formed the planets.
The Sun formed on the neutron (n) rich SN core. The ground-state masses of
nuclei reveal repulsive n-n interactions that trigger n-emission and a series
of nuclear reactions that generate solar luminosity, the solar wind, and the
measured flux of solar neutrinos. The location of the Sun's high-density core
shifts relative to the solar surface as gravitational forces exerted by the
major planets cause the Sun to experience abrupt acceleration and deceleration,
like a yoyo on a string, in its orbit about the ever-changing centre-of-mass of
the solar system. Solar cycles (surface magnetic activity, solar eruptions, and
sunspots) and major climate changes arise from changes in the depth of the
energetic SN core remnant in the interior of the Sun.
