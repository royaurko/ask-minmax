This article describes a comprehensive system for surveillance and monitoring
applications. The development of an efficient real time video motion detection
system is motivated by their potential for deployment in the areas where
security is the main concern. The paper presents a platform for real time video
motion detection and subsequent generation of an alarm condition as set by the
parameters of the control system. The prototype consists of a mobile platform
mounted with RF camera which provides continuous feedback of the environment.
The received visual information is then analyzed by user for appropriate
control action, thus enabling the user to operate the system from a remote
location. The system is also equipped with the ability to process the image of
an object and generate control signals which are automatically transmitted to
the mobile platform to track the object.
