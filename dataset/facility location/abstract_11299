We investigate the ability of the reference hypernetted-chain integral
equation to describe the phase diagram of square-well fluids with four
different ranges of attraction. Comparison of our results with simulation data
shows that the theory is able to reproduce with fairly good accuracy a
significant part of the coexistence curve, provided an extrapolation procedure
is used to circumvent the well-known pathologies of the pseudo-spinodal line,
which are more severe at reduced width of the attractive well. The method
provides a useful approach for a quick assessment of the location of the
liquid-vapor coexistence curve in this kind of fluid and serves as a check for
the more complex problem of anisotropic "patchy" square-well molecules.
