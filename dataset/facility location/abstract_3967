G339.88-1.26 is considered to be a good candidate for a massive star with a
circumstellar disk. This has been supported by the observations of linearly
distributed methanol maser spots believed to delineate this disk, and
mid-infrared observations that have discovered a source at this location that
is elongated at the same position angle as the methanol maser distribution. We
used the mid-infrared imager/spectrometer OSCIR at Keck to make high-resolution
images of G339.88-1.26. We resolve the mid-infrared emission into 3 sources
within 1.5 arcsec of the location of the masers. We determine that the methanol
masers are most likely not located in a circumstellar disk. Furthermore we find
that the observed radio continuum emission most likely comes from two sources
in close proximity to each other. One source is an unobscured massive star with
an extended HII region that is responsible for the peak in the radio continuum
emission. A second source is embedded and centered on the elongation in the
radio continuum emission that is believed to be tracing an outflow in this
region.
