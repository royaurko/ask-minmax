We present detailed Monte Carlo results for the two-dimensional melting
transition of various systems up to N=65536 hard disks. The simulations are
performed in the NVT ensemble, using a new updating scheme. In the isotropic
phase the bond orientational correlation length xi_6 and the susceptibility
chi_6 are measured and compared with the predictions of the
Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory. From the scaling
relation of xi_6 and chi_6 we calculate the critical exponent eta_6. In the
phase transition region we use finite-size scaling methods to locate the
disclination binding transition point and compare the results with the values
obtained from the behaviour in the isotropic phase. Additionally, we measure
the topological defect density, the pressure and the distribution of the second
moment of the local bond orientational order parameter. All results are in good
agreement with the KTHNY theory, while a first-order phase transition with
small correlation length and a one-stage continuous transition can be ruled
out.
