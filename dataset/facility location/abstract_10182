The three-dimensional four-fermion model with a Z_2 chiral symmetry and N=4
fermion species in the system is investigated numerically at non-zero
temparature and chemical potential. The phase diagram in the (chemical
potential, temperature) plane is mapped out quantitatively. A detailed finite
size scaling analysis shows that the zero temperature and non-zero chemical
potential chiral phase transition is first order, whereas the non-zero
temperature and non-zero chemical potential transition remains second order
down to very low temperatures. Quantitative results for the location of the end
of the first order line are given. The simulations at T=0 provided no evidence
for a nuclear liquid-gas transition.
