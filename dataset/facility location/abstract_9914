We study a tight binding model including both on site disorder and coupling
of the electrons to randomly oriented magnetic moments. The transport
properties are calculated via the Kubo-Greenwood scheme, using the exact
eigenstates of the disordered system and large system size extrapolation of the
low frequency optical conductivity. We first benchmark our method in the model
with only structural disorder and then use it to map out the transport regimes
and metal- insulator transitions in problems involving (i) scattering from
random magnetic moments, and (ii) the combined effect of structural disorder
and magnetic scattering. We completely map out the dependence of the d.c
conductivity on electron density (n) the structural disorder (\Delta) and the
magnetic coupling (J'), and locate the insulator-metal phase boundary in the
space of n-\Delta-J'. These results serve as a reference for understanding
transport in systems ranging from magnetic semiconductors to double exchange
`colossal magnetoresistance' systems. A brief version of this study appears in
our earlier paper Europhys. Lett. vol 65, 75 (2004).
