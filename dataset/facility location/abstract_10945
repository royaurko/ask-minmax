We predict the existence and address the stability of two-dimensional surface
solitons featuring topologically complex shapes, including dipoles, vortices,
and bound states of vortex solitons, at the interface of nonlocal thermal
media. Unlike their counterparts in bulk media, surface dipoles are found to be
stable in the entire existence domain. Surface vortices are found to exhibit
strongly asymmetric intensity and phase distributions, and are shown to be
stable, too. Bound states of surface vortex solitons belong to a novel class of
surface solitons having no counterparts in bulk media. Such states are found to
be stable provided that their energy flow does not exceed an upper threshold.
Our findings constitute the first known example of topologically complex
solitons located at nonlocal two-dimensional interfaces.
