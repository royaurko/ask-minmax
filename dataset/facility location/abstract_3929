Neutron capture cross sections of unstable isotopes are important for
neutron-induced nucleosynthesis as well as for technological applications. A
combination of a radioactive beam facility, an ion storage ring and a high flux
reactor would allow a direct measurement of neutron induced reactions over a
wide energy range on isotopes with half lives down to minutes. The idea is to
measure neutron-induced reactions on radioactive ions in inverse kinematics.
This means, the radioactive ions will pass through a neutron target. In order
to efficiently use the rare nuclides as well as to enhance the luminosity, the
exotic nuclides can be stored in an ion storage ring. The neutron target can be
the core of a research reactor, where one of the central fuel elements is
replaced by the evacuated beam pipe of the storage ring. Using particle
detectors and Schottky spectroscopy, most of the important neutron-induced
reactions, such as (n,$\gamma$), (n,p), (n,$\alpha$), (n,2n), or (n,f), could
be investigated.
