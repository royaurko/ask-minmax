We present an orbifold compactification of the minimal seven dimensional
supergravity. The vacuum is a slice of AdS_7 where six-branes of opposite
tension are located at the orbifold fixed points. The cancellation of gauge and
gravitational anomalies restricts the gauge group and matter content on the
boundaries. In addition anomaly cancellation fixes the boundary gauge couplings
in terms of the gravitational constant, and the mass parameter of the
Chern-Simons term.
