Based on the joint-observations of the radio broadband spectral emissions of
solar eclipse on August 1, 2008 at Jiuquan (total eclipse) and Huairou (partial
eclipse) at the frequencies of 2.00 -- 5.60 GHz (Jiuquan), 2.60 -- 3.80 GHZ
(Chinese solar broadband radiospectrometer, SBRS/Huairou), and 5.20 -- 7.60 GHz
(SBRS/Huairou), the contributors assemble a successive series of broadband spectrum
with a frequency of 2.60 -- 7.60 GHz to observe the solar eclipse
synchronously. This is the first attempt to analyze the solar eclipse radio
emission under the two telescopes located at different places with broadband
frequencies in the periods of total and partial eclipse. With these analyses,
the contributors made a new semiempirical model of the coronal plasma density of the
quiet Sun and made a comparison with the classic models.
