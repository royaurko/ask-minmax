The High Intensity Heavy-Ion Accelerator Facility is a new project in the
Institute of Modern Physics. The dipole magnets of all rings are conceived as
fast cycled superconducting magnet with high magnetic field and large gap, the
warm iron and superconducting coil structure (superferric) is adopted. The
reasonable structure design of coil and cryostat is very important for reliable
operation. Based on the finite element software ANSYS, the mechanical analysis
of electromagnetic stress, the thermal stress in the cooling down and the
stress in the pumping are showed in detail. According to the analysis result,
the supporter structure is the key problem of coil system. With reasonable
support's structure design, the stress and the deformation of coil structure
can be reduced effectively, which ensure the stable operation of
superconducting coil system.
