This paper describes an original experimental procedure to measure the
mechanical interaction between the tongue and teeth and palate during speech
production. It consists in using edentulous people as subjects and to insert
pressure sensors in the structure of their complete dental prosthesis. Hence,
there is no perturbation of the vocal tract cavity due to the sensors
themselves. Several duplicates are used with transducers situated at different
locations of the complete denture according to palatography's results, in order
to carefully analyze the production of specific sounds such as stop
consonants.. It is also possible to measure the contact pressure at different
locations on the palate for the same sound.
