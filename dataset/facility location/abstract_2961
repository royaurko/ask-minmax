Strong interaction of closely located, nearly parallel hydraulic fractures
and its influence on their propagation are studied. Both computational and
physical aspects of the problem are considered. It is shown that from the
computational point of view, when a distance between cracks is small as
compared with their sizes, the system becomes ill-conditioned and numerical
results deteriorate. The physical consequence of the interaction consists in
decreasing of the crack opening and even greater decrease of conductivity. Then
the resistance to fluid flow grows what results in the propagation of only
those fractures, the distance between which is large enough.
  The research aims to suggests a means to overcome the computational
difficulty and to improve numerical simulation of hydraulic fractures in
shales. Numerical experiments are carried out for a 2D problem by using the
complex variable hypersingular boundary element method of higher order
accuracy. The condition number of the main matrix of a system, the opening of
cracks, the stress intensity factors, effective conductivity and resistance of
a cluster are calculated and analysed. The results imply that to avoid
computational instability, it is possible to replace a cluster of cracks by a
single properly located crack. The results also evidently confirm that the
propagation of distant individual fractures rather than of an array of closely
located cracks is to be expected in practice, what agrees with observations.
