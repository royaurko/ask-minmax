The validity of Hubble's law defies the determination of the center of the
big bang expansion, even if it exists. Every point in the expanding universe
looks like the center from which the rest of the universe flies away. In this
article, the contributor shows that the distribution of apparently circular galaxies
is not uniform in the sky and that there exists a special direction in the
universe in our neighborhood. The data is consistent with the assumption that
the tidal force due to the mass distribution around the universe center causes
the deformation of galactic shapes depending on its orientation and location
relative to the center and our galaxy. The location of the center is estimated
to be at a distance ~0.88/h Gpc in the direction of l=135 +/- 30 degrrs and b =
-35 +/- 20 degrees in galactic coordinates (alpha = 01h 36m, delta = +26d 50m
in equatorial J2000.0 or in the direction of the Constellation Pisces). Further
study of the deformation of galaxies such as triaxial galaxies and
non-axisymmetric spiral galaxies can be utilized for a more accurate
determination of the universe center.
