Superconducting mechanism mediated by interband exchange Coulomb repulsion is
examined in an extended two-band Hubbard models with a wide band crossing the
Fermi level and coexisting with a narrower band located at moderately lower
energy. We apply newly developed path-integral renormalization group method to
reliably calculate pairing correlations. The correlation shows marked
enhancement at moderate amplitudes of the exchange Coulomb repulsion taken
smaller than the on-site repulsion for the narrower band. The pairing symmetry
is s-wave while it has unconventional phases with the opposite sign between the
order parameters on the two bands, in agreement with the mean-field prediction.
Since the band structure of recently discovered superconductor MgB$_2$ shares
basic similarities with our model, we propose that the present results provide
a relevant clue for the understanding of the superconducting mechanism in
MgB$_2$ as well as in this class of multi-band materials with good metallic
conduction in the normal state.
