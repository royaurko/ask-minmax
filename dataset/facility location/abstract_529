Diffraction Anomalous Fine Structure (DAFS) spectroscopy uses resonant
elastic x-rays scattering as an atomic, shell and site selective probe that
gives information on the electronic structure and the local atomic environment
as well as on the long range ordered crystallographic structure. A DAFS
experiment consists of measuring the Bragg peak intensities as a function of
the energy of the incoming x-ray beam. The French CRG (Collaborative Research
Group) beamline BM2-D2AM (Diffraction Diffusion Anomale Multi-longueurs d'onde)
at the ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility) has developed a state of
the art energy scan diffraction set-up. In this article, we present the
requirements for obtaining reliable DAFS data and report recent technical
achievements.
