In the models of brane construction, the isometry of a compactified space
might be broken by branes. In four-dimensional effective Lagrangian, the
breaking of the isometry is seen as the spontaneous breaking of the
corresponding effective symmetry. Then it seems natural to expect that there
are various kinds of defects that will be implemented by the spontaneous
symmetry breaking. These defects are parametrized by the brane positions. In
this paper we consider two kinds of such ``brane defects'', which are formed by
the local fluctuations of the locations of branes along their transversal
directions. The fluctuation of a brane position might leads to winding (or
wraping) around a non-contractible circle of the compactified space. These
``primary'' brane defects are already discussed by several contributors. On the
other hand, if there are multiple branes in the compactified space and their
configuration in a compactified space is determined by the potential that
depends only on their relative positions, one might find incidental symmetry in
the effective potential, which is spontaneously broken by branes. We examined
the latter ``incidental'' symmetry breakings and stable defect configurations.
We paid special attention to the difference between ``primary'' brane defects.
