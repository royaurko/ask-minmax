Knowledge creation and dissemination in science and technology systems is
perceived as a prerequisite for socio-economic development. The efficiency of
creating new knowledge is considered to have a geographical component, i.e.
some regions are more capable in scientific knowledge production than others.
This article shows a method to use a network representation of scientific
interaction to assess the relative efficiency of regions with diverse
boundaries in channeling knowledge through a science system. In a first step, a
weighted aggregate of the betweenness centrality is produced from empirical
data (aggregation). The subsequent randomization of this empirical network
produces the necessary Null-model for significance testing and normalization
(randomization). This step is repeated to yield higher confidence about the
results (re-sampling). The results are robust estimates for the relative
regional efficiency to broker knowledge, which is discussed along with
cross-sectional and longitudinal empirical examples. The network representation
acts as a straight-forward metaphor of conceptual ideas from economic geography
and neighboring disciplines. However, the procedure is not limited to
centrality measures, nor is it limited to spatial aggregates. Therefore, it
offers a wide range of application for scientometrics and beyond.
