We report millimeter observations of the line of sight to the recently
discovered Soft Gamma Repeater, SGR 1627-41, which has been tentatively
associated with the supernova remnant SNR G337.0-0.1 Among the eight molecular
clouds along the line of sight to SGR 1627-41, we show that SNR G337.0-0.1 is
probably interacting with one of the most massive giant molecular clouds (GMC)
in the Galaxy, at a distance of 11 kpc from the sun. Based on the high
extinction to the persistent X-ray counterpart of SGR 1627-41, we present
evidence for an association of this new SGR with the SNR G337.0-0.1; they both
appear to be located on the near side of the GMC. This is the second SGR
located near an extraordinarily massive GMC. We suggest that SGR 1627-41 is a
neutron star with a high transverse velocity (~ 1,000 \kms) escaping the young
(~ 5,000 years) supernova remnant G337.0-0.1
