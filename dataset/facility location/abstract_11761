A new exact solution of Euler equations (rigid body dynamics) is presented
here.
  All the components of angular velocity of rigid body for such a solution
differ from both the cases of symmetric rigid rotor (which has two equal
moments of inertia: Lagrange or Kovalevskaya case), and from the Euler case
when all the applied torques are zero, or from other well-known particular
cases.
  The key features are the next: - the center of masses of rigid body is
assumed to be located at meridional plane along the main principal axis of
inertia of rigid body, - besides, the principal moments of inertia are assumed
to satisfy to a simple algebraic equality. Also there is a restriction at
choosing of initial conditions.
  Such a solution is also proved to satisfy to Euler-Poinsot equations,
including invariants of motion and additional Euler invariant (square of the
vector of angular momentum is a constant). So, such a solution is a
generalization of Euler case.
