The Infrared Spectrograph (IRS)is one of the three instruments on board the
Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) to be launched in December 2001. The
IRS will provide high resolution spectra R~600 from 10--37microns and low
resolution spectra R~60 from 5.3--40microns Its high sensitivity and ``spectral
mapping-mode'' make it a powerful instrument for observing both faint
point-like and extended sources.
