We present the results of high-resolution 13CO(1-0) mapping observations with
the NRO 45m telescope of the area toward the southern bright arm region of M51,
including the galactic center. The obtained map shows the central depression of
the the circumnuclear ring and the spiral arm structure.The arm-to-interarm
ratio of the 13CO(1-0) integrated intensity is 2-4. We also have found a
feature different from that found in the 12CO results. The 12CO/13CO ratio
spatially varies, and shows high values (~20) for the interarm and the central
region, but low values(~10) for the arm. These indicate that there is a denser
gas in the spiral arm than in the interarm. The distribution of the 13CO shows
a better correspondence with that of the H\alpha emission than with the 12CO in
the disk region, except for the central region. We found that the 13CO emission
is located on the downstream side of the 12CO arm, namely there is an offset
between the 12CO and the 13CO as well as the H\alpha emission. This suggests
that there is a time delay between the accumulation of gas caused by the
density wave and dense gas formation, accordingly star formation. This time
delay is estimated to be ~10^7 yr based on the assumption of galactic rotation
derived by the rotation curve and the pattern speed of M51. It is similar to
the growth timescale of a gravitational instability in the spiral arm of M51,
suggesting that the gravitational instability plays an important role for dense
gas formation.
