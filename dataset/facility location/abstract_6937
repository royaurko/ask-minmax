Based on a published catalog of 355 quasars with significant optical linear
polarization, it is shown here that the distribution of polarization directions
is skewed, preferentially toward one location in the sky and away from a
second. To show this, we calculate the average polarization angle as a function
of position. The function makes a clean quadrupole on the sky offering the
opportunity to apply multipoles including their spherical harmonic, Maxwell
vector and symmetric tensor representations. The evidence suggests that
observed polarization directions of optical quasars are not independent over
very large angular scales, thereby confirming similar conclusions by others.
