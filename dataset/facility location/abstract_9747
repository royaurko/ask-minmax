In the previous paper, it was shown that holes doped into BaBiO3 self-trap as
small polarons and bipolarons. These point defects are energetically favorable
partly because they undo locally the strain in the charge-density-wave (Peierls
insulator) ground state. In this paper the neutral excitations of the same
model are discussed. The lowest electronic excitation is predicted to be a
self-trapped exciton, consisting of an electron and a hole located on adjacent
Bi atoms. This excitation has been seen experimentally (but not identified as
such) via the Urbach tail in optical absorption, and the multi-phonon spectrum
of the ``breathing mode'' seen in Raman scattering. These two phenomena occur
because of the Franck-Condon effect associated with oxygen displacement in the
excited state.
