We propose a collective stringlike model of pentaquarks with the geometry of
an equilateral tetrahedron in which the four quarks are located at the four
corners and the antiquark in its center. The nonplanar equilibrium
configuration is a consequence of the permutation symmetry of the four quarks.
In an application to the spectrum of exotic Theta baryons, we find that the
ground state pentaquark has angular momentum and parity J(p)=1/2(-) and a small
magnetic moment of 0.382 nuclear magnetons. The decay width is suppressed by
the spatial overlap with the decay products.
