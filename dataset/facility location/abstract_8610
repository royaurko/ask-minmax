This paper presents 19 additional candidate clusters detected using the
galaxy catalog extracted from the I-band images taken for the ESO Imaging
Survey (EIS). The candidates are found over a region of 1.1 square degrees,
located near the South Galactic Pole. Combined with the sample reported
earlier, the number of candidates in the Southern Galactic Cap is now 54 over a
total area of 3.6 square degrees. Images in V band are also available over 2.7
square degrees, and galaxy catalogs extracted from them over a uniform area of
2 square degrees have been used to further explore the reality of the I cluster
candidates. Nearly all the I candidates with estimated redshifts <~ 0.5 are
also identified in V. At higher redshifts, only rich candidates are detected in
both bands.
