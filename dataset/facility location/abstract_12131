We report a trigonometric parallax of 12 GHz methanol masers associated with
the massive star forming region G9.62+0.20, corresponding to a distance of
5.2+-0.6 kpc. With a local standard of rest velocity of about 2 km/s, the
region's kinematic distances of 0.5 and 16 kpc differ greatly from the distance
derived here. Our measurement of the peculiar motion of the star forming region
shows a very large deviation from a circular Galactic orbit: 41 km/s radially
outward from the Galactic center and 60 km/s counter to Galactic rotation. The
combination of its radial velocity and distance places G9.62+0.20 in the inner
region of the Galaxy close to the Expanding Near 3 kpc-Arm, where the bulge/bar
potential has strong gravitational influence. We also map the distribution of
12 GHz methanol masers, locate them with respect to a hypercompact H II region,
and compare our data with the periodic flare phenomenon reported previously for
this source.
