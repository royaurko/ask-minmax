Evidence of a mis-aligned secondary bar, within the primary bar of the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is presented. The density distribution and the
de-reddened mean magnitudes ($I_0$) of the red clump stars in the bar obtained
from the OGLE II data are used for this study. The bar region which
predominantly showed wavy pattern in the line of sight in \citet{a03} was
located. These points in the X-Z plane delineate an S-shaped pattern, clearly
indicating a mis-aligned bar. This feature is statistically significant and
does not depend on the considered value of $I_0$ for the LMC center. The rest
of the bar region were not found to show the warp or the wavy pattern. The
secondary bar is found to be considerably elongated in the Z-direction, with an
inclination of 66$^o$.5 $\pm$ 0$^o$.9, whereas the undisturbed part of the
primary bar is found to have an inclination of 15$^o$.1 $\pm$ 2$^o$.7, such
that the eastern sides are closer to us with respect to the western sides of
both the bars. The PA$_{maj}$ of the secondary bar is found to be 108$^o$.4
$\pm$ 7$^o$.3. The streaming motions found in the H I velocity map close to the
LMC center could be caused by the secondary bar. The recent star formation and
the gas distribution in LMC could be driven by the mis-aligned secondary bar.
