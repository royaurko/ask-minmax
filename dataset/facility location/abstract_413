This paper describes a new model for sharing location info for mobile users.
This approach can operate without the need for disclosing identity info to
third party servers. It could be described as a safe location sharing model.
The proposed approach creates a special form of distributed database that
splits location info and identity information. In this distributed data store
identity info is always saved locally. It eliminates one of the main concerns
with location-based systems - privacy. This paper describes a model itself as
well as its implementation in the form of HTML5 mobile web application.
