We discuss a gauge choice which allows us to avoid the introduction of
artificial timelike outer boundaries in numerical studies of test fields based
on a 3+1 decomposition of asymptotically flat background spacetimes. The main
idea is to include null infinity in the computational domain by conformally
compactifying the metric on hyperboloidal foliations and fixing the spatial
coordinate location of null infinity, i.e. scri-fixing. We construct such
coordinates explicitly on Minkowski, Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes.
