In very intense electromagnetic fields, the vacuum refractive index is
expected to be modified due to non linear QED properties. Up to now, these
predictions are tested by searching phase shifts in the propagation of
polarized light through uniform magnetic fields. We propose a new approach
which consists in producing a vacuum index gradient and send a light beam
trough it in order to detect its angular deviation. The vacuum index gradient,
similar to a "prismatic vacuum", is created by the interaction of two very
intense and ultra short laser pulses, used as pump pulses. At the maximum of
the index gradient, the deflection angle of the probe pulse is estimated to be
$2 \ 10^{-13} \times (\frac{w_0}{10 \mu\mathrm{m}})^{-3} \times \frac{I}{1
\mathrm{J}}$ radians, where $I$ is the total energy of the two pump pulses and
$w_0$ is the minimum waist (fwhm) at the interaction area of the two pump
pulses. Assuming the most intense laser pulses attainable by the LASERIX
facility ($I = 25$ J, 30 fs fwhm duration, 800 nm central wavelength) and
assuming a minimum waist of $w=10 \mu\mathrm{m}$ (fwhm) (corresponding to an
intensity of the order of $10^{21}$ W/cm$^2$), the expected deflection angle is
about $5 \ 10^{-12}$ radians at the maximum of the index gradient. We propose
to measure it with a Sagnac interferometer.
