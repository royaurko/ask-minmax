The availability of precisely determined frequencies of radial and non-radial
oscillation modes in red giants is finally paving the way for detailed studies
of the internal structure of these stars. We look for the seismic signature of
regions of sharp structure variation in the internal structure of the CoRoT
target HR7349. We analyse the frequency dependence of the large frequency
separation and second frequency differences, as well as the behaviour of the
large frequency separation obtained with the envelope auto-correlation
function. We find evidence for a periodic component in the oscillation
frequencies, i.e. the seismic signature of a sharp structure variation in
HR7349. In a comparison with stellar models we interpret this feature as caused
by a local depression of the sound speed that occurs in the helium
second-ionization region. Using solely seismic constraints this allows us to
estimate the mass (M=1.2^{+0.6}_{-0.4} Msun) and radius (R=12.2^{+2.1}_{-1.8}
Rsun) of HR7349, which agrees with the location of the star in an HR diagram.
