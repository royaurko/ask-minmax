We propose an experiment with two coupled microwave cavities and a
"tunneling" photon observed by the passage of Rydberg atoms. We model the
coupled cavities as in Ref. \cite{art1} and include dissipative effects as well
as limited detection efficiency. We also consider realistic finite atom-field
interaction times and provide for a simple analytical expression for the photon
"tunneling" probability including all these effects. We show that for
sufficiently small dissipation constants the effect can be observed with
current experimental facilities.
