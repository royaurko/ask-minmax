We present a catalogue of 107 point-like X-ray sources derived from a
systematic analysis of all the ROSAT PSPC observations of the galactic center
region performed in 1992-1993. Besides SgrA*, the massive black hole at the
galactic center, 41 X-ray sources have been positionally associated with
already classified objects. Twenty are identified with foreground stars and
five with known Low Mass X-ray Binaries. The majority of the sources in our
catalogue still remains unidentified. They are hard and/or severely absorbed
and probably represent a large population of X-ray binaries located in the
galactic center region, accreting at low accretion rates, and still largely
unknown.
