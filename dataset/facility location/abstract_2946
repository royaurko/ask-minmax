The growing evidence for short-baseline neutrino oscillations and the
possible existence of sterile neutrinos necessitates the development of a
cost-effective experiment that can resolve these mysteries. The OscSNS \cite{1}
experiment, located at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge
Laboratory, is ideal for this purpose.
