High quality electron beams with flat distributions in both energy and
current are critical for many accelerator-based scientific facilities such as
free-electron lasers and MeV ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopes. In
this Letter we report on using corrugated structures to compensate for the beam
nonlinear energy chirp imprinted by the curvature of the radio-frequency field,
leading to a significant reduction in beam energy spread. By using a pair of
corrugated structures with orthogonal orientations, we show that the quadrupole
wake fields which otherwise increase beam emittance can be effectively
canceled. This work also extends the applications of corrugated structures to
the low beam charge (a few pC) and low beam energy (a few MeV) regime and may
have a strong impact in many accelerator-based facilities.
