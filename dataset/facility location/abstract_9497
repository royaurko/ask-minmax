We identify `red clump stars' - core helium-burning giants - among 2MASS
stars and use them to measure the run of reddening with distance in the
direction of each of the Galactic Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXP). We combine
this with extinction estimates from X-ray spectroscopy to infer distances and
find that the locations of all AXP are consistent with being in Galactic spiral
arms. We also find that the 2-10 keV luminosities implied by our distances are
remarkably similar for all AXPs, being all around 1.3e35 erg s-1. Furthermore,
using our distances to estimate effective black-body emitting radii, we find
that the radii are tightly anti-correlated with pulsed fraction, and somewhat
less tightly anti-correlated with black-body temperature. We find no obvious
relationship of any property with the dipole magnetic field strength inferred
from the spin-down rate.
