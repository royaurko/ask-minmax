The BTeV experiment is a b-physics experiment designed to conduct precision
tests of the CKM description of CP violation and study rare processes involving
bottom and charm hadrons. The experiment will be located in the C0 interaction
region at the Fermilab Tevatron, and is intended to begin data-taking around
2007-2008. One of the most important elements of the BTeV spectrometer is the
ring-imaging Cerenkov detector (RICH) which is used for particle
identification. In this article we describe the BTeV RICH and present its
expected performance.
