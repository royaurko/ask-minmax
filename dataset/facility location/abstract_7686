We investigate the influence of close neighbor galaxies on the properties of
supernovae (SNe) and their host galaxies using 56 SNe located in pairs of
galaxies with different levels of star formation (SF) and nuclear activity. The
statistical study of SN hosts shows that there is no significant difference
between morphologies of hosts in our sample and the larger general sample of SN
hosts in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8 (DR8). The mean
distance of type II SNe from nuclei of hosts is greater by about a factor of 2
than that of type Ibc SNe. The distributions and mean distances of SNe are
consistent with previous results compiled with the larger sample. For the first
time it is shown that SNe Ibc are located in pairs with significantly smaller
difference of radial velocities between components than pairs containing SNe Ia
and II. We consider this as a result of higher star formation rate (SFR) of
these closer systems of galaxies. SN types are not correlated with the
luminosity ratio of host and neighbor galaxies in pairs. The orientation of SNe
with respect to the preferred direction toward neighbor galaxy is found to be
isotropic and independent of kinematical properties of the galaxy pair.
