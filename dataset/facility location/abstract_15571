The electronic band structure of GaTe has been calculated by numerical atomic
orbitals density-functional theory, in the local density approximation. In
addition, the valence-band dispersion along various directions of the GaTe
Brillouin zone has been determined experimentally by angle-resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy. Along these directions, the calculated valence-band
structure is in good concordance with the valence-band dispersion obtained by
these measurements. It has been established that GaTe is a direct-gap
semiconductor with the band gap located at the Z point, that is, at Brillouin
zone border in the direction perpendicular to the layers. The valence-band
maximum shows a marked \textit{p}-like behavior, with a pronounced anion
contribution. The conduction band minimum arises from states with a comparable
\textit{s}- \textit{p}-cation and \textit{p}-anion orbital contribution.
Spin-orbit interaction appears to specially alter dispersion and binding energy
of states of the topmost valence bands lying at $\Gamma$. By spin-orbit, it is
favored hybridization of the topmost \textit{p}$_z$-valence band with deeper
and flatter \textit{p$_x$}-\textit{p$_y$} bands and the valence-band minimum at
$\Gamma$ is raised towards the Fermi level since it appears to be determined by
the shifted up \textit{p$_x$}-\textit{p$_y$} bands.
