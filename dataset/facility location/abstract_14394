The initial location of data in DRAMs is determined and controlled by the
'address-mapping' and even modern memory controllers use a fixed and
run-time-agnostic address mapping. On the other hand, the memory access pattern
seen at the memory interface level will dynamically change at run-time. This
dynamic nature of memory access pattern and the fixed behavior of address
mapping process in DRAM controllers, implied by using a fixed address mapping
scheme, means that DRAM performance cannot be exploited efficiently. DReAM is a
novel hardware technique that can detect a workload-specific address mapping at
run-time based on the application access pattern which improves the performance
of DRAMs. The experimental results show that DReAM outperforms the best
evaluated address mapping on average by 9%, for mapping-sensitive workloads, by
2% for mapping-insensitive workloads, and up to 28% across all the workloads.
DReAM can be seen as an insurance policy capable of detecting which scenarios
are not well served by the predefined address mapping.
