A set $D$ of vertices of a graph $G$ is locating every two distinct vertices
outside $D$ have distinct neighbors in $D$, that is, for distinct vertices $u$
and $v$ outside $D$, $N(u) \cap D \ne N(v) \cap D$ where $N(u)$ denotes the
open neighborhood of $u$. If $D$ is also a dominating set (total dominating
set), it is called a locating-dominating set (respectively, locating-total
dominating set) of $G$. A graph $G$ is twin-free if every two distinct vertices
of $G$ have distinct open and closed neighborhoods. It is conjectured [D.

Locating-total dominating sets in twin-free graphs, manuscript] respectively,
that any twin-free graph $G$ without isolated vertices has a
locating-dominating set of size at most one-half its order and a locating-total
dominating set of size at most two-thirds its order. In this paper, we prove
these two conjectures for the class of line graphs. Both bounds are tight for
this class, in the sense that there are infinitely many connected line graphs
for which equality holds in the bounds.
