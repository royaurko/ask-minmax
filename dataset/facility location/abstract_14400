We introduce an Expanded Parts Model (EPM) for recognizing human attributes
(e.g. young, short hair, wearing suit) and actions (e.g. running, jumping) in
still images. An EPM is a collection of part templates which are learnt
discriminatively to explain specific scale-space regions in the images (in
human centric coordinates). This is in contrast to current models which consist
of a relatively few (i.e. a mixture of) 'average' templates. EPM uses only a
subset of the parts to score an image and scores the image sparsely in space,
i.e. it ignores redundant and random background in an image. To learn our
model, we propose an algorithm which automatically mines parts and learns
corresponding discriminative templates together with their respective locations
from a large number of candidate parts. We validate our method on three recent
challenging datasets of human attributes and actions. We obtain convincing
qualitative and state-of-the-art quantitative results on the three datasets.
