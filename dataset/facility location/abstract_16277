The spatial distribution of stars in the nearby S0 galaxy NGC 5102 is
investigated using images obtained with WIRCam and MegaCam on the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. With the exception of gaps between detector
elements, the entire galaxy is surveyed in r' and i', while the J and Ks data
extend out to 6 kpc (7 disk scale lengths). A modest population of main
sequence (MS) stars with M_V < -3.5 and ages 70 Myr are detected throughout the
disk, with the majority located in the southern half of the galaxy. The ratio
of C stars to bright M giants is consistent with an overall increase in the
star formation rate within the past 1 Gyr. Star-forming activity during the
interval 0.1 - 2 Gyr was more centrally concentrated than during the past 100
Myr. The structure of the disk changes near 5 kpc (5.5 disk scale lengths).
RSGs and bright AGB stars are traced out to a radius of 14 kpc (15.6 scale
lengths) along the southern portion of the major axis, while a tentative
detection is also made of bright AGB stars at a projected distance of 16 kpc
along the south east minor axis. A large clump of AGB stars that subtends an
arcmin is identified to the west of the galaxy center. It is argued that this
is the remnant of a companion galaxy that triggered past episodes of elevated
star-forming activity.
