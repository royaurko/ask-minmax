Alfven waves have been invoked as an important mechanism of particle
acceleration in stellar winds of cool stars. After their identification in the
solar wind they started to be studied in winds of stars located in different
regions of the HR diagram. We discuss here some characteristics of these waves
and we present a direct application in the acceleration of late-type stellar
winds.
