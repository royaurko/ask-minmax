We modify the first ISS model (hep-th/0602239) by gauging a diagonal flavour
symmetry. We add additional multiplets transforming as fundamentals and
anti-fundamentals under the gauged flavour group. Their number is chosen such
that the microscopic theory is asymptotically free whereas in the Seiberg dual
(w.r.t. the colour group) it changes to an infrared free theory. Non
perturbative effects within the flavour group can correct the location of the
supersymmetric vacuum. Statements about meta-stability of the susy breaking
vacuum would require a two loop calculation. For general couplings, the
question whether gauging flavour destabilises susy breaking remains open.
