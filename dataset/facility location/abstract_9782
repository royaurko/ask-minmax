We study the correlations of classical hardcore dimer models doped with
monomers by Monte Carlo simulation. We introduce an efficient cluster
algorithm, which is applicable in any dimension, for different lattices and
arbitrary doping. We use this algorithm for the dimer model on the square
lattice, where a finite density of monomers destroys the critical confinement
of the two-monomer problem. The monomers form a two-component plasma located in
its high-temperature phase, with the Coulomb interaction screened at finite
densities. On the triangular lattice, a single pair of monomers is not
confined. The monomer correlations are extremely short-ranged and hardly change
with doping.
