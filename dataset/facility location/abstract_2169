CHR is a very versatile programming language that allows programmers to
declaratively specify constraint solvers. An important part of the development
of such solvers is in their testing and debugging phases. Current CHR
implementations support those phases by offering tracing facilities with
limited information. In this report, we propose a new trace for CHR which
contains enough information to analyze any aspects of \CHRv\ execution at some
useful abstract level, common to several implementations. %a large family of
rule based solvers. This approach is based on the idea of generic trace. Such a
trace is formally defined as an extension of the $\omega_r^\lor$ semantics of
CHR. We show that it can be derived form the SWI Prolog CHR trace.
