A novel precision polarimeter will go a long way in satisfying the
requirements of the precision experiments being planned for a future facility
such as the Electron Ion Collider. A polarimeter based on the asymmetry in the
spacial distribution of the spin light component of synchrotron radiation will
make for a fine addition to the existing-conventional M{\o}ller and Compton
polarimeters. The spin light polarimeter consists of a set of wriggler magnet
along the beam that generate synchrotron radiation. The spacial distribution of
synchrotron radiation will be measured by an ionization chamber after being
collimated. The up-down spacial asymmetry in the transverse plane is used to
quantify the polarization of the beam. As a part of the design process,
firstly, a rough calculation was drawn out to establish the validity of such an
idea. Secondly, the fringe fields of the wriggler magnet was simulated using a
2-D magnetic field simulation toolkit called Poisson Superfish, which is
maintained by Los Alamos National Laboratory. This was used to account for beam
motion effects and the corresponding correlations were show to be negligible.
Lastly, a full fledged GEANT-4 simulation was built to study the response time
of the ionization chamber. This GEANT-4 simulation was analyzed for variety of
effects that may hinder precision polarimetry. It was found that a Spin-Light
Polarimeter would be a fine relative polarimeter.
