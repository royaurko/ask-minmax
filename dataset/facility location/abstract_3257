Gemini Observatory's northern and southern telescopes are both presently
being outfitted with facility mid-infrared imagers/spectrometers. This will
allow observers the unique opportunity to apply to one observatory for all-sky
spectroscopic access in the mid-infrared with the light gathering power of
8-meter telescopes. Gemini South has recently commissioned the Thermal-Region
Camera and Spectrograph (T-ReCS) and is now available to perform queue
observations for the community. T-ReCS is capable of low-resolution long-slit
spectroscopy of R~100 near 10 and 20 um, and medium-resolution long-slit
spectroscopy of R~1000 near 10 um. Gemini North is presently commissioning
Michelle, which will be capable of low-, medium-, and high-resolution long-slit
spectroscopy of R~200, 1000, and 3000, respectively, near 10 um, as well as
low-resolution long-slit spectroscopy of R~200 near 20 um. Michelle can also
perform echelle spectroscopy of R~30000 at 10 and 20 um. The low-, medium-, and
high-resolution spectroscopic modes of Michelle will be available to the public
for the fall semester of 2004, and the echelle mode is expected to be available
in 2005.
