We present a comparative study of the excitations in bulk and liquid D2
confined within the pores of MCM-41. The material (Mobile Crystalline
Material-41) is a silicate obtained by means of a template that yields a
partially crystalline structure composed by arrays of nonintersecting hexagonal
channels of controlled width having walls made of amorphous SiO2. Its porosity
was characterized by means of adsorption isotherms and found to be composed by
a regular array of pores having a narrow distribution of sizes with a most
probable value of 2.45 nm. The assessment of the precise location of the sample
within the pores is carried out by means of pressure isotherms. The study was
conducted at two pressures which correspond to pore fillings above the
capillary condensation regime. Within the range of wave vectors where
collective excitations can be followed up (0.3<Q<3.0 $\AA$&#8722;1), we found
confinement brings forward a large shortening of the excitation lifetimes that
shifts the characteristic frequencies to higher energies. In addition, the
coherent quasielastic scattering shows signatures of reduced diffusivity.
