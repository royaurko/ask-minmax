Triangular arrays of Ni nanotriangles embedded in superconducting Nb films
exhibit unexpected dynamical vortex effects. Collective pinning with a vortex
lattice configuration different from the expected fundamental triangular
"Abrikosov state" is found. The vortex motion which prevails against the
triangular periodic potential is produced by channelling effects between
triangles. Interstitial vortices coexisting with pinned vortices in this
asymmetric potential, lead to ratchet reversal, i.e. a DC output voltage which
changes sign with the amplitude of an applied alternating drive current. In
this landscape, ratchet reversal is always observed at all magnetic fields (all
numbers of vortices) and at different temperatures. The ratchet reversal is
unambiguously connected to the presence of two locations for the vortices:
interstitial and above the artificial pinning sites.
