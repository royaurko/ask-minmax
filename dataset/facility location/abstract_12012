Based on Cumulative Number of Confirmed Human Cases of Avian Influenza (H5N1)
Reported to World Health Organization (WHO) in the 2011 from 15 countries,
Indonesia has the largest number death because Avian Influenza which 146
deaths. In this research, the researcher built an Avian Influenza (H5N1) Expert
System for identifying avian influenza disease and displaying the result of
identification process. In this paper, we describe five symptoms as major
symptoms which include depression, combs, wattle, bluish face region, swollen
face region, narrowness of eyes, and balance disorders. We use chicken as
research object. Research location is in the Lampung Province, South Sumatera.
The researcher reason to choose Lampung Province in South Sumatera on the basis
that has a high poultry population. Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the
degree of belief as inference engine in expert system, our approach uses
Dempster-Shafer theory to combine beliefs under conditions of uncertainty and
ignorance, and allows quantitative measurement of the belief and plausibility
in our identification result. The result reveal that Avian Influenza (H5N1)
Expert System has successfully identified the existence of avian influenza and
displaying the result of identification process.
