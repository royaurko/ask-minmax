We characterize the small and large scale environment of the young star V1331
Cygni with high resolution HST/WFPC2 and Digitized Sky Survey images. In
addition to a previously known outer dust ring (~30'' in diameter), the
HST/WFPC2 scattered light image reveals an inner dust ring for the first time.
This ring has a maximum radius of 6.5'' and is possibly related to a molecular
envelope. Large-scale optical images show that V1331 Cyg is located at the tip
of a long dust filament linking it to the dark cloud LDN 981. We discuss the
origin of the observed dust morphology and analyze the object's relation to its
parent dark cloud LDN 981. Finally, based on recent results from the
literature, we investigate the properties of V1331 Cyg and conclude that in its
current state the object does not show suffcient evidence to be characterized
as an FU Ori object.
