Proposed low energy beta beam facilities would be capable of producing
intense beams of neutrinos (anti-neutrinos) with well defined spectra. We
present analytic expressions and numerical results which accurately show how
the total neutrino flux reaching the detector depends on the geometry of the
source and the detector. Several contributors have proposed measurements which
require using different flux shapes. We show that detectors of different sizes
and shapes will receive neutrino fluxes with different spectral shapes, and
that the spectral shape will also be different in different regions of the same
detector. Our findings also show that for certain measurements systematic
uncertainties and run time can be reduced.
