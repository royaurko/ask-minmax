In this article, we first prove quantitative estimates associated to the
unique continuation theorems for operators with partially analytic coefficients
of Tataru, Robbiano-Zuily and H\"ormander. We provide local stability estimates
that can be propagated, leading to global ones.
  Then, we specify the previous results to the wave operator on a Riemannian
manifold $\mathcal{M}$ with boundary. For this operator, we also prove Carleman
estimates and local quantitative unique continuation from and up to the
boundary $\partial \mathcal{M}$. This allows us to obtain a global stability
estimate from any open set $\Gamma$ of $\mathcal{M}$ or $\partial \mathcal{M}$,
with the optimal time and dependence on the observation.
  This provides the cost of approximate controllability: for any $T>2 \sup_{x
\in \mathcal{M}}(dist(x,\Gamma))$, we can drive any data of $H^1_0 \times L^2$
in time $T$ to an $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of zero in $L^2 \times H^{-1}$,
with a control located in $\Gamma$, at cost $e^{C/\varepsilon}$.
  We also obtain similar results for the Schr\"odinger equation.
