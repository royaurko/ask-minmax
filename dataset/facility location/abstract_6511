The snow line in a gas disk is defined as the distance from the star beyond
which the water ice is stable against evaporation. Since oxygen is the most
abundant element after hydrogen and helium, the presence of ice grains can have
important consequences for disk evolution. However, determining the position of
the snow line is not simple. I discuss some of the important processes that
affect the position of the snow line.
