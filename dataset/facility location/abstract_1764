The reaction $\gamma p \to \pi^0 \pi^0 p$ has been measured using the TAPS
BaF$_2$ calorimeter at the tagged photon facility of the Mainz Microtron
accelerator in the beam energy range from threshold up to 820 MeV. Close to
threshold, chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) predicts that this channel is
significantly enhanced compared to double pion final states with charged pions.
The strength is attributed dominantly to pion loops in the 2\Piz{} channel - a
finding that opens new prospects for the test of ChPT. Our measurement is the
first which is sensitive enough for a conclusive comparison with the ChPT
calculation and is in agreement with its prediction. The data are also in
agreement with a calculation in the unitary chiral approach.
  In the second resonance region, a recent model interpretation of new GRAAL
data claimed a dominance of the $\Roper \to \sigma N$ reaction process. We
present very accurate invariant mass distributions of ${\Piz \Piz}$ and ${\Piz
p}$ systems, which are in contrast to the $\sigma N$ intermediate state and
which show a dominance of the $\Delta \pi$ intermediate state.
