The development of sputtering facilities, at the moment, is mainly pursued
through experimental tests, or simply by expertise in the field, and relies
much less on numerical simulation of the process environment. This leads to
great efforts and empirically, roughly optimized solutions: in fact, the
simulation of these devices, at the state of art, is quite good in predicting
the behavior of single steps of the overall deposition process, but it seems
still ahead a full integration among the tools simulating the various phenomena
involved in a sputter. We summarize here the techniques and codes already
available for problems of interest in sputtering facilities, and we try to
outline the possible features of a comprehensive simulation framework. This
framework should be able to integrate the single paradigms, dealing with
aspects going from the plasma environment up to the distribution and properties
of the deposited film, not only on the surface of the substrate, but also on
the walls of the process chamber.
