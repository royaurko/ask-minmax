The Pisgah Survey, located at the facilities of the Pisgah Astronomical
Research Institute in Rosman NC, is a low cost project to acquire
fully-automated I band photometry of selected areas of the sky. The survey
collects multiple images of about 16.5 sq. deg. of sky per night, searching for
variability in stars with apparent magnitudes brighter than I = 15. The main
scientific goal of this project is to discover new low-mass detached eclipsing
binaries to provide precise constraints to the mass-radius relation for the
lower main sequence.
  In this paper we present a technical description of the project, including
the software routines to automate the collection and analysis of the data, and
a description of our variable identification strategy. We prove the feasibility
of our technique by showing the successful detection of the previously known
M-dwarf detached eclipsing binary GJ 2069A, and we present the results of the
analysis of the first set of fields imaged by the survey, in which 15 new
variables have been discovered among 8,201 stars monitored. The paper concludes
with an outline of the project's prospects.
