The AMANDE facility at IRSN-Cadarache produces mono-energetic neutron fields
from 2 keV to 20 MeV with metrological quality. To be considered as a standard
facility, characteristics of neutron field i.e fluence distribution must be
well known by a device using absolute measurements. The development of new
detector systems allowing a direct measurement of neutron energy and fluence
has started in 2006. Using the proton recoil telescope principle with the goal
of increase the efficiency, two systems with full localization are studied. A
proton recoil telescope using CMOS sensor (CMOS-RPT) is studied for
measurements at high energies and the helium 4 gaseous micro-time projection
chamber (microTPC He4) will be dedicated to the lowest energies. Simulations of
the two systems were performed with the transport Monte Carlo code MCNPX, to
choose the components and the geometry, to optimize the efficiency and
detection limits of both devices or to estimate performances expected. First
preliminary measurements realised in 2008 demonstrated the proof of principle
of these novel detectors for neutron metrology.
