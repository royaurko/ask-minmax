We report a multi-wavelength study of four new planetary nebula (PN)
candidates selected from the INT/WFC Photometric Ha Survey of the Northern
Galactic Plane (IPHAS) and Deep Sky Hunter (DSH) catalogues. We present
mid-resolution optical spectra of these PNs. The PN status of our sample was
confirmed by optical narrow-band images and mid-resolution spectra. Based on
the locations of these objects in the log (Ha/[N II]) versus log (Ha/[S II])
diagnostic diagram, we conclude that these sources are evolved lowexcitation
PNs. The optical and infrared appearances of these newly discovered PNs are
discussed. Three of the new nebulae studied here are detected in infrared and
have low infrared-to-radio flux ratios, probably suggesting that they are
evolved. Furthermore, we derive the dynamical ages and distances of these
nebulae and study the spectral energy distribution for one of them with
extensive infrared archival data.
