The simulation of the optical turbulence (OT) for astronomical applications
obtained with non-hydrostatic atmospherical models at meso-scale presents, with
respect to measurements, some advantages. The future of the ground-based
astronomy relies upon the potentialities and feasibility of the ELTs. Our
ability in knowing, controlling and 'managing' the effects of the turbulence on
such a new generation telescopes and facilities are determinant to assure their
competitiveness with respect to the space astronomy. In the past several
studies have been carried out proving the feasibility of the simulation of
realistic Cn2 profiles above astronomical sites. The European Community (FP6
Program) decided recently to fund a Project aiming, from one side, to prove the
feasibility of the OT forecasts and the ability of meso-scale models in
discriminating astronomical sites from optical turbulence point of view and,
from the other side, to boost the development of this discipline at the
borderline between the astrophysics and the meteorology. In this contribution I
will present the scientific and technological goals of this project, the
challenges for the ground-based astronomy that are related to the success of
such a project and the international synergies that have been joint to optimize
the results.
