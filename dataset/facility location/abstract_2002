The 197Au(gamma,n) reaction is used as an activation standard for
photodisintegration studies on astrophysically relevant nuclei. At the
bremsstrahlung facility of the superconducting electron accelerator ELBE
(Electron Linear accelerator of high Brilliance and low Emittance) of
Forschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, photoactivation measurements on 197Au
have been performed with bremsstrahlung endpoint energies from 8.0 to 15.5 MeV.
The measured activation yield is compared with previous experiments as well as
with calculations using Hauser-Feshbach statistical models. It is shown that
the experimental data are best described by a two-Lorentzian parametrization
with taking the axial deformation of 197Au into account. The experimental
197Au(gamma,n) reaction yield measured at ELBE via the photoactivation method
is found to be consistent with previous experimental data using photon
scattering or neutron detection methods.
