Precise angular distributions have been measured for the first time for the
photoproduction of $\pi^{0}$-mesons off neutrons bound in the deuteron. The
effects from nuclear Fermi motion have been eliminated by a complete kinematic
reconstruction of the final state. The influence of final-state-interaction
effects has been estimated by a comparison of the reaction cross section for
quasi-free protons bound in the deuteron to the results for free protons and
then applied as a correction to the quasi-free neutron data. The experiment was
performed at the tagged photon facility of the Mainz Microtron MAMI with the
Crystal Ball and TAPS detector setup for incident photon energies between
$0.45$~GeV and $1.4$~GeV. The results are compared to the predictions from
reaction models and partial-wave analyses based on data from other isospin
channels. The model predictions show large discrepancies among each other and
the present data will provide much tighter constraints. This is demonstrated by
the results of a new analysis in the framework of the Bonn-Gatchina
coupled-channel analysis which included the present data.
