We report 102 new redshifts and magnitudes for a sample of galaxies to RF ~
15.5 mag in a 2.17 deg x 2.17 deg region centered on the galaxy IC 4296, the
most luminous member of the A3565 cluster. Up to the limiting magnitude we find
29 cluster members, and measure a velocity dispersion of 228 km/s. The
estimated total mass for this system is ~ 3.0 x h**-1 10**13 Msun (where h =
H0/100 km/s/Mpc), and its dynamical properties are quite typical of poor
clusters presenting X-ray emission. We also find that galaxies with absorption
lines are more concentrated towards the center of the cluster, while systems
with emission lines are mainly located in the outer parts. The small velocity
dispersion of the cluster, coupled to the known presence of an interacting pair
of galaxies, and the large extent of the brightest cluster galaxy, could
indicate that galaxy formation through mergers may still be underway in this
system. The surveyed region also contains galaxies belonging to the Shapley
Concentration cluster A3560. Within 30 arc min of the cluster center, we detect
32 galaxies, for which we measure a velocity dispersion of 588 km/s and a mass
of ~2 x h**-1 10**14 Msun. However, because our sample is restricted to
galaxies brighter than M*, these values should be considered only as rough
estimates.
