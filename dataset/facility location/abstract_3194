Interstellar dust appears in a number of roles in the interstellar medium.
Historically, the most familiar one is as a source of extinction in the
optical. Absorbed optical and ultraviolet light heats the dust, whence infrared
(including near-infrared to submillimeter) emission, the particular theme of
this review. In some distant galaxies, most of the luminosity of the galaxy is
thus converted into the infrared, though in the Milky Way the situation is not
generally as extreme, except in localized regions of star formation. I briefly
review the range of physical conditions in which the dust emits in the
interstellar medium and the various sizes of dust probed. Of interest
astrophysically are observations of both the spectrum and the spatial
distribution of the emission, preferably in combination.
 In the past fifteen year probes of dust emission have advanced significantly:
through IRAS, KAO, COBE experiments, IRTS, ISO, and MSX. Satellite and
stratospheric observations of dust emission are complemented by ground-based
studies, such as imaging and polarimetry in the submillimeter with the JCMT or
imaging of reflected light from dust in the near infrared with 2MASS. Looking
ahead, the next decade promises to be equally exciting. I give an overview of
some of the distinctive features of facilities anticipated in the near term
(WIRE), early in the new millennium (SOFIA, SIRTF), and somewhat further out
(IRIS, FIRST, Planck).
