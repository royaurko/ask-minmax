We have used the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope to perform the most
sensitive search to date for neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) in the circumstellar
envelope (CSE) of the carbon star IRC+10216. Our observations have uncovered a
low surface brightness HI shell of diameter ~1300" (~0.8 pc), centered on
IRC+10216. The HI shell has an angular extent comparable to the far
ultraviolet-emitting astrosphere of IRC+10216 previously detected with the
GALEX satellite, and its kinematics are consistent with circumstellar matter
that has been decelerated by the local interstellar medium. The shell appears
to completely surround the star, but the highest HI column densities are
measured along the leading edge of the shell, near the location of a previously
identified bow shock. We estimate a total mass of atomic hydrogen associated
with IRC+10216 CSE of M_HI~3x10e-3 M_sun. This is only a small fraction of the
expected total mass of the CSE (<1%) and is consistent with the bulk of the
stellar wind originating in molecular rather than atomic form, as expected for
a cool star with an effective temperature T_eff<~2200 K. HI mapping of a 2 deg
x 2 deg region surrounding IRC+10216 has also allowed us to characterize the
line-of-sight interstellar emission in the region and has uncovered a link
between diffuse FUV emission southwest of IRC+10216 and the Local Leo Cold
Cloud.
