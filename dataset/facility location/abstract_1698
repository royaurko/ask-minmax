Virtual Compton Scattering is studied at the Thomas Jefferson National
Accelerator Facility in the energy domain below pion threshold and in the
Delta(1232) resonance region. The data analysis is based on the Dispersion
Relation (DR) approach. The electric and magnetic Generalized Polarizabilities
(GPs) of the proton and the structure functions Pll-Ptt/epsilon and Plt are
determined at four-momentum transfer squared Q2=0.92 and 1.76 GeV2. The DR
analysis is consistent with the low-energy expansion analysis. The world data
set indicates that neither the electric nor magnetic GP follows a simple dipole
form.
