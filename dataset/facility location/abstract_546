We report on the first radioactive beam experiment performed at the recently
commissioned REX-ISOLDE facility at CERN in conjunction with the highly
efficient gamma spectrometer MINIBALL. Using 30Mg ions accelerated to an energy
of 2.25 MeV/u together with a thin nat-Ni target, Coulomb excitation of the
first excited 2+ states of the projectile and target nuclei well below the
Coulomb barrier was observed. From the measured relative de-excitation gamma
ray yields the B(E2; 0+ -> 2+) value of 30Mg was determined to be 241(31)
e2fm4. Our result is lower than values obtained at projectile fragmentation
facilities using the intermediate-energy Coulomb excitation method, and
confirms the theoretical conjecture that the neutron-rich magnesium isotope
30Mg lies still outside the ``island of inversion''.
