We have imaged the nearby galaxy merger Arp 299 at arcsecond and
milliarcsecond resolution, using both the Very Large Array and the Very Long
Baseline Array. The large-scale radio emission from the merger contains 5
bright, compact radio sources embedded in diffuse emission, with diameters less
than 200 pc. Supernova rates of 0.1 to 1 per year are required to produce the
VLA-detected radio emission in these sources. Two of the compact VLA radio
sources, designated Source A and Source D, also have been detected and imaged
at milliarcsecond scales. Source A, which is associated with the nucleus of one
of the merging galaxies, contains five milliarcsecond-scale sources, each with
a radio power between 100 and 1000 times that of the Galactic supernova remnant
Cassiopeia A. Four of these have flat or inverted spectra and appear to be
young supernovae. Three of the VLBI-scale sources are located within 10 pc
(projected) of one another, and two are separated by less than 3 pc, indicating
that they all may be within the same super starcluster or complex of such
clusters. The brightest VLBI-scale source, A0, has an extremely inverted
pectrum, with alpha larger than +2 at gigahertz frequencies. It seems to be the
youngest supernova, which has not yet broken out of its circumstellar shell.
The milliarcsecond radio sources within Source A appear to constitute a
upernova factory, confirming the presence of an extreme starburst that peaked
at least a few million years ago.
