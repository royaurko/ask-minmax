Building on the work of Morris, Thorne, and Yurtsever, some particularly
simple examples of traversable wormholes are exhibited. These examples are
notable both because the analysis is not limited to spherically symmetric
cases, and because it is possible to in some sense minimize the use of exotic
matter. In particular, it is possible for a traveller to traverse such a
wormhole without passing through a region of exotic matter. As in previous
analyses, the weak energy condition is violated in these traversable wormholes.
