We construct the metric of new multi-black hole configurations on a
d-dimensional cylinder R^{d-1} x S^1, in the limit of small total mass (or
equivalently in the limit of a large cylinder). These solutions are valid to
first order in the total mass and describe configurations with several small
black holes located at different points along the circle direction of the
cylinder. We explain that a static configuration of black holes is required to
be in equilibrium such that the external force on each black hole is zero, and
we examine the resulting conditions. The first-order corrected thermodynamics
of the solutions is obtained and a Newtonian interpretation of it is given. We
then study the consequences of the multi-black hole configurations for the
phase structure of static Kaluza-Klein black holes and show that our new
solutions imply continuous non-uniqueness in the phase diagram. The new
multi-black hole configurations raise the question of existence of new
non-uniform black strings. Finally, a further analysis of the three-black hole
configuration suggests the possibility of a new class of static lumpy black
holes in Kaluza-Klein space.
