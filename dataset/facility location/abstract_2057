We extend our recent study of dilepton invariant-mass spectra from the decays
of rho mesons produced by photon reactions off nuclei. We specifically focus on
experimental spectra as recently measured by the CLAS Collaboration at the
Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility using carbon and iron nuclei.
Building on our earlier work we broaden our description to a larger set of
observables in order to identify sensitivities to the medium effects predicted
by microscopic calculations of the rho spectral function. We compute mass
spectra for several target nuclei and study the spectral shape as a function of
the 3-momentum of the outgoing lepton pair. We also compute the so-called
nuclear transparency ratio which provides an alternative means (and thus
consistency check) of estimating the inelastic rho width in the cold nuclear
medium.
