A set S of vertices of a graph G is a dominating set of G if every vertex u
of G is either in S or it has a neighbour in S. In other words, S is dominating
if the sets S\cap N[u] where u \in V(G) and N[u] denotes the closed
neighbourhood of u in G, are all nonempty. A set S \subseteq V(G) is called a
locating code in G, if the sets S \cap N[u] where u \in V(G) \setminus S are
all nonempty and distinct. A set S \subseteq V(G) is called an identifying code
in G, if the sets S\cap N[u] where u\in V(G) are all nonempty and distinct. We
study locating and identifying codes in the circulant networks C_n(1,3). For an
integer n>6, the graph C_n(1,3) has vertex set Z_n and edges xy where x,y \in
Z_n and |x-y| \in {1,3}. We prove that a smallest locating code in C_n(1,3) has
size \lceil n/3 \rceil + c, where c \in {0,1}, and a smallest identifying code
in C_n(1,3) has size \lceil 4n/11 \rceil + c', where c' \in {0,1}.
