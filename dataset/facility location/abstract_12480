This work aims to study the Portuguese regional agglomeration process, using
the linear form the New Economic Geography models that emphasize the importance
of spatial factors (distance, costs of transport and communication) in
explaining of the concentration of economic activity in certain locations. In a
theoretical context, it is intended to explain the complementarily of
clustering models, associated with the New Economic Geography, and polarization
associated with the Keynesian tradition, describing the mechanisms by which
these processes are based. As a summary conclusion, we can say which the
agglomeration process shows some signs of concentration in Lisboa e Vale do
Tejo (which is evidence of regional divergence in Portugal) and the
productivity factor significantly improves the results that explain the
regional clustering in Portugal (despite being ignored in the models of New
Economic Geography).
