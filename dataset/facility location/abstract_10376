We show that if there exists a special kind of Born-Infeld type scalar field,
then one can send information from inside a black hole. This information is
encoded in perturbations of the field propagating in non-trivial scalar field
backgrounds, which serves as a "new ether". Although the theory is
Lorentz-invariant it allows, nevertheless, the superluminal propagation of
perturbations with respect to the "new ether". We found the stationary solution
for background, which describes the accretion of the scalar field onto a black
hole. Examining the propagation of small perturbations around this solution we
show the signals emitted inside the horizon can reach an observer located
outside the black hole. We discuss possible physical consequences of this
result.
