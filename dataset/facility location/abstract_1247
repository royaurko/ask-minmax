The location of the solar dynamo is discussed in the context of new insights
into the theory of nonlinear turbulent dynamos. It is argued that, from a
dynamo-theoretic point of view, the bottom of the convection zone is not a
likely location and that the solar dynamo may be distributed over the
convection zone. The near surface shear layer produces not only east-west field
alignment, but it also helps the dynamo disposing of its excess small scale
magnetic helicity.
