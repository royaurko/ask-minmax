Observations of nearby star forming clouds with imaging X-ray telescopes have
revealed that X-ray emission is elevated $10^1-10^4$ above main sequence levels
in low-mass pre-main sequence (PMS) stars. The variability and spectral X-ray
evidence, together with circularly polarized radio continuum flares seen in a
few cases, strongly argues for an origin in magnetic reconnection flares. These
high levels of magnetic activity are present from the earliest protostellar
phase to the main sequence. After a brief review of past observations, three
astrophysical issues are raised: the location of the flaring magnetic fields,
the origin of these fields, and the effects of flare high-energy photons and
particles on the environs. New results from Chandra observations of a
well-defined samples of PMS solar analogues are presented, giving an improved
view of magnetic flaring in the early Sun.
