A multi-MW proton facility, Project X, has been proposed and is currently
under development at Fermilab. We are carrying out a program of research and
development aimed at integrated systems testing of critical components
comprising the front end of Project X. This program, known as the Project X
Injector Experiment (PXIE), is being undertaken as a key component of the
larger Project X R&D program. The successful completion of this program will
validate the concept for the Project X front end, thereby minimizing a primary
technical risk element within Project X. PXIE is currently under construction
at Fermilab and will be completed over the period FY12-17. PXIE will include an
H- ion source, a CW 2.1-MeV RFQ and two superconductive RF (SRF) cryomodules
providing up to 25 MeV energy gain at an average beam current of 1 mA
(upgradable to 2 mA). Successful systems testing will also demonstrate the
viability of novel front end technologies that are expected find applications
beyond Project X.
