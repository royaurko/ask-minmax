MINOS will measure the composition of a neutrino beam at two locations, 735km
apart, in an effort confirm the (atmospheric) neutrino oscillation hypothesis
and measure the associated mixing parameters. Oscillations will be manifested
as a difference in the rate and energy spectrum of muon neutrino CC
interactions measured in the two detectors. Because most interactions observed
in MINOS are inelastic, the neutrino energy is reconstructed as the sum of the
energy carried by the muon and that seen in the hadronic shower emanating from
the struck nucleus. The latter is sensitive to uncertainties in the
hadronisation process, chief among them those due to intranuclear re-scattering
(i.e., final state interactions). We discuss the simulation of intranuclear
re-scattering currently used by MINOS and its effect on quantities observable
in the experiment.
