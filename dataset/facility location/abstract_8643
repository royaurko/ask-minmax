We compute mass outflow rate $R_{\dot m}$ from relativistic matter accreting
quasi-spherically onto Schwarzschild black holes. Taking the pair-plasma
pressure mediated shock surface as the {\it effective} boundary layer (of the
black hole) from where bulk of the outflow is assumed to be generated,
computation of this rate is done using combinations of exact transonic inflow
and outflow solutions. We find that $R_{\dot m}$ depends on the initial
parameters of the flow, the polytropic index of matter, the degree of
compression of matter near the shock surface and on the location of the shock
surface itself. We thus not only study the variation of the mass outflow rate
as a function of various physical parameters governing the problem but also
provide a sufficiently plausible estimation of this rate.
