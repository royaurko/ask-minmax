Fault localization is a process to find the location of faults. It determines
the root cause of the failure. It identifies the causes of abnormal behaviour
of a faulty program. It identifies exactly where the bugs are. Existing fault
localization techniques are Slice based technique, Program- Spectrum based
Technique, Statistics Based Technique, Program State Based Technique, Machine
learning based Technique and Similarity Based Technique. In the proposed method
Model Based Fault Localization Technique is used, which is called Probabilistic
Program Dependence Graph . Probabilistic Program Dependence Graph (PPDG) is an
innovative model that scans the internal behaviour of the project. PPDG
construction is enhanced by Program Dependence Graph (PDG). PDG is achieved by
the Control Flow Graph (CFG). The PPDG construction augments the structural
dependences represented by a program dependence graph with estimates of
statistical dependences between node states, which are computed from the test
set. The PPDG is based on the established framework of probabilistic graphical
models. This work presents algorithms for constructing PPDGs and applying fault
localization.
