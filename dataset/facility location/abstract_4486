We present I-band light curves of 54 Population II Cepheids identified in the
OGLE-II catalog of variable objects in the Galactic bulge fields. Their periods
range from a fraction of a day to several days. Their light curves show very
close similarity to the light curves of classical Cepheids with periods a few
times longer.
  We analyze location of the newly identified Population II Cepheids in the
color--magnitude diagram. The position of these objects confirms recent
discovery that the interstellar extinction toward the Galactic bulge might be
anomalous. The slope of the reddening line obtained from our sample is in very
good agreement with the earlier one derived with red clump stars and the one
derived with RR~Lyr stars in the Galactic bulge.
  Our Population II Cepheids follow the same period--luminosity (P--L) relation
indicating similar status of these objects. We compare the P--L relation of
these stars with the relation of Population II Cepheid detected by the OGLE-II
survey in the LMC. Deviations from the P--L relation of the Galactic bulge
Cepheids seem to indicate that these objects are located in the Galactic bar
similarly to red clump stars.
