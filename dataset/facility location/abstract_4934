For spatiotemporal chaos described by partial differential equations, there
are generally locations where the dynamical variable achieves its local
extremum or where the time partial derivative of the variable vanishes
instantaneously. To a large extent, the location and movement of these
topologically special points determine the qualitative structure of the
disordered states. We analyze numerically statistical properties of the
topologically special points in one-dimensional spatiotemporal chaos. The
probability distribution functions for the number of point, the lifespan, and
the distance covered during their lifetime are obtained from numerical
simulations. Mathematically, we establish a probabilistic model to describe the
dynamics of these topologically special points. In despite of the different
definitions in different spatiotemporal chaos, the dynamics of these special
points can be described in a uniform approach.
