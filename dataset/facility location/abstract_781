One component of the future international Facility for Antiproton and Ion
Research - FAIR is directed towards studies of hadronic matter at the
sub-nuclear level with beams of antiprotons. These studies focus on two key
aspects: confinement of quarks and the generation of the hadron masses. These
goals will be pursued by performing precision measurements of charged and
neutral decay products from antiproton-proton annihilation in the charmonium
mass region. In this report an overview of the charmonium issues relevant to
PANDA will be presented.
