The present paper aims at locating the breakings of the integration process
of an international system observed during about 50 years in the 19th century.
A historical study could link them to special events, which operated as
exogenous shocks on this process. The indicator of integration used is the
spread between the highest and the lowest among the London, Hamburg and Paris
gold-silver prices. Three algorithms are combined to study this integration: a
periodization obtained with the SOM algorithm is confronted to the estimation
of a two-regime Markov switching model, in order to give an interpretation of
the changes of regime; in the same time change-points are identified over the
whole period providing a more precise interpretation of the various types of
regulation.
