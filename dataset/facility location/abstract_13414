This paper deals with the maximum value of the difference between the
determining number and the metric dimension of a graph as a function of its
order. Our technique requires to use locating-dominating sets, and perform an
independent study on other functions related to these sets. Thus, we obtain
lower and upper bounds on all these functions by means of very diverse tools.
Among them are some adequate constructions of graphs, a variant of a classical
result in graph domination and a polynomial time algorithm that produces both
distinguishing sets and determining sets. Further, we consider specific
families of graphs where the restrictions of these functions can be computed.
To this end, we utilize two well-known objects in graph theory: $k$-dominating
sets and matchings.
