The XMM-Newton X-ray observatory took part in the multi-wavelength observing
campaign of the massive, evolved star Eta Carinae in 2003 during its recent
X-ray minimum. This paper reports on the results of these observations, mainly
from the aspect of spectral change. Hard X-ray emission from the point source
of Eta Carinae was detected even during the minimum. During the minimum the
observed flux above 3 keV was ~3e-12 ergs cm-2 s-1, which is about one percent
of the flux before the minimum. Changes in the spectral shape revealed two
X-ray emission components in the central point source. One component is
non-variable and has relatively cool plasma of kT~1 keV and moderate
absorption, NH~5e22 cm-2. The plasma is probably located far from the star,
possibly produced by the high speed polar wind from Eta Carinae. The other high
temperature component has kT~5 keV and is strongly variable. This component
shows an increase in the apparent column density from 5e22 cm-2 to 2e23 cm-2,
probably originating near the heart of the binary system. These changes in NH
were smaller than expected if the minimum is produced solely by an increase of
hydrogen column density. The X-ray minimum seems to be dominated by a decrease
of the apparent emission measure, suggesting that the brightest part of the
X-ray emitting region is completely obscured during the minimum in the form of
an eclipse. A ``partial covering'' model might explain the residual emission
seen during the minimum.
