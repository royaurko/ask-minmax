e present Near Infrared imaging polarimetry of three regions of massive star
formation, G$192.16 - 3.82$, Cepheus A, and W42. In W42 we have discovered a
new bipolar nebula located at the far side of the HII region behind the visible
cluster of exciting stars. The axis of this new nebula is aligned with the
magnetic field threading the entire cluster region. Polarization in the bipolar
outflow nebulosity associated with G192.16 is consistent with a single
illuminating source, too faint to be detected at $2 \micron$. Polarization in
the reflection nebulosity associated with Ceph A requires more than one
illuminating source, although HW2 is clearly dominant. In all three objects,
the magnetic field in the outflow at distances greater than $\sim 0.2$ pc is
radial. In G192.16 the magnetic field geometry closer than $\sim 0.2$ pc to the
embedded star appears chaotic. For G192.16 the outflow is not aligned with the
surrounding magnetic field, which lies in the galactic plane. In Ceph A, the
outflow axis could be interpreted as being aligned with the galactic plane, but
the magnetic field threading the region is not. Only in the case of W42 is the
magnetic field threading the HII region aligned with the mean field in the
surrounding galactic plane.
