Effects of magnetic fields (applied along the c-axis) on static spin
correlation were studied for the electron-doped superconductors
Pr$_{1-x}$LaCe$_{x}$CuO$_4$ with $x$=0.11 ($T_c$=26 K) and $x$=0.15 ($T_c$=16
K) by neutron scattering measurements. In the $x$=0.11 sample located near the
antiferromagnetic(AF) and superconducting phase boundary, the field dependence
of both the magnetic intensity at T=3 K and the onset temperature of the
magnetic order exhibits a peak at $\sim$5 T. In contrast, in the overdoped
$x$=0.15 sample a static AF order is neither observed at zero-field nor induced
by the field up to 8.5 T. Difference and similarity of the field effect between
the hole- and electron-doped high-$T_c$ cuprates are discussed.
