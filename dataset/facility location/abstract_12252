Repulsive point processes arise in models where competition forces entities
to be more spread apart than if placed independently. Simulation of these types
of processes can be accomplished using dominated coupling from the past with a
running time that varies as the intensity of the number of points. These
algorithms usually exhibit what is called an artificial phase transition, where
below a critical intensity the algorithm runs in finite expected time, but
above the critical intensity the expected number of steps is infinite. Here the
artificial phase transition is examined. In particular, an earlier lower bound
on this artificial phase transition is improved by including a new type of term
in the analysis. In addition, the results of computer experiments to locate the
transition are presented.
