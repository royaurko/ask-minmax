We present results from a season of observations with the Chinese Small
Telescope ARray (CSTAR), obtained over 183 days of the 2010 Antarctic winter.
We carried out high-cadence time-series aperture photometry of 20,000 stars
with i<15.3 mag located in a 23 square-degree region centered on the south
celestial pole.
  We identified 188 variable stars, including 67 new objects relative to our
2008 observations, thanks to broader synoptic coverage, a deeper magnitude
limit and a larger field of view.
  We used the photometric data set to derive site statistics from Dome A. Based
on two years of observations, we find that extinction due to clouds at this
site is less than 0.1 and 0.4 mag during 45% and 75% of the dark time,
respectively.
