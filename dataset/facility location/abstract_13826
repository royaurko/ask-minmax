We view a distributed system as a graph of active locations with
unidirectional channels between them, through which they pass messages. In this
context, the graph structure of a system constrains the propagation of
information through it.
  Suppose a set of channels is a cut set between an information source and a
potential sink. We prove that, if there is no disclosure from the source to the
cut set, then there can be no disclosure to the sink. We introduce a new
formalization of partial disclosure, called *blur operators*, and show that the
same cut property is preserved for disclosure to within a blur operator. This
cut-blur property also implies a compositional principle, which ensures limited
disclosure for a class of systems that differ only beyond the cut.
