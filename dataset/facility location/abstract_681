In this paper, a new automatic system for classifying ritual locations in
diverse Hajj and Umrah video scenes is investigated. This challenging subject
has mostly been ignored in the past due to several problems one of which is the
lack of realistic annotated video datasets. HUER Dataset is defined to model
six different Hajj and Umrah ritual locations[26].
  The proposed Hajj and Umrah ritual location classifying system consists of
four main phases: Preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and location
classification phases. The shot boundary detection and background/foregroud
segmentation algorithms are applied to prepare the input video scenes into the
KNN, ANN, and SVM classifiers. The system improves the state of art results on
Hajj and Umrah location classifications, and successfully recognizes the six
Hajj rituals with more than 90% accuracy. The various demonstrated experiments
show the promising results.
