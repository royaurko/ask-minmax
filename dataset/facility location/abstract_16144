We discuss the prospects of exploring the neutrino mass parameters with a
CERN based Beta-beam experiment using two different detectors at two different
baselines. The proposed set-up consists of a 50 kton iron calorimeter (ICAL) at
a baseline of around 7150 km which is roughly the magic baseline, e.g.,
ICAL@INO, and a 50 kton Totally Active Scintillator Detector at a distance of
730 km, e.g., at Gran Sasso. We take 8B and 8Li source ions with a boost factor
$\gamma$ of 650 for the magic baseline while for the closer detector we
consider 18Ne and 6He ions with a range of Lorentz boosts. We find that the
locations of the two detectors complement each other leading to an exceptional
high sensitivity. With $\gamma=650$ for 8B/8Li and $\gamma=575$ for 18Ne/6He
and total luminosity corresponding to $5\times (1.1\times 10^{19})$ and
$5\times (2.9\times 10^{19})$ useful ion decays in neutrino and antineutrino
modes respectively, we find that the two-detector set-up can probe maximal CP
violation and establish the neutrino mass ordering if $\sin^22\theta_{13}$ is
$1.8 \times 10^{-5}$ and $4.6 \times 10^{-5}$, respectively, or more. The
sensitivity reach for $\sin^22\theta_{13}$ itself is $5.3 \times 10^{-5}$. CP
violation can be discovered for 64% of the possible $\delta_{CP}$ values for
$\sin^22\theta_{13} \geq 8\times 10^{-5}$.
