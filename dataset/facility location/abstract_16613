The "strange attractor like" precursor, calculated from the Earth's
oscillating electric field registered at PYR and HIO monitoring sites located
in Greece, is studied in the domain of T = 14 days. It is assumed that the
generating precursory signals focal mechanism is triggered by the corresponding
M1 (moon declination) tidal wave. The obtained results from the analysis of
eight (8) cases of large (Ms>6.0R) EQs that occurred from March 18th, 2006 to
November 17th, 2008 suggest the validity of the method. Moreover, it is found
that the specific methodology applied for T = 14 days behaves very closely to
the same one when applied for T = 1 day even though there is a resolution
decrease in the calculated predictive time window for the occurrence of the
oncoming large EQ. It is speculated that this type of precursor, once it is
present in one distinct oscillating component of the seismic precursory
generated electric field, then, most probably, it is present in most of its
other oscillating components. The latter suggests the investigation of the
preseismic precursory electric field at its longer wavelengths i.e. components
triggered by the Ssa (6 months, moon declination) oscillating components. The
large value of the obtained success rate (predicted EQs / total no. of large
EQs) suggests its use as a time prediction tool in the domain of the
"short-term prediction".
