We present SCUBA-2 850um submillimetre (submm) observations of the fields of
10 dusty, luminous galaxies at z ~ 1.7 - 4.6, detected at 12um and/or 22um by
the WISE all-sky survey, but faint or undetected at 3.4um and 4.6um; dubbed
hot, dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs). The six detected targets all have total
infrared luminosities greater than 10^13 L_sun, with one greater than 10^14
L_sun. Their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are very blue from
mid-infrared to submm wavelengths and not well fitted by standard AGN SED
templates, without adding extra dust extinction to fit the WISE 3.4um and 4.6um
data. The SCUBA-2 850um observations confirm that the Hot DOGs have less cold
and/or more warm dust emission than standard AGN templates, and limit an
underlying extended spiral or ULIRG-type galaxy to contribute less than about
2% or 55% of the typical total Hot DOG IR luminosity, respectively. The two
most distant and luminous targets have similar observed submm to mid-infrared
ratios to the rest, and thus appear to have even hotter SEDs. The number of
serendipitous submm galaxies (SMGs) detected in the 1.5-arcmin-radius SCUBA-2
850um maps indicates there is a significant over-density of serendipitous
sources around Hot DOGs. These submm observations confirm that the
WISE-selected ultra-luminous galaxies have very blue mid-infrared to submm
SEDs, suggesting that they contain very powerful AGN, and are apparently
located in unusual arcmin-scale overdensities of very luminous dusty galaxies.
