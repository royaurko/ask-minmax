Cross sections for the p($e,e'\pi^{+}$)n process on $^1$H, $^2$H, $^{12}$C,
$^{27}$Al, $^{63}$Cu and $^{197}$Au targets were measured at the Thomas
Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) in order to extract the
nuclear transparencies. Data were taken for four-momentum transfers ranging
from $Q^2$=1.1 to 4.8 GeV$^2$ for a fixed center of mass energy of $W$=2.14
GeV. The ratio of $\sigma_L$ and $\sigma_T$ was extracted from the measured
cross sections for $^1$H, $^2$H, $^{12}$C and $^{63}$Cu targets at $Q^2$ = 2.15
and 4.0 GeV$^2$ allowing for additional studies of the reaction mechanism. The
experimental setup and the analysis of the data are described in detail
including systematic studies needed to obtain the results. The results for the
nuclear transparency and the differential cross sections as a function of the
pion momentum at the different values of $Q^2$ are presented. Global features
of the data are discussed and the data are compared with the results of model
calculations for the p($e,e'\pi^{+}$)n reaction from nuclear targets.
