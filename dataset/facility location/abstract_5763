Based on a deep survey of the Galactic Center region performed with the
INTEGRAL observatory, we measured for the first time the hard X-ray (20-200
keV) spectrum of the Seyfert 1 galaxy GRS 1734-292 located in the direction of
the Galactic Center. We extended the spectrum to lower energies using archival
GRANAT and ASCA observations. The broadband X-ray spectrum is similar to those
of other nearby luminous AGNs, having a power law shape without cutoff up to at
least 100 keV.
