In this paper we apply an extended Kalman filter to track both the location
and the orientation of a mobile target from multistatic response measurements.
We also analyze the effect of the limited-view aspect on the stability and the
efficiency of our tracking approach. Our algorithm is based on the use of the
generalized polarization tensors, which can be reconstructed from the
multistatic response measurements by solving a linear system. The system has
the remarkable property that low order generalized polarization tensors are not
affected by the error caused by the instability of higher orders in the
presence of measurement noise.
