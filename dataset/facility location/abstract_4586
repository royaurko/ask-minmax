I discuss different approaches to finite density lattice QCD. In particular,
I focus on the structure of the phase diagram and discuss attempts to determine
the location of the critical end-point. Recent results on the transiton line as
function of the chemical potential ($T_c(\mu_q)$) are reviewed. Along the
transition line, hadronic fluctuations have been calculated, which can be used
to characterize properties of the Quark Gluon plasma and eventually can also
help to identify the location of the critical end-point in the QCD phase
diagram on the lattice and in heavy ion experiments. Furthermore, I comment on
the structure of the phase diagram at large $\mu_q$.
