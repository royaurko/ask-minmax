We study numerically the influence of disorder and localization effects on
the local spectroscopic characteristics and infrared optical properties of
$\mbox{Ga}_{1-x}\mbox{Mn}_x\mbox{As}$. We treat the band structure and disorder
effects at an equal level by using exact diagonalization supercell simulation
method. This method accurately describes the low doping limit and gives a clear
picture of the transition to higher dopings, which captures the localization
effects inaccessible to other theoretical methods commonly used. Our
simulations capture the rich mid-gap localized states observed in scanning
tunneling microscopy studies and reproduce the observed features of the
infrared optical absorption experiments. We show clear evidence of a disordered
valence band model for metallic samples in which (i) there is no impurity band
detached from the valence band, (ii) the disorder tends to localize and pull
states near the top of the valence band into the gap region, and (iii) the
Fermi energy is located deep in the delocalized region away from the mobility
edge. We identify localized states deep in the gap region by visualizing the
probability distribution of the quasiparticles and connecting it to their
respective participation ratios. The analysis of the infrared-optical
absorption data indicates that it does not have a direct relation to the nature
of the states at the Fermi energy.
