We present radio observations of the unique, recently formed, planetary
nebula (PN) associated with a very long-period OH/IR variable star V1018 Sco
that is unequivocally still in its asymptoticgiant branch phase. Two regions
within the optical nebula are clearly detected in nonthermal radio continuum
emission, with radio spectral indices comparable to those seen in
colliding-wind Wolf-Rayet binaries. We suggest that these represent shocked
interactions between the hot, fast stellar wind and the cold nebular shell that
represents the PN's slow wind moving away from the central star. This same
interface produces both synchrotron radio continuum and the optical PN
emission. The fast wind is neither spherical in geometry nor aligned withany
obvious optical or radio axis. We also report the detection of transient H2O
maser emission in this nebula.
