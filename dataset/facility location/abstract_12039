BM Orionis, eclipsing binary system that located in the center of Orion
Nebula Cluster posses several enigmatic problems. Its intrinsic nature and
nebular environment make it harder to measure the physical parameters of the
system, but it is believed as Algol type binary where secondary component is
pre-main sequence star with larger radius. To assure this, several stellar
models ($M_1=5.9$ {M_{\odot}} and $M_2=2.0$ {M_{\odot}}) are created and
simulated using MESA. Models with rigid rotation of $\omega=10^{-5}$ rad/s
exhibit considerable similar properties during pre-main sequence stage, but 2.0
{\msun} at assumed age of $\sim10^6$ is $6.46$ times dimmer than observed
secondary star. There must be an external mechanism to fill this luminosity
gap. Then, simulated post-main sequence binary evolution of BM Ori that
involves mass transfer shows that primary star will reach helium sequence with
the mass of $\sim0.8$ {\msun} before second stage mass transfer.
