We present properties of intensity oscillations of a sunspot in the
photosphere and chromosphere using G~band and CaIIH filtergrams from Hinode.
Intensity power maps as function of magnetic field strength and frequency
reveal reduction of power in Gband with increase in photospheric magnetic field
strength at all frequencies. In CaIIH, however, stronger fields exhibit more
power at high frequencies particularly in the 4.5 mHz-8.0 mHz band. Power
distribution in different locations of the active region show that the
oscillations in CaIIH exhibit more power in comparison to that of Gband. We
also relate the power in intensity oscillations with different components of
the photospheric vector magnetic field using near simultaneous
spectro-polarimetric observations of the sunspot from the Hinode
spectropolarimeter. The photospheric umbral power is strongly anti-correlated
with the magnetic field strength and its the line-of-sight component while
there is a good correlation with the transverse component. A reversal of this
trend is observed in the chromosphere with the exception at low frequencies
($\nu\le$ 1.5 mHz). The power in sunspot penumbrae is anti-correlated with the
magnetic field parameters at all frequencies (1.0 $\le\nu\le$ 8.0 mHz) in both
the photosphere and chromosphere, except that the chromospheric power shows a
strong correlation in the frequency range 3-3.5 mHz.
