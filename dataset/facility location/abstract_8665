We present Ulysses, KONUS-WIND, and BATSE observations of bursts from a new
soft gamma repeater which was active in 1998 June and July. Triangulation of
the bursts results in a ~ 1.8 degree by 16 '' error box whose area is ~ 7.6
arcminutes^2, which contains the Galactic supernova remnant G337.0-0.1. This
error box intersects the position of a BeppoSAX X-ray source which is also
consistent with the position of G337.0-0.1 (Woods et al. 1999), and is thought
to be the quiescent counterpart to the repeater. If so, the resulting error box
is ~ 2 ' by 16 '' and has an area of ~ 0.6 arcminutes^2. The error box location
within the supernova remnant suggests that the neutron star has a transverse
velocity of ~ 200 - 2000 km/s.
