The possible association of the supernova remnant (SNR) G 343.1-2.3 with the
pulsar PSR B 1706-44 (superposed on the arclike "shell" of the SNR) has been
questioned by some contributors on the basis of an inconsistency between the implied
and measured (scintillation) transverse velocities of the pulsar, the absence
of any apparent interaction between the pulsar and the SNR's "shell", and some
other indirect arguments. We suggest, however, that this association could be
real if both objects are the remnants of a supernova (SN) which exploded within
a mushroom-like cavity (created by the SN progenitor wind breaking out of the
parent molecular cloud). This suggestion implies that the actual shape of the
SNR's shell is similar to that of the well-known SNR VRO 42.05.01 and that the
observed bright arc corresponds to the "half" of the SNR located inside the
cloud. We report the discovery in archival radio data of an extended ragged
radio arc to the southeast of the bright arc which we interpret as the "half"
of the SN blast wave expanding in the intercloud medium.
