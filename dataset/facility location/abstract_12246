We adapt the Kolmogorov's normalization algorithm (which is the key element
of the original proof scheme of the KAM theorem) to the construction of a
suitable normal form related to an invariant elliptic torus. As a byproduct,
our procedure can also provide some analytic expansions of the motions on
elliptic tori. By extensively using algebraic manipulations on a computer, we
explicitly apply our method to a planar four-body model not too different with
respect to the real Sun--Jupiter--Saturn--Uranus system. The frequency analysis
method allows us to check that our location of the initial conditions on an
invariant elliptic torus is really accurate.
