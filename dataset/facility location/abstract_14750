We present observational evidence for a galaxy `Type' dependence to the
location of a spiral galaxy's disk parameters in the mu_0-log(h) (central disk
surface-brightness - disk scale-length) plane. With a sample of ~40 Low Surface
Brightness galaxies (both bulge- and disk-dominated) and ~80 High Surface
Brightness galaxies, the early-type disk galaxies (<=Sc) tend to define a
bright envelope in the mu_0-log(h) plane, while the late-type (>=Scd) spiral
galaxies have, in general, smaller and fainter disks. Below the defining
surface brightness threshold for a Low Surface Brightness galaxy (i.e. more
than 1 mag fainter than the 21.65 B-mag arcsec^(-2) Freeman value), the
early-type spiral galaxies have scale-lengths greater than 8-9 kpc, while the
late-type spiral galaxies have smaller scale-lengths. All galaxies have been
modelled with a seeing-convolved Sersic r^(1/n) bulge and exponential disk
model. We show that the trend of decreasing bulge shape parameter (n) with
increasing Hubble type and decreasing bulge-to-disk luminosity ratio, which has
been observed amongst the High Surface Brightness galaxies, extends to the Low
Surface Brightness galaxies, revealing a continuous range of structural
parameters.
