In order to map the 3-dimensional location and shape of the emission
originating within the accretion stream in AM Her systems, we have investigated
the possibilities of relaxing the hitherto-applied constraint of a
predetermined stream trajectory in modelling the eclipse profiles. We use
emission points which can be located anywhere in the Roche lobe of the primary,
together with a regularisation term which favours any curved stream structure,
connected at the secondary and white dwarf primary. Our results show that,
given suitable regularisation constraints, such inversion is feasible. We
investigate the effect of removing the regularisation term, and also the
sensitivity of the fit to input parameters such as inclination.
