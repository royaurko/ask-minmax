The ratios $r_{01}$ and $r_{10}$ of small to large separations of KIC 2837475
primarily exhibit an increase behavior in the observed frequency range. The
calculations indicate that only the models with overshooting parameter
$\delta_{\rm ov}$ between approximately 1.2 and 1.6 can reproduce the observed
ratios $r_{01}$ and $r_{10}$ of KIC 2837475. The ratios $r_{01}$ and $r_{10}$
of the frequency separations of p-modes with inner turning points that are
located in the overshooting region of convective core can exhibit an increase
behavior. The frequencies of the modes that can reach the overshooting region
decrease with the increase in $\delta_{\rm ov}$. Thus the ratio distributions
are more sensitive to $\delta_{\rm ov}$ than to other parameters. The increase
behavior of the KIC 2837475 ratios results from a direct effect of the
overshooting of convective core. The characteristic of the ratios provides a
strict constraint on stellar models. Observational constraints point to a star
with $M=1.490\pm0.018$ $M_{\odot}$, $R=1.67\pm0.01$ $R_{\odot}$, age
$=2.8\pm0.4$ Gyr, and $1.2\lesssim$ $\delta_{\rm ov}$ $\lesssim1.6$ for KIC
2837475.
