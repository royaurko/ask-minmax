One of the elements that have popularized and facilitated the use of
geographical information on a variety of computational applications has been
the use of Web maps; this has opened new research challenges on different
subjects, from locating places and people, the study of social behavior or the
analyzing of the hidden structures of the terms used in a natural language
query used for locating a place. However, the use of geographic information
under technological features is not new, instead it has been part of a
development and technological integration process. This paper presents a state
of the art review about the application of geographic information under
different approaches: its use on location based services, the collaborative
user participation on it, its contextual-awareness, its use in the Semantic Web
and the challenges of its use in natural languge queries. Finally, a prototype
that integrates most of these areas is presented.
