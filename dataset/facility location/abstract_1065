The CSR-LINAC injector has been proposed in Heavy Ion Research Facility in
Lanzhou (HIRFL). The linac mainly consists of two parts, the RFQ and the
IH-DTL. The KONUS (Kombinierte Null Grad Struktur) concept has been introduced
into the DTL section. In this paper, the re-matching of the main accelerating
section will be finished in the 3.7 MeV/u scheme and the new beam dynamics
design up to 7 MeV/u will be also shown. Through the beam re-matching, the
relative emittance growth has been suppressed greatly along the linac.
