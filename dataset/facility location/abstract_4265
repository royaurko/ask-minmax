This paper analyzes the spectral efficiency as a function of medium access
control (MAC) for large random spreading CDMA random access systems that employ
a linear receiver. It is shown that located at higher than the physical layer,
MAC along with spreading and power allocation can effectively perform spectral
efficiency maximization and near-far mitigation.
