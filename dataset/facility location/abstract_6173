The spectrum of integrable spin chains are shown to be independent of the
ordering of their spins. As an application we introduce defects (local spin
inhomogeneities in homogenous chains) in two-boundary spin systems and, by
changing their locations, we show the spectral equivalence of different
boundary conditions. In particular we relate certain nondiagonal boundary
conditions to diagonal ones.
