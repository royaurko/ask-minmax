For the production of a polarized antiproton beam various methods have been
suggested including the possibility that antiprotons may be produced polarized
which will be checked experimentally. The polarization of antiprotons produced
under typical conditions for antiproton beam preparation will be measured at
the CERN/PS. If the production process creates some polarization a polarized
antiproton beam could be prepared by a rather simple modification of the
antiproton beam facility. The detection setup and the expected experimental
conditions are described.
