It is argued that in relativistic heavy ion collisions, due to limited size
of the formed matter, the reliable criterion of critical point is finite-size
scaling, rather than non-monotonous behavior of observable. How to locate
critical point by finite-size scaling is proposed. The data of $\pt$
correlation from RHIC/STAR are analyzed. Critical points are likely observed
around $\sqrt s =62$ and 200 GeV. They could be, respectively, the transition
of deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration predicted by lattice-QCD.
Further confirmation with other observable and energies is suggested.
