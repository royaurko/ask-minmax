We report the results of a search for muon-neutrino disappearance by the Main
Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search. The experiment uses two detectors
separated by 734 km to observe a beam of neutrinos created by the Neutrinos at
the Main Injector facility at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The data
were collected in the first 282 days of beam operations and correspond to an
exposure of 1.27e20 protons on target. Based on measurements in the Near
Detector, in the absence of neutrino oscillations we expected 336 +/- 14
muon-neutrino charged-current interactions at the Far Detector but observed
215. This deficit of events corresponds to a significance of 5.2 standard
deviations. The deficit is energy dependent and is consistent with two-flavor
neutrino oscillations according to delta m-squared = 2.74e-3 +0.44/-0.26e-3
eV^2 and sin^2(2 theta) > 0.87 at 68% confidence level.
