The energy dependent Green's function for an interface Hamiltonian which
interpolates between two and three dimensions can be calculated explicitly.
This yields an expression for the density of states on the interface which
interpolates continuously between the two-dimensional behavior for high
energies and the three-dimensional behavior for low energies.
