A system is described that uses a mixed-level representation of (part of)
meaning of natural language documents (based on standard Horn Clause Logic) and
a variable-depth search strategy that distinguishes between the different
levels of abstraction in the knowledge representation to locate specific
passages in the documents. Mixed-level representations as well as
variable-depth search strategies are applicable in fields outside that of NLP.
