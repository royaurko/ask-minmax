Implicit particle filters for data assimilation update the particles by first
choosing probabilities and then looking for particle locations that assume
them, guiding the particles one by one to the high probability domain. We
provide a detailed description of these filters, with illustrative examples,
together with new, more general, methods for solving the algebraic equations
and with a new algorithm for parameter identification.
