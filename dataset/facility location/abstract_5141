Localization of radio frequency sources over multipath channels is a
difficult problem arising in applications such as outdoor or indoor gelocation.
Common approaches that combine ad-hoc methods for multipath mitigation with
indirect localization relying on intermediary parameters such as
time-of-arrivals, time difference of arrivals or received signal strengths,
provide limited performance. This work models the localization of known
waveforms over unknown multipath channels in a sparse framework, and develops a
direct approach in which multiple sources are localized jointly, directly from
observations obtained at distributed sources. The proposed approach exploits
channel properties that enable to distinguish line-of-sight (LOS) from non-LOS
signal paths. Theoretical guarantees are established for correct recovery of
the sources' locations by atomic norm minimization. A second-order cone-based
algorithm is developed to produce the optimal atomic decomposition, and it is
shown to produce high accuracy location estimates over complex scenes, in which
sources are subject to diverse multipath conditions, including lack of LOS.
