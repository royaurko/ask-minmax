In many applications of current interest, the observations are represented as
a signal defined over a graph. The analysis of such signals requires the
extension of standard signal processing tools. Building on the recently
introduced Graph Fourier Transform, the first contribution of this paper is to
provide an uncertainty principle for signals on graph. As a by-product of this
theory, we show how to build a dictionary of maximally concentrated signals on
vertex/frequency domains. Then, we establish a direct relation between
uncertainty principle and sampling, which forms the basis for a sampling
theorem for graph signals. Since samples location plays a key role in the
performance of signal recovery algorithms, we suggest and compare a few
alternative sampling strategies. Finally, we provide the conditions for perfect
recovery of a useful signal corrupted by sparse noise, showing that this
problem is also intrinsically related to vertex-frequency localization
properties.
