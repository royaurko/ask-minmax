Detachment of neutral cations/anions from solid alkali halides can in
principle be provoked by donating/subtracting electrons to the surface of
alkali halide crystals, but generally constitutes a very endothermic process.
However, the amount of energy required for emission is smaller for atoms
located in less favorable positions, such as surface steps and kinks. For a
corner ion in an alkali halide cube the binding is the weakest, so it should be
easier to remove that atom, once it is neutralized. We carried out first
principles density functional calculations and simulations of neutral and
charged NaCl nanocubes, to establish the energetics of extraction of
neutralized corner ions. Following hole donation (electron removal) we find
that detachment of neutral Cl corner atoms will require a limited energy of
about 0.8 eV. Conversely, following the donation of an excess electron to the
cube, a neutral Na atom is extractable from the corner at the lower cost of
about 0.6 eV. Since the cube electron affinity level (close to that a NaCl(100)
surface state, which we also determine) is estimated to lie about 1.8 eV below
vacuum, the overall energy balance upon donation to the nanocube of a zero
energy electron from vacuum will be exothermic. The atomic and electronic
structure of the NaCl(100) surface, and of the nanocube Na and Cl corner
vacancies are obtained and analyzed as a byproduct.
