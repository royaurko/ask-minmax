Computing practice today depends on visual output to drive almost all user
interaction. Other senses, such as audition, may be totally neglected, or used
tangentially, or used in highly restricted specialized ways. We have excellent
audio rendering through D-A conversion, but we lack rich general facilities for
modeling and manipulating sound comparable in quality and flexibility to
graphics. We need co-ordinated research in several disciplines to improve the
use of sound as an interactive information channel.
  Incremental and separate improvements in synthesis, analysis, speech
processing, audiology, acoustics, music, etc. will not alone produce the
radical progress that we seek in sonic practice. We also need to create a new
central topic of study in digital audio research. The new topic will assimilate
the contributions of different disciplines on a common foundation. The key
central concept that we lack is sound as a general-purpose information channel.
We must investigate the structure of this information channel, which is driven
by the co-operative development of auditory perception and physical sound
production. Particular audible encodings, such as speech and music, illuminate
sonic information by example, but they are no more sufficient for a
characterization than typography is sufficient for a characterization of visual
information.
