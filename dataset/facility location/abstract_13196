Asynchronous replication of the genome has been associated with different
rates of point mutation and copy number variation (CNV) in human populations.
Here, we explored if the bias in the generation of CNV that is associated to
DNA replication timing might have conditioned the birth of new protein-coding
genes during evolution. We show that genes that were duplicated during primate
evolution are more commonly found among the human genes located in
late-replicating CNV regions. We traced the relationship between replication
timing and the evolutionary age of duplicated genes. Strikingly, we found that
there is a significant enrichment of evolutionary younger duplicates in late
replicating regions of the human and mouse genome. Indeed, the presence of
duplicates in late replicating regions gradually decreases as the evolutionary
time since duplication extends. Our results suggest that the accumulation of
recent duplications in late replicating CNV regions is an active process
influencing genome evolution.
