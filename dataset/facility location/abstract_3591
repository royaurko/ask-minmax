Soft real-time applications require timely delivery of messages conforming to
the soft real-time constraints. Satisfying such requirements is a complex task
both due to the volatile nature of distributed environments, as well as due to
numerous domain-specific factors that affect message latency. Prompt detection
of the root-cause of excessive message delay allows a distributed system to
react accordingly. This may significantly improve compliance with the required
timeliness constraints.
  In this work, we present a novel approach for distributed performance
monitoring of soft-real time distributed systems. We propose to employ recent
distributed algorithms from the statistical signal processing and learning
domains, and to utilize them in a different context of online performance
monitoring and root-cause analysis, for pinpointing the reasons for violation
of performance requirements. Our approach is general and can be used for
monitoring of any distributed system, and is not limited to the soft real-time
domain.
  We have implemented the proposed framework in TransFab, an IBM prototype of
soft real-time messaging fabric. In addition to root-cause analysis, the
framework includes facilities to resolve resource allocation problems, such as
memory and bandwidth deficiency. The experiments demonstrate that the system
can identify and resolve latency problems in a timely fashion.
