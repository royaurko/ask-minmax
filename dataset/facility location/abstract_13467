By using fluid-kinetic simulations of confined and concentrated emulsion
droplets, we investigate the nature of space non-homogeneity in soft-glassy
dynamics and provide quantitative measurements of the statistical features of
plastic events in the proximity of the yield-stress threshold. Above the yield
stress, our results show the existence of a finite stress correlation scale,
which can be mapped directly onto the {\it cooperativity scale}, recently
introduced in the literature to capture non-local effects in the soft-glassy
dynamics. In this regime, the emergence of a separate boundary (wall) rheology
with higher fluidity than the bulk, is highlighted in terms of near-wall
spontaneous segregation of plastic events. Near the yield stress, where the
cooperative scale cannot be estimated with sufficient accuracy, the system
shows a clear increase of the stress correlation scale, whereas plastic events
exhibit intermittent clustering in time, with no preferential spatial location.
A quantitative measurement of the space-time correlation associated with the
motion of the interface of the droplets is key to spot the long-range amorphous
order at the yield stress threshold.
