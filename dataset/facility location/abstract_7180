We present deep optical B, V, R images of a sample of 10 interacting systems
which were selected for their resemblance to disturbed galaxies at high
redshift. Photometry is performed on knots in the tidal features of the
galaxies. We calculate a grid of evolutionary synthesis models with two
metallicities and various burst strengths for systems consisting of some
fraction of the stellar population of a progenitor spiral plus starburst. By
comparison with two-color diagrams we interpret the photometric data, select
from a total of about 100 condensations 36 star-forming objects that are
located in the tidal features and predict their further evolution. Being more
luminous by 4 mag than normal HII regions we argue that these objects could be
tidal dwarf galaxies or their progenitors, although they differ in number and
mean luminosity from the already known tidal dwarf galaxies typically located
at the end of tidal tails in nearby giant interacting systems. From comparison
with our models we note that all objects show young burst ages. The young
stellar component formed in these tidal dwarf candidates contributes up to 18%
to the total stellar mass at the end of the starburst and dominates the optical
luminosity. This may result in fading by up to 2.5 mag in B during the next 200
Myrs after the burst.
