We present the near- and mid-infrared zodiacal light spectrum obtained with
the AKARI Infra-Red Camera (IRC). A catalog of 278 spectra of the diffuse sky
covering a wide range of Galactic and ecliptic latitudes was constructed. The
wavelength range of this catalog is 1.8-5.3 {\mu}m with wavelength resolution
of \lambda /\Delta \lambda ~20. Advanced reduction methods specialized for the
slit spectroscopy of diffuse sky spectra are developed for constructing the
spectral catalog. Based on the comparison analysis of the spectra collected in
different seasons and ecliptic latitudes, we confirmed that the spectral shape
of the scattered component and the thermal emission component of the zodiacal
light in our wavelength range does not show any dependence on location and
time, but relative brightness between them varies with location. We also
confirmed that the color temperature of the zodiacal emission at 3-5 {\mu}m is
300+/-10 K at any ecliptic latitude. This emission is expected to be originated
from sub-micron dust particles in the interplanetary space.
