The TD-LTE system is envisaged to adopt dynamic time division duplexing (TDD)
transmissions for small cells to adapt their communication service to the fast
variation of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) traffic demands. However, different
DL/UL directions for the same subframe in adjacent cells will result in new
destructive interference components, i.e., eNB-to-eNB and UE-to-UE, with levels
that can significantly differ from one subframe to another. In this paper, a
feasible UL power control mechanism is proposed to manage eNB-to-eNB
interference, where different UL power control parameters are set based on
different interference level. We consider the geometric location information
and the subframe set selection process about adjacent eNBs when the
interference level is estimated. The performance of the proposed scheme is
evaluated through system level simulations and it is shown that the scheme can
achieve preferable improvement in terms of UL average and 5%-ile packet
throughputs compared with the original scheme without power control. Also, the
UE-to-UE interference is not worse when the UE transmit power become higher.
