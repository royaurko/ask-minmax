We report the detection of the 3.3 mu Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH)
feature in two Seyfert 1 galaxies - NGC 3227 and Mrk 766, and one QSO - Mrk
478, observed with SpeX at IRTF at a spectral resolution not previously
attained for this type of objects. Except for NGC 3227, this is the first time
that the 3.3 mu PAH emission is detected in Mrk 766 and Mrk 478. The widths of
the emission, reported also for the first time, are rather similar, ranging
from 450 A to 550 A. The luminosity of the 3.3 mu PAH emission measured in the
QSO Mrk 478 places it at a level similar of that found in starburst and
infrared luminous galaxies and implies that this object is having a vigorous
burst of star formation. The spatial resolution of the spectra allows us to
constrain the location of the star-forming region to the inner 1 Kpc for the
QSO and 150 pc for the Seyferts. Our results support the idea that these
objects resides in molecular gas-rich galaxies and that their observed infrared
excess is primarily due to star formation, as previously indicated by CO and
H_2 observations. We also report, for Mrk 1239, the presence of a broad
emission feature centred at 3.43 mu, not previosly detected in an extragalactic
object and whose origin is not yet clear.
