We found that the experimental results on transverse mass spectra of kaons
produced in central Pb+Pb (Au+Au) interactions show an anomalous dependence on
the collision energy. The inverse slopes of the spectra increase with energy in
the low (AGS) and high (RHIC) energy domains, whereas they are constant in the
intermediate (SPS) energy range. We argue that this anomaly is probably caused
by a modification of the equation of state in the transition region between
confined and deconfined matter. This observation may be considered as a new
signal, in addition to the previously reported anomalies in the pion and
strangeness production, of the onset of deconfinement located in the low SPS
energy domain.
