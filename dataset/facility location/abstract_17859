Large available bandwidth in 60\,GHz band promises very high data rates -- in
the order of Gb/s. However, high free-space path loss makes it necessary to
employ beamforming capable directional antennas. When beamforming is used, the
links are sensitive to misalignment in antenna directionality because of
movement of devices. To identify and circumvent the misalignments, we propose
to use the motion sensors (i.e., accelerometer and gyroscope) which are already
present in most of the modern mobile devices. By finding the extent of
misaligned beams, corrective actions are carried out to reconfigure the
antennas. Motion sensors on mobile devices provide means to estimate the extent
of misalignments. We collected real data from motion sensors and steer the
beams appropriately. The results from our study show that the sensors are
capable of detecting the cause of errors as translational or rotational
movements. Furthermore it is also shown that the sensor data can be used to
predict the next location of the user. This can be used to reconfigure the
directional antenna to switch the antenna beam directions and hence avoid
frequent link disruptions. This decreases the number of beam searches thus
lowering the MAC overhead.
