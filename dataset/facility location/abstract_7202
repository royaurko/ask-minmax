We present the first millimeter-wave aperture synthesis map of dust around a
main sequence star. A 3'' resolution image of 1.3 mm continuum emission from
Vega reveals a clump of emission 12'' from the star at PA 45 deg, consistent
with the location of maximum 850 micron emission in a lower resolution
JCMT/SCUBA map. The flux density is 4.0+/-0.9 mJy. Adjacent 1.3 mm peaks with
flux densities 3.4+/-1.0 mJy and 2.8+/-0.9 mJy are located 14'' and 13'' from
the star at PA 67 deg and 18 deg, respectively. An arc-like bridge connects the
two strongest peaks. There is an additional 2.4 +/-0.8 mJy peak to the SW 11''
from the star at PA 215 deg and a marginal detection, 1.4+/-0.5 mJy, at the
stellar position, consistent with photospheric emission. An extrapolation from
the 850 micron flux, assuming F_{1.3mm-0.85mm} proportional to lambda^{-2.8},
agrees well with the total detected flux for Vega at 1.3 mm, and implies a dust
emissivity index, beta, of 0.8. We conclude that we have detected all but a
very small fraction of the dust imaged by SCUBA in our aperture synthesis map
and that these grains are largely confined to segments of a ring of radius 95
AU.
