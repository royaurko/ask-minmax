We discuss an alternative approach to constrain the absolute bolometric
luminosity of Zero Age Horizontal Branch structures by using the observational
pulsational properties of ab type RR Lyrae stars and theoretical expectations
concerning both the relation connecting the pulsational properties of these
variables to their evolutionary ones, as luminosity, mass and effective
temperature and, also the location in the H-R diagram for the fundamental
pulsators instability strip boundaries. Since the main goal of this work is to
obtain an evaluation of the ZAHB bolometric luminosity as much as possible
independent on stellar evolution theory, we have minimized the use of
evolutionary prescriptions, being the only adopted evolutionary input the
allowed mass range for fundamental pulsators. Nevertheless, the effects on our
final results related to the use of these evolutionary prescriptions have been
carefully checked. The reliability of the suggested method to obtain the ZAHB
luminosity is shown by applying it to a selected sample of globular clusters
(GCs), whose heavy elements abundance covers almost all the complete GCs
metallicity range. The results obtained for the ZAHB bolometric luminosities
have been compared with evolutionary prescriptions on such quite important
quantity as given by recent evolutionary computations has been also performed.
The existence of evident mismatches between current results and some
evolutionary models has been verified and discussed.
