Multiple string matching is known as locating all the occurrences of a given
number of patterns in an arbitrary string. It is used in bio-computing
applications where the algorithms are commonly used for retrieval of
information such as sequence analysis and gene/protein identification.
Extremely large amount of data in the form of strings has to be processed in
such bio-computing applications. Therefore, improving the performance of
multiple string matching algorithms is always desirable. Multicore
architectures are capable of providing better performance by parallelizing the
multiple string matching algorithms. The Aho-Corasick algorithm is the one that
is commonly used in exact multiple string matching algorithms. The focus of
this paper is the acceleration of Aho-Corasick algorithm through a multicore
CPU based software implementation. Through our implementation and evaluation of
results, we prove that our method performs better compared to the state of the
art.
