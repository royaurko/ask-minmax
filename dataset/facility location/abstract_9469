Powerful radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars at high redshifts are
frequently associated with extended emission-line regions (EELRs). Here we
investigate the [O II] EELR around the quasar 3C 196 at z=0.871 using integral
field spectroscopy. We also detect extended [Ne II] emission at a distance of
about 30 kpc from the core. The emission is aligned with the radio hot spots
and shows a redshifted and a blueshifted component with a velocity difference
of ~800 km s^-1. The alignment effect and large velocities support the
hypothesis that the EELR is caused by a jet-cloud interaction, which is
furthermore indicated by the presence of a pronounced bend in the radio
emission at the location of the radio hot spots. We also report observations of
two other systems which do not show as clear indications of interactions. We
find a weaker alignment of an [O II] EELR from the z=0.927 quasar 3C 336, while
no EELR is found around the core-dominated quasar OI 363 at z=0.63.
