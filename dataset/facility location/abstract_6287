We report the first experimental evidence that electromagnetic coupling
between physically separated planar metal patterns located in parallel planes
provides for exceptionally strong polarization rotatory power if one pattern is
twisted in respect to the other, creating a 3D chiral object. In terms of
optical rotary power per sample of thickness equal to one wavelength, the
bi-layered structure rotates five orders of magnitude stronger than a
gyrotropic crystal of quartz in the visible spectrum. We also saw a signature
of negative refraction for circularly polarized waves propagating through the
chiral slab.
