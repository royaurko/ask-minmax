The production and acceleration of Radioactive Ion Beams (RIBs) is today an
area of intense interest. The history and development of RIB facilities in
Europe is presented, with discussion of both the in-flight and ISOL methods
used at different laboratories. The current status of present developments like
the SPIRAL II facility at GANIL and the FAIR in-flight facility at GSI are
briefly reviewed. Particular emphasis is given to the recent EURISOL
Feasibility Study for a European ISOL facility, and the present EURISOL Design
Study.
