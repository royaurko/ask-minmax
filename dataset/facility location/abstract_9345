Analysis of the experimental data of joint Russian - Hungarian research was
carried out at Tien Shan station on the search of sources of primary cosmic
rays (PCR) at energies 0.1-1.0 PeV. Maps of extensive air shower arrival
directions were presented where the standard deviation of mean event numbers in
equatorial co-ordinates exceeded a definite value. The excess of EAS number was
observed from an Galaxy object - the SN remnant and some other directions. The
young pulsar PSR 0656+14 located near the centre of this object.
