We report on the results of an EPIC XMM-Newton observation of the faint
source SAXJ1748.2-2808 and the surrounding field. This source was discovered
during the BeppoSAX Galactic center survey performed in 1997-1998. A spatial
analysis resulted in the detection of 31 sources within the EPIC field of view.
SAXJ1748.2-2808 is clearly resolved into 2 sources in EPIC images with the
brighter contributing almost 80% of the 2-10keV flux. Spectral fits to this
main source are consistent with an absorbed power-law with a photon index of
1.4+/-0.5 and absorption equivalent to 14E22cm-2 together with an iron line at
6.6+/-0.2 keV with an equivalent width of ~780eV. The significantly better
statistics of the XMM-Newton observation, compared with BeppoSAX,allows to
exclude a thermal nature for the X-ray emission. A comparison with other
observations of SAXJ1748.2-2808 does not reveal any evidence for spectral or
intensity long-term variability. Based on these properties we propose that the
source is a low-luminosity high-mass X-ray binary located in the Galactic
center region.
