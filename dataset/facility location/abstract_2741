A neutrino factory storage ring can provide beams to various locations. We
discuss the ICANOE detector (at LNGS) at one such site. We then describe the
prospects for the use of the underground location at Carlsbad, NM for a
neutrino factory detector. A brief discussion is given of a simple magnetized
Fe detector of 10 50 kT for this site.
