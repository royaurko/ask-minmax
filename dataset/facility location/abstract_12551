We would like to show the existence of finite energy SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs
particles of one-half topological charge. The magnetic fields of these
solutions at spatial infinity correspond to the magnetic field of a positive
one-half magnetic monopole located at the origin and a semi-infinite Dirac
string which carries a magnetic flux of $\frac{2\pi}{g}$ going into the center
of the sphere at infinity. Hence the net magnetic charge of the configuration
is zero. The solutions possess gauge potentials that are singular along
one-half of the z-axis, elsewhere they are regular. There are two distinct
configurations of these particles with different total energies and magnetic
dipole moments. Their total energies are found to increase with the strength of
the Higgs field self-coupling constant $\lambda$.
