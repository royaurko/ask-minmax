The Leja method is a polynomial interpolation procedure that can be used to
compute matrix functions. In particular, computing the action of the matrix
exponential on a given vector is a typical application. This quantity is
required, e.g., in exponential integrators.
  The Leja method essentially depends on three parameters: the scaling
parameter, the location of the interpolation points, and the degree of
interpolation. We present here a backward error analysis that allows us to
determine these three parameters as a function of the prescribed accuracy.
Additional aspects that are required for an efficient and reliable
implementation are discussed. Numerical examples that illustrate the
performance of our Matlab code are included.
