We present new 21-cm HI observations performed with ATCA of the large HI
filament located about 15 kpc NE from the centre of Centaurus A and discovered
by Schiminovich et al.(1994). This HI cloud is situated (in projection) near
the radio jet of Centaurus A, as well as near a large filament of ionised gas
of high excitation and turbulent velocities and near regions with young stars.
The higher velocity and spatial resolution of the new data reveals that, apart
from the smooth velocity gradient corresponding to the overall rotation of the
cloud around Centaurus A, HI with anomalous velocities of about 100 km/s is
present at the southern tip of this cloud. This is interpreted as evidence for
an ongoing interaction between the radio jet and the HI cloud. Gas stripped
from the HI cloud gives rise to the large filament of ionised gas and the star
formation regions that are found downstream from the location of the
interaction. The implied flow velocities are very similar to the observed
anomalous HI velocities. Given the amount of HI with anomalous kinematics and
the current star formation rate, the efficiency of jet-induced star formation
is at most of the order of a percent.
