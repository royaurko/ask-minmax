Duality between N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories(Seiberg's duality) is
geometrized, in the framework of AdS/CFT correspodences. It is shown that
Seiberg's duality corresponds to monodromy of wrapped D5 branes on the homology
cycles of a generalized conifold where D3 branes are located. The celebrated
\tilde{N}_c=N_f-N_c, \tilde{N}_f=N_f rule is reproduced and a braid group
structure in a sequence of dualities, is found.
