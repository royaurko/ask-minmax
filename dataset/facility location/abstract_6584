In this paper, we propose an efficient mobility control algorithm for the
downlink multi-cell orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA)
system for co-channel interference reduction. It divides each cell into several
areas. The mobile nodes in each area find their own optimal position according
to their present location. Both the signal to interference plus noise ratio
(SINR) and the capacity for each node are increased by the proposed mobility
control algorithm. Simulation results say that, even the frequency reuse factor
(FRF) is equal to 1, the average capacity is improved after applying the
mobility control algorithm, compared to existing partial frequency reuse (PFR)
scheme.
