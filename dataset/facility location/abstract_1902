A new neutron detector based on Micromegas technology has been developed for
the measurement of the simulated neutron spectrum in the ADS project. After the
presentation of simulated neutron spectra obtained in the interaction of 140
MeV protons with the spallation target inside the TRIGA core, a full
description of the new detector configuration is given. The advantage of this
detector compared to conventional neutron flux detectors and the results
obtained with the first prototype at the CELINA 14 MeV neutron source facility
at CEA-Cadarache are presented. The future developments of operational
Piccolo-Micromegas for fast neutron reactors are also described.
