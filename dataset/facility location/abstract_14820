The pulsar PSR J0631+1036 was discovered during a radio search of Einstein
X-ray source error circles. A detection of a 288ms sinusoidal modulation in the
ASCA lightcurve, the same period as the radio pulsar, appeared to confirm the
association of the X-ray source and the pulsar. Its X-ray spectrum was said to
be similar to that of middle aged gamma-ray pulsars such as Geminga. However,
an XMM-Newton observation of the PSR J0631+1035 field, along with a re-analysis
of VLA data confirming the timing position of the pulsar, show a 75''
discrepancy in location of the X-ray source and the pulsar, and therefore these
cannot be the same object. The X-ray source appears to be the counterpart of an
A0 star, detected by the XMM-Newton Optical Monitor. No 288ms period was
detected from either the area around the pulsar or the bright X-ray source. The
upper limit on the X-ray luminosity with relation to the empirically observed
correlation between radio measured dE/dt and X-ray luminosity is discussed.
