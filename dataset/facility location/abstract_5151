The distribution of local gravitational potentials generated by a complete
volume-limited sample of galaxy groups and clusters filling the Corona Borealis
region has been analyzed. Mapping such a distribution as a function of spatial
posi-tions, the deepest potential wells trace unambiguously the locations of
the densest cluster clumps within the selected sample providing the physical
keys to disentangle a still open issue regarding the true extent and cluster
membership of the well-known region of the Corona Borealis Supercluster. The
two deepest potential wells found at R.A. ~ 230{\deg}, Decl. ~ 29{\deg} and z ~
.074 and, R.A. ~ 240{\deg}, Decl. ~ 28{\deg} and z ~ .09 correspond to very
close and massive clumps of galaxy groups and clusters similar to a binary-like
system lying in the central part of the Corona Borealis region. The first clump
matches the location of the supercluster commonly referred to as Corona
Borealis, while its more massive com-panion is centrally dominated by the
cluster A2142, one of the richest clusters found by Abell (1961). To a first
approx-imation, this binary-like system seems gravitationally bound favoring
the idea that the region apparently dominated by the Corona Borealis
Supercluster is more massive and extended than commonly believed in literature.
