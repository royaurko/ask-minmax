We introduce genetic algorithms as a means to estimate the accuracy required
to discriminate among different models using experimental observables. We
exemplify the technique in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard
model. If supersymmetric particles are discovered, models of supersymmetry
breaking will be fit to the observed spectrum and it is beneficial to ask
beforehand: what accuracy is required to always allow the discrimination of two
particular models and which are the most important masses to observe? Each
model predicts a bounded patch in the space of observables once unknown
parameters are scanned over. The questions can be answered by minimising a
"distance" measure between the two hypersurfaces. We construct a distance
measure that scales like a constant fraction of an observable.
  Genetic algorithms, including concepts such as natural selection, fitness and
mutations, provide a solution to the minimisation problem. We illustrate the
efficiency of the method by comparing three different classes of string models
for which the above questions could not be answered with previous techniques.
The required accuracy is in the range accessible to the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) when combined with a future linear collider (LC) facility. The technique
presented here can be applied to more general classes of models or observables.
