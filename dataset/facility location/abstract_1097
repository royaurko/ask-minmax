We attempt to simulate the heterogeneous nucleation of ice at model
silver-iodide surfaces and find relatively facile ice nucleation and growth at
the Ag+ termi nated basal face, but never see nucleation at the I- terminated
basal face or the prism and normal faces. Water molecules strongly adsorb onto
the Ag+ terminate d face to give a well-ordered hexagonal ice-like bilayer that
then acts as a template for further ice growth.
