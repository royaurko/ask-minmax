We consider a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in a harmonic potential
under the influence of a homogeneous magnetic field. We investigate spatial and
spin structure of the mean-field ground states under constraints on the number
of atoms and the total magnetization. We show that the trapping potential can
make the antiferromagnetic condensate separate into three, and ferromagnetic
condensate into two distinct phases. In the ferromagnetic case, the
magnetization is located in the center of the harmonic trap, while in the
antiferromagnetic case magnetized phases appear in the outer regions. We
describe how the transition from the Thomas-Fermi regime to the single-mode
approximation regime with decreasing number of atoms results in the
disappearance of the domains. We suggest that the ground states can be created
in experiment by adiabatically changing the magnetic field strength.
