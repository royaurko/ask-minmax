We study both bosonic and supersymmetric (p,q) minimal models coupled to
Liouville theory using the ground ring and the various branes of the theory.
  From the FZZT brane partition function, there emerges a unified, geometric
description of all these theories in terms of an auxiliary Riemann surface
M_{p,q} and the corresponding matrix model. In terms of this geometric
description, both the FZZT and ZZ branes correspond to line integrals of a
certain one-form on M_{p,q}. Moreover, we argue that there are a finite number
of distinct (m,n) ZZ branes, and we show that these ZZ branes are located at
the singularities of M_{p,q}. Finally, we discuss the possibility that the
bosonic and supersymmetric theories with (p,q) odd and relatively prime are
identical, as is suggested by the unified treatment of these models.
