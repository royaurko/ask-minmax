It has been known theoretically that localized states exist around zigzag
edges of a graphite ribbon and of a carbon nanotube, whose energy eigenvalues
are located between conduction and valence bands. We found that in metallic
single-walled zigzag carbon nanotubes two of the localized states become
critical, and that their localization length is sensitive to the mean curvature
of a tube and can be controlled by the Aharonov-Bohm flux. The curvature
induced mini-gap closes by the relatively weak magnetic field. Conductance
measurement in the presence of the Aharonov-Bohm flux can give information
about the curvature effect and the critical states.
