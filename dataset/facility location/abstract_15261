We present ESO-NTT low resolution spectroscopy of the neutron star X-ray
transient Cen X-4 in quiescence over a complete orbital cycle. Our data reveal
the presence of a K3-7 V companion which contributes 63% to the 5600-6900A flux
and orbits the neutron star with a velocity semi-amplitude of K_2=145.8 +/- 1.0
km s^{-1}. This, combined with a previous determination of the inclination
angle and mass ratio, yields a neutron star and companion mass of M_1=1.5 +/-
1.0 M_Sun and M_2=0.31 +/- 0.27 M_Sun, respectively. The mass donor is thus
undermassive for the inferred spectral type indicating it is probably evolved,
in agreement with previous studies. Doppler tomography of the H_alpha line
shows prominent emission located on the companion and a slightly asymmetric
accretion disc distribution similar to that seen in systems with precessing
eccentric discs. Strong H_alpha emission from the companion can be explained by
X-ray irradiation from the primary. No evidence is found for a hot spot in
H_alpha, whereas one is revealed via Doppler tomography of the HeI lines. This
can be interpreted as the hot spot and outer regions of the disc being at a
higher temperature than in other systems.
