In this paper we will study the numerical solution of a discontinuous
differential system by a Rosenbrock method. We will also focus on one-sided
approach in the context of Rosenbrock schemes, and we will suggest a technique
based on the use of continuous extension, in order to locate the event point,
with an application to discontinuous singularly perturbed systems.
