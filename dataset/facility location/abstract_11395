Graphene is formed on SiC(000-1) surfaces (the so-called C-face of the
crystal) by annealing in vacuum, with the resulting films characterized by
atomic force microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, scanning Auger microscopy
and Raman spectroscopy. Morphology of these films is compared with the graphene
films grown on SiC(0001) surfaces (the Si-face). Graphene forms a terraced
morphology on the C-face, whereas it forms with a flatter morphology on the
Si-face. It is argued that this difference occurs because of differing
interface structures in the two cases. For certain SiC wafers, nanocrystalline
graphite is found to form on top of the graphene.
