The XMM satellite has a scientific payload of 3 EPIC and 2 RGS instruments
which provide for both imaging and non-dispersive spectroscopy as well as
medium-to-high resolution dispersive spectroscopy, in the soft to medium X-ray
bands. The co-aligned OM adds the facility for simultaneous optical and UV
studies. In this poster paper we describe the instrumental characteristics of
XMM, comparing them to those of ASCA. We also forecast the expected X-ray
spectra of a selection of both the Polars and Intermediate Polars by means of
simulations based on ASCA model fits.
