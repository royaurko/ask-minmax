The young massive stellar object G35.20-0.74 was observed in the mid-infrared
using T-ReCS on Gemini South. Previous observations have shown that the near
infrared emission has a fan-like morphology that is consistent with emission
from the northern lobe of a bipolar radio jet known to be associated with this
source. Mid-infrared observations presented in this paper show a monopolar
jet-like morphology as well, and it is argued that the mid-infrared emission
observed is dominated by thermal continuum emission from dust. The mid-infrared
emission nearest the central stellar source is believed to be directly heated
dust on the walls of the outflow cavity. The hydroxyl, water, and methanol
masers associated with G35.20-0.74 are spatially located along these
mid-infrared cavity walls. Narrow jet or outflow cavities such as this may also
be the locations of the linear distribution of methanol masers that are found
associated with massive young stellar objects. The fact that G35.20-0.74 has
mid-infrared emission that is dominated by the outflow, rather than disk
emission, is a caution to those that consider mid-infrared emission from young
stellar objects as only coming from circumstellar disks.
