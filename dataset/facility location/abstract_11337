The Casimir effect of a piston for massless scalar fields which satisfy
Dirichlet boundary conditions in the context of five-dimensional
Randall-Sundrum models is studied. In these scenarios we derive and calculate
the expression for the Casimir force on the piston. We also discuss the Casimir
force in the limit that one outer plate is moved to the remote place to show
that the nature of the reduced force between the parallel plates left. In the
Randall-Sundrum model involving two branes the two plates attract each other
when they locate very close, but the reduced Casimir force turns to be
repulsive as the plates separation is not extremely tiny, which is against the
experimental phenomena. In the case of one brane model the shape of the reduced
Casimir force is similar to that of the standard two-parallel-system in the
four-dimensional flat spacetimes while the sign of force remains negative.
