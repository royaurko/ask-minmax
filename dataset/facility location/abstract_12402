We study the numerical convergence of hydrodynamical simulations of
self-gravitating accretion discs, in which a simple cooling law is balanced by
shock heating. It is well-known that there exists a critical cooling time scale
for which shock heating can no longer compensate for the energy losses, at
which point the disc fragments. The numerical convergence of previous results
of this critical cooling time scale was questioned recently using Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). We employ a two-dimensional grid-based code to
study this problem, and find that for smooth initial conditions, fragmentation
is possible for slower cooling as the resolution is increased, in agreement
with recent SPH results. We show that this non-convergence is at least partly
due to the creation of a special location in the disc, the boundary between the
turbulent and the laminar region, when cooling towards a gravito-turbulent
state. Converged results appear to be obtained in setups where no such sharp
edges appear, and we then find a critical cooling time scale of ~ 4
$\Omega^{-1}$, where $\Omega$ is the local angular velocity.
