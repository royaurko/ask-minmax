The problem studied in this paper is ultrasound image reconstruction from
frequency-domain measurements of the scattered field from an object with
contrast in attenuation and sound speed. The case where the object has uniform
but unknown contrast in these properties relative to the background is
considered. Background clutter is taken into account in a physically realistic
manner by considering an exact scattering model for randomly located small
scatterers that vary in sound speed. The resulting statistical characteristics
of the interference is incorporated into the imaging solution, which includes
applying a total-variation minimization based approach where the relative
effect of perturbation in sound speed to attenuation is included as a
parameter. Convex optimization methods provide the basis for the reconstruction
algorithm. Numerical data for inversion examples are generated by solving the
discretized Lippman-Schwinger equation for the object and speckle-forming
scatterers in the background. A statistical model based on the Born
approximation is used for reconstruction of the object profile. Results are
presented for a two dimensional problem in terms of classification performance
and compared to minimum-l2-norm reconstruction. Classification using the
proposed method is shown to be robust down to a signal-to-clutter ratio of less
than 1 dB.
