We have systematically studied the X-ray emission properties of globular
cluster millisecond pulsars in order to evaluate their spectral properties and
luminosities in a uniform way. Cross-correlating the radio timing positions of
the cluster pulsars with the high resolution Chandra images revealed 31 X-ray
counterparts identified in nine different globular cluster systems, including
those in 47 Tuc. Timing analysis has been performed for all sources
corresponding to the temporal resolution available in the archival Chandra
data. Making use of unpublished data on M28, M4 and NGC 6752 allowed us to
obtain further constraints for the millisecond pulsar counterparts located in
these clusters. Counting rate and energy flux upper limits were computed for
those 36 pulsars for which no X-ray counterparts could be detected. Comparing
the X-ray and radio pulse profiles of PSR J1821-2452 in M28 and the 47 Tuc
pulsars PSR J0024-7204D,O,R indicated some correspondence between both
wavebands. The X-ray efficiency of the globular cluster millisecond pulsars was
found to be in good agreement with the efficiency Lx ~ 10^-3 Edot observed in
Galactic field rotation-powered pulsars. Millisecond pulsars in the galactic
plane and in globular clusters appear to show no distinct differences in their
X-ray emission properties.
