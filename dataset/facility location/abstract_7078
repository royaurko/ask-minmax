Multivariate geostatistics is based on modelling all covariances between all
possible combinations of two or more variables and their locations in a
continuously indexed domain. Multivariate spatial covariance models need to be
built with care, since any covariance matrix that is derived from such a model
has to be nonnegative-definite. In this article, we develop a conditional
approach for model construction. Starting with bivariate spatial covariance
models, we demonstrate the approach's generality, including its connection to
regression and to multivariate models defined by spatial networks. We
demonstrate the fitting of such models on a minimum-maximum temperature
dataset.
