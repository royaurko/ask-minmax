We present here a cost effective framework for a robust scalable and
distributed job processing system that adapts to the dynamic computing needs
easily with efficient load balancing for heterogeneous systems. The design is
such that each of the components are self contained and do not depend on each
other. Yet, they are still interconnected through an enterprise message bus so
as to ensure safe, secure and reliable communication based on transactional
features to avoid duplication as well as data loss. The load balancing,
fault-tolerance and failover recovery are built into the system through a
mechanism of health check facility and a queue based load balancing. The system
has a centralized repository with central monitors to keep track of the
progress of various job executions as well as status of processors in
real-time. The basic requirement of assigning a priority and processing as per
priority is built into the framework. The most important aspect of the
framework is that it avoids the need for job migration by computing the target
processors based on the current load and the various cost factors. The
framework will have the capability to scale horizontally as well as vertically
to achieve the required performance, thus effectively minimizing the total cost
of ownership.
