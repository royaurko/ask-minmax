The main goal of our project is to obtain a complete picture of individual
open clusters from homogeneous data and then search for correlations between
their astrophysical parameters. The near-infrared JHKS photometric data from
the 2-Micron All Sky Survey were used to determine new coordinates of the
centres, angular sizes and radial density profiles for 849 open clusters in the
Milky Way. Additionally, age, reddening, distance, and linear sizes were also
derived for 754 of them. For these open clusters our results are in
satisfactory agreement with the literature data. The analysed sample contains
open clusters with ages in the range from 7 Myr to 10 Gyr. The majority of
these clusters are located up to 3 kpc from the Sun, less than 0.4 kpc from the
Galactic Plane and 6 - 12 kpc from the Galactic Centre. The majority of
clusters have core radii of about 1.5 pc and the limiting radii of the order of
10 pc. We notice that in the near-infrared, open clusters seem to be greater
than in optical bands. We notice that a paucity of clusters is observed at
Galactic longitudes range from 140{\deg} to 200{\deg} which probably reflects
the real spatial distribution of open clusters in the Galaxy. The lack of
clusters was also found in earlier studies.
