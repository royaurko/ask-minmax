We have produced radio maps, using the ATCA, of the central regions of six
southern Seyfert 2 galaxies (NGC 1365, 4945, 6221, 6810, 7582, and Circinus)
with circumnuclear star formation, to estimate the relative contribution of
star formation activity compared to activity from the active galactic nucleus
(AGN). The radio morphologies range from extended diffuse structures to compact
nuclear emission, with no evidence, even in the relatively compact sources, for
synchrotron self--absorption. In each case the radio to far--infrared (FIR)
ratio has a value consistent with star formation, and in all but one case the
radio to [FeII] ratio is also consistent with star formation. We derive
supernova rates and conclude that, despite the presence of a Seyfert nucleus in
these galaxies, the radio, FIR, and [FeII] line emission are dominated by
processes associated with the circumnuclear star formation (i.e. supernova
remnants and HII regions) rather than with the AGN.
