For a body with negligible mass moving in the gravitational field of a star
and one planet in a circular orbit (the circular restricted three-body problem)
five equilibrium points exist and are known as the Lagrangian points. The
positions of the Lagrangian points are not valid for dust particles because in
the derivation of the Lagrangian points is assumed that no other forces beside
the gravitation act on the body with negligible mass. Here we determined
positions of the equilibrium points for the dust particles in the circular
restricted three-body problem with radiation. The equilibrium points are
located on curves connecting the Lagrangian points in the circular restricted
three-body problem. The equilibrium points for Jupiter are distributed in large
interval of heliocentric distances due to its large mass. The equilibrium
points for the Earth explain a cloud of dust particles trailing the Earth
observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The dust particles moving in the
equilibrium points are distributed in interplanetary space according to their
properties.
