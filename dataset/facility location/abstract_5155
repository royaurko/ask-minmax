Deployment of high-penetration photovoltaic (PV) power is expected to have a
range of effects -- both positive and negative -- on the distribution grid. The
magnitude of these effects may vary greatly depending upon feeder topology,
climate, PV penetration level, and other factors. In this paper we present a
simulation study of eight representative distribution feeders in three
California climates at PV penetration levels up to 100\%, supported by a unique
database of distributed PV generation data that enables us to capture the
impact of PV variability on feeder voltage and voltage regulating equipment.
When comparing the influence of feeder location (i.e. climate) versus feeder
type on outcomes, we find that location more strongly influences the incidence
of reverse power flow, reductions in peak loading and the presence of voltage
excursions. On the other hand, we find that feeder characteristics more
strongly influence the magnitude of loss reduction and changes in voltage
regulator operations. We find that secondary distribution transformer aging is
negligibly affected in almost all scenarios.
