The SNO+ liquid scintillator experiment is under construction in the SNOLAB
facility in Canada. The success of this experiment relies upon accurate
characterization of the liquid scintillator, linear alkylbenzene (LAB). In this
paper, scintillation decay times for alpha and electron excitations in LAB with
2 g/L PPO are presented for both oxygenated and deoxygenated solutions. While
deoxygenation is expected to improve pulse shape discrimination in liquid
scintillators, it is not commonly demonstrated in the literature. This paper
shows that for linear alkylbenzene, deoxygenation improves discrimination
between electron and alpha excitations in the scintillator.
