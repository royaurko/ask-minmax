Business process management (BPM) is moving from a niche market into the
mainstream. One of the factors leading to this transformation is the emergence
of very powerful rapid solutions development tools for creating BPM solutions
(BPM RSD). It has been widely recognized that this facility is important for
achieving benefits quickly. Similar benefits are attributed to the agile
software movement, but BPM RSD differs in that the objective is to reduce the
need for custom software development. As the BPM RSD features of some of the
current business process management suites (BPMS) products have matured,
additional benefits have emerged that fundamentally change the way we approach
solutions in this space.
