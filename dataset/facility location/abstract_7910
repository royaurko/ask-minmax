The MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR will search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay
of the 76Ge isotope with a mixed array of enriched and natural germanium
detectors. The observation of this rare decay would indicate the neutrino is
its own anti-particle, demonstrate that lepton number is not conserved, and
provide information on the absolute mass-scale of the neutrino. The
DEMONSTRATOR is being assembled at the 4850 foot level of the Sanford
Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota. The array will be
contained in a low-background environment and surrounded by passive and active
shielding. The goals for the DEMONSTRATOR are: demonstrating a background rate
less than 3 t$^{-1}$ y$^{-1}$ in the 4 keV region of interest (ROI) surrounding
the 2039 keV 76Ge endpoint energy; establishing the technology required to
build a tonne-scale germanium based double-beta decay experiment; testing the
recent claim of observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay [H. V.
Klapdor-Kleingrothaus and I. V. Krivosheina, Mod. Phys. Lett. A21, 1547
(2006)]; and performing a direct search for light WIMPs (3-10 GeV).
