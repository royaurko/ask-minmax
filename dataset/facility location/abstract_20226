Recent work has exploited pulsar survey data to identify temporally isolated,
millisecond-duration radio bursts with large dispersion measures (DMs). These
bursts have been interpreted as arising from a population of extragalactic
sources, in which case they would provide unprecedented opportunities for
probing the intergalactic medium; they may also be linked to new source
classes. Until now, however, all so-called fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been
detected with the Parkes radio telescope and its 13-beam receiver, casting some
concern about the astrophysical nature of these signals. Here we present FRB
121102, the first FRB discovery from a geographic location other than Parkes.
FRB 121102 was found in the Galactic anti-center region in the 1.4-GHz Pulsar
ALFA survey with the Arecibo Observatory with a DM = 557.4 $\pm$ 3 pc
cm$^{-3}$, pulse width of $3\; \pm 0.5$ ms, and no evidence of interstellar
scattering. The observed delay of the signal arrival time with frequency agrees
precisely with the expectation of dispersion through an ionized medium. Despite
its low Galactic latitude ($b = -0.2^{\circ}$), the burst has three times the
maximum Galactic DM expected along this particular line-of-sight, suggesting an
extragalactic origin. A peculiar aspect of the signal is an inverted spectrum;
we interpret this as a consequence of being detected in a sidelobe of the ALFA
receiver. FRB 121102's brightness, duration, and the inferred event rate are
all consistent with the properties of the previously detected Parkes bursts.
