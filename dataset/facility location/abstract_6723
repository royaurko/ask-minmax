We consider several WLAN stations associated at rates r1, r2, ..., rk with an
Access Point. Each station is downloading a long file from a local server,
located on the LAN to which the AP is attached. We model these simultaneous
TCP-controlled transfers using a Markov Chain. Our analytical approach leads to
a procedure to compute aggregate download throughput numerically, and the
results match simulations very well.
