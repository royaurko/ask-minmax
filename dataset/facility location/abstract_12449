Continuing to estimate the Direction-of-arrival (DOA) of the signals
impinging on the antenna array, even when a few elements of the underlying
Uniform Linear Antenna Array (ULA) fail to work will be of practical interest
in RADAR, SONAR and Wireless Radio Communication Systems. This paper proposes a
new technique to estimate the DOAs when a few elements are malfunctioning. The
technique combines Singular Value Thresholding (SVT) based Matrix Completion
(MC) procedure with the Direct Data Domain (D^3) based Matrix Pencil (MP)
Method. When the element failure is observed, first, the MC is performed to
recover the missing data from failed elements, and then the MP method is used
to estimate the DOAs. We also, propose a very simple technique to detect the
location of elements failed, which is required to perform MC procedure. We
provide simulation studies to demonstrate the performance and usefulness of the
proposed technique. The results indicate a better performance, of the proposed
DOA estimation scheme under different antenna failure scenarios.
