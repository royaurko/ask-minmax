We analyze total and polarized intensity images of the quasar 3C 454.3
obtained monthly with the VLBA at 43 GHz within the ongoing Boston U.
monitoring program of gamma-ray blazars started in June 2007. The data are
supplemented by VLBA observations performed during intense campaigns of 2 week
duration when the quasar was observed 3 times per campaign. We find a strong
increase of activity in the parsec-scale jet of the quasar during high
gamma-ray states in December 2009, April 2010, and November 2010. We detect new
superluminal knots, K09 and K10, associated with the autumn 2009 and 2010
outbursts, respectively, and compare their kinematic parameters. We analyze
optical polarimetric behavior along with polarization parameters of the
parsec-scale jet and outline similarities and differences in polarization
properties across wavelengths. The results of the analysis support the
conclusions that the optical polarized emission is produced in a region located
in the vicinity of the mm-wave core of the jet of the quasar, and that the
gamma-ray outbursts occur when a superluminal disturbance passes through the
core.
