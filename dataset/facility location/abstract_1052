The study of heavy-ion collisions has currently unprecedented opportunities
with two first class facilities, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at
BNL and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, and five large experiments
ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, PHENIX and STAR producing a wealth of high quality data.
Selected results recently obtained are presented on the study of flow, energy
loss and direct photons.
