In February 2000, the International Committee for Future Accelerators
initiated a study of a new model for international collaboration on a future
large accelerator project, the Global Accelerator Network. The study is based
on a model of a facility, which is remote from most of the collaborating
institutions. It is designed, built and operated by a collaboration of equal
partner institutions distributed around the world. According to this model, the
expert-staff from each laboratory remains based at their home institution but
continues to participate in the operation of the machine after construction.
This report summarizes the conclusions of the Task Force on Remote Operation,
which investigated the general and technical implications of far-remote
operations.
