We propose a novel experimental setup for the determination of the leptonic
CP-violating phase delta using the decay at rest (DAR) of mu+ from a single
source located at distances of 10 and 30 km from two 20 kton organic liquid
scintillator detectors. The mu+ are created by bombarding a target with a 9 mA
beam of 800 MeV protons. With this proposal delta can be determined with a
precision of about 20 (15) degrees in 6 (12) years. In contrast with the
DAEdALUS project, only a single source is required and it runs with a duty
factor of 100 percent. Therefore 9 mA is the maximum instanteous current,
greatly reducing both the technological challenges and the costs.
