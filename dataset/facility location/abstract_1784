Double differential cross sections (DDCS) for light charged particles
(proton, deuteron, triton, 3He, alpha) and neutrons produced by a proton beam
impinging on a 238U target at 62.9 MeV were measured at the CYCLONE facility in
Louvain-la-Neuve (Belgium). These measurements have been performed using two
independent experimental set-ups ensuring neutron (DeMoN counters) and light
charged particles (Si-Si-CsI telescopes) detection. The charged particle data
were measured at 11 different angular positions from 25 degrees to 140 degrees
allowing the determination of angle differential, energy differential and total
production cross sections.
