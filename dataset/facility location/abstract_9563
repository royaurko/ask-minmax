We present semi-analytical and numerical models, accounting for the impact of
radiative cooling on the hydrodynamics of the matter reinserted as strong
stellar winds and supernovae within the volume occupied by young, massive and
compact superstellar clusters. First of all we corroborate the location of the
threshold line in the mechanical energy input rate vs the cluster size plane,
found by Silich et al. (2004). Such a line separates clusters able to drive a
quasi-adiabatic or a strongly radiative wind from clusters in which
catastrophic cooling occurs within the star cluster volume. Then we show that
the latter, clusters above the threshold line, undergo a bimodal behavior in
which the central densest zones cool rapidly and accumulate the injected matter
to eventually feed further generations of star formation, while the outer zones
are still able to drive a stationary wind. The results are presented into a
series of universal dimensionless diagrams from which one can infer: the size
of the two zones, the fraction of the deposited mass that goes into each of
them and the luminosity of the resultant winds, for clusters of all sizes and
energy input rates, regardless the assumed adiabatic terminal speed V_A.
