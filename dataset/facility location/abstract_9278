In this paper we will discuss the problem of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays
(UHECR) and show that the idea of a Single Source Model established by Erlykin
and Wolfendale (1997) to explain the features seen in cosmic ray energy spectra
around the 10**15 eV region can be successfully applied also for the much
higher energies. The propagation of UHECR (of energies higher than 10**19 eV)
in extragalactic magnetic fields can no longer be described as a random walk
(diffusion) process and the transition to rectilinear propagation gives a
possible explanation for the so-called Greisen-Zatzepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cut-off
which still remains an open question after almost 40 years. A transient "single
source" located at a particular distance and producing UHECR for a finite time
is the proposed solution.
