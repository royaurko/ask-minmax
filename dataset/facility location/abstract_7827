The goal of this work is to develop a numerical simulation that accurately
captures the biomechanical response of bacterial biofilms and their associated
extracellular matrix (ECM). In this, the second of a two-part effort, the
primary focus is on formally presenting the heterogeneous rheology Immersed
Boundary Method (hrIBM) and validating our model against experimental results.
With this extension of the Immersed Bounadry Method (IBM), we use the
techniques originally developed in Part I, (Hammond et al. (2014) ) to treat
the biofilm as a viscoelastic fluid possessing variable rheological properties
anchored to a set of moving locations (i.e., the bacteria locations). We
validate our modeling approach from Part I by comparing dynamic moduli and
compliance moduli computed from our model to data from mechanical
characterization experiments on Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms. The
experimental setup is described in Pavlovsky et al. (2013) in which biofilms
are grown and tested in a parallel plate rheometer. Matlab code used to produce
results in this paper will be available at
