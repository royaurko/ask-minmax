It is generally inferred from astronomical measurements that Dark Matter (DM)
comprises approximately 27\% of the energy-density of the universe. If DM is a
subatomic particle, a possible candidate is a Weakly Interacting Massive
Particle (WIMP), and the DarkSide-50 (DS) experiment is a direct search for
evidence of WIMP-nuclear collisions. DS is located underground at the
Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy, and consists of three
active, embedded components; an outer water veto (CTF), a liquid scintillator
veto (LSV), and a liquid argon (LAr) time projection chamber (TPC). This paper
describes the data acquisition and electronic systems of the DS detectors,
designed to detect the residual ionization from such collisions.
