We provide constraints on the inclination angle of the H\,{\sc i} disk of the
dwarf irregular galaxy Holmberg II (Ho II) from stability analysis of the outer
gaseous disk. We point out that a mean inclination angle of 27 degrees and thus
a flat circular velocity of ~60 km/s, is required to have a level of
gravitational stability similar to that found in other galaxies. Adopting this
inclination angle, we find that Ho II lies on the right location in the
baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. Moreover, for this inclination, its rotation
curve is consistent with MOND. However, the corresponding analysis of the
stability under MOND indicates that this galaxy could be problematic for MOND
because its outer parts are marginally unstable in this gravity theory. We urge
MOND simulators to study numerically the non-linear stability of gas-rich dwarf
galaxies since it may provide a new key test for MOND.
