We present the results of archival coincidence analyses using public neutrino
data from the 40-string configuration of IceCube (IC40) and contemporaneous
public gamma-ray data from Fermi LAT. Our analyses have the potential to
discover statistically significant coincidences between high-energy neutrino
and gamma-ray signals, and hence, possible jointly-emitting neutrino/gamma-ray
transients. This work is an example of more general multimessenger studies that
the Astrophysical Multimessenger Observatory Network (AMON) aims to perform.
AMON is currently under development and will link multiple running and future
high-energy neutrino, cosmic ray and follow-up observatories as well as
gravitational wave facilities. This single network will enable near real-time
coincidence searches for multimessenger astrophysical transients and their
electromagnetic counterparts. We will present the component high-energy
neutrino and gamma-ray datasets, the statistical approaches that we used, and
the results of analyses of the IC40+LAT datasets.
