Next-generation projects in High Energy Physics will reach again a new
dimension of complexity. Information management has to ensure an efficient and
economic information flow within the collaborations, offering world-wide
up-to-date information access to the collaborators as one condition for
successful projects. DESY introduces several information systems in preparation
for the planned linear collider TESLA: a Requirements Management System (RMS)
is in production for the TESLA planning group, a Product Data Management System
(PDMS) is in production since the beginning of 2002 and is supporting the
cavity preparation and the general engineering of accelerator components. A
pilot Asset Management System (AMS) is in production for supporting the
management and maintenance of the technical infrastructure, and a Facility
Management System (FMS) with a Geographic Information System (GIS) is currently
being introduced to support civil engineering. Efforts have been started to
integrate the systems with the goal that users can retrieve information through
a single point of access. The paper gives an introduction to information
management and the activities at DESY.
