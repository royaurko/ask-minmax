Transfer reactions are a powerful probe of the properties of atomic nuclei.
When used in inverse kinematics with radioactive ion beams they can provide
detailed information on the structure of exotic nuclei and can inform
nucleosynthesis calculations. There are a number of groups around the world who
use these reactions, usually with particle detection in large silicon arrays.
Sometimes these arrays are coupled to gamma-ray detectors, and occasionally
smaller arrays of silicon detectors are mounted within a solenoid magnet.
Modern techniques using transfer reactions in inverse kinematics are covered,
with specific examples, many from measurements made with beams from the
Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
