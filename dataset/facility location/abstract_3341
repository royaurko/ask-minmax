For the HERA upgrade, the ZEUS experiment has designed and installed a high
precision Micro Vertex Detector (MVD) using single sided micro-strip sensors
with capacitive charge division. The sensors have a readout pitch of 120
microns, with five intermediate strips (20 micron strip pitch). An extensive
test program has been carried out at the DESY-II testbeam facility. In this
paper we describe the setup developed to test the ZEUS MVD sensors and the
results obtained on both irradiated and non-irradiated single sided micro-strip
detectors with rectangular and trapezoidal geometries. The performances of the
sensors coupled to the readout electronics (HELIX chip, version 2.2) have been
studied in detail, achieving a good description by a Monte Carlo simulation.
Measurements of the position resolution as a function of the angle of incidence
are presented, focusing in particular on the comparison between standard and
newly developed reconstruction algorithms.
