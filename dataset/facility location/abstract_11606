Building on earlier work on football shaped extra dimensions, we construct a
compact codimension two braneworld with precisely one brane. The two extra
dimensions topologically represent a 2-torus which is stabilized by a bulk
cosmological constant and magnetic flux. The torus has positive constant
curvature almost everywhere, except for a single conical singularity at the
location of the brane. In contradistinction to the football shaped case, there
is no fine-tuning required for the brane tension. We also present some
plausibility arguments why the model should not suffer from serious stability
issues.
