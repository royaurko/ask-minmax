Due to the recent interest shown by astronomers towards the Antarctic Plateau
as a potential site for large astronomical facilities, we assisted in the last
years to a strengthening of site testing activities in this region,
particularly at Dome C. Most of the results collected so far concern
meteorologic parameters and optical turbulence measurements based on different
principles using different instruments. At present we have several elements
indicating that, above the first 20-30 meters, the quality of the optical
turbulence above Dome C is better than above whatever other site in the world.
The challenging question, crucial to know which kind of facilities to build on,
is to establish how much better the Dome C is than a mid-latitude site. In this
contribution we will provide some complementary elements and strategies of
analysis aiming to answer to this question. We will try to concentrate the
attention on critical points, i.e. open questions that still require
explanation/attention.
