In late August 2005, 80 researchers from more than 15 countries convened for
a 4-day conference entitled ``The Tenth Anniversary of 51 Peg b: Status and
Prospects for Hot Jupiter Studies''. The meeting was held at l'Observatoire de
Haute-Provence, the location of the 1.93-m telescope and ELODIE spectrograph
used to discover the planetary companion to 51 Peg roughly 10 years ago. I
summarize several dominant themes that emerged from the meeting, including (i)
recent improvements in the precision of radial velocity measurements of nearby,
Sun-like stars, (ii) the continued value of individual, newly-discovered
planets of novel character to expand the parameter space with which the theory
must contend, and (iii) the crucial role of space-based observatories in
efforts to characterize hot Jupiter planets. I also present the returns of an
informal poll of the conference attendees conducted on the last day of the
meeting, which may be amusing to revisit a decade hence.
