We have observed trapping of electrons in an electrostatic trap formed over
the surface of liquid helium-4. These electrons are detected by a Single
Electron Transistor located at the centre of the trap. We can trap any desired
number of electrons between 1 and $\sim 30$. By repeatedly ($\sim 10^3-10^4$
times) putting a single electron into the trap and lowering the electrostatic
barrier of the trap, we can measure the effective temperature of the electron
and the time of its thermalisation after heating up by incoherent radiation.
