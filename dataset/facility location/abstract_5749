Various models for electromagnetic emissions correlated with the
gravitational wave signals expected to be detectable by the current and planned
gravitational wave detectors are studied. The position error on the location of
a gravitational wave source is estimated, and is used to show that it could be
possible to observe the electromagnetic counterparts to neutron star-neutron
star or neutron star-black hole binary coalescences detected with the Advanced
LIGO and the Virgo detectors.
