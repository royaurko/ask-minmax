We show how to systematically improve the Momentum Average (MA)approximation
for the Green's function of a Holstein polaron, bysystematically improving the
accuracy of the self-energy diagrams in such a way that they can still all be
summed efficiently. This allows us to fix some of the problems of the MA
approximation, e.g. we now find the expected polaron+phonon continuum at the
correct location, and a momentum-dependent self-energy. The quantitative
agreement with numerical data is further improved, as expected since the number
of exactly satisfied spectral weight sum rules is increased. The corrections
are found to be larger in lower dimensional systems.
