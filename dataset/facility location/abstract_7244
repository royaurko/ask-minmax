In a recent paper Pello et al. reported observations of a faint galaxy,
gravitationally lensed by the galaxy cluster Abell 1835. Deep J-band
spectroscopy revealed a weak emission line near 1.34 microns, detected in two
spectra with different central wavelengths. The line was interpreted as
Lyman-alpha at redshift z=10.0. This interpretation is supported by the
broad-band photometric spectral energy distribution, and by the location of the
galaxy close to the lens critical line for this redshift. We have reanalysed
the two spectra, just released from the data archive. Our analysis includes
allowance for wavelength shifts due to transverse drift of the object in the
slit. We do not detect a significant emission line at the reported location, or
nearby, at either grating setting, nor in the combined spectrum. We provide a
possible explanation for the reported detection as due to spurious positive
flux introduced in the sky-subtraction stage as a result of variable hot
pixels. We provide our final reduced 2D frame, and corresponding error array.
