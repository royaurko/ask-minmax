Deeply virtual electroproduction of pion in exclusive reaction
$p(e,e'\pi^+)n$ is studied using a two-component model which includes soft
hadronic and hard partonic reaction mechanisms. The results are compared with
the experimental data measured at HERMES in the deep inelastic region for
values of $Q^2>1$ GeV$^2$ and $W^2 > 10$ GeV$^2$. At forward angles the $\pi^+$
cross section is longitudinal and is dominated by exchange of Regge poles, with
$\pi$ the dominant trajectory. The off-forward region with $-t>1$ GeV$^2$ is
transverse and shows the dominance of partonic subprocesses. An implication of
present results for the future JLAB facilities are briefly discussed.
