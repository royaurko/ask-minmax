The USA Experiment is a new X-ray timing experiment with large collecting
area and microsecond time resolution capable of conducting a broad program of
studies of galactic X-ray binaries. USA is one of nine experiments aboard the
Advanced Research and Global Observation Satellite which was launched February
23, 1999. USA is a collimated proportional counter X-ray telescope with about
1000 cm$^2$ of effective area per detector with two detectors sensitive to
photons in the energy range 1-15 keV. A unique feature of USA is that photon
events are time tagged by reference to an onboard GPS receiver allowing precise
absolute time and location determination. We will present an overview of the
USA instrument, capabilities, and scientific observing plan as well as the
current status of the instrument.
