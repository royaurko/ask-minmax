The application of non-axisymmetric resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs)
with a toroidal mode number n=6 in the MAST tokamak produces a significant
reduction in plasma energy loss associated with type-I Edge Localized Modes
(ELMs), the first such observation with n>3. During the ELM mitigated stage
clear lobe structures are observed in visible-light imaging of the X-point
region. These lobes or manifold structures, that were predicted previously,
have been observed for the first time in a range of discharges and their
appearance is correlated with the effect of RMPs on the plasma i.e. they only
appear above a threshold when a density pump out is observed or when the ELM
frequency is increased. They appear to be correlated with the RMPs penetrating
the plasma and may be important in explaining why the ELM frequency increases.
The number and location of the structures observed can be well described using
vacuum modelling. Differences in radial extent and poloidal width from vacuum
modelling are likely to be due to a combination of transport effects and plasma
screening.
