A ROSAT HRI X-ray image was obtained of the open globular cluster NGC 288,
which is located near the South Galactic Pole. This is the first deep X-ray
image of this system. We detect a Low Luminosity Globular Cluster X-ray source
(LLGCX) RXJ005245.0-263449 with an X-ray luminosity of (5.5+-1.4)x10^32 ergs/s
(0.1-2.0 keV), which is located very close to the cluster center. There is
evidence for X-ray variability on a time scale of <~ 1 day. The presence of
this LLGCX in such an open cluster suggests that dense stellar systems with
high interaction rates are not needed to form LLGCXs. We also searched for
diffuse X-ray emission from NGC 288. Upper limits on the X-ray luminosities are
L_X^h < 9.5x10^32 ergs/s (0.52-2.02 keV) and L_X^s < 9.3x10^32 ergs/s
(0.11-0.41 keV). These imply upper limits to the diffuse X-ray to optical light
ratios in NGC 288 which are lower than the values observed for X-ray faint
early-type galaxies. This indicates that the soft X-ray emission in these
galaxies is due either to a component which is not present in globular clusters
(e.g., interstellar gas, or a stellar component which is not found in low
metallicity Population II systems), or to a relatively small number of bright
Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs).
