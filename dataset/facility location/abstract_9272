We have imaged two bona-fide brown dwarfs with TReCS/GEMINI-S and find
mid-infrared excess emission that can be explained by optically thick dust disk
models. In the case of the young ($\approx$2Myr) Cha H$\alpha$1 we measure
fluxes at 10.4$\mu$m and 12.3$\mu$m that are fully consistent with a standard
flared disk model and prominent silicate emission. For the $\approx$ 10Myr old
brown dwarf 2MASS1207-3932 located in the TW Hydrae association we find excess
emission at 8.7$\mu$m and 10.4$\mu$m with respect to its photosphere, and
confirm disk accretion as likely cause of its strong activity. Disks around
brown dwarfs likely last at least as long as their low-mass stellar
counterparts in the T-Tauri phase. Grain growth, dust settling, and evolution
of the geometry of brown dwarfs disks may appear on a timescale of 10Myr and
can be witnessed by observations in the mid-infrared.
