A systematic self-consistent procedure is provided to describe by means of
the Szekeres dust models the evolution of multiple self-gravitating cold dark
matter structures (over-densities and density voids), whose spatial location
can be prescribed beforehand for all times by suitable initial conditions that
define the free parameters of the models. Following this procedure makes it
possible to obtain a fully relativistic non-perturbative coarse grained
description of actually existing cosmic structure at various scales. We discuss
possible astrophysical and cosmological applications.
