We examine the formation of bound states on a generalized nonlinear impurity
located at or near the beginning (surface) of a linear, tight-binding
semi-infinite lattice. Using the formalism of lattice Green functions, we
obtain in closed form the number of bound states as well as their energies and
probability profiles, for different nonlinearity parameter values and
nonlinearity exponents, at different distances from the surface. It is shown
that close to the surface, the amount of nonlinearity needed to create a bound
state or to effect dynamical selftrapping, increases (decreases) depending on
whether the exponent is smaller (larger) than, approximately, two.
