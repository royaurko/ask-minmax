We present the first results of the project "Tsessevich". The main goal of
this project is to find the real coordinates of eclipsing variable star YY Dra,
which had been discovered by Tsessevich in 1934. However, the possible misprint
in the coordinates entailed that the star had been lost and later identified
with a cataclysmic star DO Dra, which located closely to the published
coordinates of YY Dra. We expected, that search for YY Dra will give us some
new variable stars as a "by product". We plan to publish the results of the
search as soon as the new variable stars would be confirmed. As the present
paper is the first of the series of the papers about the results of this
project, here we describe it's idea, used instruments, methods and computer
programs. Also we present the first five new eclipsing W UMa-type variable
stars. They are already registered in the VSX catalog. For these systems we've
determined all parameters needed for the General Catalog of Variable Stars.
