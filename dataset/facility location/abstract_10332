The appearances of complex eigenvalues in the spectra of PT-symmetric
quantum-mechanical systems are usually associated with a spontaneous breaking
of PT. In this letter we discuss a family of models for which this phenomenon
is also linked with an explicit breaking of supersymmetry. Exact
level-crossings are located, and connections with N-fold supersymmetry and
quasi-exact solvability in certain special cases are pointed out.
