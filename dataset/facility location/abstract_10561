A search for an annual variation of a daily sidereal modulation of the
frequency difference between co-located ${}^{129}$Xe and ${}^{3}$He Zeeman
masers sets a stringent limit on boost-dependent Lorentz and CPT violation
involving the neutron, consistent with no effect at the level of 150 nHz. In
the framework of the general Standard-Model Extension, the present result
provides the first clean test for the fermion sector of the symmetry of
spacetime under boost transformations at a level of $10^{-27}$ GeV.
