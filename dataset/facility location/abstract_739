Interferometry has brought many new constraints in optical astronomy in the
recent years. A major leap in this field is the opening of large
interferometric facilities like the Very Large Telescope Interferometer and the
Keck Interferometer to the astronomical community. Planning for the future is
both easy --most specialists know in which directions to develop
interferometry-- and difficult because of the increasing complexity of the
technique. I present a short status of interferometry today. Then I detail the
possible astrophysical prospects. Finally I address some important instrumental
issues that are decisive for the future of interferometry.
