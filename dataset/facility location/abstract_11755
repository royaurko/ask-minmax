We use the available two different self-consistent formulations of
quasiparticle models and extend their applications for the description of quark
gluon plasma (QGP) at non-vanishing baryon chemical potentials. The
thermodynamical quantities calculated from these models are compared with the
values obtained from lattice simulations and a good agreement between
theoretical calculations and lattice QCD data suggests that the values of the
parameters used in the paper are consistent. A new equation of state (EOS) for
a gas of extended baryons and pointlike mesons is presented here which
incorporates the repulsive hard-core interactions arising due to geometrical
size of baryons. A first order deconfining phase transition is constructed
using Gibb's equilibrium criteria between the hadron gas EOS and quasiparticle
model EOS for the weakly interacting quark matter. This leads to an interesting
finding that the phase transition line ends at a critical end point beyond
which a crossover region exists in the phase diagram.
