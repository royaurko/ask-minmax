SS433 is the only known persistent supercritical accretor, it may be very
important for understanding ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) located in
external galaxies. We describe main properties of the SS433 supercritical
accretion disk and jets. Basing on observational data of SS433 and published 2D
simulations of supercritical accretion disks we estimate parameters of the
funnel in the disk/wind of SS 433. We argue that the UV radiation of the SS433
disk (~50000 K, ~10^{40}erg/s) is roughly isotropic, but X-ray radiation (~10^7
K, ~10^{40}erg/s) of the funnel is midly anisotropic. A face-on SS433 object
has to be ultraluminous in X-rays (10^{40-41}erg/s). Typical time-scales of the
funnel flux variability are estimated. Shallow and very broad (0.1-0.3c) and
blue-shifted absorption lines are expected in the funnel X-ray spectrum.
