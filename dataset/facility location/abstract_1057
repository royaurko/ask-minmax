This talk is a brief account of recent developments on light scalar meson
spectroscopy. I mostly focus on the major revision of the $\sigma$ or
$f_0(500)$ meson in the Review of Particle Physics, driven by new data and the
accummulation of rigorous dispersive studies, but I also comment on recent
updates of other scalars and future progress.
