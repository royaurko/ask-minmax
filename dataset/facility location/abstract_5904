Within a two-band, strong coupling model we analyze SIS-tunneling
conductance, Raman scattering and optical conductivity measured on $MgB_2$
samples. We find that features observed in tunneling and Raman spectroscopy at
intermediate energies $\omega=\Delta_{\sigma}+\Delta_{\pi}\simeq 8\div 10meV$
can be consistently explained when incoherent scattering between $\sigma$ and
$\pi$ band is considered. We calculate the optical conductivity and find that
strong coupling effects are important for explaining the presently available
data, and predict the location and magnitude of interband scattering features
for this spectroscopic probe as well.
