As part of the Intensity Frontier effort within the 2013 Community Summer
Study, a workshop on the proton machine capabilities was held (High Intensity
Secondary Beams Driven by Proton Beams) April 17-20, 2013 at Brookhaven
National Laboratory in Upton, NY. Primary aims of the workshop were to
understand: 1) the beam requirements for proposed high intensity proton beam
based measurements; 2) the capabilities of existing world-wide high power
proton machines; 3) proton facility upgrade plans and proposals for new
facilities; 4) and to document the R&D needs for proton accelerators and target
systems needed to support proposed intensity frontier measurements. These
questions are addressed in this summary.
