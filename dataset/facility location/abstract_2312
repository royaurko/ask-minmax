We introduce T2Ku, an open source project that aims at building a semantic
wiki of mathematics featuring automated reasoning(AR) techniques. We want to
utilize AR techniques in a way that truly helps mathematical researchers solve
problems in the real world, instead of building another ambitious yet useless
system. By setting this as our objective, we exploit pragmatic design decisions
that have proven feasible in other projects, while still employs a loosely
coupled architecture to allow better inference programs to be integrated in the
future. In this paper, we state the motivations and examine state-of-the-art
systems, why we are not satisfied with those systems and how we are going to
improve. We then describe our architecture and the way we implemented the
system. We present examples showing how to use its facilities. T2Ku is an
on-going project. We conclude this paper by summarizing the development
progress and encouraging the reader to join the project.
