We report an observation of a small scale flux-tube that undergoes kinking
and triggers the macrospicule and a jet on November 11, 2010 in the north polar
corona. The small-scale flux-tube emerged well before the triggering of
macrospicule and as the time progresses the two opposite halves of this omega
shaped flux-tube bent transversely and approached towards each other. After
$\sim$ 2 minutes, the two approaching halves of the kinked flux-tube touch
each-other and internal reconnection as well as energy release takes place at
the adjoining location and a macrospicule was launched which goes upto a height
of 12 Mm. Plasma starts moving horizontally as well as vertically upward along
with the onset of macrospicule and thereafter converts into a large-scale jet
which goes up to $\sim$ 40 Mm in the solar atmosphere with a projected speed of
$\sim$ 95 km s$^{-1}$. We perform 2-D numerical simulation by considering the
VAL-C initial atmospheric conditions to understand the physical scenario of the
observed macrospicule and associated jet. The simulation results show that
reconnection generated velocity pulse in the lower solar atmosphere steepens
into slow shock and the cool plasma is driven behind it in form of
macrospicule. The horizontal surface waves also appeared with the shock fronts
at different heights, which most likely drove and spread the large-scale jet
associated with the macrospicule.
