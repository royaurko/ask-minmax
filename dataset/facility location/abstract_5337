The MAXI (Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image) mission is the first astronomical
payload to be installed on the Japanese Experiment Module-Exposed Facility
(JEM-EF) on the ISS. It is scheduled for launch in the middle of 2009 to
monitor all-sky X-ray objects on every ISS orbit. MAXI will be more powerful
than any previous X-ray All Sky Monitor (ASM) payloads, being able to monitor
hundreds of AGN. MAXI will provide all sky images of X-ray sources of about 20
mCrab in the energy band of 2-30 keV from observation on one ISS orbit (90
min), about 4.5 mCrab for one day, and about 1 mCrab for one month. A final
detectability of MAXI could be 0.2 mCrab for 2 year observations.
