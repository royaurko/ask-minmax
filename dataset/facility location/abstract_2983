We investigate the influence of columnar defects in layered superconductors
on the thermally activated penetration of pancake vortices through the surface
barrier. Columnar defects, located near the surface, facilitate penetration of
vortices through the surface barrier, by creating ``weak spots'', through which
pancakes can penetrate into the superconductor. Penetration of a pancake
mediated by an isolated column, located near the surface, is a two-stage
process involving hopping from the surface to the column and the detachment
from the column into the bulk; each stage is controlled by its own activation
barrier. The resulting effective energy is equal to the maximum of those two
barriers. For a given external field there exists an optimum location of the
column for which the barriers for the both processes are equal and the
reduction of the effective penetration barrier is maximal. At high fields the
effective penetration field is approximately two times smaller than in
unirradiated samples. We also estimate the suppression of the effective
penetration field by column clusters. This mechanism provides further reduction
of the penetration field at low temperatures.
