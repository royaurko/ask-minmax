The effects of the bimodal random field distribution on the thermal and
magnetic properties of of the Heisenberg thin film have been investigated by
making use of a two spin cluster with the decoupling approximation. Particular
attention has been devoted to the obtaining of phase diagrams and magnetization
behaviors. The physical behaviors of special as well as tricritical points are
discussed for a wide range of selected Hamiltonian parameters. For example, it
is found that when the strength of magnetic field increases, the locations of
special point in related plane decrease. Moreover, tricritical behavior has
been obtained for the higher values of the magnetic field, and influences of
the varying Hamiltonian parameters on its behavior have been elucidated in
detail in order to have a better understanding of mechanism underlying of the
considered system.
