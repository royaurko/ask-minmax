We report on the results from {\it Suzaku} X-ray observations of the radio
complex region called Kookaburra, which includes two adjacent TeV $\gamma$-ray
sources HESS J1418-609 and HESS J1420-607. The {\it Suzaku} observation
revealed X-ray diffuse emission around a middle-aged pulsar PSR J1420-6048 and
a plausible PWN Rabbit with elongated sizes of $\sigma_{\rm X}=1^{\prime}.66$
and $\sigma_{\rm X}=1^{\prime}.49$, respectively. The peaks of the diffuse
X-ray emission are located within the $\gamma$-ray excess maps obtained by
H.E.S.S. and the offsets from the $\gamma$-ray peaks are $2^{\prime}.8$ for PSR
J1420-6048 and $4^{\prime}.5$ for Rabbit. The X-ray spectra of the two sources
were well reproduced by absorbed power-law models with $\Gamma=1.7-2.3$. The
spectral shapes tend to become softer according to the distance from the X-ray
peaks. Assuming the one zone electron emission model as the first order
approximation, the ambient magnetic field strengths of HESS J1420-607 and HESS
J1418-609 can be estimated as 3 $\mu$G, and $2.5 \mu$G, respectively. The X-ray
spectral and spatial properties strongly support that both TeV sources are
pulsar wind nebulae, in which electrons and positrons accelerated at
termination shocks of the pulsar winds are losing their energies via the
synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering as they are transported
outward.
