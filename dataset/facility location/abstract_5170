The recent discoveries of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies in the vicinity of
the Magellanic system supports the expectation from cosmological models that
such faint objects exist and are numerous. By developing a mass model of the
Local Group and backwards integrating the Magellanic Clouds' present
kinematics, we find that the locations of these UFDs are consistent with those
predicted if previously associated with the Large MC as part of a loose
association. We further demonstrate how these satellites are likely to have
been processed by the Galactic hot halo upon accretion, with the implication
that ongoing detections of extremely gas-rich objects on the periphery of the
Galaxy and without clear stellar counterparts are analogous to the progenitors
of the gas-deficient UFDs. Our model allows us predict the locations of other
putative Magellanic satellites, and propose how their distribution/kinematics
provide a novel constraint on the dynamical properties of the Galaxy. We also
predict that the stripped metal-poor HI, previously associated with these UFDs,
lies coincident with but distinguishable from the extensive Magellanic Stream.
