A leading hypothesis for the nature of the elusive dark matter are thermally
produced, weakly interacting massive particles that arise in many theories
beyond the standard model of particle physics. Their self-annihilation in
astrophysical regions of high density provides a potential means of indirectly
detecting dark matter through the annihilation products, which nicely
complements direct and collider searches. Here, I review the case of gamma rays
which are particularly promising in this respect: distinct and unambiguous
spectral signatures would not only allow a clear discrimination from
astrophysical backgrounds but also to extract important properties of the dark
matter particles; powerful observational facilities like the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope or upcoming large, ground-based Cherenkov telescope arrays will
be able to probe a considerable part of the underlying, e.g. supersymmetric,
parameter space. I conclude with a more detailed comparison of indirect and
direct dark matter searches, showing that these two approaches are, indeed,
complementary.
