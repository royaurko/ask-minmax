We are using the Multibeam 21cm receiver on the Parkes Telescope combined
with the optical Two degree Field spectrograph (2dF) of the Anglo-Australian
Telescope to obtain the first complete spectroscopic sample of the Fornax
cluster. In the optical the survey is unique in that all objects (both
``stars'' and ``galaxies'') within our magnitude limits (Bj=16.5 to 19.7) are
measured, producing the most complete survey of cluster members irrespective of
surface brightness. We have detected two new classes of high surface brightness
dwarf galaxy in the cluster. With 2dF we have discovered a population of very
low luminosity (Mb approx -12) objects which are unresolved from the ground and
may be the stripped nuclei of dwarf galaxies; they are unlike any known
galaxies. In a survey of the brighter (Bj=16.5 to 18) galaxies with the
FLAIR-II spectrograph we have found a number of new high surface brightness
dwarf galaxies and show that the fraction of star-forming dwarf galaxies in the
cluster is about 30 per cent, about twice that implied by earlier morphological
classifications. Our radio observations have greatly improved upon the
sensitivity of the standard Multibeam survey by using a new ``basket weave''
scanning pattern. Our initial analysis shows that we are detecting new cluster
members with HI masses of order 10-to-the-8 Msun and HI mass-to-light ratios of
1-2 Msun/Lsun.
