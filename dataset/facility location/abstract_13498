Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been observed in O-rich
planetary nebulae towards the Galactic Bulge. This combination of oxygen-rich
and carbon-rich material, known as dual-dust or mixed chemistry, is not
expected to be seen around such objects. We recently proposed that PAHs could
be formed from the photodissociation of CO in dense tori. In this work, using
VISIR/VLT, we spatially resolved the emission of the PAH bands and ionised
emission from the [SIV] line, confirming the presence of dense central tori in
all the observed O-rich objects. Furthermore, we show that for most of the
objects, PAHs are located at the outer edge of these dense/compact tori, while
the ionised material is mostly present in the inner parts of these tori,
consistent with our hypothesis for the formation of PAHs in these systems. The
presence of a dense torus has been strongly associated with the action of a
central binary star and, as such, the rich chemistry seen in these regions may
also be related to the formation of exoplanets in post-common-envelope binary
systems.
