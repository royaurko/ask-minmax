Clustering has become an increasingly important task in analysing huge
amounts of data. Traditional applications require that all data has to be
located at the site where it is scrutinized. Nowadays, large amounts of
heterogeneous, complex data reside on different, independently working
computers which are connected to each other via local or wide area networks. In
this paper, we propose a scalable density-based distributed clustering
algorithm which allows a user-defined trade-off between clustering quality and
the number of transmitted objects from the different local sites to a global
server site. Our approach consists of the following steps: First, we order all
objects located at a local site according to a quality criterion reflecting
their suitability to serve as local representatives. Then we send the best of
these representatives to a server site where they are clustered with a slightly
enhanced density-based clustering algorithm. This approach is very efficient,
because the local detemination of suitable representatives can be carried out
quickly and independently from each other. Furthermore, based on the scalable
number of the most suitable local representatives, the global clustering can be
done very effectively and efficiently. In our experimental evaluation, we will
show that our new scalable density-based distributed clustering approach
results in high quality clusterings with scalable transmission cost.
