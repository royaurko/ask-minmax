As noticed by R. Kulkarni, the conjugacy classes of subgroups of the modular
group correspond bijectively to bipartite cuboid graphs. We'll explain how to
recover the graph corresponding to a subgroup $G$ of
$\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ from the combinatorics of the right action of
$\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ on the right cosets
$G\setminus\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. This gives a method of constructing
nice fundamental domains (which Kulkarni calls "special polygons") for the
action of $G$ on the upper half plane. For the classical congruence subgroups
$\Gamma_0(N)$, $\Gamma_1(N)$, $\Gamma(N)$ etc. the number of operations the
method requires is the index times something that grows not faster than a
polynomial in $\log N$. We also give algorithms to locate a given element of
the upper half-plane on the fundamental domain and to write a given element of
$G$ as a product of independent generators.
