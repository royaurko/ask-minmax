Radio AGN feedback is often assumed to work, but detailed physical models of
this process are not well developed. This paper examines a possible path for
radio AGN feedback to heat the gas in and around galaxies and perhaps suppress
star formation. Nearby radio AGN are almost all FR-I radio galaxies, and it is
argued that such outflows become decelerated and fully turbulent in their early
stages. A 3D non-linear MHD turbulence calculation is made to determine the
time required for this outflowing turbulent energy to be converted into heat.
Using radio and x-ray observations of nearby FR-I AGN for normalization results
in a time for the onset of heating of about 100 million years. This is
comparable to the gas cooling times in and around galaxies, and the resulting
location of heat deposition is consistent with FR-I outflows.
