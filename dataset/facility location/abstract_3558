Micromesh Gas Amplification Structures (Micromegas) are being used in an
increasing number of Particle Physics applications since their conception
fourteen years ago. More recently, they are being used or considered as readout
of Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) in the field of Rare Event searches (dealing
with dark matter, axions or double beta decay). In these experiments, the
radiopurity of the detector components and surrounding materials is measured
and finely controlled in order to keep the experimental background as low as
possible. In the present paper, the first measurement of the radiopurity of
Micromegas planes obtained by high purity germanium spectrometry in the low
background facilities of the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC) is
presented. The obtained results prove that Micromegas readouts of the microbulk
type are currently manufactured with radiopurity levels below 30 microBq/cm2
for Th and U chains and ~60 microBq/cm2 for 40K, already comparable to the
cleanest detector components of the most stringent low background experiments
at present. Taking into account that the studied readouts were manufactured
without any specific control of the radiopurity, it should be possible to
improve these levels after dedicated development.
