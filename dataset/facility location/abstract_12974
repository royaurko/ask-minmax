Results are presented on the performance of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference
system (ANFIS) for wind velocity forecasts in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec region
in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. The data bank was provided by the
meteorological station located at the University of Isthmus, Tehuantepec
campus, and this data bank covers the period from 2008 to 2011. Three data
models were constructed to carry out 16, 24 and 48 hours forecasts using the
following variables: wind velocity, temperature, barometric pressure, and date.
The performance measure for the three models is the mean standard error (MSE).
In this work, performance analysis in short-term prediction is presented,
because it is essential in order to define an adequate wind speed model for
eolian parks, where a right planning provide economic benefits.
