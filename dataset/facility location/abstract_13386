A key open question in the glass transition field is whether a finite
temperature thermodynamic transition to the glass state exists or not. Recent
simulations of coupled replicas in atomistic models have found signatures of a
static transition as a function of replica coupling. This can be viewed as
evidence of an associated thermodynamic glass transition in the uncoupled
system. We demonstrate here that a different interpretation is possible. We
consider the triangular plaquette model, an interacting spin system which
displays (East model-like) glassy dynamics in the absence of any static
transition. We show that when two replicas are coupled there is a curve of
equilibrium phase transitions, between phases of small and large overlap, in
the temperature-coupling plane (located on the self-dual line of an exact
temperature/coupling duality of the system) which ends at a critical point.
Crucially, in the limit of vanishing coupling the finite temperature transition
disappears, and the uncoupled system is in the disordered phase at all
temperatures. We discuss interpretation of atomistic simulations in light of
this result.
