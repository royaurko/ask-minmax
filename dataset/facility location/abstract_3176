A 3-day international workshop on atmospheric monitoring and calibration for
high-energy astroparticle detectors, with a view towards next-generation
facilities. The atmosphere is an integral component of many high-energy
astroparticle detectors. Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes and
cosmic-ray extensive air shower detectors are the two instruments driving the
rapidly evolving fields of very-high- and ultra-high-energy astrophysics. In
these instruments, the atmosphere is used as a giant calorimeter where cosmic
rays and gamma rays deposit their energy and initiate EASs; it is also the
medium through which the resulting Cherenkov light propagates. Uncertainties in
real-time atmospheric conditions and in the fixed atmospheric models typically
dominate all other systematic errors. With the improved sensitivity of upgraded
IACTs such as H.E.S.S.-II and MAGIC-II and future facilities like the Cherenkov
Telescope Array (CTA) and JEM-EUSO, statistical uncertainties are expected to
be significantly reduced, leaving the atmosphere as the limiting factor in the
determination of astroparticle spectra. Varying weather conditions necessitate
the development of suitable atmospheric monitoring to be integrated in the
overall instrument calibration, including Monte Carlo simulations. With
expertise distributed across multiple collaborations and scientific domains, an
interdisciplinary workshop is being convened to advance progress on this
critical and timely topic.
