The geospatial analyst is required to apply art, science, and technology to
measure relative positions of natural and man-made features above or beneath
the earths surface, and to present this information either graphically or
numerically. The reference positions for these measurements need to be well
archived and managed to effectively sustain the activities in the spatial
industry. The research herein described highlights the need for an information
system for the Land Surveyors Equipment Store. Such a system is a database
management system with a user friendly graphical interface. This paper
describes one such system that has been developed for the Equipment Store of
the Department of Geomatic Engineering, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and
Technology, Ghana. The system facilitates efficient management and location of
instruments, as well as easy location of beacons together with their attribute
information, it provides multimedia information about instruments in an
Equipment Store. Digital camera was used capture the pictorial descriptions of
the beacons. Geographic Information System software was employed to visualize
the spatial location of beacons and to publish the various layers for the
Graphical User Interface. The aesthetics of the interface was developed with
user interface design tools and coded by programming. The developed Suite,
powered by a reliable and fully scalable database, provides an efficient way of
booking and analyzing transactions in an Equipment Store.
