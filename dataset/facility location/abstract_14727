The Seyfert 2 Galaxy NGC 7172 was observed twice by BeppoSAX narrow field
instruments approximately one year apart. As found in previous observations,
the source is variable on short time scales (hours) by a factor of $\sim$30%,
confirming the presence of a type 1 nucleus at the center. A strong flux
variability (by a factor of 2) on a longer time scale was observed between the
two observations. Indeed, in November 1997, the lowest flux ever recorded was
detected by BeppoSAX. The broad band spectra obtained with the BeppoSAX narrow
field instruments show marginal evidence of a reflection component. This
structure could explain the very flat spectra previously observed in the 2-10
keV band. An FeK$\alpha$ line was also detected in both observations. The line
intensity appears to remain almost constant between the two observations even
if the associated large errors cannot exclude some variability. In order to
understand the problem of the origin of the line, data from previous
observations, performed with other satellites, were also used. The scenario
favored is one where the line is produced at a distance of approximatively 8
light years from the continuum source region, rather than having its origin in
the accretion disk. In the framework of the standard unified models for AGN,
this suggests that its origin is located in the molecular torus.
