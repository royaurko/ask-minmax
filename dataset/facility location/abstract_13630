We develop a connection between mixture and envelope representations of
objective functions that arise frequently in statistics. We refer to this
connection using the term "hierarchical duality." Our results suggest an
interesting and previously under-exploited relationship between marginalization
and profiling, or equivalently between the Fenchel--Moreau theorem for convex
functions and the Bernstein--Widder theorem for Laplace transforms. We give
several different sets of conditions under which such a duality result obtains.
We then extend existing work on envelope representations in several ways,
including novel generalizations to variance-mean models and to multivariate
Gaussian location models. This turns out to provide an elegant missing-data
interpretation of the proximal gradient method, a widely used algorithm in
machine learning. We show several statistical applications in which the
proposed framework leads to easily implemented algorithms, including a robust
version of the fused lasso, nonlinear quantile regression via trend filtering,
and the binomial fused double Pareto model. Code for the examples is available
on GitHub at https://github.com/jgscott/hierduals.
