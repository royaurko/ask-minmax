The high-velocity clouds of atomic hydrogen, discovered about 35 years ago,
have velocities inconsistent with simple Galactic rotation models that
generally fit the stars and gas in the Milky Way disk. Their origins and role
in Galactic evolution remain poorly understood, largely for lack of information
on their distances. The high-velocity clouds might result from gas blown from
the Milky Way disk into the halo by supernovae, in which case they would enrich
the Galaxy with heavy elements as they fall back onto the disk. Alternatively,
they may consist of metal-poor gas -- remnants of the era of galaxy formation,
accreted by the Galaxy and reducing its metal abundance. Or they might be truly
extragalactic objects in the Local Group of galaxies. Here we report a firm
distance bracket for a large high-velocity cloud, Chain A, which places it in
the Milky Way halo (2.5 to 7 kiloparsecs above the Galactic plane), rather than
at an extragalactic distance, and constrains its gas mass to between 10^5 and 2
times 10^6 solar masses.
