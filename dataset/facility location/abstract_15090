We have observed the massive star forming region associated with the early B
protostar G192.16-3.84 in NH3(1,1), 22.2 GHz water masers, 1.3 cm continuum
emission, and at 850 microns. The dense gas associated with G192.16 is clumpy,
optically thin, and has a mass of 0.9 Msun. The ammonia core is gravitationally
unstable which may signal that the outflow phase of this system is coming to an
end. Water masers trace an ionized jet 0.8" (1600 AU at a distance of 2 kpc)
north of G192.16. Masers are also located within 500 AU of G192.16, their
velocity distribution is consistent with but does not strongly support the
interpretation that the maser emission arises in a 1000 AU rotating disk
centered on G192.16. Roughly 30" south of G192.16 (0.3 pc) is a compact,
optically thick (optical depth = 1.2) ammonia core (called G192 S3) with an
estimated mass of 2.6 Msun. Based on the presence of 850 micron and 1.2 mm
continuum emission, G192 S3 probably harbors a very young, low-mass protostar
or proto-cluster. The dense gas in the G192 S3 core is likely to be
gravitationally bound and may represent the next site of star formation in this
region.
