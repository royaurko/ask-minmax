The measurements of the parameters of the neutrino mixing matrix in the
present and future neutrino oscillation experiments at accelerators are
presented. The perspectives for high intensity new neutrino facilities as
SuperBeams, BetaBeams and Neutrino Factories devoted to precise measurements
subleading numu to nue oscillation parameters at the atmospheric scale are
discussed. Emphasis is on the determination of the currently unknown 1-3 sector
of the leptonic mixing matrix (i.e. the mixing between the first and third
generation and the CP violating Dirac phase) and on possible experimental
programs to be developed in Europe.
