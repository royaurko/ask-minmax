We present an example of the practical implementation of a protocol for
experimental bifurcation detection based on on-line identification and feedback
control ideas. The idea is to couple the experiment with an on-line
computer-assisted identification/feedback protocol so that the closed-loop
system will converge to the open-loop bifurcation points. We demonstrate the
applicability of this instability detection method by real-time,
computer-assisted detection of period doubling bifurcations of an electronic
circuit; the circuit implements an analog realization of the Roessler system.
The method succeeds in locating the bifurcation points even in the presence of
modest experimental uncertainties, noise and limited resolution. The results
presented here include bifurcation detection experiments that rely on
measurements of a single state variable and delay-based phase space
reconstruction, as well as an example of tracing entire segments of a
codimension-1 bifurcation boundary in two parameter space.
