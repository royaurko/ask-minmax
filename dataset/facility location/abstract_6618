The Penrose inequality has so far been proven in cases of spherical symmetry
and in cases of zero extrinsic curvature. The next simplest case worth
exploring would be non-spherical, non-rotating black holes with non-zero
extrinsic curvature. Following Karkowski et al.'s construction of prolate black
holes, we define initial data on an asymptotically flat spacelike 3-surface
with nonzero extrinsic curvature that may be chosen freely. This gives us the
freedom to define the location of the apparent horizon such that the Penrose
inequality is violated. We show that the dominant energy condition is violated
at the poles for all cases considered.
