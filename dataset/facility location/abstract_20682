We report on new broad band spectral and temporal observations of the
magnetar 1E 2259+586, which is located in the supernova remnant CTB 109. Our
data were obtained simultaneously with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope
Array (NuSTAR) and Swift, and cover the energy range from 0.5-79 keV. We
present pulse profiles in various energy bands and compare them to previous
RXTE results. The NuSTAR data show pulsations above 20 keV for the first time
and we report evidence that one of the pulses in the double-peaked pulse
profile shifts position with energy. The pulsed fraction of the magnetar is
shown to increase strongly with energy. Our spectral analysis reveals that the
soft X-ray spectrum is well characterized by an absorbed double-blackbody or
blackbody plus power-law model in agreement with previous reports. Our new hard
X-ray data, however, suggests that an additional component, such as a
power-law, is needed to describe the NuSTAR and Swift spectrum. We also fit the
data with the recently developed coronal outflow model by Beloborodov for hard
X-ray emission from magnetars. The outflow from a ring on the magnetar surface
is statistically preferred over outflow from a polar cap.
