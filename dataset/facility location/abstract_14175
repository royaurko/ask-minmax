We study various self-avoiding walks (SAWs) which are constrained to lie in
the upper half-plane and are subjected to a compressive force. This force is
applied to the vertex or vertices of the walk located at the maximum distance
above the boundary of the half-space. In the case of bridges, this is the
unique end-point. In the case of SAWs or self-avoiding polygons, this
corresponds to all vertices of maximal height. We first use the conjectured
relation with the Schramm-Loewner evolution to predict the form of the
partition function including the values of the exponents, and then we use
series analysis to test these predictions.
