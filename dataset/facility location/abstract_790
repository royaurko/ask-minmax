We reexamine the axion-photon couplings in various invisible axion models
motivated by the recent proposal of using optical interferometry at the ASST
facility in the SSCL to search for axion. We illustrate that the assignment of
$U(1)_{PQ}$ charges for the fermion fields plays an important role in
determining the couplings. Several simple non-minimal invisible axion models
with suppressed and enhanced axion-photon couplings are constructed,
respectively. We also discuss the implications of possible new experiments to
detect solar axions by conversion to $X$-rays in a static magnetic apparatus
tracking the sun.
