We report on an informal survey about the use of software in the worldwide
astronomical community. The survey was carried out between December 2014 and
February 2015, collecting responses from 1142 astronomers, spanning all career
levels. We find that all participants use software in their research. The vast
majority of participants, 90%, write at least some of their own software. Even
though writing software is so wide-spread among the survey participants, only
8% of them report that they have received substantial training in software
development. Another 49% of the participants have received "little" training.
The remaining 43% have received no training. We also find that astronomers'
software stack is fairly narrow. The 10 most popular tools among astronomers
are (from most to least popular): Python, shell scripting, IDL, C/C++, Fortran,
IRAF, spreadsheets, HTML/CSS, SQL and Supermongo. Across all participants the
most common programing language is Python ($67\pm 2\%$), followed by IDL
($44\pm 2\%$), C/C++ ($37\pm 2\%$) and Fortran ($28\pm 2\%$). IRAF is used
frequently by $24\pm 1\%$ of participants. We show that all trends are largely
independent of career stage, area of research and geographic location.
