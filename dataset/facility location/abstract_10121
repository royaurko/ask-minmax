The pattern of acoustic peaks in the sub-horizon power spectrum of primordial
density anisotropies at recombination can be naturally understood in the
framework of standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology (without inflation)
as a consequence of the boundary conditions imposed by the causal horizon on
the statistical two-points correlation functions: the sub-horizon spectrum is
discrete (harmonic), with comoving modes located at $k_n = n
\frac{\pi}{H^{-1}_{eq}}$, $n = 1,2,...$, because the causally connected patch
of the universe at recombination is compact, with comoving radius
$H^{-1}_{eq}$. The results presented in this paper complement those presented
in [1], where it was shown that the scale invariance of the primordial density
anisotropies over comoving scales of cosmological size is also a consequence of
the boundary conditions imposed by causality. Together these results lay an
appealing theoretical alternative to the inflationary paradigm as the ultimate
answer for the origin of cosmological structures in standard cosmology.
