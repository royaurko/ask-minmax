Motivated by applications in genomics, finance, and biomolecular simulation,
we introduce a Bayesian framework for modeling changepoints that tend to
co-occur across multiple related data sequences. We infer the locations and
sequence memberships of changepoints in our hierarchical model by developing
efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and posterior mode finding
algorithms based on dynamic programming recursions. We further propose an
empirical Bayesian Monte Carlo expectation-maximization procedure for
estimating unknown prior parameters from data. The resulting framework
accommodates a broad range of data and changepoint types, including real-valued
sequences with changing mean or variance and sequences of counts or binary
observations. We demonstrate on simulated data that our changepoint estimation
accuracy is competitive with the best methods in the literature, and we apply
our methodology to the discovery of DNA copy number variations in cancer cell
lines and the analysis of historical price volatility in U.S. stocks.
