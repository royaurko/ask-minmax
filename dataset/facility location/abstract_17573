Swift J1357.2-0933 is the first confirmed very faint black hole X-ray
transient and has a short estimated orbital period of 2.8 hr. We observed Swift
J1357.2-0933 for ~50 ks with XMM-Newton in 2013 July during its quiescent
state. The source is clearly detected at a 0.5-10 keV unabsorbed flux of
~3x10^-15 erg cm-2 s-1. If the source is located at a distance of 1.5 kpc (as
suggested in the literature), this would imply a luminosity of ~8x10^29 erg
s-1, making it the faintest detected quiescent black hole LMXB. This would also
imply that there is no indication of a reversal in the quiescence X-ray
luminosity versus orbital period diagram down to 2.8 hr, as has been predicted
theoretically and recently supported by the detection of the 2.4 hr orbital
period black hole MAXI J1659-152 at a 0.5-10 keV X-ray luminosity of ~ 1.2 x
10^31 erg s-1. However, there is considerable uncertainty in the distance of
Swift J1357.2-0933 and it may be as distant as 6 kpc. In this case, its
quiescent luminosity would be Lx ~ 1.3 x 10^31 erg s-1, i.e., similar to MAXI
J1659-152 and hence it would support the existence of such a bifurcation
period. We also detected the source in optical at r' ~22.3 mag with the
Liverpool telescope, simultaneously to our X-ray observation. The X-ray/optical
luminosity ratio of Swift J1357.2-0933 agrees with the expected value for a
black hole at this range of quiescent X-ray luminosities.
