Using millimeter-very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of the
BL Lac object S5 0716+714 from August 2008 to September 2013, we investigate
variations in the core flux density and orientation of the sub-parsec scale jet
i.e. position angle. The gamma-ray data obtained by the Fermi-LAT (Large Area
Telescope) are used to investigate the high-energy flux variations over the
same time period. For the first time in any blazar, we report a significant
correlation between the gamma-ray flux variations and the position angle (PA)
variations in the VLBI jet. The cross-correlation analysis also indicates a
positive correlation such that the mm-VLBI core flux density variations are
delayed with respect to the gamma-ray flux by 82$\pm$32 days. This suggests
that the high-energy emission is coming from a region located
$\geq$(3.8$\pm$1.9) parsecs upstream of the mm-VLBI core (closer to the central
black hole). These results imply that the observed inner jet morphology has a
strong connection with the observed gamma-ray flares.
