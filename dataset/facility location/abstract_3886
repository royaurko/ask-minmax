We present the motivation, design and current status of the Open Cluster
Chemical Abundances from Spanish Observatories survey (OCCASO). Using the high
resolution spectroscopic facilities available at Spanish observatories, OCCASO
will derive chemical abundances in a sample of 20 to 25 open clusters older
than 0.5 Gyr. This sample will be used to study in detail the formation and
evolution of the Galactic disc using open clusters as tracers.
