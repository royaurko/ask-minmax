Descriptions of cosmic impacts and meteorite falls are found throughout
Australian Aboriginal oral traditions. In some cases, these texts describe the
impact event in detail, sometimes citing the location, suggesting that the
events were witnessed. We explore whether cosmic impacts and meteorite falls
may have been witnessed by Aboriginal Australians and incorporated into their
oral traditions. We discuss the complications and bias in recording and
analysing oral texts but suggest that these texts may be used both to locate
new impact structures or meteorites and model observed impact events. We find
that, while detailed Aboriginal descriptions of cosmic impacts are abundant in
the literature, there is currently no physical evidence connecting these
accounts to impact events currently known to Western science.
