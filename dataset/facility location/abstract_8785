A deep optical galaxy search behind the southern Milky Way and a subsequent
redshift survey of the identified obscured galaxies traces clusters and
superclusters into the deepest layers of Galactic foreground extinction (A_B <=
3^m - 5^m). In the Great Attractor region, we have identified a low-mass
cluster (the Centaurus-Crux cluster) at (l, b, v, sigma) = (305.5deg, +5.5deg,
6214 km/s, 472 km/s) and found that ACO 3627 (the Norma cluster) at (l, b, v,
sigma) = (325.3deg, -7.2deg, 4844 km/s, 848 km/s) is the most massive cluster
in the Great Attractor region known to date. It is comparable in virial mass,
richness and size to the well-known but more distant Coma cluster. The Norma
cluster most likely marks the bottom of the potential well of the Great
Attractor. It is located at the intersection of two main large-scale
structures, the Centaurus Wall and the Norma supercluster. The flow field
observed around the Great Attractor probably is caused by the confluence of
these two massive structures.
