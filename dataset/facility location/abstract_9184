Precise-Doppler experiments suggest that a massive (m sin i=0.86 M_J) planet
orbits at semimajor axis a=3.4 AU around Epsilon Eridani, a nearby star with a
massive debris disk. The dynamical perturbations from such a planet would mold
the distribution of dust around this star. We numerically integrated the orbits
of dust grains in this system to predict the central dust cloud structure. For
a supply of grains that begin in low-inclination, low-eccentricity orbits at 15
AU, the primary feature of the dust distribution is a pair of dense clumps,
containing dust particles trapped in mean-motion resonances of the form n:1.
These clumps appear to revolve around the star once every two planet
revolutions. Future observations with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer,
the SMA, or ALMA could detect these clumps, confirming the existence of the
planet and revealing its location.
