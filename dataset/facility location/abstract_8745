We have used the ROSAT All-Sky Survey around the North Ecliptic Pole to
construct a complete sample of galaxy clusters. The deep and contiguous nature
of the survey affords us the opportunity to examine large-scale structure in
the Universe on scales of hundreds of megaparsecs. We have identified over 99%
of the 446 X-ray sources in the survey area. The cluster sample consists of 65
objects with redshifts approaching unity. Surprisingly, some 20% of the
clusters exists in a wall-like structure at z=0.088 spanning the entire 9 deg x
9 deg survey region. This is a very significant extension of both the
membership and the spatial extent to a known supercluster in this location.
