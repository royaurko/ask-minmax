The electronic structure and the location of muonium centers (Mu) in
single-crystalline ZnO were determined for the first time. Two species of Mu
centers with extremely small hyperfine parameters have been observed below 40
K. Both Mu centers have an axial-symmetric hyperfine structure along with a
[0001] axis, indicating that they are located at the AB_{O,//} and BC_{//}
sites. It is inferred from their small ionization energy (~6 meV and 50 meV)
and hyperfine parameters (~10^{-4} times the vacuum value) that these centers
behave as shallow donors, strongly suggesting that hydrogen is one of the
primary origins of n type conductivity in as-grown ZnO.
