The multi-dissipative photogravitational triaxial elliptic restricted three
body problem is treated. The perturbed locations of triangular points are
computed. The stability of the triangular points under changing one or more
perturbing parameter is investigated. The results revealed that at certain
values of the considered perturbing parameters, we haven't triangular
equilibrium points, or at least there exists but very far from the origin. The
change in the stability/instability regions with eccentricity seems to be
nonlinear. It seems that increasing the eccentricity the enlarge the stability
regions and vice versa. It is revealed that we have two disjoint stability
regions. The stability/instability regions for a new set of eccentricities are
merged to one region. Consider a very high eccentricity stability region for
the whole domain of the mass ratio except in the neighborhood of 0.3 is
obtained. stability/asymptotic stability/instability regions due to certain
photogravitational effects correspond are revealed.
