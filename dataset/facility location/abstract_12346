Position verification in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is quite tricky in
presence of attackers (malicious sensor nodes), who try to break the
verification protocol by reporting their incorrect positions (locations) during
the verification stage. In the literature of WSNs, most of the existing methods
of position verification have used trusted verifiers, which are in fact
vulnerable to attacks by malicious nodes. They also depend on some distance
estimation techniques, which are not accurate in noisy channels (mediums). In
this article, we propose a secure position verification scheme for WSNs in
noisy channels without relying on any trusted entities. Our verification scheme
detects and filters out all malicious nodes from the network with very high
probability.
