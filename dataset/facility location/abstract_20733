The Virgo detector is a kilometer-length interferometer for gravitational
wave detection located near Pisa (Italy). During its second science run (VSR2)
in 2009, six months of data were accumulated with a sensitivity close to its
design. In this paper, the methods used to determine the parameters for
sensitivity estimation and gravitational wave reconstruction are described. The
main quantities to be calibrated are the frequency response of the mirror
actuation and the sensing of the output power. Focus is also put on their
absolute timing. The monitoring of the calibration data as well as the
parameter estimation with independent techniques are discussed to provide an
estimation of the calibration uncertainties. Finally, the estimation of the
Virgo sensitivity in the frequency-domain is described and typical
sensitivities measured during VSR2 are shown.
