In a virtualized environment, contextualization is the process of configuring
a VM instance for the needs of various deployment use cases. Contextualization
in CernVM can be done by passing a handwritten context to the user data field
of cloud APIs, when running CernVM on the cloud, or by using CernVM web
interface when running the VM locally. CernVM Online is a publicly accessible
web interface that unifies these two procedures. A user is able to define,
store and share CernVM contexts using CernVM Online and then apply them either
in a cloud by using CernVM Cloud Gateway or on a local VM with the single-step
pairing mechanism. CernVM Cloud Gateway is a distributed system that provides a
single interface to use multiple and different clouds (by location or type,
private or public). Cloud gateway has been so far integrated with OpenNebula,
CloudStack and EC2 tools interfaces. A user, with access to a number of clouds,
can run CernVM cloud agents that will communicate with these clouds using their
interfaces, and then use one single interface to deploy and scale CernVM
clusters. CernVM clusters are defined in CernVM Online and consist of a set of
CernVM instances that are contextualized and can communicate with each other.
