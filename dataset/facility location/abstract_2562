Two-dimensional space-resolved temperature and density images of an inertial
confinement fusion (ICF) implosion core have been diagnosed for the first time.
Argon-doped, direct-drive ICF experiments were performed at the Omega Laser
Facility and a collection of two-dimensional space-resolved spectra were
obtained from an array of gated, spectrally resolved pinhole images recorded by
a multi-monochromatic x-ray imager. Detailed spectral analysis revealed
asymmetries of the core not just in shape and size but in the temperature and
density spatial distributions, thus characterizing the core with an
unprecedented level of detail.
