Magnetooptical properties of magnetic photonic crystals have been
investigated in the view of their possible applications for the modern
integrated-optics devices. A "transfer matrices" formalism was expanded for the
case of oblique light incidence on the periodic nanoscaled magnetic
multilayered systems. Several new effects such as the Faraday effect dependence
on the incidence angle and the tunability of the bandgap defect modes spectral
location by external magnetic fields were found. Several possibilities of
one-dimensional magnetic photonic crystals applications for the optical devices
are discussed. Initial steps towards the practical implementation of the
proposed devices are reported.
