Nowadays neutron scattering science is increasing its instrumental power.
Most of the neutron sources in the world are pushing the development of their
technologies to be more performing. The neutron scattering development is also
pushed by the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Sweden, a neutron facility
which has just started construction. Concerning small area detectors (1m^2),
the 3He technology, which is today cutting edge, is reaching fundamental limits
in its development. Counting rate capability, spatial resolution and
cost-e?ectiveness, are only a few examples of the features that must be
improved to ful?fill the new requirements. On the other hand, 3He technology
could still satisfy the detector requirements for large area applications
(50m^2), however, because of the present 3He shortage that the world is
experiencing, this is not practical anymore. The recent detector advances (the
Multi-Grid and the Multi-Blade prototypes) developed in the framework of the
collaboration between the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) and ESS are presented in
this manuscript. In particular two novel 10B-based detectors are described; one
for large area applications (the Multi-Grid prototype) and one for application
in neutron refectometry (small area applications, the Multi-Blade prototype).
