The phase diagram at zero temperature of $^4$He adsorbed on an helium
incommensurate triangular solid on top of a single graphene sheet has been
obtained using the diffusion Monte Carlo method. We have found that, in
accordance with previous experimental and simulation results for graphite, the
ground state of $^4$He on this setup is a liquid that, upon compression,
transforms into a triangular solid. To define the stability limits of both
liquid and solid phases, we considered not only the adsorption energies of the
atoms located on the second layer but the average energy of the atoms in both
layers. Our results show that the lower density limit for a stable liquid in
the second layer is 0.163 $\pm$ 0.005 \AA$^{-2}$ and that the lower limit for
the existence of an incommensurate solid on the second layer is 0.186 $\pm$
0.003 \AA$^{-2}$. Both values are in overall agreement with the results of
torsional oscillator experiments and heat capacity measurements on graphite.
The 4/7 and 7/12 registered solids are found to be metastable with respect to
triangular incommensurate arrangements of the same density.
