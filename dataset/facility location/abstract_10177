We test a new parametrization of a suitably truncated classically perfect
action for SU(2) pure gauge theory with respect to self-consistency and locate
the deconfinement transition on a 12^3X4 lattice. Using the technique of
smoothing (blocking followed by inverse blocking) we demonstrate clustering of
action and topological charge density. Concentrating on the Abelian monopoles
found in smoothed configurations after Abelian projection from the maximally
Abelian gauge, we present evidence for their role as carriers of non-Abelian
action and topological charge.
