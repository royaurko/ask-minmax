The results obtained from the ASCA observations of the cluster of galaxies
Abell 3627 are presented. This cluster, located behind the Milky way, was
recently found to be a nearby, X-ray bright and very rich cluster. Pointed
observations onto the central region of the cluster gave a gas temperature of
$\sim7$ keV and a metallicity of about 0.2 solar. An offset pointing to a
substructure elongated to south-east of the cluster center gave a significantly
lower temperature of $\sim 5$ keV. The 2--10 keV luminosity within a radius of
40' (1.1 Mpc) is estimated to be $3.7 \times 10^{44} erg/s$. The X-ray data
imply a cluster mass of about $4\times 10^{14}$ $M_\odot$ within 40'.
