Weak gravitational lensing enables direct reconstruction of dark matter maps
over cosmologically significant volumes. This research is currently
telescope-limited. The Dark Matter Telescope (DMT) is a proposed 8.4 m
telescope with a 3 degree field of view, with an etendue of 260 $(m.
degree)^2$, ten times greater than any other current or planned telescope. With
its large etendue and dedicated observational mode, the DMT fills a nearly
unexplored region of parameter space and enables projects that would take
decades on current facilities. The DMT will be able to reach 10-sigma limiting
magnitudes of 27-28 magnitude in the wavelength range .3 - 1 um over a 7 square
degree field in 3 nights of dark time. Here we review its unique weak lensing
cosmology capabilities and the design that enables those capabilities.
