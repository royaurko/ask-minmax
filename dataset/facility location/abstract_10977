We investigate the existence and especially the linear stability of single
and multiple-charge quantized vortex states of nonlinear Schroedinger equations
in the presence of a periodic and a parabolic potential in two spatial
dimensions. The study is motivated by the examination of pancake-shaped
Bose-Einstein condensates in the presence of magnetic and optical confiement. A
two-parameter space of the condensate's chemical potential versus the periodic
potential's strength is scanned for both single- and double-quantized vortex
states located at a local minimum or a local maximum of the lattice. Triply
charged vortices are also briefly discussed. Single-charged vortices are found
to be stable for cosinusoidal potentials and unstable for sinusoidal ones above
a critical strength. Higher charge vortices are more unstable for both types of
potentials and their dynamical evolution leads to breakup into single-charged
vortices.
