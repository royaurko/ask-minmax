Braneworlds, understood here as double domain wall spacetimes, can be
described in terms of a linear harmonic function, with kinks at the locations
of the boundary branes. In a dynamical setting, there is therefore the risk
that the boundary brane of negative tension, at whose location the value of the
harmonic function is always lowest, can encounter a zero of this harmonic
function, corresponding to the formation of a singularity. We show that for
certain types of brane-bound matter this singularity can be avoided, and the
negative-tension brane can shield the bulk spacetime from the singularity by
bouncing back smoothly before reaching the singularity. In our analysis we
compare the 5- and 4-dimensional descriptions of this phenomenon in order to
determine the validity of the moduli space approximation.
