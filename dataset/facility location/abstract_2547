We use the world data on the pion form factor for space-like kinematics and a
technique previously used to extract the proton transverse densities to extract
the transverse pion charge density and its uncertainty due the incomplete
knowledge of the pion form factor at large values of Q2 and the experimental
uncertainties. The pion charge density at small values of impact parameter
b<0.1 fm is dominated by this incompleteness error while the range between
0.1-0.3 fm is relatively well constrained. A comparison of pion and proton
transverse charge densities shows that the pion is denser than the proton for
values of b<0.2 fm. The pion and proton transverse charge densities seem to be
the same for values of b=0.3-0.6 fm. Future data from Thomas Jefferson National
Accelerator Facility (JLab) 12 GeV and the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will
increase the dynamic extent of the form factor data to higher values of Q2 and
thus reduce the uncertainties in the extracted pion transverse charge density.
