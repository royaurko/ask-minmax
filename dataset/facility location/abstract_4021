Background: Transposed elements (TEs) have a substantial impact on mammalian
evolution and are involved in numerous genetic diseases. We compared the impact
of TEs on the human transcriptome and the mouse transcriptome. Results: We
compiled a dataset of all TEs in the human and mouse genomes, identifying
3,932,058 and 3,122,416 TEs, respectively. We than extracted TEs located within
human and mouse genes and, surprisingly, we found that 60% of TEs in both human
and mouse are located in intronic sequences, even though introns comprise only
24% of the human genome. All TE families in both human and mouse can exonize.
TE families that are shared between human and mouse exhibit the same percentage
of TE exonization in the two species, but the exonization level of Alu, a
primatespecific retroelement, is significantly greater than that of other TEs
within the human genome, leading to a higher level of TE exonization in human
than in mouse (1,824 exons compared with 506 exons, respectively). We detected
a primate-specific mechanism for intron gain, in which Alu insertion into an
exon creates a new intron located in the 3' untranslated region (termed
'intronization'). Finally, the insertion of TEs into the first and last exons
of a gene is more frequent in human than in mouse, leading to longer exons in
human. Conclusion: Our findings reveal many effects of TEs on these two
transcriptomes. These effects are substantially greater in human than in mouse,
which is due to the presence of Alu elements in human.
