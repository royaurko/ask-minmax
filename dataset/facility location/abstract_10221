The energy dependence of the total hadronic cross sections is caused by gluon
bremsstrahlung which we treat nonperturbatively. It is located at small
transverse distances about 0.3 fm from the valence quarks. The cross section of
gluon radiation is predicted to exponentiate and rise with energy as s^{\Delta}
with \Delta=0.17 +/- 0.01. The total cross section also includes a large energy
independent Born term which corresponds to no gluon radiation. The calculated
total cross section and the slope of elastic scattering are in good agreement
with the data.
