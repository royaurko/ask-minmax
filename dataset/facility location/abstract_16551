We study the QCD phase diagram, in particular we study the critical points of
the two main QCD phase transitions, confinement and chiral symmetry breaking.
Confinement drives chiral symmetry breaking, and, due to the finite quark mass,
at small density both transitions are a crossover, while they are a first or
second order phase transition in large density. We study the QCD phase diagram
with a quark potential model including both confinement and chiral symmetry. We
present the confinement of quark fields into a flux tube, obtained in SU(3)
quenched lattice QCD, to illustrate the importance of the confining
quark-antiquark potential. Our finite temperature con-fining potential is
extracted from the Lattice QCD data of the Bielefeld group. Our formalism, the
Coulomb gauge hamiltonian of QCD, is presently the only one able to
microscopically include both a quark-antiquark confining potential and a vacuum
condensate of quark-antiquark pairs. This model is able to address all the
excited hadrons, and chiral symmetry breaking, at the same token. Our order
parameters are the Polyakov loop and the quark mass gap. We address how the
quark masses affect the critical point location in the phase diagram.
