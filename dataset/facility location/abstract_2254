An extension of the framework of the Finite Integration Technique (FIT)
including dynamic and adaptive mesh refinement is presented. After recalling
the standard formulation of the FIT, the proposed mesh adaptation procedure is
described. Besides the linear interpolation approach, a novel interpolation
technique based on specialized spline functions for approximating the discrete
electromagnetic field solution during mesh adaptation is introduced. The
standard FIT on a fixed mesh and the new adaptive approach are applied to a
simulation test case with known analytical solution. The numerical accuracy of
the two methods are shown to be comparable. The dynamic mesh approach is,
however, much more efficient. This is also demonstrated for the full scale
modeling of the complete RF gun at the Photo Injector Test Facility DESY
Zeuthen (PITZ) on a single computer. Results of a detailed design study
addressing the effects of individual components of the gun onto the beam
emittance using a fully self-consistent approach are presented.
