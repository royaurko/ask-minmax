A spectrograph is an optical instrument that disperses photons of different
energies into distinct directions and space locations, and images photon
spectra on a position-sensitive detector. Spectrographs consist of collimating,
angular dispersive, and focusing optical elements. Bragg reflecting crystals
arranged in an asymmetric scattering geometry are used as the dispersing
elements. A ray-transfer matrix technique is applied to propagate x-rays
through the optical elements. Several optical designs of hard x-ray
spectrographs are proposed and their performance is analyzed. Spectrographs
with an energy resolution of 0.1 meV and a spectral window of imaging up to a
few tens of meVs are shown to be feasible for inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS)
spectroscopy applications. In another example, a spectrograph with a 1-meV
spectral resolution and 85-meV spectral window of imaging is considered for Cu
K-edge resonant IXS (RIXS).
