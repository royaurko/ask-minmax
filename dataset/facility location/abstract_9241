We present observational results from studying the quasi-periodicities in
global solar radio flux during periods of enhanced noise storm activity, over
durations of ~4 hrs a day ("intra-day" variations), observed at 77.5 MHz with
the newly commissioned log-periodic array tracking system at the Gauribidanur
radio observatory. Positional information on the storm centers were obtained
with the radio imaging data from the Nancay (sic.) Radioheliograph (NRH), while
their active region (AR) counterparts on the photosphere (and the overlying
chromosphere) were located from the H-alpha images of the Big Bear Solar
Observatory (BBSO). The quasi-periodicity in flux was found to be 110 minutes,
with the fluctuation in flux being 3(+/- 1.5) solar flux units (sfu). The
results of such pulsations are interpreted qualitatively as evidence for
coronal seismology.
