We introduce and investigate the ability of an attacker to surreptitiously
use an otherwise secure wireless network to detect moving people through walls,
in an area in which people expect their location to be private. We call this
attack on location privacy of people an "exploiting radio windows" (ERW)
attack. We design and implement the ERW attack methodology for through wall
people localization that relies on reliably detecting when people cross the
link lines by using physical layer measurements between the legitimate
transmitters and the attack receivers. We also develop a method to estimate the
direction of movement of a person from the sequence of link lines crossed
during a short time interval. Additionally, we describe how an attacker may
estimate any artificial changes in transmit power (used as a countermeasure),
compensate for these power changes using measurements from sufficient number of
links, and still detect line crossings. We implement our methodology on WiFi
and ZigBee nodes and experimentally evaluate the ERW attack by monitoring
people movements through walls in two real-world settings. We find that our
methods achieve very high accuracy in detecting line crossings and determining
direction of motion.
