The Simulation of Cherenkov light lateral distribution function (LDF) from
particles of Extensive Air Showers (EAS) with ultra high energy cosmic rays
(E>=10^16 eV) was simulated for primary protons by the computer code CORSIKA.
The parameterization, that constructed on the basis of this simulation have
allowed us to reconstruct the events, that is, to reconstruct the type and
energy of the particle that generated EAS from signal amplitudes of Cherenkov
light registered with the Tunka-25 facility. The extrapolation of the Cherenkov
light LDF approximation at the energy range (10^16-2.10^18 eV) was taken into
account.
