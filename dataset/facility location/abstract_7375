The contributors suggest a low cost closed AB-Dome, which may protect small cities
such as Sederot from rockets, mortar shells, chemical and biological weapons.
The offered AB-Dome is also very useful in peacetime because it protects the
city from outside weather (violent storms, hail) and creates a fine climate
within the Dome. The roughly hemispherical AB-Dome is a gigantic inflated thin
transparent film, located at altitude up to 1 - 5 kilometers, which converts
the city into a closed-loop air system. The film may be armored with a basalt
or steel grille or cloth pocket-retained stones that destroy (by collision or
detonation) incoming rockets, shells and other projectiles. Such an AB-Dome
would even protect the city in case of a third-party nuclear war involving
temporary poisoning of the Earth atmosphere by radioactive dust. The building
of the offered dome is easy; the film spreads on the ground, the fan engines
turn on and the cover rises to the needed altitude and is supported there by a
small internal overpressure.
  The offered method is cheaper by thousands of times than protection of a city
by current anti-rocket systems. The AB-Dome may be also used (height is up to
1-5 and more kilometers) for TV, communication, long distance location,
tourism, suspended high speed and altitude windmills (energy), illumination and
entertainment (projected messages and pictures).
  The contributors developed the theory of AB-Dome, made estimations, computations
and computed a typical project. Discussion and results are at the end of the
article.
