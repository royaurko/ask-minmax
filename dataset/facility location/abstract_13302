We have carried out adaptive-optics assisted observations at the Subaru
telescope, and have found 11 intrinsically polarized sources in the central
parsec of our Galaxy. They are selected from 318 point sources with Ks<15.5,
and their interstellar polarizations are corrected using a Stokes Q/I - U/I
diagram. Considering brightness, near-infrared color excess, and the amount of
intrinsic polarization, two of them are good young stellar object (YSO)
candidates with an age of ~10^5 yr. If they are genuine YSOs, their existence
provides strong constraints on star formation mechanisms in this region. In the
remaining sources, two are known as bow-shock sources in the Northern arm. One
other is also located in the Northern arm and shows very similar properties,
and thus likely to be a so far unknown bow-shock source. The origin of the
intrinsic polarization of the other sources is as yet uncertain.
