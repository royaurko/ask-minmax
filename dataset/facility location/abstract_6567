A scheme is formulated for testing nonlocality of single photons by
considering the state of a single photon that could be located within one of
two spatially separated cavities. The outcomes of four experiments on this
state involving the resonant interactions of two-level atoms with these
cavities and a couple of other auxiliary ones is shown to lead to a
contradiction with the criterion of locality.
