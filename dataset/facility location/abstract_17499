We present the results of theoretical study of Current-Phase Relations (CPR)
in Josephson junctions of SIsFS type, where 'S' is a bulk superconductor and
'IsF' is a complex weak link consisting of a superconducting film 's', a
metallic ferromagnet 'F' and an insulating barrier 'I'. We calculate the
relationship between Josephson current and phase difference. At temperatures
close to critical, calculations are performed analytically in the frame of the
Ginsburg-Landau equations. At low temperatures numerical method is developed to
solve selfconsistently the Usadel equations in the structure. We demonstrate
that SIsFS junctions have several distinct regimes of supercurrent transport
and we examine spatial distributions of the pair potential across the structure
in different regimes. We study the crossover between these regimes which is
caused by shifting the location of a weak link from the tunnel barrier 'I' to
the F-layer. We show that strong deviations of the CPR from sinusoidal shape
occur even in a vicinity of Tc, and these deviations are strongest in the
crossover regime. We demonstrate the existence of temperature-induced crossover
between 0 and pi states in the contact and show that smoothness of this
transition strongly depends on the CPR shape.
