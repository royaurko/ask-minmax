The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter (ALMA) Array Front End (FE) system
is the first element in a complex chain of signal receiving, conversion,
processing and recording. 70 Front Ends will be required for the project. The
Front End is designed to receive signals in ten different frequency bands. In
the initial phase of operations, the antennas will be fully equipped with six
bands. These are Band 3 (84-116 GHz), Band 4 (125-163 GHz), Band 6 (211-275
GHz), Band 7 (275-373 GHz), Band 8 (385-500 GHz) and Band 9 (602-720 GHz). It
is planned to equip the antennas with the missing bands at a later stage of
ALMA operations, with a few Band 5 (163-211 GHz) and Band 10 (787-950 GHz)
receivers in use before the end of the construction project.
  The ALMA Front End is far superior to any existing receiver systems;
spin-offs of the ALMA prototypes are leading to improved sensitivities in
existing millimeter and submillimeter observatories. The Front End units are
comprised of numerous elements, produced at different locations in Europe,
North America and East Asia and are integrated at several Front End integration
centers (FEIC) to insure timely delivery of all the units to Chile. The North
American FEIC (NA FEIC) is at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory facility
in Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.
  This paper describes the design and performance of the test set used at the
NA FEIC to check the performance of the Front Ends, following integration and
prior to shipment to Chile.
