We develop a statistical theory of stimulated Brillouin backscatter (BSBS) of
a spatially and temporally partially incoherent laser beam for laser fusion
relevant plasma. We find a new collective regime of BSBS which has a much
larger threshold than the classical threshold of a coherent beam in
long-scale-length laser fusion plasma. We identify two contributions to BSBS
convective instability increment. The first is collective with intensity
threshold independent of the laser correlation time and controlled by
diffraction. The second is independent of diffraction, it grows with increase
of the correlation time and does not have an intensity threshold. The
instability threshold is inside the typical parameter region of National
Ignition Facility (NIF). We also find that the bandwidth of KrF-laser-based
fusion systems would be large enough to allow additional suppression of BSBS.
