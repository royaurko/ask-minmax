We report the discovery of 6 SX Phoenicis stars in the southern globular
cluster NGC 4833. Images were obtained from January through June 2011 with the
Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy 0.6 meter telescope located
at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory. The image subtraction method of
Alard & Lupton (1998)was used to search for variable stars in the cluster. We
confirmed 17 previously cataloged variables by Demers & Wehlau(1977). In
addition to the previously known variables we have identified 10 new variables.
Of the total number of confirmed variables in our 10x10 arcmin^2 field, we
classified 10 RRab variables, with a mean period of 0.69591 days, 7 RRc, with a
mean period of 0.39555 days, 2 possible RRe variables with a mean period of
0.30950 days, a W Ursae Majoris contact binary, an Algol-type binary, and the 6
SX Phoenicis stars with a mean period of 0.05847 days. The periods, relative
numbers of RRab and RRc variables, and Bailey diagram are indicative of the
cluster being of the Oosterhoff type II. We present the phased-light curves,
periods of previously known variables and the periods and classifications of
the newly discovered variables, and their location on the color-magnitude
diagram.
