Co-addition of deep (rms about 30 microJy) 20 cm data obtained with the
Australia Telescope Compact Array at the location of Spitzer Wide field survey
(SWIRE) sources has yielded statistics of radio source counterparts to faint 24
micron sources in stacked images with rms < 1 microJy. We confirm that the
infrared-radio correlation extends to f(24micron) = 100 microJy but with a
significantly lower coefficient, f (20cm) = 0.039 f(24micron) (or q24 = 1.39)
than hitherto reported. We postulate that this may be due to a change in the
mean q24 value ratio for objects with f(24micron) < 1mJy.
