In an experiment at the SISSI-LISE3 facility of GANIL, the decay of the
proton drip-line nucleus Fe45 has been studied after projectile fragmentation
of a Ni58 primary beam at 75 MeV/nucleon impinging on a natural nickel target.
Fragment-implantation events have been correlated with radioactive decay events
in a 16x16 pixel silicon strip detector on an event-by-event basis. The
decay-energy spectrum of Fe45 implants shows a distinct peak at
(1.06+/-0.04)MeV with a half-life of T1/2 = (4.7+3.4-1.4)ms. None of the events
in this peak is in coincidence with beta particles which were searched for in a
detector next to the implantation detector. For a longer correlation interval,
daughter decays of the two-proton daughter Cr43 can be observed after Fe45
implantation. The decay energy for Fe45 agrees nicely with several theoretical
predictions for two-proton emission. Barrier-penetration calculations slightly
favour a di-proton emission picture over an emission of two individual protons
and point thus to a He2 emission mode.
