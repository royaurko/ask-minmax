Context. Frequent, simultaneous observations across the electromagnetic
spectrum are essential to the study of a range of astrophysical phenomena
including Active Galactic Nuclei. A key tool of such studies is the ability to
observe an object when it flares i.e. exhibits a rapid and significant increase
in its flux density.
  Aims. We describe the specific observational procedures and the calibration
techniques that have been developed and tested to create a single baseline
radio interferometer that can rapidly observe a flaring object. This is the
only facility that is dedicated to rapid high resolution radio observations of
an object south of -30 degrees declination. An immediate application is to
provide rapid contemporaneous radio coverage of AGN flaring at {\gamma}-ray
frequencies detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.
  Methods. A single baseline interferometer was formed with radio telescopes in
Hobart, Tasmania and Ceduna, South Australia. A software correlator was set up
at the University of Tasmania to correlate these data.
  Results. Measurements of the flux densities of flaring objects can be made
using our observing strategy within half an hour of a triggering event. These
observations can be calibrated with amplitude errors better than 15%. Lower
limits to the brightness temperatures of the sources can also be calculated
using CHI.
