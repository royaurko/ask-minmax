We show that the Pade Approximant (PA) approach for resummation of
perturbative series in QCD provides a systematic method for approximating the
flow of momentum in Feynman diagrams. In the large-$\beta_0$ limit, diagonal
PA's generalize the Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie (BLM) scale-setting method to
higher orders in a renormalization scale- and scheme-invariant manner, using
multiple scales that represent Neubert's concept of the distribution of
momentum flow through a virtual gluon. If the distribution is non-negative, the
PA's have only real roots, and approximate the distribution function by a sum
of delta-functions, whose locations and weights are identical to the optimal
choice provided by the Gaussian quadrature method for numerical integration. We
show how the first few coefficients in a perturbative series can set rigorous
bounds on the all-order momentum distribution function, if it is positive. We
illustrate the method with the vacuum polarization function and the Bjorken sum
rule computed in the large-$\beta_0$ limit.
