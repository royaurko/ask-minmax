The horizontal component amplitudes of magnetograms recorded by ground-based
observatories of the INTERMAGNET network have been used to analyze the global
pattern variance of the solar diurnal variations. Those kinds of data present
gaps in records and consequently we explore them via a time-frequency gapped
wavelet algorithm. We propose a new approach to analyze magnetograms based on
scale correlation. The results show that the magnetic records have a
latitudinal dependence affected by the season of year and by the level of solar
activity. We have found a disparity on the latitudinal response at Southern and
Northern Hemispheres during solstices, which is expected due to the asymmetry
of the Sq field. On the other hand at equinoxes, records from stations located
at approximately the same latitude but at different longitudes presented
peculiar dissimilarities. The achieved results suggest that quiet day patterns
and the physical processes involved in their formation are strongly affected
by: the conductivity of the E-region, the geomagnetic field intensity and its
configuration, and the thermospheric winds.
