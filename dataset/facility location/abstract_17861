Hot subdwarf B stars (sdBs) are evolved, core helium-burning objects located
on the extreme horizontal branch. Their formation history is still puzzling as
the sdB progenitors must lose nearly all of their hydrogen envelope during the
red-giant phase. About half of the known sdBs are in close binaries with
periods from 1.2 h to a few days, a fact that implies they experienced a
common-envelope phase. Eclipsing hot subdwarf binaries (also called HW Virginis
systems) are rare but important objects for determining fundamental stellar
parameters. Even more significant and uncommon are those binaries containing a
pulsating sdB, as the mass can be determined independently by asteroseismology.
  Here we present a first analysis of the eclipsing hot subdwarf binary
V2008-1753. The light curve shows a total eclipse, a prominent reflection
effect, and low--amplitude pulsations with periods from 150 to 180 s. An
analysis of the light-- and radial velocity (RV) curves indicates a mass ratio
close to $ q = 0.146$, an RV semi-amplitude of $K=54.6 \,\rm kms^{-1}$, and an
inclination of $i=86.8^\circ$. Combining these results with our spectroscopic
determination of the surface gravity, $\log \,g = 5.83$, the best--fitting
model yields an sdB mass of 0.47$M_{\rm \odot}$ and a companion mass of $69
M_{\rm Jup}$. As the latter mass is below the hydrogen-burning limit,
V2008-1753 represents the first HW Vir system known consisting of a pulsating
sdB and a brown dwarf companion. Consequently, it holds great potential for
better constraining models of sdB binary evolution and asteroseismology.
