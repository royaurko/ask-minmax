We prove that a flow of cold collisionless particles from all directions in
and out of a region necessarily forms a caustic. A corollary is that, in cold
dark matter cosmology, galactic halos have inner caustics in addition to the
more obvious outer caustics. The outer caustics are fold catastrophes located
on topological spheres surrounding the galaxy. To obtain the catastrophe
structure of the inner caustics, we simulate the infall of cold collisionless
particles in a fixed gravitational potential. The structure of inner caustics
depends on the angular momentum distribution of the infalling particles. We
confirm a previous result that the inner caustic is a "tricusp ring" when the
initial velocity field is dominated by net overall rotation. A tricusp ring is
a closed tube whose cross section is a section of an elliptic umbilic
catastrophe. However, tidal torque theory predicts that the initial velocity
field is irrotational. For irrotational initial velocity fields, we find the
inner caustic to have a tent-like structure which we describe in detail in
terms of the known catastrophes. We also show how the tent caustic transforms
into a tricusp ring when a rotational component is added to the initial
velocity field.
