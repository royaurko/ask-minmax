We have observed the bright, magnetically active multiple star AB Doradus in
a multiwavelength campaign centring around two large facility allocations in
November 2006 and January, 2007. Our observations have covered at least three
large flares. These flares were observed to produce significant hardening of
the X-ray spectra during their very initial stages. We monitored flare-related
effects using the Suzaku X-ray satellite and the Australia Telescope Compact
Array at 3.6 and 6 cm. Observations at 11 and 21 cm were also included, but
they were compromised by interference. From our multiwavelength coverage we
find that the observed effects can be mainly associated with a large active
region near longitude zero. The second major X-ray and microwave flare of Jan
8, 2007 was observed with a favourable geometry that allowed its initial
high-energy impulsive phase to be observed in the higher frequency range of
Suzaku's XIS detectors. The fractional circular polarisation was measured for
the complete runs, for 25 min integrations and, at 4.80 GHz, for 5 min
integrations. Most of the full data sets showed circular polarisation fractions
from AB Dor B that were significant at greater than the 3 sigma level. In
several of the 5 min integrations at 4.80 and 8.64 GHz this fraction reached a
significance level between 3 and 9 sigma. Lack of angular resolution prevented
identification of these high V/I values with one or other of the two low-mass
red-dwarf components of AB Dor B.
