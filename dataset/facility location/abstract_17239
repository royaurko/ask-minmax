In social dilemmas, cooperation among randomly interacting individuals is
often difficult to achieve. The situation changes if interactions take place in
a network where the network structure jointly evolves with the behavioral
strategies of the interacting individuals. In particular, cooperation can be
stabilized if individuals tend to cut interaction links when facing adverse
neighborhoods. Here we consider two different types of reaction to adverse
neighborhoods, and all possible mixtures between these reactions. When faced
with a gloomy outlook, players can either choose to cut and rewire some of
their links to other individuals, or they can migrate to another location and
establish new links in the new local neighborhood. We find that in general
local rewiring is more favorable for the evolution of cooperation than
emigration from adverse neighborhoods. Rewiring helps to maintain the diversity
in the degree distribution of players and favors the spontaneous emergence of
cooperative clusters. Both properties are known to favor the evolution of
cooperation on networks. Interestingly, a mixture of migration and rewiring is
even more favorable for the evolution of cooperation than rewiring on its own.
While most models only consider a single type of reaction to adverse
neighborhoods, the coexistence of several such reactions may actually be an
optimal setting for the evolution of cooperation.
