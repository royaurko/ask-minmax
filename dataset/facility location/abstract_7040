Daring predictions of the proximate future can establish shared discursive
frameworks, mobilize capital, and steer complex processes. Among the prophetic
visions that encouraged and accompanied the development of new communication
technologies was the "Digital Earth," described in a 1998 speech by Al Gore as
a high-resolution representation of the planet to share and analyze detailed
information about its state. This article traces a genealogy of the Digital
Earth as a techno-scientific myth, locating it in a constellation of media
futures, arguing that a common subtext of these envisionments consists of a
dream of wholeness, an afflatus to overcome perceived fragmentation among
humans, and between humans and the Earth.
