A model of the bar and old stellar disk of the Galaxy has been derived from
the survey of the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) of the Cosmic
Background Explorer at wavelengths of 1.25, 2.2, 3.5, and 4.9 microns. It
agrees very well with the data, except in directions in which the near-
infrared optical depth is high. Among the conclusions drawn from the model: The
Sun is located approximately 16.5 pc above the midpoint of the Galactic plane.
The disk has an outer edge four kpc from the Sun, and is warped like the HI
layer. It has a central hole roughly the diameter of the inner edge of the
"three-kiloparsec" molecular cloud ring, and within that hole lies a bright,
strong, "early-type" bar, tilted approximately 14 degrees from the Sun-Galactic
center line. The model has 47 free parameters. The model is discussed in detail
and contour plots and images of the residuals presented.
