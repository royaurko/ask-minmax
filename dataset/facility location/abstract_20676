The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will search for planets
transiting bright and nearby stars. TESS has been selected by NASA for launch
in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into
a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its two-year
mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical CCD cameras to monitor at
least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with I = 4-13 for temporary drops in
brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an
interval ranging from one month to one year, depending mainly on the star's
ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the
ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with
the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target
stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded
every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10-100 times brighter than those surveyed by
the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to
characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a
thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in
size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every four months, inviting
immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will
be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets,
which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.
