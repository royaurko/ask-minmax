We present a new analysis on the issue of the location of the observed
microlensing events in direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This is
carried out starting from a recently drawn coherent picture of the geometrical
structure and dynamics of the LMC disk and by considering different
configurations for the LMC bar. In this framework it clearly emerges that the
spatial distribution of the events observed so far shows a near--far asymmetry.
This turns out to be compatible with the optical depth calculated for the LMC
halo objects. In this perspective, our main conclusion, supported by a
statistical analysis on the outcome of an evaluation of the microlensing rate,
is that self lensing can not account for all the observed events. Finally we
propose a general inequality to calculate quickly an upper limit to the optical
depth along a line of view through the LMC center.
