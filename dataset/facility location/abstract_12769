We give a detailed analysis of the effects of scheme transformations in the
vicinity of an exact or approximate infrared fixed point in an asymptotically
free gauge theory with fermions. We list necessary conditions that such
transformations must obey and show that, although these can easily be satisfied
in the vicinity of an ultraviolet fixed point, they constitute significant
restrictions on scheme transformations at an infrared fixed point. We construct
acceptable scheme transformations and use these to study the scheme-dependence
of an infrared fixed point, making comparison with our previous three-loop and
four-loop calculations of the location of this point in the $\bar{MS}$ scheme.
We also use an illustrative hypothetical exact $\beta$ function to investigate
how accurately analyses of finite-order series expansions probe an infrared
fixed point and the effect of a scheme transformation on these. Some
implications of our work are discussed.
