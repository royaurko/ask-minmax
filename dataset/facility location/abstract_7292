[Abridged]We compare both the Milky Way and M31 galaxies to local external
disk galaxies within the same mass range, using their relative locations in the
planes formed by V_flat versus M_K, j_disk, and the average Fe abundance of
stars in the galaxy outskirts. We find, for all relationships, that the MW is
systematically offset by ~ 1 sigma, showing a significant deficiency in stellar
mass, in angular momentum, in disk radius and [Fe/H] in the stars in its
outskirts at a given V_flat. On the basis of their location in the M_K, V_flat,
and R_d volume, the fraction of spirals like the MW is 7+/-1%, while M31
appears to be a "typical'' spiral. Our Galaxy appears to have escaped any
significant merger over the last ~10 Gyrs which may explain why it is deficient
by a factor 2 to 3 in stellar mass, angular momentum and outskirts metallicity
and then, unrepresentative of the typical spiral. As with M31, most local
spirals show evidence for a history shaped mainly by relatively recent merging.
We conclude that the standard scenario of secular evolution is generally unable
to reproduce the properties of most (if not all) spiral galaxies. However, the
so-called "spiral rebuilding'' scenario proposed by Hammer et al. 2005 is
consistent with the properties of both distant galaxies and of their
descendants - the local spirals.
