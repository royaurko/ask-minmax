In the Lema\^{\i}tre -- Tolman (L--T) models that have nonconstant bang-time
function $t_B(r)$, light emitted close to those points of the Big Bang where
$\dril {t_B} r \neq 0$ is blueshifted at the receiver position. The blueshifted
rays are expected to perturb the temperature of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) radiation along the lines of sight of the present central observer. It is
shown here that, in a general L--T model, the $t_B(r)$ can be chosen so that
the blueshift-generating region is hidden before the recombination time, where
the L--T model does not apply. The rest of the paper is devoted to
investigating blueshifts in one specific L--T model, called L--T$(t_B)$ -- the
one that duplicates the luminosity distance vs. redshift relation of the
$\Lambda$CDM model using nonconstant $t_B(r)$ alone. The location of the
blueshift-generating region in the L--T$(t_B)$ spacetime is determined.
Profiles of redshift/blueshift along several rays intersecting the past light
cone of the present central observer are calculated. The L--T$(t_B)$ model
matched to Friedmann is considered, and profiles of redshift/blueshift in such
a composite model are calculated. The requirement of invisibility of blueshifts
makes the L--T$(t_B)$ model astrophysically unacceptable if it should apply
back to the recombination time, but does not "rule out" a general L--T model --
it only puts limits on $\dril {t_B} r$.
