The Hall conductivity $\sigma_{\rm xy}$ of a two-dimensional electron system
is quantized in units of $e^2/h$ when the Fermi level is located in the
mobility gap between two Landau levels. We consider the deviation of
$\sigma_{\rm xy}$ from a quantized value caused by the thermal activation of
electrons to the extended states for the case of a long range random potential.
This deviation is of the form $\sigma_{\rm xy}^*\exp(-\Delta/T)$. The prefactor
$\sigma_{\rm xy}^*$ is equal to $e^2/h$ at temperatures above a characteristic
temperature $T_2$. With the temperature decreasing below $T_2$, $\sigma_{\rm
xy}^*$ decays according to a power law: $\sigma_{\rm xy}^* =
\frac{e^2}{h}(T/T_2)^\gamma$. Similar results are valid for a fractional Hall
plateau near filling factor $p/q$ if $e$ is replaced by the fractional charge
$e/q$.
