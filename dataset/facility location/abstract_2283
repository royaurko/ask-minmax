A 20 arcmin \times 20 arcmin region around 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC) is observed and analyzed in the near-infrared. We obtain
polarimetry data in the J, H, and K_s bands using the SIRIUS polarimeter SIRPOL
at the Infrared Survey Facility 1.4 m telescope. We measure the Stokes
parameters of 2562 point-like sources to derive the degree of polarization and
the polarization position angles. We discuss the statistics of the groups
classified by color-magnitude diagram and proper motions of the sources, in
order to separate the Galactic foreground sources from those present in the
LMC. We notice that groups classified by the proper motion data show a tendency
towards different polarimetric properties.
