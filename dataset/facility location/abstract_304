The recent discovery that neutrinos have mass opens a wide new field of
experimentation. Accelerator-made neutrinos are essential. Ideas for future
facilities include superbeams beta-beams and neutrino factories, each
associated with one or several options for detector systems. A summary of the
perceived virtues and shortcomings of these options, and a number of open
questions, are presented.
