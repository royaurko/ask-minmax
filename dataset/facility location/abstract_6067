We propose a method to study lattice QCD at non-vanishing temperature (T) and
chemical potential (\mu). We use n_f=2+1 dynamical staggered quarks with
semi-realistic masses on L_t=4 lattices. The critical endpoint (E) of QCD on
the Re(\mu)-T plane is located. We calculate the pressure (p), the energy
density (\epsilon) and the baryon density (n_B) of QCD at non-vanishing T and
\mu.
