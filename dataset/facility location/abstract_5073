The LHCb experiment is set for a significant upgrade, which will be ready for
Run 3 of the LHC in 2020. This upgrade will allow LHCb to run at a
significantly higher instantaneous luminosity and collect an integrated
luminosity of $50\,\text{fb}^{-1}$ by the end of Run 4. In this process the
Vertex locator (VELO) detector will be upgraded to a pixel-based silicon
detector. The upgraded VELO will improve upon the current detector by being
closer to the beam and having lower material modules with microchannel cooling
and a thinner RF-foil. Simulations have shown that it will maintain its
excellent performance, even after the radiation damage caused by collecting an
integrated luminosity of $50\,\text{fb}^{-1}$.
