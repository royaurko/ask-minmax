We report results showing that thermally-induced openings of double stranded
DNA coincide with the location of functionally relevant sites for
transcription. Investigating both viral and bacterial DNA gene promoter
segments, we found that the most probable opening occurs at the transcription
start site. Minor openings appear to be related to other regulatory sites. Our
results suggest that coherent thermal fluctuations play an important role in
the initiation of transcription. Essential elements of the dynamics, in
addition to sequence specificity, are nonlinearity and entropy, provided by
local base-pair constraints.
