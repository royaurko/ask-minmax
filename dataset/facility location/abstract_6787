We consider the escape of particles located in the middle well of a symmetric
triple well potential driven sinusoidally by two forces such that the potential
wells roll as in stochastic resonance and the height of the potential barrier
oscillates symmetrically about a mean as in resonant activation. It has been
shown that depending on their phase difference the application of these two
synchronized signals may lead to a splitting of time averaged Kramers' escape
rate and a preferential product distribution in a parallel chemical reaction in
the steady state.
