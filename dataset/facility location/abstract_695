We propose to design data structures called succinct geometric indexes of
negligible space (more precisely, o(n) bits) that, by taking advantage of the n
points in the data set permuted and stored elsewhere as a sequence, to support
geometric queries in optimal time. Our first and main result is a succinct
geometric index that can answer point location queries, a fundamental problem
in computational geometry, on planar triangulations in O(lg n) time. We also
design three variants of this index. The first supports point location using
$\lg n + 2\sqrt{\lg n} + O(\lg^{1/4} n)$ point-line comparisons. The second
supports point location in o(lg n) time when the coordinates are integers
bounded by U. The last variant can answer point location in O(H+1) expected
time, where H is the entropy of the query distribution. These results match the
query efficiency of previous point location structures that use O(n) words or
O(n lg n) bits, while saving drastic amounts of space.
  We then generalize our succinct geometric index to planar subdivisions, and
design indexes for other types of queries. Finally, we apply our techniques to
design the first implicit data structures that support point location in
$O(\lg^2 n)$ time.
