Spectral correlations in the optical phonon spectrum of a solid with a
complex unit cell are analysed using the Wigner-Dyson statistical approach.
Despite the fact that all force constants are real, we find that the statistics
are predominantly of the GUE type depending on the location within the
Brillouin zone of a crystal and the unit cell symmetry. Analytic and numerical
results for the crossover from GOE to GUE statistics are presented.
