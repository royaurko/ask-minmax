We study the phase diagram of the SU(2) lattice gauge theory with
fundamental-adjoint Wilson plaquette action. We confirm the presence of a first
order bulk phase transition and we estimate the location of its end-point in
the bare parameter space. If this point is second order, the theory is one of
the simplest realizations of a lattice gauge theory admitting a continuum limit
at finite bare couplings. All the relevant gauge observables are monitored in
the vicinity of the fixed point with very good control over finite-size
effects. The scaling properties of the low-lying glueball spectrum are studied
while approaching the end-point in a controlled manner.
