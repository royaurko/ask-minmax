We investigate the location of the radio jet bases ("radio cores") of blazars
in radio images, and their stationarity by means of dense very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) observations. In order to measure the position of a radio
core, we conducted 12 epoch astrometric observation of the blazar Markarian 421
with the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry at 22 GHz immediately after a
large X-ray flare, which occurred in the middle of 2011 September. For the
first time, we find that the radio core is not stationary but rather changes
its location toward 0.5 mas downstream. This angular scale corresponds to the
de-projected length of a scale of $10^5$ Schwarzschild radii (Rs) at the
distance of Markarian~421. This radio-core wandering may be a new type of
manifestation associated with the phenomena of large X-ray flares.
