We present new spectroscopic data in the field of five high-redshift (z>=0.6)
candidate galaxy clusters, drawn from the EIS Cluster Candidate Catalog. A
total of 327 spectra were obtained using FORS1 at the VLT, out of which 266 are
galaxies with secure redshifts. In this paper, we use these data for confirming
the existence of overdensities in redshift space at the approximate same
location as the matched-filter detections in the projected distribution of
galaxies from the EIS I-band imaging survey. The spectroscopic redshifts,
associated to these overdensities, are consistent but, in general, somewhat
lower than those predicted by the matched-filter technique. Combining the
systems presented here with those analyzed earlier, we have spectroscopically
confirmed a total of nine overdensities in the redshift range 0.6<z<1.3,
providing an important first step in building an optically-selected,
high-redshift sample for more detailed studies, complementing those based on
the few available X-ray selected systems.
