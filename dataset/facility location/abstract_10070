Three variational vector equations are derived for the extended
particle-field object located on the light cone. Point sources are excluded
from the pure field equations and all physical magnitudes are free from
divergences. Accepting 3D intersections of 4D cone-charges, vector
electrogravity explains all observed phenomena under common flat 3D and 1D
intervals. External cone-charges contribute to pseudo-Riemannian metrics of
proper four-spaces of charged objects, resulting in dilation-compression of
their proper time rates. Photon-type gravitational radiation is not associated
with metric modulation of flat, laboratory space. The Minkowski-Lorentz
equation for free charges corresponds to the equivalence principle for the
canonical four-space. The predicted criterion of double unification, particles
with fields - gravity with electrodynamics, is confirmed in vector
electrogravity.
