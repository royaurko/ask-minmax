The RCT 1.3-meter telescope, formerly known as the Kitt Peak National
Observatory (KPNO) 50-inch telescope, has been refurbished as a fully robotic
telescope, using an autonomous scheduler to take full advantage of the
observing site without the requirement of a human presence. Here we detail the
current configuration of the RCT, and present as a demonstration of its
high-priority science goals, the broadband {\it UBVRI} photometric calibration
of the optical facility. In summary, we find the linear color transformation
and extinction corrections to be consistent with similar optical KPNO
facilities, to within a photometric precision of 10% (at $1\sigma$). While
there were identified instrumental errors likely adding to the overall
uncertainty, associated with since-resolved issues in engineering and
maintenance of the robotic facility, a preliminary verification of this
calibration gave good indication that the solution is robust, perhaps to a
higher precision than this initial calibration implies. The RCT has been
executing regular science operations since 2009, and is largely meeting the
science requirements set in its acquisition and re-design.
