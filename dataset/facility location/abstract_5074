When assessing the hazard brought by storm surges on the coast, a frequency
analysis is often conducted. An issue of particular concern is the sea level
rise (SLR), thought to have an impact on maximum water levels. In this study,
three gauge stations with long records dating back to the 19th century and
located along the Polish Baltic Sea coast were analyzed. Different theoretical
distributions were tested in order to find the best-fitting one. Gumbel
distribution was chosen and estimated for 40-year moving periods. The location
parameter soared in all tide gauges, but the shape parameter was stable in
Gdansk and decreased in the other two. In effect, theoretical annual maximum
water levels followed the SLR in Gdansk, whereas most extreme storm surges had
no trend in Swinoujscie and a negative one in Kolobrzeg. A possible explanation
for this was investigated (change in atmospheric circulation measured by NAO
index).
