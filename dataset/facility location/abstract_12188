Most methods of orbit determination are often difficult for numerical
implementations since they are developed before the computer era. The recently
developed mathematical technique of semi-definite programming (SDP) has been
implemented for many problems in scientific fields including astrometry. This
is a good opportunity to resolve orbits of binary systems located in the
southern hemisphere since more than seventy years Bosscha Observatory had been
continuously conducting observations of binary systems. Here we describe
prospects of application of SDP for deriving orbital parameters of binary
systems using data supplied by Bosscha Observatory that has been published in
the Centre de Donnees astronomiques de Strasbourg. This study will support
observers at Bosscha Observatory to appropriately select target stars belong to
binary systems for their ongoing researches. Since SDP is a powerful scheme,
free trial-and-error and human-independent judgment, we suggest that SDP may
become a standard method for determining orbital parameters of binary systems.
