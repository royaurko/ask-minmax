The separation between single particle levels in nuclei plays the dominant
role in determining the location of the neutron drip line. The separation also
provides a test of current crossed shell model interactions if the experimental
data is such that multiple shells are involved. The present work uses the
$^{14}$N(d, p)$^{15}$N reaction to extract the 2s$_{1/2}$, and 1d$_{5/2}$ total
neutron single particle strengths and then compares these results with a shell
model calculation using a p-sd crossed shell interaction to identify the
J$^\pi$ of all levels in $^{15}$N up to 12.8 MeV in excitation.
