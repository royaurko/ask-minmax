The circular photon asymmetry for pi0 eta photoproduction on the proton was
measured for the first time at the tagged photon facility of the MAMI C
accelerator using the Crystal Ball/TAPS photon spectrometer. The experimental
results are interpreted within a phenomenological isobar model that confirms
the dominant role of the Delta(1700)D33 resonance. The measured asymmetry
allows us to identify small contributions from positive-parity resonances via
interference terms with the dominant D33 amplitude.
