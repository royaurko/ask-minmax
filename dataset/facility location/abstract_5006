The information collected by mobile phone operators can be considered as the
most detailed information on human mobility across a large part of the
population. The study of the dynamics of human mobility using the collected
geolocations of users, and applying it to predict future users' locations, has
been an active field of research in recent years. In this work, we study the
extent to which social phenomena are reflected in mobile phone data, focusing
in particular in the cases of urban commute and major sports events. We
illustrate how these events are reflected in the data, and show how information
about the events can be used to improve predictability in a simple model for a
mobile phone user's location.
