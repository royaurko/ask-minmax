Using the standard formulation of algebraic random walks (ARWs) via
coalgebras, we consider ARWs for co-and Hopf-algebraic structures in the ring
of symmetric functions. These derive from different types of products by
dualisation, giving the dual pairs of outer multiplication and outer coproduct,
inner multiplication and inner coproduct, and symmetric function plethysm and
plethystic coproduct. Adopting standard coordinates for a class of measures
(and corresponding distribution functions) to guarantee positivity and correct
normalisation, we show the effect of appropriate walker steps of the outer,
inner and plethystic ARWs. If the coordinates are interpreted as heights or
occupancies of walker(s) at different locations, these walks introduce
translations, dilations (scalings) and inflations of the height coordinates,
respectively.
