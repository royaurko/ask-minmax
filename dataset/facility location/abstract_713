The Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) is one of the three instruments on board the
Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) to be launched in December 2001. The
IRS will provide high resolution spectra (R = 600) from 10-37 microns and low
resolution spectra (R >= 60) from 5-40microns. Its high sensitivity and
``spectral mapping''-mode make it a powerful instrument for observing both
faint point-like and extended sources. We discuss the performance of the IRS on
faint extragalactic targets and present simulated spectra of starbursts and
AGNs at high redshift. In addition, we discuss the determination of redshifts
from the low resolution spectra.
