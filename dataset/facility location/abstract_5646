We present 0.1-10 keV observations of Her X-1 obtained with the Low-Energy
Spectrometer Concentrator instrument onboard the BeppoSAX satellite during the
main on-state of the 35 day cycle. We confirm the existence of an intense 0.093
keV blackbody component and a broad emission feature at 0.94 keV. The pulse
phase dependence of these components is similar, suggesting a common origin.
This is most likely fluorescent excitation of moderately ionized
($\xi\sim$10--100) material located at the inner edge of the accretion disk.
