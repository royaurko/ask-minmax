This work investigates the possible supernova kick velocities imposed on HMXB
systems in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Comparisons are made between the
location of such systems and the locations of young, stellar clusters on the
premise that these may represent the birthplace of many of these systems.
Measurements of the separation of clusters and HMXBs,and an estimate of the
typical lifetimes of these systems, leads to a minimum average space velocity
30 km/s. This value is compared to theoretical estimates.
