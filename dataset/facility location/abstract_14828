We compare two techniques for following the cooling of gas and its
condensation into galaxies within high resolution simulations of cosmologically
representative regions. Both techniques treat the dark matter using N-body
methods. One follows the gas using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) while
the other uses simplified recipes from semi-analytic (SA) models. We compare
the masses and locations predicted for dense knots of cold gas (the `galaxies')
when the two techniques are applied to evolution from the same initial
conditions and when the additional complications of star formation and feedback
are ignored. We find that above the effective resolution limit of the two
techniques, they give very similar results both for global quantities such as
the total amount of cooled gas and for the properties of individual `galaxies'.
The SA technique has systematic uncertainties arising from the simplified
cooling model adopted, while details of the SPH implementation can produce
substantial systematic variations in the galaxy masses it predicts.
Nevertheless, for the best current SPH methods and the standard assumptions of
the SA model, systematic differences between the two techniques are remarkably
small. The SA technique gives adequate predictions for the condensation of gas
into `galaxies' at less than one percent of the computational cost of obtaining
similar results at comparable resolution using SPH.
