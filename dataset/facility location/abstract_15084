We present a numerical approach to investigate the relationship between
magnetic fields and Faraday rotation effects in clusters of galaxies. We can
infer the structure and strength of intra-cluster magnetic fields by comparing
our simulations with the observed polarization properties of extended cluster
radio sources such as radio galaxies and halos. We find the observations
require a magnetic field which fluctuates over a wide range of spatial scales
(at least one order of magnitude). If several polarized radio sources are
located at different projected positions in a galaxy cluster, as is the case
for A119, detailed Faraday rotation images allow us to constrain both the
magnetic field strength and the slope of the power spectrum. Our results show
that the standard analytic expressions applied in the literature overestimate
the cluster magnetic field strengths by a factor of about 2. We investigate the
possible effects of our models on beam depolarization of radio sources whose
radiation traverses the magnetized intracluster medium. Finally, we point out
that radio halos may provide important information about the spatial power
spectrum of the magnetic field fluctuations on large scales. In particular,
different values of the index of the power spectrum produce very different
total intensity and polarization brightness distributions.
