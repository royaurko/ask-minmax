We confirm the discovery of a light echo around the Type II-plateau Supernova
2003gd in Messier 74 (NGC 628), seen in images obtained with the High
Resolution Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys on-board the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST), as part of a larger Snapshot program on the late-time emission
from supernovae. The analysis of the echo we present suggests that it is due to
the SN light pulse scattered by a sheet of dust grains located about 113 pc in
front of the SN, and that these grains are not unlike those assumed to be in
the diffuse Galactic interstellar medium, both in composition and in size
distribution. The echo is less consistent with scattering off carbon-rich
grains, and, if anything, the grains may be somewhat more silicate-rich than
the Galactic dust composition. The echo also appears to be more consistent with
a SN distance closer to 7 Mpc than 9 Mpc. This further supports the conclusion
we reached elsewhere that the initial mass for the SN progenitor was relatively
low (about 8--9 M_suns). HST should be used to continue to monitor the echo in
several bands, particularly in the blue, to better constrain its origin.
