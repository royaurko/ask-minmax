The cryogenic system for the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is designed by
Jefferson Laboratory (JLab) personnel and is based on the existing JLab
facility. Our task is to use the JLab control system design [2] as much as
practical while remaining consistent with SNS control system standards. Some
aspects of the systems are very similar, including equipment to be controlled,
the need for PID loops and automatic sequences, and the use of EPICS. There are
differences in device naming, system hardware, and software tools. The
cryogenic system is the first SNS system to be developed using SNS standards.
This paper reports on our experiences in integrating the new and the old.
