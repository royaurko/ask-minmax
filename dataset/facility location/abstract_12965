We investigate, both analytically and numerically, the phase diagram of
three-dimensional Z(N) lattice gauge theories at finite temperature for N > 4.
These models, in the strong coupling limit, are equivalent to a generalized
version of vector Potts models in two dimension, with Polyakov loops playing
the role of Z(N) spins. It is argued that the effective spin models have two
phase transitions of infinite order (i.e. BKT). Using a cluster algorithm we
confirm this conjecture, locate the position of the critical points and extract
various critical indices.
