The polarization properties of a magnetophotonic crystal at the frequencies
located in the vicinity of ferromagnetic resonance are studied. The
investigations are curried out taking into consideration the fact that the
magnitude of material losses in ferrite layers at this frequency band is
significant. The method is based on obtaining a system of ordinary differential
equations and further analyzing the stability of solutions of this system. The
electromagnetic properties of the structure under study are found out via the
analysis of the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix of the structure period. On
this basis the boundaries of the stopbands and passbands of the eigenwaves are
determined. The frequency and angular dependences of the reflection and
transmission coefficients are given. The angle of the rotation of the
polarization plane and the ellipticity of the reflected and transmitted fields
are obtained.
