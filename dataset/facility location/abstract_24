In the future several Spallation Source facilities will be available
worldwide. Spallation Sources produce large amount of neutrinos from
decay-at-rest muons and thus can be well adapted to accommodate
state-of-the-art neutrino experiments. In this paper low energy neutrino
scattering experiments that can be performed at such facilities are reviewed.
Estimation of expected event rates are given for several nuclei, electrons and
protons at a detector located close to the source. A neutrino program at
Spallation Sources comprises neutrino-nucleus cross section measurements
relevant for neutrino and core-collapse supernova physics, electroweak tests
and lepton-flavor violation searches.
