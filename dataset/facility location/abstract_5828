The dynamic phase diagram of vortex lattices driven in disorder is calculated
in two and three dimensions. A modified Lindemann criterion for the
fluctuations of the distance of neighboring vortices is used, which unifies
previous analytic approaches to the equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase
transitions. The temperature shifts of the dynamic melting and decoupling
transitions are found to scale inversely proportional to large driving
currents. A comparison with two-dimensional simulations shows that this
phenomenological approach can provide quantitative estimate for the location of
these transitions.
