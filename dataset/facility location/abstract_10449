The Henon-Heiles system in the general form has been considered. In a
nonintegrable case with the help of the Painleve test new solutions have been
found as formal Laurent or Puiseux series, depending on three parameters. One
of parameters determines a location of the singularity point, other parameters
determine coefficients of series. It has been proved, that if absolute values
of these two parameters are less or equal to unit, then obtained series
converge in some ring. For some values of these parameters the obtained Laurent
series coincide with the Laurent series of the known exact solutions.
