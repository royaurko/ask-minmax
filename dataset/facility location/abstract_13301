An XMM-Newton observation of the luminous Seyfert galaxy PG1211+143 in 2001
revealed the first clear evidence for a highly ionised high speed wind (in a
non-BAL AGN), with a velocity of v~0.09c based on the identification of
blue-shifted absorption lines in both EPIC and RGS spectra. A subsequent
analysis of EPIC spectra, including additional absorption lines, led to an
upward revision of the wind speed to ~0.14c, while broad band modelling
indicated the need for a second, partial covering absorber to account for
continuum curvature and spectral variability. We show here, in a new analysis
of the XMM-Newton RGS data, that this additional absorber is detected in the
soft X-ray spectra, with the higher spectral resolution providing a much
improved velocity constraint, with v~0.07c. Similar variability of the 0.07c
and 0.14c outflow components suggest they are physically linked, and we
speculate that occurs by the fast (primary) wind impacting on small clumps of
higher density, slow moving matter close to the disc. We show that strong,
velocity broadened soft X-ray emission features, located at the redshift of
PG1211+143, indicate the extended scale of the ionised outflow.
