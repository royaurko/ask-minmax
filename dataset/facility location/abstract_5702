We present the preliminary results of a 40.8 ks Chandra ACIS observation of
the young supernova remnant (SNR) N103B located in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
The image reveals structure at the sub-arcsecond level, including several
bright knots and filamentary structures. The remnant has the characteristic
spectrum of a Type Ia SNR, containing strong lines of Fe, He-and H-like Si and
S, Ar, and Ca. Narrow band images reveal non-uniformities in the remnant.
