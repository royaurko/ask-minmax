The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is a proposed next generation radio
telescope. Between now and 2005 this project is in a technology development and
prototyping phase, with construction likely to begin in $\sim 2010$. This paper
describes what the SKA may be like, its key features, the motivation for
building it and where you can access more details about it. Its is important to
see any new facility in context, so other new facilities are also discussed.
Avenues for future extensibility of the SKA other telescopes are covered, with
some emphasis on multiple beam systems. Some suggestions for useful pulsar
experiments and pulsar searches strategies are summarised. A conclusion is that
the SKA may not be the most cost effective way to search for pulsars and that a
128 beam receiver system on an Arecibo like telescope working between 1 and 5
GHz may be a more cost effective approach.
