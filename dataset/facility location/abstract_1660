We evaluate regions of parameter space in the minimal supergravity model
where ``unbounded from below'' (UFB) or charge or color breaking minima (CCB)
occur. Our analysis includes the most important terms from the 1-loop effective
potential. We note a peculiar discontinuity of results depending on how
renormalization group improvement is performed: One case leads to a UFB
potential throughout the model parameter space, while the other typically
agrees quite well with similar calculations performed using only the tree level
potential. We compare our results with constraints from cosmology and
naturalness and find a preferred region of parameter space which implies
$m_{\tg}\alt 725$ GeV, $m_{\tq}\alt 650$ GeV, $m_{\tw_1}\alt 225$ GeV and
$m_{\tell_R}\alt 220$ GeV. We discuss the consequences of our results for
supersymmetry searches at various colliding beam facilities.
