The ANTARES neutrino telescope is currently the largest operating water
Cherenkov detector and the largest neutrino detector in the Northern
Hemisphere. Its main scientific target is the detection of high-energy (TeV and
beyond) neutrinos from cosmic accelerators, as predicted by hadronic
interaction models, and the measurement of the diffuse neutrino flux. Its
location allows for surveying a large part of the Galactic Plane, including the
Galactic Centre. In addition to the standalone searches for point-like and
diffuse high-energy neutrino signals, ANTARES has developed a range of
multi-messenger strategies to exploit the close connection between neutrinos
and other cosmic messengers such as gamma-rays, charged cosmic rays and
gravitational waves. This contribution provides an overview of the recently
conducted analyses, including a search for neutrinos from the Fermi bubbles
region, searches for optical counterparts with the TAToO program, and searches
for neutrinos in correlation with gamma-ray bursts, blazars, and microquasars.
Further topics of investigation, covering e.g. the search for neutrinos from
dark matter annihilation, searches for exotic particles and the measurement of
neutrino oscillations, are also reviewed.
