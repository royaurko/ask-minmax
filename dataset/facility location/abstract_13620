We propose a computationally efficient statistical method to obtain
distributional properties of annual maximum 24 hour precipitation on a 1 km by
1 km regular grid over Iceland. A latent Gaussian model is built which takes
into account observations, spatial variations and outputs from a local
meteorological model. A covariate based on the meteorological model is
constructed at each observational site and each grid point in order to
assimilate available scientific knowledge about precipitation into the
statistical model. The model is applied to two data sets on extreme
precipitation, one uncorrected data set and one data set that is corrected for
phase and wind. The observations are assumed to follow the generalized extreme
value distribution. At the latent level, we implement SPDE spatial models for
both the location and scale parameters of the likelihood. An efficient MCMC
sampler which exploits the model structure is constructed, which yields fast
continuous spatial predictions for spatially varying model parameters and
quantiles.
