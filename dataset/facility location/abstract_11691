This paper considers the problem of detecting equal-shaped non-overlapping
unimodal peaks in the presence of Gaussian ergodic stationary noise, where the
number, location and heights of the peaks are unknown. A multiple testing
approach is proposed in which, after kernel smoothing, the presence of a peak
is tested at each observed local maximum. The procedure provides strong control
of the family wise error rate and the false discovery rate asymptotically as
both the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the search space get large, where the
search space may grow exponentially as a function of SNR. Simulations assuming
a Gaussian peak shape and a Gaussian autocorrelation function show that desired
error levels are achieved for relatively low SNR and are robust to partial peak
overlap. Simulations also show that detection power is maximized when the
smoothing bandwidth is close to the bandwidth of the signal peaks, akin to the
well-known matched filter theorem in signal processing. The procedure is
illustrated in an analysis of electrical recordings of neuronal cell activity.
