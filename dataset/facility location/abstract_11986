We present a multi-wavelength study of the radio source G296.7-0.9. This
source has a bilateral radio morphology, a radio spectral index of -0.5 +/-
0.1, sparse patches of linear polarisation, and thermal X-rays with a bright
arc near the radio boundary. Considering these characteristics, we conclude
that G296.7-0.9 is a supernova remnant (SNR). The age and morphology of the SNR
in the context of its environment suggest that the source is co-located with an
HII region, and that portions of the shock front have broken out into a lower
density medium. We see no evidence for a neutron star or pulsar wind nebula
associated with SNR G296.7-0.9.
