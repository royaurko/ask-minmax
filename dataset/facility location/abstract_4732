Recent advances in observational performance and numerical simulations have
revolutionised our understanding of the solar chromosphere. This concerns in
particular the structure and dynamics on small spatial and temporal scales. As
a result, the picture of the solar chromosphere changed from an idealised
static and plane-parallel stratification to a complex compound of intermittent
domains, which are dynamically coupled to the layers below and above. In this
picture, the chromosphere in a stricter sense is associated with the typical
fibrillar structure shaped by magnetic fields like it is known from images
taken in the H alpha line core. In internetwork regions below this layer, there
exists a domain with propagating shock waves and weak magnetic fields, which
both probably interact with the overlying large scale field. The existence of
such a sub-canopy domain certainly depends on the properties of the overlying
field. Details of the structure of the lower atmosphere can therefore be
expected to vary significantly from location to location. Here, high-resolution
observations, which were obtained with the CRISP filter at the Swedish Solar
Telescope, are used to derive qualitative constraints for the atmospheric
structure of quiet Sun regions.
