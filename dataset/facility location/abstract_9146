INTEGRAL made 3 observations in 2003 April of the black hole candidate H
1743-322 during the rising part, and close to the maximum, of an outburst. H
1743-322 was previously observed in outburst in 1977-1978. The source is
located in a crowded region of the sky (l = 357 deg, b = -2 deg) and at least
18 sources are clearly detected in the field of view of the gamma-ray imager
during a 277 ksec exposure. These are well known persistent X-ray binaries and
3 transient sources in outburst. The combined 5-200 keV JEM-X and SPI spectrum
of H 1743-322 is well fit with an absorbed ((2.5 10E22 atom/cm2) soft (photon
index 2.70 +/- 0.09) power-law model consistent with J 1743-322 being in a
high/soft state.
