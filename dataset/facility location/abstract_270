Turkish Accelerator Center) project is aimed to build an accelerator center
in Turkey. The first step of the project is to construct IR-FEL facility. The
second stage is to build a synchrotron radiation facility named TURKAY, which
is the third generation synchrotron radiation light source that aimed to
achieve high brilliance photon beam from low emittance electron beam at 3 GeV.
The electron beam parameters highly depend on the magnetic lattice of the
storage ring. In this paper a low emittance storage ring for TURKAY is proposed
and beam dynamic properties of the magnetic lattice are investigated.
