We describe a direct method for monitoring the geometrical dimensions of a
synchrotron beam at the target position for internal target installations. The
method allows for the observation of the proton beam size as well as the
position of the beam relative to the target. As a first demonstration of the
technique, we present results obtained by means of the COSY-11 detection system
installed at the cooler synchrotron COSY. The influence of the stochastic
cooling on the COSY proton beam dimensions is also investigated.
