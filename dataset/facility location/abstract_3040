Genomic expression depends critically both on the ability of regulatory
proteins to locate specific target sites on a DNA within seconds and on the
formation of long lived (many minutes) complexes between these proteins and the
DNA. Equilibrium experiments show that indeed regulatory proteins bind tightly
to their target site. However, they also find strong binding to other
non-specific sites which act as traps that can dramatically increase the time
needed to locate the target. This gives rise to a conflict between the speed
and stability requirements. Here we suggest a simple mechanism which can
resolve this long-standing paradox by allowing the target sites to be located
by proteins within short time scales even in the presence of traps. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the mechanism is robust in the presence of
generic disorder in the DNA sequence and does not require a specially designed
target site.
