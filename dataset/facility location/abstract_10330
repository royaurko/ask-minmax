Non-commutative gauge theory on fuzzy sphere was obtained by Alekseev et al.
as describing the low energy dynamics of a spherical D2-brane in S^3 with the
background b-field. We identify a subset of solutions of this theory which are
analogs of ``unstable'' solitons on a non-commutative flat D2-brane found by
Gopakumar et al. Analogously to the flat case, these solutions have the
interpretation as describing D0-branes ``not yet dissolved'' by the D2-brane.
We confirm this interpretation by showing the precise agreement of the binding
energy computed in the non-commutative and ordinary Born-Infeld descriptions.
We then study stability of the solution describing a single D0-brane off a
D2-brane. Similarly to the flat case, we find an instability when the D0-brane
is located close to the D2-brane. We furthermore obtain the complete mass
spectrum of 0-2 fluctuations, which thus gives a prediction for the low energy
spectrum of the 0-2 CFT in S^3. We also discuss in detail how the instability
to a formation of the fuzzy sphere modifies the usual Higgs mechanism for small
separation between the branes.
