The main goal of the FIRST-APM QSO Survey (FAQS) survey is to compile the
most complete sample of Bright QSOs, located in the area covered by the Second
Byurakan Survey (SBS). Here we report the first results of an ongoing study
based on the cross-identification of the FIRST radio catalog and the APM
optical catalog. The overlapping sky area between FIRST and SBS is about 700
deg$^{2}$. The compiled list of sources for this overlapping region contains
$\sim 400$ quasar candidates brighter than $B=18\fm5$. About 90 objects were
already spectroscopically classified. During 1999-2000, we observed
spectroscopically more than 150 FAQS objects with the 2.1m telescope of the
Guillermo Haro Observatory (GHO).We have found 51 new QSOs (4 BAL QSOs), 13
Seyfert Galaxies (5 NLSy1's), 23 emission line galaxies, 3 BL Lac objects and
57 stars.
