We numerically study the dependence of the dynamics on the range of
interaction $\Delta$ for the short-range square well potential. We find that,
for small $\Delta$, dynamics scale exactly in the same way as thermodynamics,
both for Newtonian and Brownian microscopic dynamics. For interaction ranges
from a few percent down to the Baxter limit, the relative location of the
attractive glass line and the liquid-gas line does not depend on $\Delta$. This
proves that in this class of potentials, disordered arrested states (gels) can
be generated only as a result of a kinetically arrested phase separation.
