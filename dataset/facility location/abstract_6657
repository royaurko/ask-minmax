It is shown that in a magnetic field quantized vortices in a superfluid
obtain a real quantized electric charge concentrated in the vortex core. This
charge is compensated by an opposite surface charge located at a macroscopic
distance from the vortex axis. It is determined that the polarization caused by
the vortex velocity field does not give rise to electric fields outside an
infinite cylinder. Observation of electric fields created by the vortices is
possible only near the end surfaces of the cylinder which must be closed with
dielectric covers to prevent superfluid leaking. Influence of cover properties
on the potential created by the vortex is researched. Potential created by the
vortices on point and ring electrodes are calculated.
