Recently Neiner et al. reported that the B2 IV-V star zeta Cas contains a
weak magnetic field which varies on the same 5.37 day period found from the
modulations of its N V, C IV, and Si IV UV resonance lines. We have studied the
time variable properties of the same resonance lines in greater detail to
determine the physical characteristics of the magnetospheric structure
responsible for them. In our formulation this structure takes the form of an
axisymmetric "disk" similarto those around magnetic He-strong Bp stars. This
structure corotates with the star, covering greater or lesser amounts of its
area during its transit. zeta Cas offers a special case because we observe it
from a low inclination and yet its magnetic axis is substantially inclined to
the rotation axis. The equivalent width-phase curves show a flat maximum for
half the cycle, indicating that the disk is extended out of the plane, extends
to the star's surface in the magnetic plane, or both. Synthetic spectra of the
line profiles during the maximum and minimum occultation phases can be best
reconciled with a disk geometry in which the resonance lines are formed at a
closed outer edge and along a thin outer layer. We speculate that observed weak
redshifted emission is formed in "auroral caps" located near the magnetic poles
of the star. We argue that this results from shocks of stagnated wind material
returning to the star and shocking against the outflowing wind.
