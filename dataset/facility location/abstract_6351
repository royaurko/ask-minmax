The purpose of this work is to survey what is known about the linear
independence of spikes and sines. The paper provides new results for the case
where the locations of the spikes and the frequencies of the sines are chosen
at random. This problem is equivalent to studying the spectral norm of a random
submatrix drawn from the discrete Fourier transform matrix. The proof involves
depends on an extrapolation argument of Bourgain and Tzafriri.
