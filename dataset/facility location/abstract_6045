We have found a simple criterion which allows for the straightforward
determination of the order-disorder critical temperatures. The method
reproduces exactly results known for the two dimensional Ising, Potts and
$Z(N<5)$ models. It also works for the Ising model on the triangular lattice.
For systems which are not selfdual our proposition remains an unproven
conjecture. It predicts $\beta_c=0.2656...$ for the two coupled layers of Ising
spins. Critical temperature of the three dimensional Ising model is related to
the free energy of the two layer Ising system.
