We present a method to determine the impurity Greens function of the
interacting resonant level model (IRLM) using numerical simulation techniques
based on the expansion of a resolvent expression in terms of Chebyshev
polynomials. The iterative determination of the contributions to the expansion
is based on a Density Matrix Renormalisation Group algorithm. The spectral
function has lorentzian shape, where we can show that the width grows
monotonically with the interaction on the contact link. Moreover, for values of
the interaction compareable to the band width, there are additional peaks
showing up for energies located outside the conduction band.
