For a function g(w) analytic and univalent in {w:1<|w|<\infty} with a simple
pole at \infty and a continuous extension to {w:|w|\geq 1}, we consider the
Faber polynomials F_n(z), n=0,1,2,..., associated to g(w) via their generating
function g'(w)/(g(w)-z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty F_n(z)w^{-(n+1)}. Assuming that g(w)
maps the unit circle T onto a piecewise analytic curve L whose exterior domain
has no outward-pointing cusps, and under an additional assumption concerning
the "Lehman expansion" of g(w) about those points of T mapped onto corners of
L, we obtain asymptotic formulas for F_n(z) that yield fine results on the
location, limiting distribution and accumulation points of the zeros of the
Faber polynomials. The asymptotic formulas are shown to hold uniformly and the
exact rate of decay of the error terms involved is provided.
