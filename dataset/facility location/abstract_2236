We report a solution-processed, ligand supported synthesis of 15-20 nm thick
Sb(2-x)Bi(x)Te3 nanoplatelets. After complete ligand removal by a facile
NH3-based etching procedure, the platelets are spark plasma sintered to a
p-type nanostructured bulk material with preserved crystal grain sizes. Due to
this nanostructure, the total thermal conductivity is reduced by 60 % in
combination with a reduction in electric conductivity of as low as 20 % as
compared to the bulk material demonstrating the feasibility of the phonon-glass
electron-crystal concept. An enhancement in the dimensionless thermoelectric
figure of merit of up to 15 % over state-of-the-art bulk materials is achieved
meanwhile shifting the maximum to significantly higher temperatures.
