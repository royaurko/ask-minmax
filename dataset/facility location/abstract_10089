With appropriately chosen parameters, the C-metric represents two uniformly
accelerated black holes moving in the opposite directions on the axis of the
axial symmetry (the z-axis). The acceleration is caused by nodal singularities
located on the z-axis.
  In the~present paper, geodesics in the~C-metric are examined. In general
there exist three types of timelike or null geodesics in the C-metric:
geodesics describing particles 1) falling under the black hole horizon;
2)crossing the acceleration horizon; and 3) orbiting around the z-axis and
co-accelerating with the black holes.
  Using an effective potential, it can be shown that there exist stable
timelike geodesics of the third type if the product of the parameters of the
C-metric, mA, is smaller than a certain critical value. Null geodesics of the
third type are always unstable. Special timelike and null geodesics of the
third type are also found in an analytical form.
