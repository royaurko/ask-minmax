The National Ignition Facility (NIF) will contain the world's most powerful
laser. NIF requires more than 1500 precisely timed trigger pulses to control
the timing of laser and diagnostic equipment. The Integrated Timing System
applies new concepts to generate and deliver triggers at preprogrammed times to
equipment throughout the laser and target areas of the facility. Trigger pulses
during the last 2 seconds of a shot cycle are required to have a jitter of less
than 20 ps (rms) and a wander of less than 100 ps (max). Also, the Timing
System allows simultaneous, independent use by multiple clients by partitioning
the system hardware into subsets that are controlled via independent software
keys. The hardware necessary to implement the Integrated Timing System is
commercially available. -- This work is performed under the auspices of the
