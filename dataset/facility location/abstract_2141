It is possible to find the optimized radiation dose per session for a
radiotherapy (RT) treatment, using a population dynamics model. This has
already been done in a previous work for a protocol with 30 sessions and a
fixed dose per session. Extending this model to other protocols, with a
variable number of sessions, we could change the radiation dosage while keeping
the success probability of treatment at its maximum value. This could help the
RT oncology service managers to plan the sequence of patients and treatments
adapting it to the facilities of the oncology service. Besides, if tumor
surrounding tissue is not able to afford a high dosage, it could be useful to
extend the treatment to a higher number of low dose radiation sessions, keeping
an optimal treatment.
