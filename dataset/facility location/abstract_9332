Centrifugal pressure of matter spiralling onto black holes, have long been
known to produce standing or oscillating shocks. The post-shock disc puffs up
in the form of a torus, which intercepts soft photons from the outer Keplerian
disc and inverse Comptonizes them to produce hard photons. The post-shock
region also produces jets. We study the interaction of both hard photons and
soft photons, with rotating electron-positron jets. We show that hard photons
from the post-shock torus are instrumental in acceleration of jets, while soft
photons from the Keplerian disc is a better collimating agent. We also show
that if the jets are launched closer to the black hole, relativistic and
collimated jets are produced; if they are launched at larger distances both
collimation and acceleration are less. We also show that if the shock location
is relatively at larger distances from the black hole, collimation is better.
