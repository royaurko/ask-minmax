Recent observations give some clues that the lenses discovered by the
microlensing experiments in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds may be
located in these satellite galaxies. We re-examine the possibility that
self-lensing alone may account for the optical depth measured towards the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We present a self-consistent multi-component model of
the LMC consisting of distinct stellar populations, each associated to a
vertical velocity dispersion ranging from 10 to 60 km/s. The present work
focuses on showing that such dispersions comply with current 20 - 30 km/s
limits set by observation on specific LMC populations. We also show that this
model reproduces both the 1-2 10^-7 observed optical depth and the event
duration distribution.
