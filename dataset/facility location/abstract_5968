With a one-band envelope function theory, we investigate the dynamics of a
finite nanowire superlattice driven by an ac electric field by solving
numerically the time-dependent Schroedinger equation. We find that for an ac
electric field resonant with two energy levels located in two different
minibands, the coherent dynamics in nanowire superlattices is much more complex
as compared to the standard two-level description. Depending on the energy
levels involved in the transitions, the coherent oscillations exhibit different
patterns. A signature of barrier-well inversion phenomenon in nanowire
superlattices is also obtained.
