Nova Puppis 2000 (V445 Pup) has been proposed as the first example of a
helium nova. Recent optical spectroscopy of V445 Pup at V=19.91 mag obtained
with IMACS on the 6.5-m Magellan telescope, shows that the spectrum consists of
HeI, [OI], [OII] and [OIII] emission lines and no hydrogen is present. The
spectroscopy shows an expanding nova shell with blue- and redshifted velocity
components around +/- 850 km/s and +/- 1600 km/s. Images taken with Magellan
under very good seeing conditions (FWHM ~ 0.6") shows V445 Pup to be extended
(full width at zero intensity ~ 1.9") and elongated (position angle ~ 150deg).
We have followed the secular evolution of V445 Pup since the decline from
(optical) maximum, at near-infrared wavelengths (J, H and Ks) using the
Infrared Survey Facility (IRSF) at the Sutherland site of the South African
Astronomical Observatory. We find that V445 Pup is still covered by a dense
dust shell more than three years after its outburst.
