The disc formation mechanism of B[e] supergiants is one of the puzzling
phenomena in massive star evolution. Rapid stellar rotation seems to play an
important role for the non-spherically symmetric mass-loss leading to a
high-density disc or ring-like structure of neutral material around these
massive and luminous objects. The radial density and temperature structure as
well as the kinematics within this high-density material are, however, not well
studied. Based on high-resolution optical spectra of a sample of B[e]
supergiants in the Magellanic Clouds we especially searched for tracers of the
kinematics within their discs. Besides the well-known [O I] lines, we
discovered the [Ca II] {\lambda}{\lambda}7291, 7324 lines that can be used as a
complementary set of disc tracers. We find that these lines originate from very
high-density regions, located closer to the star than the [O I] {\lambda}5577
line-forming region. The line profiles of both the [O I] and the [Ca II] lines
indicate that the discs or rings of high-density material are in Keplerian
rotation. We estimate plausible ranges of disc inclination angles for the
sample of B[e] supergiants and suggest that the star LHA 120-S 22 might have a
spiral arm rather than a disc.
