A two-dimensional fluid of hard spheres each having a spin $\pm 1$ and
interacting via short-range Ising-like interaction is studied near the second
order phase transition from the paramagnetic gas to the ferromagnetic gas
phase. Monte Carlo simulation technique and the multiple histogram data
analysis were used. By measuring the finite-size behaviour of several different
thermodynamic quantities,we were able to locate the transition and estimate
values of various static critical exponents. The values of exponents
$\beta/\nu$ and $\gamma/\nu$ are close to the ones for the two-dimensional
lattice Ising model. However, our result for the exponent $\nu =1.35$ is very
different from the one for the Ising universality class.
