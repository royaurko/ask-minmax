We report the EXITE2 hard X-ray imaging of the sky around 3C273. A 2h
observation on May 8, 1997, shows a $\sim$260 mCrab source detected at
$\sim4\sigma$ in each of two bands (50-70 and 70-93 keV) and located $\sim$30'
from 3C273 and consistent in position with the SIGMA source GRS1227+025. The
EXITE2 spectrum is consistent with a power law with photon index 3 and large
low energy absorption, as indicated by the GRANAT/SIGMA results. No source was
detected in more sensitive followup EXITE2 observations in 2000 and 2001 with
3$\sigma$ upper limits of 190 and 65 mCrab, respectively. Comparison with the
flux detected by SIGMA shows the source to be highly variable, suggesting it
may be non-thermal and beamed and thus the first example of a ``type 2''
(absorbed) Blazar. Alternatively it might be (an unprecedented) very highly
absorbed binary system undergoing accretion disk instability outbursts,
possibly either a magnetic CV, or a black hole X-ray nova.
