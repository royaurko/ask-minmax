We investigate some basic properties of the {\it heart}
$\heartsuit(\mathcal{K})$ of a convex set $\mathcal{K}.$ It is a subset of
$\mathcal{K},$ whose definition is based on mirror reflections of euclidean
space, and is a non-local object. The main motivation of our interest for
$\heartsuit(\mathcal{K})$ is that this gives an estimate of the location of the
hot spot in a convex heat conductor with boundary temperature grounded at zero.
Here, we investigate on the relation between $\heartsuit(\mathcal{K})$ and the
mirror symmetries of $\mathcal{K};$ we show that $\heartsuit(\mathcal{K})$
contains many (geometrically and phisically) relevant points of $\mathcal{K};$
we prove a simple geometrical lower estimate for the diameter of
$\heartsuit(\mathcal{K});$ we also prove an upper estimate for the area of
$\heartsuit(\mathcal{K}),$ when $\mathcal{K}$ is a triangle.
