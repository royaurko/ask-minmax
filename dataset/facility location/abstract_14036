Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an emerging technique in the field of
biomedical imaging, with applications in ophthalmology, dermatology, coronary
imaging etc. OCT images usually suffer from a granular pattern, called speckle
noise, which restricts the process of interpretation. Therefore the need for
speckle noise reduction techniques is of high importance. To the best of our
knowledge, use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) techniques has never
been explored for speckle reduction of OCT images. Here, a comparative study of
several ICA techniques (InfoMax, JADE, FastICA and SOBI) is provided for noise
reduction of retinal OCT images. Having multiple B-scans of the same location,
the eye movements are compensated using a rigid registration technique. Then,
different ICA techniques are applied to the aggregated set of B-scans for
extracting the noise-free image. Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR),
Contrast-to-Noise-Ratio (CNR) and Equivalent-Number-of-Looks (ENL), as well as
analysis on the computational complexity of the methods, are considered as
metrics for comparison. The results show that use of ICA can be beneficial,
especially in case of having fewer number of B-scans.
