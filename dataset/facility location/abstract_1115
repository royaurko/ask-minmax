An implementation of both the ALICE code and TENDL evaluated nuclear data
library in order to describe nuclear reactions by low-energy projectiles in the
Monte Carlo code MARS15 is presented. Comparisons between results of modelling
and experimental data on reaction cross sections and secondary particle
distributions are shown as well.
