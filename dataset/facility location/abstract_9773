We evaluate, by means of variational calculations, the bound state energy E_B
of a pair of charges located on the surface of a cylinder, interacting via
Coulomb potential - e^2 / r . The trial wave function involves three
variational parameters. E_B is obtained as a function of the reduced curvature
C = a_0 / R, where a_0 is the Bohr radius and R is the radius of the cylinder.
We find that the energetics of binding exhibits a monotonic trend as a function
of C ; the known 1D and 2D limits of E_B are reproduced accurately by our
calculation. E_B is relatively insensitive to curvature for small C .
  Its value is ~ 1% higher at C = 1 than at C = 0. This weak dependence is
confirmed by a perturbation theory calculation. The high curvature regime
approximates the 1D Coulomb model; within our variational approach, E_B has a
logarithmic divergence as R approaches zero. The proposed variational method is
applied to the case of donors in single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs).
