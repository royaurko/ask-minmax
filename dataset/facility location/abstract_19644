We present HST/ACS observations of RR Lyrae variable stars in six ultra deep
fields of the Andromeda galaxy (M31), including parts of the halo, disk, and
giant stellar stream. Past work on the RR Lyrae stars in M31 has focused on
various aspects of the stellar populations that make up the galaxy's halo,
including their distances and metallicities. This study builds upon this
previous work by increasing the spatial coverage (something that has been
lacking in previous studies) and by searching for these variable stars in
constituents of the galaxy not yet explored. Besides the 55 RR Lyrae stars we
found in our initial field located 11kpc from the galactic nucleus, we find
additional RR Lyrae stars in four of the remaining five ultra deep fields as
follows: 21 in the disk, 24 in the giant stellar stream, 3 in the halo field
21kpc from the galactic nucleus, and 5 in one of the halo fields at 35kpc. No
RR Lyrae were found in the second halo field at 35kpc. The RR Lyrae populations
of these fields appear to mostly be of Oosterhoff I type, although the 11kpc
field appears to be intermediate or mixed. We will discuss the properties of
these stars including period and reddening distributions. We calculate
metallicities and distances for the stars in each of these fields using
different methods and compare the results, to an extent that has not yet been
done. We compare these methods not just on RR Lyrae stars in our M31 fields,
but also on a data set of Milky Way field RR Lyrae stars.
