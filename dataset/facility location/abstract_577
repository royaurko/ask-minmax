The status of relativistic nuclear many-body calculations of nuclear systems
to be built up in terms of protons and neutrons is reviewed. In detail,
relativistic effects on several aspects of nuclear matter such as the effective
mass, saturation mechanism, and the symmetry energy are considered. This review
will especially focus on isospin asymmetric issues, since these aspects are of
high interest in astrophysical and nuclear structure studies. Furthermore, from
the experimental side these aspects are experiencing an additional boost from a
new generation of radioactive beam facilities, e.g. the future GSI facility
FAIR in Germany or SPIRAL2 at GANIL/France. Finally, the prospects of studying
finite nuclei in microscopic calculations which are based on realistic $NN$
interactions by including relativistic effects in calculations of low momentum
interactions are discussed.
