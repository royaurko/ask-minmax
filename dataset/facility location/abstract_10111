We present an algorithm for treating mesh refinement interfaces in numerical
relativity. We detail the behavior of the solution near such interfaces located
in the strong field regions of dynamical black hole spacetimes, with particular
attention to the convergence properties of the simulations. In our applications
of this technique to the evolution of puncture initial data with vanishing
shift, we demonstrate that it is possible to simultaneously maintain second
order convergence near the puncture and extend the outer boundary beyond 100M,
thereby approaching the asymptotically flat region in which boundary condition
problems are less difficult and wave extraction is meaningful.
