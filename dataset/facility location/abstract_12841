We investigate the temporal and spectral correlations between flux and
anisotropy fluctuations of TeV-band cosmic rays in the light of recent data
taken with IceCube. We find that for a conventional distribution of cosmic-ray
sources the dipole anisotropy is higher than observed, even if source
discreteness is taken into account. Moreover, even for a shallow distribution
of galactic cosmic-ray sources and a reacceleration model, fluctuations arising
from source discreteness provide a probability only of the order of 10% that
the cosmic-ray anisotropy limits of the recent IceCube analysis are met. This
probability estimate is nearly independent of the exact choice of source rate,
but generous for a large halo size. The location of the intensity maximum far
from the Galactic Center is naturally reproduced.
