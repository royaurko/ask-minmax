We give a short overview of the DarkLight detector concept which is designed
to search for a heavy photon A' with a mass in the range 10 MeV/c^2 < m(A') <
90 MeV/c^2 and which decays to lepton pairs. We describe the intended operating
environment, the Jefferson Laboratory free electon laser, and a way to extend
DarkLight's reach using A' --> invisible decays.
