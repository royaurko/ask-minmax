Using long slit emission-line spectra we detect a fast outflow of ionized
gas, with velocities up to 1000 km/s, in the nearby powerful radio galaxy 3C
293 (z = 0.045). The fast outflow is located about 1 kpc east of the nucleus,
in a region of enhanced radio emission due to the presence of a distorted radio
jet. We present results that indicate that this fast outflow is caused by a
jet-ISM interaction. The kinematics of the outflowing ionized gas are very
similar to those of a fast outflow of neutral hydrogen gas in this galaxy,
suggesting that both outflows are the result of the same driving mechanism.
While the mass of the outflowing ionized gas is about 1 x 10e5 M_sun, the total
HI mass involved in the neutral outflow is about 100 times higher (10e7 M_sun).
This shows that, despite the high energies that must be involved in driving the
outflow, most of the gas remains, or becomes again, neutral. Other outflows of
ionized gas, although not as pronounced as in the region of the enhanced radio
emission, are also seen in various other regions along the axis of the inner
radio jets. The regular kinematics of the emission-line gas along the major
axis of the host galaxy reveal a rotating ionized gas disk 30 kpc in extent.
