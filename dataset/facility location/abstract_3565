Strain-balanced Quantum Well Solar Cells (SB- QWSCs) are radiatively
dominated at concentrator current levels. Incorporating back surface mirrors on
the back of the doped substrate leads to a reduction in this radiative
recombination current while the non-radiative dark current at lower bias
remains unchanged. This work extends a previous model of radiative dark
currents to cells where the substrate is not a perfectly absorbing sink for
emitted luminescence by including multiple passes of photons emitted by
radiative recombination. The luminescence in such mirrored structures is
reduced and the radiative dark current lower. The structure is suited to
concentrator applications because it corresponds to the high efficiency limit
where losses due to light re-emission are limited to the solid angle for
absorption of solar radiation.
