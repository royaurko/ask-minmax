Ab-initio density functional theory calculations are performed to study the
electronic properties of a MoS2 monolayer deposited over a SiO2 substrate in
the presence of interface impurities and defects. When MoS2 is placed on a
defect-free substrate the oxide plays an insignificant role, since the
conduction band top and the valence band minimum of MoS2 are located
approximately in the middle of the SiO2 band-gap. However, if Na impurities and
O dangling bonds are introduced at the SiO2 surface, these lead to localized
states, which modulate the conductivity of the MoS2 monolayer from n- to
p-type. Our results show that the conductive properties of MoS2 deposited on
SiO2 are mainly determined by the detailed structure of the MoS2 /SiO2
interface, and suggest that doping the substrate can represent a viable
strategy for engineering MoS2 -based devices.
