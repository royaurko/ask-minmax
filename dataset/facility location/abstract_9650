In realistic spinglasses, such as CuMn, AuFe and EuSrS, magnetic atoms are
located at random positions. Their couplings are determined by their relative
positions. For such systems a field theory is formulated. In certain limits it
reduces to the Hopfield model, the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, and the
Viana-Bray model. The model has a percolation transition, while for RKKY
couplings the ``concentration scaling'' T_g proportional to c occurs. Within
the Gaussian approximation the Ginzburg-Landau expansion is considered in the
clusterglass phase, that is to say, for not too small concentrations. Near
special points, the prefactor of the cubic term, or the one of the
replica-symmetry- breaking quartic term, may go through zero. Around such
points new spin glass phases are found.
