We report the discovery of 44.7 ms pulsations from the X-ray source CXOU
J181335.1-174957 using data obtained with the XMM-Newton Observatory. PSR
J1813-1749 lies near the center of the young radio supernova remnant
G12.82-0.02, which overlaps the compact TeV source HESS J1813-178. This
rotation-powered pulsar is the second most energetic in the Galaxy, with a
spin-down luminosity of Edot = (6.8 +/- 2.7)E37 erg/s. In the rotating dipole
model, the surface dipole magnetic field strength is B_s = (2.7 +/- 0.6)E12 G
and the spin-down age of 3.3-7.5 kyr, consistent with the location in the
small, shell-type radio remnant. At an assumed distance of 4.7 kpc by
association with an adjacent young stellar cluster, the efficiency of PSR
J1813-1749 in converting spin-down luminosity to radiation is approx. 0.03% for
its 2-10 keV flux, approx. 0.1% for its 20-100 keV INTEGRAL flux, and approx.
0.07% for the >200 GeV emission of HESS J1813-178, making it a likely power
source for the latter. The nearby young stellar cluster is possibly the
birthplace of the pulsar progenitor, as well as an additional source of seed
photons for inverse Compton scattering to TeV energies.
