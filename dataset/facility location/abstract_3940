We present the results of an investigation to determine the longitudinal
distributions and temporal evolution of ices on the surface of Triton. Between
2002 and 2014, we obtained 63 nights of near-infrared (0.7-2.5 $\mu$m) spectra
using the SpeX instrument at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). Triton
has spectral features in this wavelength region from N$_2$, CO, CH$_4$, CO$_2$,
and H$_2$O. An absorption feature at 2.405 $\mu$m could be due to either ethane
(C$_2$H$_6$) or $^{13}$CO. We calculated the equivalent width (or fractional
band depth in the case of H$_2$O) in each nightly average spectrum, constructed
longitudinal distributions, and quantified temporal evolution for each of the
chosen absorption bands. The volatile ices (N$_2$, CO, CH$_4$) show significant
variability over one Triton rotation and have well-constrained longitudes of
peak absorption. The non-volatile ices (CO$_2$, H$_2$O) show poorly-constrained
peak longitudes and little variability. The longitudinal variability of the
2.405 $\mu$m band resembles the non-volatile ices and is consistent with ethane
absorption. N$_2$ and CH$_4$ absorption increased over the period of the
observations, whereas absorption from the non-volatiles remained constant. We
conclude from these results that the southern latitudes of Triton are currently
dominated by non-volatile ices and as the sub-solar latitude migrates
northwards, a larger quantity of volatile ices are coming into view.
