The direct measurement of reaction cross sections at astrophysical energies
often requires the use of solid targets of known thickness, isotopic
composition, and stoichiometry that are able to withstand high beam currents
for extended periods of time. Here, we report on the production and
characterisation of isotopically enriched Ta$_2$O$_5$ targets for the study of
proton-induced reactions at the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics
facility of the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. The targets were prepared
by anodisation of tantalum backings in enriched water (up to 66% in $^{17}$O
and up to 96% in $^{18}$O). Special care was devoted to minimising the presence
of any contaminants that could induce unwanted background reactions with the
beam in the energy region of astrophysical interest. Results from target
characterisation measurements are reported, and the conclusions for proton
capture measurements with these targets are drawn.
