During the final evolution of most stars, they shed their outer skin and
expose their core of the hot ashes of nuclear burning. As these hot and very
dense cores cool into white dwarf stars, they go through episodes of
multiperiodic, nonradial g-mode pulsation. The tools of stellar seismology
allow us to use the pulsation spectra as powerful probes into the deep
interiors of these stars. Progress in white dwarf seismology has required
significant international cooperation, since another consequence of the complex
pulsations of these stars is decoding the true pulsation frequencies requires a
coordinated global effort involving high-speed photometric observations.
Through one such effort, the Whole Earth Telescope project, we have located
subsurface composition changes, detected differential rotation and magnetic
fields, and measured fundamental quantities such as stellar mass, luminosity,
and distance to extraordinary accuracy.
