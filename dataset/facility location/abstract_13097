Electric vehicles represent a promising technology for reducing emissions and
dependence on fossil fuels and have started entering different automotive
markets. In order to bolster their adoption by consumers and hence enhance
their penetration rate, a charging station infrastructure needs to be deployed.
This paper studies decentralized policies that assign electric vehicles to a
network of charging stations with the goal to achieve little to no queueing.
This objective is especially important for electric vehicles, whose charging
times are fairly long. The social optimality of the proposed policies is
established in the many-server regime, where each station is equipped with
multiple charging slots. Further, convergence issues of the algorithm that
achieves the optimal policy are examined. Finally, the results provide insight
on how to address questions related to the optimal location deployment of the
infrastructure.
