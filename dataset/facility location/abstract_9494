Radiative transfer in a clumped winds is used to describe X-ray emission line
profiles observed in the XMM-Newton RGS spectrum of the OI star Zeta Puppis. It
is shown that this X-ray spectrum can be explained as originating from a
multi-temperature collisional plasma located in the wind acceleration zone. The
X-rays are attenuated in the clumped stellar wind, which gives characteristic
profiles to the emergent lines. We specifically study the N VII emission line
in the spectrum of Zeta Pup. Long RGS exposures reveal that the N VII line
profile is structured. On the basis of our Zeta Pup atmosphere model, we rule
out the presence of N VII in the cool wind component. We suggest that the
detailed N VII line structure is due to self-absorption in the hot plasma. Wind
clumping also affects the transfer of ionizing radiation in high-mass X-ray
binaries (HMXBs). We derive analytical formulae for the ionisation parameter in
dependence on the parameters of wind clumping.
