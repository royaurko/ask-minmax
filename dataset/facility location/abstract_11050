Magnetic and charge susceptibilities of the two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard
model are investigated applying a strong coupling diagram technique in which
the expansion in powers of the hopping constants is used. For small lattices
and high temperatures results are in agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.
With the departure from half-filling $x$ the low-frequency magnetic
susceptibility becomes incommensurate and the incommensurability parameter
grows with $x$. The incommensurability, its dependence on frequency and on $x$
resemble experimental results in lanthanum cuprates. Also for finite $x$ sharp
maxima appear in the static charge susceptibility. The maxima are finite which
points to the absence of the long-range charge ordering (static stripes).
However, for $x\approx 0.12$ the maxima are located near the momenta
$(0,\pm\pi/2)$, $(\pm\pi/2,0)$. In this case an interaction of carriers with
tetragonal distortions can stabilize stripes with the wavelength of four
lattice spacings, as observed in the low-temperature tetragonal phase of
cuprates. As follows from the obtained results, the magnetic incommensurability
is not a consequence of the stripes.
