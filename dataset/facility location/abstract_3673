In the present work we report on a new measurement of resonance strengths in
the reaction 25Mg(p,gamma)26Al at E_cm= 92 and 189 keV. This study was
performed at the LUNA facility in the Gran Sasso underground laboratory using a
4pi BGO summing crystal. For the first time the 92 keV resonance was directly
observed and a resonance strength omega-gamma=(2.9+/-0.6)x10E-10 eV was
determined. Additionally, the gamma-ray branchings and strength of the 189 keV
resonance were studied with a high resolution HPGe detector yielding an
omega-gamma value in agreement with the BGO measurement, but 20% larger
compared to previous works.
