Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are mostly investigated in the Local Group.
DSphs are difficult targets for observations because of their small size and
very low surface brightness. Here we measure spectroscopic and photometric
parameters of three candidates for isolated dSphs, KKH65=BTS23, KK180, and
KK227, outside the Local Group. The galaxies are found to be of low metallicity
and low velocity dispersion. They are among the lowest surface brightness
objects in the Local Universe. According to the measured radial velocities,
metallicities, and structural and photometric parameters, KKH65 and KK227 are
representatives of the ultra-diffuse quenched galaxies. KKH65 and KK227 belong
to the outer parts of the groups NGC3414 and NGC5371, respectively. KK180 is
located in the Virgo cluster infall region.
