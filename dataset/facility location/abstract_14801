The commissioning year of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey has demonstrated that
many cataclysmic variables have been missed in previous surveys with brighter
limits. We report the identification of 22 cataclysmic variables, of which 19
are new discoveries and 3 are known systems (SW UMa, BH Lyn and Vir4). A
compendium of positions, colors and characteristics of these systems obtained
from the SDSS photometry and spectroscopy is presented along with data obtained
during follow-up studies with the Apache Point Observatory (APO) and Manastash
Ridge Observatory (MRO) telescopes. We have determined orbital periods for 3 of
the new systems: two show dwarf nova outbursts, and the third is a likely
magnetic system with eclipses of its region of line emission. Based on these
results, we expect the completed survey to locate at least 400 new CVs. Most of
these will be faint systems with low accretion rates that will provide new
constraints on binary evolution models.
