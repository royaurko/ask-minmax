The omnipresent tilt-to-length coupling in two-beam laser interferometers,
frequently a nuisance in precision measurements, vanishes for the singular case
of two beams with identical parameters and complete detection of both beams
without clipping. This effect has been observed numerically and is explained in
this manuscript by the cancellation of two very different effects of equal
magnitude and opposite sign.
