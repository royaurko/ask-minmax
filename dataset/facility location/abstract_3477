We present a measurement of the transverse intensity distributions of the
COSY proton beam at the target interaction point at ANKE at the injection
energy of 45 MeV, and after acceleration at 2.65 GeV. At 2.65 GeV, the machine
acceptance was determined as well. From the intensity distributions the beam
size is determined, and together with the measured machine acceptance, the
dimensions of a storage cell for the double-polarized experiments with the
polarized internal gas target at the ANKE spectrometer are specified. An
optimum storage cell for the ANKE experiments should have dimensions of 15mm x
20mm x 390mm (vertical x horizontal x longitudinal), whereby a luminosity of
about 2.5*10^29 cm^-2*s^-1 with beams of 10^10 particles stored in COSY could
be reached.
