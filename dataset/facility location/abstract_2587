We report new Ks band secondary eclipse observations for the hot-Jupiters
WASP-19b and WASP-43b. Using the IRIS2 infrared camera on the Anglo-Australian
Telescope (AAT), we measured significant secondary eclipses for both planets,
with depths of 0.287 -0.020/+0.020% and 0.181 -0.027/+0.027% for WASP-19b and
WASP-43b respectively. We compare the observations to atmosphere models from
the VSTAR line-by-line radiative transfer code, and examine the effect of C/O
abundance, top layer haze, and metallicities on the observed spectra. We
performed a series of signal injection and recovery exercises on the observed
light curves to explore the detection thresholds of the AAT+IRIS2 facility. We
find that the optimal photometric precision is achieved for targets brighter
than Kmag = 9, for which eclipses as shallow as 0.05% are detectable at >5
sigma significance.
