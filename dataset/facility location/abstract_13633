We present new axially symmetric half-monopole configuration of the
SU(2)$\times$U(1) Weinberg-Salam model of electromagnetic and weak
interactions. The half-monopole configuration possesses net magnetic charge
$2\pi/e$ which is half the magnetic charge of a Cho-Maison monopole. The
electromagnetic gauge potential is singular along the negative $z$-axis.
However the total energy is finite and increases only logarithmically with
increasing Higgs field self-coupling constant $\lambda^{1/2}$ at
$\sin^2\theta_W=0.2312$. In the U(1) magnetic field, the half-monopole is just
a one dimensional finite length line magnetic charge extending from the origin
$r=0$ and lying along the negative $z$-axis. In the SU(2) 't Hooft magnetic
field, it is a point magnetic charge located at $r=0$. The half-monopole
possesses magnetic dipole moment that decreases exponentially fast with
increasing Higgs field self-coupling constant $\lambda^{1/2}$ at
$\sin^2\theta_W=0.2312$.
