The study of the scaling limit of two-dimensional models of statistical
mechanics within the framework of integrable field theory is illustrated
through the example of the RSOS models. Starting from the exact description of
regime III in terms of colliding particles, we compute the correlation
functions of the thermal, $\phi_{1,2}$ and (for some cases) spin operators in
the two-particle approximation. The accuracy obtained for the moments of these
correlators is analysed by computing the central charge and the scaling
dimensions and comparing with the exact results. We further consider the
(generally non-integrable) perturbation of the critical points with both the
operators $\phi_{1,3}$ and $\phi_{1,2}$ and locate the branches solved on the
lattice within the associated two-dimensional phase diagram. Finally we discuss
the fact that the RSOS models, the dilute $q$-state Potts model at and the O(n)
vector model are all described by the same perturbed conformal field theory.
