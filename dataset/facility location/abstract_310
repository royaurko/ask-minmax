The intense neutron source for development of fusion materials planned by
international collaboration makes a new step to clarify the technical issues
for realizing the 40 MeV, 250 mA deuteron beam facility. The baseline concept
employs two identical 125 mA linac modules whose beams are combined at the
flowing lithium target. Recent work for reducing the cost loading concerns the
staged deployment of the full irradiation capability in three steps. The
Japanese activity about the design and development study about IFMIF
accelerator in this year is presented and the schedule of next several years is
overviewed.
