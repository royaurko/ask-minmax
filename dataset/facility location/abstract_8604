We present here a method to study the distribution of electron density
fluctuations in pulsar directions as well as to estimate pulsar distances. The
method, based on a simple two-component model of the scattering medium
discussed by Gwinn et al. (1993), uses scintillation & proper motion data in
addition to the measurements of angular broadening & temporal broadening to
solve for the model parameters, namely, the fractional distance to a discrete
scatterer and the ascociated relative scattering strength. We show how this
method can be used to estimate pulsar distances reliably, when the location of
a discrete scatterer (e.g. an HII region), if any, is known. Considering the
specific example of PSR B0736-40, we illustrate how a simple characterization
of the Gum nebula region (using the data on the Vela pulsar) is possible and
can be used along with the temporal broadening measurements to estimate pulsar
distances.
