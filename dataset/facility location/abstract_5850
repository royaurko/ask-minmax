The superconducting state of a thin superconducting disk with a hole is
studied within the non-linear Ginzburg-Landau theory in which the
demagnetization effect is accurately taken into account. We find that the flux
through the hole is not quantized, the superconducting state is stabilized with
increasing size of the hole for fixed radius of the disk, and a transition to a
multi-vortex state is found if the disk is sufficiently large. Breaking the
circular summetry through a non central location of the hole in the disk
enhances the multi-vortex state.
