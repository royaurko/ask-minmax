We present a preliminary study of the multipolar structure of gravitational
radiation from spinning black hole binary mergers. We consider three different
spinning binary configurations: (1) one "hang-up" run, where the black holes
have equal masses and large spins initially aligned with the orbital angular
momentum; (2) seven "spin-flip" runs, where the holes have a mass ratio q=4,
the spins are anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum, and the initial
Kerr parameters of the holes j_1=j_2=j_i are fine-tuned to produce a
Schwarzschild remnant after merger; (3) three "super-kick" runs where the mass
ratio q=M_1/M_2=1, 2, 4 and the spins of the two holes are initially located on
the orbital plane, pointing in opposite directions. For all of these
simulations we compute the multipolar energy distribution and the Kerr
parameter of the final hole. For the hang-up run, we show that including
leading-order spin-orbit and spin-spin terms in a multipolar decomposition of
the post-Newtonian waveforms improves the agreement with the numerical
simulation.
