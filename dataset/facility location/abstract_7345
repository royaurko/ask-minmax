In scintillator detectors, the forward displacement of the neutron in the
reaction $\bar\nu_e+p\to e^++n$ provides neutrino directional information as
demonstrated by the CHOOZ reactor experiment with 2,500 events. The near
detector of the forthcoming Double Chooz experiment will collect
$1.6\times10^5$ events per year, enough to determine the average neutrino
direction with a $1 \sigma$ half-cone aperture of $2.3^\circ$ in one year. It
is more difficult to separate the two Chooz reactors that are viewed at a
separation angle $\phi=30^\circ$. If their strengths are known and
approximately equal, the azimuthal location of each reactor is obtained with
$\pm6^\circ$ ($1 \sigma$) and the probability of confusing them with a single
source is less than 11%. Five year's data reduce this ``confusion probability''
to less than 0.3%, i.e., a $3 \sigma$ separation is possible. All of these
numbers improve rapidly with increasing angular separation of the sources. For
a setup with $\phi=90^\circ$ and one year's data, the azimuthal $1 \sigma$
uncertainty for each source decreases to $\pm3.2^\circ$. Of course, for Double
Chooz the two reactor locations are known, allowing one instead to measure
their individual one-year integrated power output to $\pm11%$ ($1 \sigma$), and
their five-year integrated output to $\pm4.8%$ ($1 \sigma$).
