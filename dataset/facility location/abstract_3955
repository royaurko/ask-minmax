The recent discovery of a supernova (SN 1998bw) seemingly associated with
GRB~980425 adds a new twist to the decades-old debate over the origin of
gamma-ray bursts. To investigate the possibility that some (or all) bursts are
associated with supernovae, we performed a systematic search for
temporal/angular correlations using catalogs of BATSE and BATSE/{\it Ulysses}
burst locations. We find no associations with any of the precise BATSE/{\it
Ulysses} locations, which allows us to conclude that the fraction of
high-fluence gamma-ray bursts from known supernovae is small ($<$0.2%). For the
more numerous weaker bursts, the corresponding limiting fraction of 1.5% is
less constraining due to the imprecise locations of these events. This limit
($1.5% \simeq 18$ bursts) allows that a large fraction of the recent supernovae
used as a comparison data set (18 supernovae $\simeq 20%$) could have
associated gamma-ray bursts. Thus, although we find no significant evidence to
support a burst/supernova association, the possibility cannot be excluded for
weak bursts.
