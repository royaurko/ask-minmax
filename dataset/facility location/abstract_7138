We present near-infrared images of NGC 4314 in the $J$,$H$, and $K$ bands.
Colors in these bands are constant across the bar of NGC 4314 indicating that
the mass-to-light ratio is constant over much of the galaxy. We have developed
an efficient procedure for mapping the gravitational potential of a
non-axisymmetric galaxy based on its appearance in the near-infrared using a
Fourier Transform method. We account for the thickness of the galaxy's stellar
disk by convolving its $K$ image with a function that depends upon the vertical
stellar scale height. We apply this procedure to NGC 4314 and find that
prograde stellar orbits integrated in the potential are consistent with the
shape of the bar for a disk vertical scale height of $h = 350 \pm 100$ pc and a
corotation radius of $r=3.5 \pm 0.5$ kpc.
  We find that the inner $m=4$ Lindblad resonance is approximately at the
location of knob-like features seen near the end of the bar. The shape of
nearly closed orbits at this radius are lozenge or diamond shaped and have low
speeds along the major axis of the bar. The low speeds imply an increase in
density along the major axis of the bar. The angle of the major axis of the
$m=4$ component of the surface density begins to twist at the location of its
resonance, and the angle of the $m=2$ component begins to twist at a larger
radius near the corotation radius.
