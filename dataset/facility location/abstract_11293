A toy model of two dimensional nanoindentation in finite crystals is
proposed. The crystal is described by periodized discrete elasticity whereas
the indenter is a rigid strain field of triangular shape representing a hard
knife-like indenter. Analysis of the model shows that there are a number of
discontinuities in the load vs penetration depth plot which correspond to the
creation of dislocation loops. The stress vs depth bifurcation diagram of the
model reveals multistable stationary solutions that appear as the
dislocation-free branch of solutions develops turning points for increasing
stress. Dynamical simulations show that an increment of the applied load leads
to nucleation of dislocation loops below the nanoindenter tip. Such
dislocations travel inside the bulk of the crystal and accommodate at a certain
depth in the sample. In agreement with experiments, hysteresis is observed if
the stress is decreased after the first dislocation loop is created. Critical
stress values for loop creation and their final location at equilibrium are
calculated.
