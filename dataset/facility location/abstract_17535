We report the parallax and proper motion of five L dwarfs obtained with
observations from the robotic Liverpool Telescope. Our derived proper motions
are consistent with published values and have considerably smaller errors.
Based on our spectral type versus absolute magnitude diagram, we do not find
any evidence for binaries among our sample, or, at least no comparable mass
binaries. Their space velocities locate them within the thin disk and based on
the model comparisons they have solar-like abundances. For all five objects, we
derived effective temperature, luminosity, radius, gravity and mass from a
evolutionary model(CBA00) and our measured parallax; moreover, we derived their
effective temperature by integrating observed optical and near-infrared spectra
and model spectra (BSH06 or BT-Dusty respectively) at longer wavelengths to
obtain bolometric {\bf flux using} the classical Stefan-Boltzmann law:
generally the three temperatures for one object derived using two different
methods with three models are consistent, while at lower temperature(e.g. for
L4) the differences among the three temperatures are slightly larger than that
at higher temperature(e.g. for L1).
