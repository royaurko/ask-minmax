This paper aims to implement the six channel redundancy to achieve fault
tolerance in testing of satellites with acoustic spectrum. We mainly focus here
on achieving fault tolerance. An immediate application is the microphone data
acquisition and to do analysis at the Acoustic Test Facility (ATF) centre,
National Aerospace Laboratories. It has an 1100 cubic meter reverberation
chamber in which a maximum sound pressure level of 157 dB is generated. The six
channel Redundancy software with fault tolerant operation is devised and
developed. The data are applied to program written in C language. The program
is run using the Code Composer Studio by accepting the inputs. This is tested
with the TMS 320C 6727 DSP, Pro Audio Development Kit (PADK).
