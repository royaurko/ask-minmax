We analyze the influence of anomalous gauge couplings in the reaction $e^- \:
e^- \longrightarrow e^- \: W^- \: \nu_e$ at a 500 GeV linear collider. The
limits imposed by this process on deviations from the standard model of
electro-weak interaction, are competitive with those inferred from other high
energy experiments. Furthermore, the allowed domain in the parameter space is
quite different, and hence such an experiment would more than complement the
other direct searches.
