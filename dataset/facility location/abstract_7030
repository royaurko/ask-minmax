We present a study of photometric properties of very crowded stellar fields
toward the Galactic Bulge. We performed a search for pulsating stars among
thousands of variable stars from the OGLE-II survey supplementing the
variability study with photometric measurements in four Johnson-Cousins
$UBVI_{\rm C}$ passbands. Using these data, we analysed the properties of
objects located at different distances and, whenever possible, classified them.
