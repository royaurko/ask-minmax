We report on the properties of pre-main-sequence objects in the Taurus
molecular clouds as observed in 7 mid- and far-infrared bands with the Spitzer
Space Telescope. There are 215 previously-identified members of the Taurus
star-forming region in our ~44 square degree map; these members exhibit a range
of Spitzer colors that we take to define young stars still surrounded by
circumstellar dust (noting that ~20% of the bonafide Taurus members exhibit no
detectable dust excesses). We looked for new objects in the survey field with
similar Spitzer properties, aided by extensive optical, X-ray, and ultraviolet
imaging, and found 148 candidate new members of Taurus. We have obtained
follow-up spectroscopy for about half the candidate sample, thus far confirming
34 new members, 3 probable new members, and 10 possible new members, an
increase of 15-20% in Taurus members. Of the objects for which we have
spectroscopy, 7 are now confirmed extragalactic objects, and one is a
background Be star. The remaining 93 candidate objects await additional
analysis and/or data to be confirmed or rejected as Taurus members. Most of the
new members are Class II M stars and are located along the same cloud filaments
as the previously-identified Taurus members. Among non-members with Spitzer
colors similar to young, dusty stars are evolved Be stars, planetary nebulae,
carbon stars, galaxies, and AGN.
