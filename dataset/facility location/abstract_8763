We are developing two-dimensional 16 x 25 pixel detector arrays of both
unstressed and stressed Ge:Ga photoconductive detectors for far-infrared
astronomy from SOFIA. The arrays, based on earlier 5 x 5 detector arrays used
on the KAO, will be for our new instrument, the Far Infrared Field Imaging Line
Spectrometer (FIFI LS). The unstressed Ge:Ga detector array will cover the
wavelength range from 40 to 120 microns, and the stressed Ge:Ga detector array
from 120 to 210 microns. The detector arrays will be operated with multiplexed
integrating amplifiers with cryogenic readout electronics located close to the
detector arrays. The design of the stressed detector array and results of
current measurements on several prototype 16 pixel linear arrays are reported.
They demonstrate the feasibility of the current concept. ***This paper does not
