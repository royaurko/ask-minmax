In practice daily volatility of portfolio returns is transformed to longer
holding periods by multiplying by the square-root of time which assumes that
returns are not serially correlated. Under this assumption this procedure of
scaling can also be applied to contributions to volatility of the assets in the
portfolio. Close prices are often used to calculate the profit and loss of a
portfolio. Trading at exchanges located in distant time zones this can lead to
significant serial cross-correlations of the closing-time returns of the assets
in the portfolio. These serial correlations cause the square-root-of-time rule
to fail. Moreover volatility contributions in this setting turn out to be
misleading due to non-synchronous correlations. We address this issue and
provide alternative procedures for scaling volatility and calculating risk
contributions for arbitrary holding periods.
