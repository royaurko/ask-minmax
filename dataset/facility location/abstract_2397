The rapid neutron capture process (r-process) is thought to be responsible
for the creation of more than half of all elements beyond iron. The scientific
challenges to understanding the origin of the heavy elements beyond iron lie in
both the uncertainties associated with astrophysical conditions that are needed
to allow an r-process to occur and a vast lack of knowledge about the
properties of nuclei far from stability. There is great global competition to
access and measure the most exotic nuclei that existing facilities can reach,
while simultaneously building new, more powerful accelerators to make even more
exotic nuclei. This work is an attempt to determine the most crucial nuclear
masses to measure using an r-process simulation code and several mass models
(FRDM, Duflo-Zuker, and HFB-21). The most important nuclear masses to measure
are determined by the changes in the resulting r-process abundances. Nuclei
around the closed shells near N=50, 82, and 126 have the largest impact on
r-process abundances irrespective of the mass models used.
