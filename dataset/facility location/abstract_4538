We propose an extension to other high T_{c } compounds of a model introduced
earlier for YBCO. In the ''self-doped'' compounds we assume that the doping
part (namely the BiO, HgO, TlO planes in BSCCO, HBCCO, TBCCO respectively) is
metallic, which leads to a multiband model. This assumption is supported by
band structure calculations. Taking a repulsive pairing interaction between
these doping bands and the CuO_{2} bands leads to opposite signs for the order
parameter on these bands and to nodes whenever the Fermi surfaces of these
bands cross. We show that in BSCCO the low temperature dependence of the
penetration depth is reasonably accounted for. In this case the nodes are not
located near the 45^{o} direction, which makes the experimental determination
of the node locations an important test for our model. The situation in HBCCO
and TBCCO is rather analogous to BSCCO. We consider the indications given by
NMR and find that they rather favor a metallic character for the doping bands.
Finally we discuss the cases of NCCO and LSCO which are not ''self-doped'' and
where our model does not give nodes.
