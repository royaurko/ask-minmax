In backbone networks carrying heavy traffic loads, unwanted and unusual
end-to-end delay changes can happen, though possibly rarely. In order to
understand and manage the network to potentially avoid such abrupt changes, it
is crucial and challenging to locate where in the network lies the cause of
such delays so that some corresponding actions may be taken. To tackle this
challenge, the present paper proposes a simple and novel approach. The proposed
approach relies only on end-to-end measurements, unlike literature approaches
that often require a distributed and possibly complicated monitoring /
measurement infrastructure. Here, the key idea of the proposed approach is to
make use of compressed sensing theory to estimate delays on each hop between
the two nodes where end-to-end delay measurement is conducted, and infer
critical hops that contribute to the abrupt delay increases. To demonstrate its
effectiveness, the proposed approach is applied to a real network. The results
are encouraging, showing that the proposed approach is able to locate the hops
that have the most significant impact on or contribute the most to abrupt
increases on the end-to-end delay.
