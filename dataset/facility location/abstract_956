Observables in few-nucleon scattering processes are sensitive probes to study
the two and many-body interactions between nucleons in nuclei. In the past
decades, several facilities provided a large data base to study in detail the
few-nucleon interactions below the pion-production threshold by exploiting
polarized proton and deuteron beams and large-acceptance detectors. In this
contribution, some recent results are discussed and interpreted by rigorous
Faddeev calculations which are based upon modern potentials. Furthermore, the
paper presents preliminary results from a pioneering and exclusive study of the
four-nucleon scattering process at intermediate energies which was recently
conducted at the KVI.
