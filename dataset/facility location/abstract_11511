We present the results of modelling the subgiant star $\beta$ Hydri using the
seismic observational constraints. We have computed several grids of stellar
evolutionary tracks using Aarhus STellar Evolution Code (ASTEC,
Christensen-Dalsgaard, 2008a), with and without helium diffusion and settling.
For those models on each track that are located at the observationally
determined position of $\beta$ Hydri in the HR diagram, we have calculated the
oscillation frequencies using Aarhus adiabatic pulsation package (ADIPLS,
Christensen-Dalsgaard, 2008b). Applying the near-surface corrections to the
calculated frequencies using the empirical law presented by Kjeldsen et al.
(2008), we have compared the corrected model frequencies with the observed
frequencies of the star. We show that after correcting the frequencies for the
near-surface effects, we have a fairly good fit for both $l$=0 and $l$=2
frequencies. We also have good agreement between the observed and calculated
$l$=1 mode frequencies although there is room for improvement in order to fit
all the observed mixed modes simultaneously.
