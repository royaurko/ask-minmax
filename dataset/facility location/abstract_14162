In this paper, we present a communication-free algorithm for distributed
coverage of an arbitrary network by a group of mobile agents with local sensing
capabilities. The network is represented as a graph, and the agents are
arbitrarily deployed on some nodes of the graph. Any node of the graph is
covered if it is within the sensing range of at least one agent. The agents are
mobile devices that aim to explore the graph and to optimize their locations in
a decentralized fashion by relying only on their sensory inputs. We formulate
this problem in a game theoretic setting and propose a communication-free
learning algorithm for maximizing the coverage.
