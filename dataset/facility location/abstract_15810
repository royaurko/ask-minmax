The CLAS detector will require improvements in its particle identification
system to take advantage of the higher energies provided by the Jefferson
Laboratory accelerator upgrade to 12 GeV. To this end, we have studied the
timing characteristics of the micro-channel plate photo-multiplier 85001 from
Burle, which can be operated in a high magnetic field environment.
  For reference and comparison, measurements were also made using the standard
PMT R2083 from Hamamatsu using two timing methods.
  The cosmic ray method, which utilizes three identical scintillating counters
2cmx3cmx50cm with PMs at the ends, yields 59.1(0.7)ps.
  The location method of particles from radiative source with known coordiantes
has been used to compare timing resolutions of R2083 and Burle-85001.This
``coordinate method'' requires only one counter instrumented with two PMs and
it yields 59.5(0.7)ps.
  For the micro-channel plate photomultiplier from Burle with an external
amplification of 10 to the signals, the coordinate method yields 130(4)ps.
  This method also makes it possible to estimate the number of primary
photo-electrons.
