We report the results of a sensitive search for 12.2 GHz methanol maser
emission towards a sample of eight high-mass star formation regions in the
Large Magellanic Clouds which have been detected in other maser transitions. We
detected one source towards the star formation region N105a. This is the first
detection of a 12.2 GHz methanol maser outside our Galaxy. We also made
near-contemporaneous observations of the 6.7 GHz methanol and 22 GHz water
masers towards these sources, resulting in the detection of water maser
emission in six new sources, including one associated with the strongest 6.7
GHz maser in the Magellanic Clouds IRAS 05011-6815. The majority of the maser
sources are closely associated with objects identified as likely Young Stellar
Objects (YSO) on the basis of Spitzer Space Telescope observations. We find
that the YSOs associated with masers tend to be more luminous and have redder
infrared colours than the sample as a whole. SED modeling of the YSOs shows
that the masers are associated with sources of higher central mass, total
luminosity and ambient density than the majority of YSOs in the LMC. This is
consistent with the well-established relationship between luminous methanol and
water masers and young, high-mass objects observed in the Galaxy.
