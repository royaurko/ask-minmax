We describe and model high velocity (~15,000 km/s) Lyman alpha and Balmer
alpha emission from supernova remnant 1987A seen in September and October 1997
with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. Part of this emission comes from
a reverse shock located at ~75% of the radius of the inner boundary of the
inner circumstellar ring and confined within 30 degrees of the equatorial
plane. Departure from axisymmetry in the Lyman alpha and Balmer alpha emission
correlates with that seen in nonthermal radio emission and reveals an asymmetry
in the circumstellar gas distribution. We also see diffuse high velocity Lyman
alpha emission from supernova debris inside the reverse shock that may be due
to excitation by nonthermal particles accelerated by the shock.
