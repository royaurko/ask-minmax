The formation of massive stars is an outstanding problem in stellar
evolution. However, it is expected that they are (predominantly) born in
heirarchical environments within massive young clusters, which in turn are
located within larger star forming complexes that reflect the underlying
structure of the natal molecular cloud. Initial observations of such regions
suggest that multiple generations of stars and proto-stars are present,
necessitating a multiwavelength approach to yield a full (proto-)stellar
census; in this contribution we provide an overview of just such an
observational approach for Galactic examples, focusing on the G305 complex.
