(Abridged) Projected rotational velocities (vsini) have been measured for a
sample of 145 stars with masses between 0.4 and >10 Msun (median mass 2.1 Msun)
located in the Orion star-forming complex. These measurements have been
supplemented with data from the literature for Orion stars with masses as low
as 0.1 Msun. The primary finding from analysis of these data is that the upper
envelope of the observed values of angular momentum per unit mass (J/M) varies
as M^0.25 for stars on convective tracks having masses in the range ~0.1 to ~3
Msun. This power law extends smoothly into the domain of more massive stars (3
to 10 Msun), which in Orion are already on the ZAMS. This result stands in
sharp contrast to the properties of main sequence stars, which show a break in
the power law and a sharp decline in J/M with decreasing mass for stars with M
<2 Msun. A second result of our study is that this break is seen already among
the PMS stars in our Orion sample that are on radiative tracks, even though
these stars are only a few million years old. A comparison of rotation rates
seen for stars on either side of the convective-radiative boundary shows that
stars do not rotate as solid bodies during the transition from convective to
radiative tracks.
