On the spur of Calvary the Shroud appears. On this rock the Scriptures are
fulfilled, and this rock, located exactly to the West of the Temple of
Jerusalem, becomes mystically the new orient, place of the Resurrection of the
Lord. The alignements between the three holy places for the three monotheistic
religions, the Anastasis, the Temple, now Dome of the Rock, and the Chapel of
the Ascension with the East-West axis are here measured and commented both from
an astronomical and topographic point of view, enlighted by the urbanistic
roman concepts of Vitruvius and the catechesis of saint Cyril bishop of
Jerusalem 13 years after the inauguration of the Constantinian buildings at the
Holy Sepulcre.
