This is the proceedings of PLACES'10, the 3rd Workshop on Programming
Language Approaches to Concurrency and Communication-cEntric Software, held in
Pathos, Cyprus, on 21st Mach, 2010, co-located with the ETAPS federated
conferences. PLACES aims to offer a forum where researchers from different
fields exchange new ideas on one of the central challenges in programming in
near future, the development of programming methodologies and infrastructures
where concurrency and distribution are a norm rather than a marginal concern.
The Program Committee, after a careful and thorough reviewing process, selected
for presentation in the programme 10 papers out of 14 submissions. Each
submission was evaluated by at least two referees, and the accepted papers were
selected during two weeks' electronic discussions. This post-proceedings
contain the papers which are based on these submissions, incorporating the
result of these and further reviews, resulting in strengthened technical
results and presentations.
