The methods used in the evaluation of the neutrino-nucleus cross section are
reviewed. Results are shown for a variety of targets of practical importance.
Many of the described reactions are accessible in future experiments with
neutrino sources from the pion and muon decays at rest, which might be
available at the neutron spallation facilities. Detailed comparison between the
experimental and theoretical results would establish benchmarks needed for
verification and/or parameter adjustment of the nuclear models. Having a
reliable tool for such calculation is of great importance in a variety of
applications, e.g. the neutrino oscillation studies, detection of supernova
neutrinos, description of the neutrino transport in supernovae, and description
of the r-process nucleosynthesis.
