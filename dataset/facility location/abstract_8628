We present {\it UBVI} photometry of the eclipsing binary HV2274 - the system
which has been recently used for distance determination to the LMC by Guinan et
al. (1998). We determine the interstellar reddening to the star,
E(B-V)=0.149+/-0.015 mag, based on observed colors of the star. This value is
in excellent agreement with the mean reddening towards HV2274 obtained from
photometry of the red clump stars in the surrounding field. The reddening is
almost twice as large as determined by Guinan et al. (1998).
  We discuss the consequences of reddening underestimate. Most likely HV2274 is
located much closer with the distance modulus to the star and the LMC: m-M =
18.22+/-0.13 mag supporting the short distance scale to the LMC. Such a
distance modulus is in excellent agreement with the recent distance
determinations with RR Lyr and red clump stars.
