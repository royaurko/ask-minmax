We present a method of cones for rigorous estimations of eigenvectors,
eigenspaces and eigenvalues of a matrix. The key notion is the cone-domination
and is inspired by ideas from hyperbolic dynamical systems. We present theorems
which allow to rigorously locate the spectrum of the matrix and the
eigenspaces, also multidimensional ones in case of eigenvalues of multiplicity
greater than one or clusters of close eigenvalues.
  In case of isolated eigenvalue we show that the our method give the same or
better estimates than ones known in literature.
