Using renormalization group methods we study multifractality in percolation
at the instance of noisy random resistor networks. We introduce the concept of
master operators. The multifractal moments of the current distribution (which
are proportional to the noise cumulants $C_R^{(l)} (x, x^\prime)$ of the
resistance between two sites x and $x^\prime$ located on the same cluster) are
related to such master operators. The scaling behavior of the multifractal
moments is governed exclusively by the master operators, even though a myriad
of servant operators is involved in the renormalization procedure. We calculate
the family of multifractal exponents ${\psi_l}$ for the scaling behavior of the
noise cumulants, $C_R^{(l)} (x, x^\prime) \sim | x - x^\prime |^{\psi_l /\nu}$,
where $\nu$ is the correlation length exponent for percolation, to two-loop
order.
