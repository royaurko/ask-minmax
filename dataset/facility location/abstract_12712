NGC 2392 is a young double-shell planetary nebula (PN). Its intrinsic
structure and shaping mechanism are still not fully understood. In this paper
we present new spectroscopic observations of NGC 2392. The slits were placed at
two different locations to obtain the spectra of the inner and outer regions.
Several [Fe III] lines are clearly detected in the inner region. We infer that
NGC 2392 might have an intrinsic structure similar to the bipolar nebula Mz 3,
which also exhibits a number of [Fe III}] lines arising from the central
regions. In this scenario, the inner and outer regions of NGC 2392 correspond
to the inner lobes and the outer outflows of Mz 3, respectively. We construct a
three-dimensional morpho-kinematic model to examine our hypothesis. We also
compare the physical conditions and chemical composition of the inner and outer
regions, and discuss the implications on the formation of this type of PN.
