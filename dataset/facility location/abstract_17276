The Long Wavelength Array (LWA) will be a new multi-purpose radio telescope
operating in the frequency range 10-88 MHz. Scientific programs include
pulsars, supernova remnants, general transient searches, radio recombination
lines, solar and Jupiter bursts, investigations into the "dark ages" using
redshifted hydrogen, and ionospheric phenomena. Upon completion, LWA will
consist of 53 phased array "stations" distributed across a region over 400 km
in diameter. Each station consists of 256 pairs of dipole-type antennas whose
signals are formed into beams, with outputs transported to a central location
for high-resolution aperture synthesis imaging. The resulting image sensitivity
is estimated to be a few mJy (5sigma, 8 MHz, 2 polarizations, 1 h, zenith) from
20-80 MHz; with angular resolution of a few arcseconds. Additional information
is online at http://lwa.unm.edu. Partners in the LWA project include LANL, JPL,
NRL, UNM, NMT, and Virginia Tech.
  The full LWA will be a powerful instrument for the study of particle
acceleration mechanisms in AGN. Even with the recently completed first station
of the LWA, called "LWA1", we can begin spectral studies of AGN radio lobes.
These can be combined with Fermi observations. Furthermore we have an ongoing
project to observe Crab Giant Pulses in concert with Fermi. In addition to
these pointed studies, the LWA1 images the sky down to declination -30 degrees
daily. This is quite complimentary to Fermi's daily images of the sky.
