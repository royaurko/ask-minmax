We show the effects of environmental evolution on Virgo cluster and field
dwarf elliptical galaxies (dEs), presenting the first large-scale
integral-field spectroscopic data for this galaxy class. The great variety of
morphological, kinematic, and stellar population parameters seen in our data
supports the claim that dEs are defunct dwarf spiral/irregular galaxies and
points to a formation scenario that allows for a stochastic shaping of galaxy
properties. We further investigate the properties of our sample by analyzing
its kinematic and dynamical properties. We compare the level of rotational
support of dEs and giant early-type galaxies and show that the properties of
the former largely resemble those of giant fast-rotators. Based on our data, no
trend exists between the level of rotational support in dEs and their location
in the cluster. However, a tentative trend is seen in dark matter fraction: it
increases for larger Virgocentric distances.
