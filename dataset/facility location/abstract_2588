We have investigated the response of a significant sample of Hamamatsu H8500
MultiAnode PhotoMultiplier Tubes (MAPMTs) as single photon detectors, in view
of their use in a ring imaging Cherenkov counter for the CLAS12 spectrometer at
the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. For this, a laser working
at 407.2nm wavelength was employed. The sample is divided equally into standard
window type, with a spectral response in the visible light region, and
UV-enhanced window type MAPMTs. The studies confirm the suitability of these
MAPMTs for single photon detection in such a Cherenkov imaging application.
