We successfully identified a few final states in deuteron-deuteron scattering
at 65 MeV/nucleon at KVI using a unique and advanced detection system called
BINA. This facility enabled us to perform cross sections and polarization
measurements with an excellent statistical and systematical precision. The
analysis procedure and part of the results of the three-body break-up channel
in deuteron-deuteron scattering at 65 MeV/nucleon are presented in this paper.
