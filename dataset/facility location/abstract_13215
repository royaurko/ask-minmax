We construct cylindrical, traversable wormholes with finite radii by taking
into account the cut-and-paste procedure for the case of cosmic string
manifolds with a positive cosmological constant. Under reasonable assumptions
about the equation of state of the matter located at the shell, we find that
the wormhole throat undergoes a monotonous evolution provided it moves at a
constant velocity. In order to explore the dynamical nonlinear behaviour of the
wormhole throat, we consider that the matter at the shell is supported by
anisotropic Chaplygin gas, anti-Chaplygin gas, or a mixed of Chaplygin and
anti-Chaplygin gases implying that wormholes could suffer an accelerated
expansion or contraction but the oscillatory behavior seems to be forbidden.
