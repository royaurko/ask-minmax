The Internet of Things (IoT) aims at interconnecting everyday objects
(including both things and users) and then using this connection information to
provide customized user services. However, IoT does not work in its initial
stages without adequate acquisition of user preferences. This is caused by
cold-start problem that is a situation where only few users are interconnected.
To this end, we propose CRUC scheme - Cold-start Recommendations Using
Collaborative Filtering in IoT, involving formulation, filtering and prediction
steps. Extensive experiments over real cases and simulation have been performed
to evaluate the performance of CRUC scheme. Experimental results show that CRUC
efficiently solves the cold-start problem in IoT.
