A computer code is described for the simulation of gravitational lensing
data. The code incorporates adaptive mesh refinement in choosing which rays to
shoot based on the requirements of the source size, location and surface
brightness distribution or to find critical curves/caustics. A variety of
source surface brightness models are implemented to represent galaxies and
quasar emission regions. The lensing mass can be represented by point masses
(stars), smoothed simulation particles, analytic halo models, pixelized mass
maps or any combination of these. The deflection and beam distortions
(convergence and shear) are calculated by modified tree algorithm when halos,
point masses or particles are used and by FFT when mass maps are used. The
combination of these methods allow for a very large dynamical range to be
represented in a single simulation. Individual images of galaxies can be
represented in a simulation that covers many square degrees. For an individual
strongly lensed quasar, source sizes from the size of the quasar's host galaxy
(~ 100 kpc) down to microlensing scales (~ 10^-4 pc) can be probed in a self
consistent simulation. Descriptions of various tests of the code's accuracy are
given.
