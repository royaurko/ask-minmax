We show that Parity-Violating Deep Inelastic Scattering (PVDIS) of
longitudinally polarized electrons from deuterium can in principle be a
relatively clean probe of higher twist quark-quark correlations beyond the
parton model. As first observed by Bjorken and Wolfenstein, the dominant
contribution to the electron polarization asymmetry, proportional to the axial
vector electron coupling, receives corrections at twist-four from the matrix
element of a single four-quark operator. We reformulate the Bjorken/Wolfenstein
argument in a matter suitable for the interpretation of experiments planned at
the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab). In particular, we
observe that because the contribution of the relevant twist four operator
satisfies the Callan-Gross relation, the ratio of parity-violating longitudinal
and transverse cross sections, R_{\gamma Z}, is identical to that for purely
electromagnetic scattering, R_{\gamma}, up to perturbative and power suppressed
contributions. This result simplifies the interpretation of the asymmetry in
terms of other possible novel hadronic and electroweak contributions. We use
the results of MIT Bag Model calculations to estimate contributions of the
relevant twist four operator to the leading term in the asymmetry as a function
of Bjorken x and Q2 . We compare these estimates with possible leading twist
corrections due to violation of charge symmetry in the parton distribution
functions.
