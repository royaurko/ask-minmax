A superconducting (SC) state (Tc ~ 4.2K) has very recently been observed upon
successful doping of the CDW ordered triangular lattice TiSe$_2$, with copper.
Using high resolution photoemission spectroscopy we identify, for the first
time, the momentum space locations of the doped electrons that form the Fermi
sea of the parent superconductor. With doping, we find that the kinematic
nesting volume increases whereas the coherence of the CDW order sharply drops.
In the superconducting doping, we observe the emergence of a large density of
states in the form of a narrow electron pocket near the \textit{L}-point of the
Brillouin Zone with \textit{d}-like character. The \textit{k}-space electron
distributions highlight the unconventional interplay of CDW to SC cross-over
achieved through non-magnetic copper doping.
