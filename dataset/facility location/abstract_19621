Recent publications claim that there is no convincing evidence for
measurements of the baryonic acoustic (BAO) feature in galaxy samples using
either monopole or radial information. Different claims seem contradictory:
data is either not consistent with the BAO model or data is consistent with
both the BAO model and featureless models without BAO. We investigate this
point with a set of 216 realistic mock galaxy catalogs extracted from MICE7680,
one of the largest volume dark matter simulation run to date, with a volume of
1300 cubical gigaparsecs. Our mocks cover similar volume, densities and bias as
the real galaxies and provide 216 realizations of the Lambda or w=-1 Cold Dark
Matter (wCDM) BAO model. We find that only 20% of the mocks show a
statistically significant (3 sigma) preference for the true (input) wCDM BAO
model as compared to a featureless (non-physical) model without BAO. Thus the
volume of current galaxy samples is not yet large enough to claim that the BAO
feature has been detected. Does this mean that we can not locate the BAO
position? Using a simple (non optimal) algorithm we show that in 50% (100%) of
the mocks we can find the BAO position within 5% (20%) of the true value. These
two findings are not in contradiction: the former is about model selection, the
later is about parameter fitting within a model. We conclude that current
monopole and radial BAO measurements can be used as standard rulers if we
assume wCDM type of models.
