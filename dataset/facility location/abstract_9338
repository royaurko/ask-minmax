The optical/near-IR stellar continuum carries unique information about the
stellar population in a galaxy, its mass function and star-formation history.
Star-forming regions display rich emission-line spectra from which we can
derive the dust and gas distribution, map velocity fields, metallicities and
young massive stars and locate shocks and stellar winds. All this information
is very useful in the dissection of the starburst phenomenon. We discuss a few
of the advantages and limitations of observations in the optical/near-IR region
and focus on some results. Special attention is given to the role of
interactions and mergers and observations of the relatively dust-free starburst
dwarfs. In the future we expect new and refined diagnostic tools to provide us
with more detailed information about the IMF, strength and duration of the
burst and its triggering mechanisms.
