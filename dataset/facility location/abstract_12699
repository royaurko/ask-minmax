The luminous blue variable (LBV) stars are peculiar very massive stars. The
study of these stellar objects and their surroundings is important for
understanding the evolution of massive stars and its effects on the
interstellar medium. We study the LBV star candidate G26.47+0.02. Using several
large-scale surveys in different frequencies we performed a multiwavelength
study of G26.47+0.02 and its surroundings. We found a molecular shell (seen in
the 13CO J=1-0 line) that partially surrounds the mid-infrared nebula of
G26.47+0.02, which suggests an interaction between the strong stellar winds and
the molecular gas. From the HI absorption and the molecular gas study we
conclude that G26.47+0.02 is located at a distance of ~4.8 kpc. The radio
continuum analysis shows a both thermal and non-thermal emission toward this
LBV candidate, pointing to wind-wind collision shocks from a binary system.
This hypothesis is supported by a search of near-IR sources and the Chandra
X-ray analysis. Additional multiwavelength and long-term observations are
needed to detect some possible variable behavior, and if that is found, to
confirm the binary nature of the system.
