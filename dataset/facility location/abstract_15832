The STAR Silicon Strip Detector (SSD) completes the three layers of the
Silicon Vertex Tracker (SVT) to make an inner tracking system located inside
the Time Projection Chamber (TPC). This additional fourth layer provides two
dimensional hit position and energy loss measurements for charged particles,
improving the extrapolation of TPC tracks through SVT hits. To match the high
multiplicity of central Au+Au collisions at RHIC the double sided silicon strip
technology was chosen which makes the SSD a half million channels detector.
Dedicated electronics have been designed for both readout and control. Also a
novel technique of bonding, the Tape Automated Bonding (TAB), was used to
fullfill the large number of bounds to be done. All aspects of the SSD are
shortly described here and test performances of produced detection modules as
well as simulated results on hit reconstruction are given.
