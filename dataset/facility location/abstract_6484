We present the application of a new jet reconstruction algorithm that uses a
Gaussian filter to locate and reconstruct the jet energy to p+p and heavy ion
data from the PHENIX detector. This algorithm is combined with a fake jet
rejection scheme that provides efficient jet reconstruction with an acceptable
fake rate. We show our first results on the measured jet spectra, jet--jet
angular correlation in p+p and Cu+Cu collisions.
