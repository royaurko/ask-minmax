At TeV energies, the gamma-ray horizon of the universe is limited to
redshifts z<<1, and, therefore, any observation of TeV radiation from a source
located beyond z=1 would call for a revision of the standard paradigm. While
robust observational evidence for TeV sources at redshifts z>1 is lacking at
present, the growing number of TeV blazars with redshifts as large as z~0.5
suggests the possibility that the standard blazar models may have to be
reconsidered. We show that TeV gamma rays can be observed even from a source at
z>1, if the observed gamma rays are secondary photons produced in interactions
of high-energy protons originating from the blazar jet and propagating over
cosmological distances almost rectilinearly. This mechanism was initially
proposed as a possible explanation for the TeV gamma rays observed from blazars
with redshifts z~0.2, for which some other explanations were possible. For TeV
gamma-ray radiation detected from a blazar with z>1, this model would provide
the only viable interpretation consistent with conventional physics. It would
also have far-reaching astronomical and cosmological ramifications. In
particular, this interpretation would imply that extragalactic magnetic fields
along the line of sight are very weak, in the range 0.01 < fG < 10 fG, assuming
random fields with a correlation length of 1 Mpc, and that acceleration of E>
0.1 EeV protons in the jets of active galactic nuclei can be very effective.
