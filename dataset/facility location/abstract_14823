We searched for Delta Scuti-type pulsations amongst known and candidate Gamma
Doradus stars. We acquired 270 h of observations and monitored a total of 26
stars. One target, HD 209295, turned out to be a member of both classes of
pulsating star. We classify six of our targets as new bona fide Gamma Doradus
stars, nine more as good Gamma Doradus candidates, and three as ellipsoidal
variables. The remainder comprise one Delta Scuti star and five unexplained
variables.
  We revise the blue border of the Gamma Doradus phenomenon towards cooler
temperatures. This new blue edge extends from a temperature of about 7550 K on
the ZAMS to 7400 K one magnitude above it. Five bona fide Gamma Doradus stars
we observed are located inside the Delta Scuti instability strip, but none of
them exhibited observable Delta Scuti pulsations. We therefore suggest that
Gamma Doradus stars are less likely to be Delta Scuti pulsators compared to
other normal stars in the same region of the lower instability strip. In
addition, we show that there is a clear separation between the pulsation
constants Q of Delta Scuti and Gamma Doradus stars. The Gamma Doradus stars
known to date all have Q>0.23 d.
