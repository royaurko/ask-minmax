The proposed infrared space interferometry mission Darwin has two main aims:
(i) to detect and characterize exo-planets similar to the Earth, and (ii) to
carry out astrophysical imaging in the wavelength range 6 - 20 micron at a
sensitivity similar to JWST, but at an angular resolution up to 100 times
higher. In this contribution we will first briefly discuss the imaging
performance of the Darwin mission. We will then discuss how Darwin will
contribute in a very significant way to our understanding of the formation and
evolution of planets, stars, galaxies, and super-massive black-holes located at
the centers of galaxies.
