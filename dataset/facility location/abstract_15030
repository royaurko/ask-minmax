We present a multiwavelength study of the field containing the unidentified
X-ray source AX J1639.0-4642, discovered with the ASCA observatory and recently
detected with the IBIS telescope, onboard the INTEGRAL satellite, dubbed IGR
J16393-4643. The huge hydrogen column density towards the source, the hard
spectral index in the 0.7-10 keV band and its flux variability suggest that the
source is a High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) enshrouded by dust. Our search
reveals the presence of a non-thermal radio counterpart within the X-ray error
box. After a study of the broadband emission from X-rays to the radio domain,
we propose that AX J1639.0-4642 is a dust-enshrouded Microquasar (MQ)
candidate. In addition, the X-ray source is well within the 95% location
contour of the unidentified gamma-ray source 3EG J1639-4702. The main
properties of AX J1639.0-4642/3EG J1639-4702 are consistent with those of two
other MQs previously proposed to display high-energy gamma-ray emission.
