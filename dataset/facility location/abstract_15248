We present the X-ray afterglow catalog of BeppoSAX from the launch of the
satellite to the end of the mission. Thirty-three X-ray afterglows were
securely identified based on their fading behavior out of 39 observations. We
have extracted the continuum parameters (decay index, spectral index, flux,
absorption) for all available afterglows. We point out a possible correlation
between the X-ray afterglow luminosity and the energy emitted during the prompt
$\gamma$-ray event. We do not detect a significant jet signature within the
afterglows, implying a lower limit on the beaming angle, neither a standard
energy release when X-ray fluxes are corrected for beaming. Our data support
the hypothesis that the burst should be surrounded by an interstellar medium
rather than a wind environment, and that this environment should be dense. This
may be explained by a termination shock located near the burst progenitor. We
finally point out that some dark bursts may be explained by an intrinsic
faintness of the event, while others may be strongly absorbed.
