We collect information as complete as possible about the upcoming telescopes
and facilities relevant to gamma-ray bursts, both in the electromagnetic bands
as well as for non-electromagnetic messengers. We describe the expected synergy
between these new facilities and the SVOM mission and predict possible progress
in the field of gamma-ray bursts over the next years.
