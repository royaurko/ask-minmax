Directional transport properties at the nanoscale remain a challenge
primarily due to issues associated with control over the underlying anisotropy
and scalability to macroscopic scales. In this letter, we develop a facile
approach based on template-guided fluidic assembly of high mobility building
blocks - single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) - to fabricate ultra-thin and
anisotropic SWNT films. A major advancement is the complete control over the
anisotropy in the assembled nanostructure, realized by three-dimensional
engineering of dip-coated SWNT thin films into alternating hydrophilic and
hydrophobic micro-line patterns with prescribed intra/inter-line widths and
line thicknesses. Variations in the contact line profile results in an
evaporation-controlled assembly mechanism that leads to the formation of an
alternating, and more importantly, contiguous SWNT network. Evidently, the
nanoscopic thickness modulations are direct reflections of the substrate
geometry and chemistry. The nanostructured film exhibits significant anisotropy
in their electrical and thermal transport properties as well as optical
transparency, as revealed by characterization studies. The direct interplay
between the anisotropy and the 3D micro-line patterns of the substrate combined
with the wafer-level scalability of the fluidic assembly allows us to tune the
transport properties for a host of nanoelectronic applications.
