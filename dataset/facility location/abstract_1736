The cross section of the pd -> 3He pi+ pi - reaction has been measured at the
MOMO facility in a kinematically complete experiment at a c. m. excess energy
of Q = 70 MeV. The energy and angular distributions show that the reaction is
dominated by p-wave pi+ pi- pairs. This is in complete contrast to the results
of inclusive measurements at somewhat higher energies which show a strong
s-wave ABC enhancement at low pi pi masses. There are however indications of
p-wave pion pairs from other experiments at low Q.
