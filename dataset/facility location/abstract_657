Majorana neutrino electromagnetic properties are studied through neutral
current coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering. We focus on the potential of the
recently planned COHERENT experiment at the Spallation Neutron Source to probe
muon-neutrino magnetic moments. The resulting sensitivities are determined on
the basis of a chi^2 analysis employing realistic nuclear structure
calculations in the context of the quasi-particle random phase approximation.
We find that they can improve existing limits by half an order of magnitude. In
addition, we show that these facilities allow for Standard Model precision
tests in the low energy regime, with a competitive determination of the weak
mixing angle. Finally, they also offer the capability to probe other
electromagnetic neutrino properties, such as the neutrino charge-radius. We
illustrate our results for various choices of experimental setup and target
material.
