We report on the first lattice calculation of the QCD phase transition using
chiral fermions at physical values of the quark masses. This calculation uses
2+1 quark flavors, spatial volumes between (4 fm$)^3$ and (11 fm$)^3$ and
temperatures between 139 and 196 MeV . Each temperature was calculated using a
single lattice spacing corresponding to a temporal Euclidean extent of $N_t=8$.
The disconnected chiral susceptibility, $\chi_{\rm disc}$ shows a pronounced
peak whose position and height depend sensitively on the quark mass. We find no
metastability in the region of the peak and a peak height which does not change
when a 5 fm spatial extent is increased to 10 fm. Each result is strong
evidence that the QCD ``phase transition'' is not first order but a continuous
cross-over for $m_\pi=135$ MeV. The peak location determines a pseudo-critical
temperature $T_c = 155(1)(8)$ MeV. Chiral $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ symmetry is
fully restored above 164 MeV, but anomalous $U(1)_A$ symmetry breaking is
non-zero above $T_c$ and vanishes as $T$ is increased to 196 MeV.
