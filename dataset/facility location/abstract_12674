We explore the anisotropic nature of Feshbach resonances in the collision
between ultracold magnetic submerged-shell dysprosium atoms, which can only
occur due to couplings to rotating bound states. This is in contrast to
well-studied alkali-metal atom collisions, where most Feshbach resonances are
hyperfine induced and due to rotation-less bound states. Our novel
first-principle coupled-channel calculation of the collisions between
open-4f-shell spin-polarized bosonic dysprosium reveals a striking correlation
between the anisotropy due to magnetic dipole-dipole and electrostatic
interactions and the Feshbach spectrum as a function of an external magnetic
field. Over a 20 mT magnetic field range we predict about a dozen Feshbach
resonances and show that the resonance locations are exquisitely sensitive to
the dysprosium isotope.
