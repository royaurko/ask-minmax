Recent progress in the design and fabrication of artificial two-dimensional
(2D) materials paves the way for the experimental realization of electron
systems moving on plane fractals. In this work, we present the results of
computer simulations for the conductance and optical absorption spectrum of a
2D electron gas roaming on a Sierpinski carpet, i.e. a plane fractal with
Hausdorff dimension intermediate between one and two. We find that the
conductance is sensitive to the spatial location of the leads and that it
displays fractal fluctuations whose dimension is compatible with the Hausdorff
dimension of the sample. Very interestingly, electrons in this fractal display
a broadband optical absorption spectrum, which possesses sharp "molecular"
peaks at low photon energies.
