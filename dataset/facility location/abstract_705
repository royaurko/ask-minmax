STACEE is a proposed atmospheric Cherenkov telescope for ground-based
gamma-ray astrophysics between 25 and 500 GeV. The telescope will make use of
the large solar mirrors (heliostats) available at a solar research facility to
achieve an energy threshold lower than any existing ground-based instrument.
This paper describes the development of STACEE, including an overview of the
complete instrument design and a discussion of results from recent prototype
tests at the large solar heliostat field of Sandia National Laboratories.
