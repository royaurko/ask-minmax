We present statistical and monitoring results of narrow absorption lines that
are physically related to quasars (i.e., intrinsic NALs). We use Keck/HIRES
spectra of 37 optically bright quasars at z=2-4, and identify 150 NAL systems
that contain 124 C IV, 12 N V, and 50 Si IV doublets. Among them, 39 are
classified as intrinsic systems based on partial coverage analysis. At least
50% of quasars host intrinsic NALs. We identify two families of intrinsic
systems based on their ionization state. Some intrinsic systems have detectable
low-ionization NALs at similar velocities as higher-ionization NALs, although
such low-ionization lines are rare in broad absorption line (BAL) systems. We
also have observed an optically bright quasar, HS1603+3820, eight times with
Subaru/HDS and HET/MRS over an interval of 4.2 years (1.2 years in the quasar
rest frame), for the purpose of monitoring a variable C IV mini-BAL system. We
find that all the troughs of the system vary in concert. However, no other
correlations are seen between the variations of different profile parameters.
We propose that the observed variations are either (i) a result of rapid
continuum fluctuations, caused by a clumpy screen of variable optical depth
located between the continuum source and the mini-BAL gas, or (ii) a result of
variable scattering of continuum photons around the absorber.
