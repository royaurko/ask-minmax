The Seyfert 2 galaxies NGC 2992 and NGC 3081 have been observed by INTEGRAL
and Swift. We report about the results and the comparison of the spectrum above
10 keV based on INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI, Swift/BAT, and BeppoSAX/PDS. A spectrum
can be extracted in the X-ray energy band ranging from 1 keV up to 200 keV.
Although NGC 2992 shows a complex spectrum below 10 keV, the hard tail observed
by various missions exhibits a slope with photon index = 2, independent on the
flux level during the observation. No cut-off is detectable up to the detection
limit around 200 keV. In addition, NGC 3081 is detected in the INTEGRAL and
Swift observation and also shows an unbroken Gamma = 1.8 spectrum up to 150
keV. These two Seyfert galaxies give further evidence that a high-energy
cut-off in the hard X-ray spectra is often located at energies E_C >> 100 keV.
In NGC 2992 a constant spectral shape is observed over a hard X-ray luminosity
variation by a factor of 11. This might indicate that the physical conditions
of the emitting hot plasma are constant, while the amount of plasma varies, due
to long-term flaring activity.
