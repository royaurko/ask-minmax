Sgr A East is a supernova remnant located within few parsecs from the
Galactic Centre (GC). There are good reasons to believe that this object is the
source of the gamma-ray excess detected by HESS in the direction of the GC
meaning that Sgr A East is likely to be an efficient Cosmic Ray accelerator.
Some observations suggest that strong magnetic fields may be present in that
region allowing the acceleration of composite nuclei in Sgr A East beyond the
EeV. We show that, if this is case, EeV neutrons should be effectively produced
by the photo-disintegration of Ultra High Energy nuclei onto the IR photon
background (with temperature $\sim 40$ K) in which Sgr A East is embedded.
  Neutrons with such an energy can reach the Earth before decaying and may be
detectable under the form of a CR point-like excess in the direction of the GC.
  We determine the expected energy spectrum and the amplitude of this signal
showing that it may be measurable by the AUGER observatory.
