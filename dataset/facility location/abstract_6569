This document describes the Gloss infrastructure supporting implementation of
location-aware services. The document is in two parts. The first part describes
software architecture for the smart space. As described in D8, a local
architecture provides a framework for constructing Gloss applications, termed
assemblies, that run on individual physical nodes, whereas a global
architecture defines an overlay network for linking individual assemblies. The
second part outlines the hardware installation for local sensing. This
describes the first phase of the installation in Strathclyde University.
