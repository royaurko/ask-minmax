The insertion of solvent particles in molecular dynamics simulations of
complex fluids is required in many situations involving open systems, but this
challenging task has been scarcely explored in the literature. We propose a
simple and fast algorithm (USHER) that inserts the new solvent particles at
locations where the potential energy has the desired prespecified value. For
instance, this value may be set equal to the system's excess energy per
particle, in such way that the inserted particles are energetically
indistinguishable from the other particles present. During the search for the
insertion site, the USHER algorithm uses a steepest descent iterator with a
displacement whose magnitude is adapted to the local features of the energy
landscape. The only adjustable parameter in the algorithm is the maximum
displacement and we show that its optimal value can be extracted from an
analysis of the structure of the potential energy landscape. We present
insertion tests in periodic and non-periodic systems filled with a
Lennard-Jones fluid whose density ranges from moderate values to high values.
