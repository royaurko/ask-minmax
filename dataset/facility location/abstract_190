Identifying locations of occupants is beneficial to energy management in
buildings. A key observation in indoor environment is that distinct functional
areas are typically controlled by separate HVAC and lighting systems and room
level localization is sufficient to provide a powerful tool for energy usage
reduction by occupancy-based actuation of the building facilities. Based upon
this observation, this paper focuses on identifying the room where a person or
a mobile device is physically present. Existing room localization methods,
however, require special infrastructure to annotate rooms.
  SoundLoc is a room-level localization system that exploits the intrinsic
acoustic properties of individual rooms and obviates the needs for
infrastructures. As we show in the study, rooms' acoustic properties can be
characterized by Room Impulse Response (RIR). Nevertheless, obtaining precise
RIRs is a time-consuming and expensive process. The main contributions of our
work are the following. First, a cost-effective RIR measurement system is
implemented and the Noise Adaptive Extraction of Reverberation (NAER) algorithm
is developed to estimate room acoustic parameters in noisy conditions. Second,
a comprehensive physical and statistical analysis of features extracted from
RIRs is performed. Also, SoundLoc is evaluated using the dataset consisting of
ten (10) different rooms. The overall accuracy of 97.8% achieved demonstrates
the potential to be integrated into automatic mapping of building space.
