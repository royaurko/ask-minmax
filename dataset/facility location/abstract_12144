We present a new approach for simulating the atmospheric dynamics of the
close-in giant planet HD209458b that allows for the decoupling of radiative and
thermal energies, direct stellar heating of the interior, and the solution of
the full 3D Navier Stokes equations. Simulations reveal two distinct
temperature inversions (increasing temperature with decreasing pressure) at the
sub-stellar point due to the combined effects of opacity and dynamical flow
structure and exhibit instabilities leading to changing velocities and
temperatures on the nightside for a range of viscosities. Imposed on the
quasi-static background, temperature variations of up to 15% are seen near the
terminators and the location of the coldest spot is seen to vary by more than
20 degrees, occasionally appearing west of the anti-solar point. Our new
approach introduces four major improvements to our previous methods including
simultaneously solving both the thermal energy and radiative equations in both
the optical and infrared, incorporating updated opacities, including a more
accurate treatment of stellar energy deposition that incorporates the opacity
relevant for higher energy stellar photons, and the addition of explicit
turbulent viscosity.
