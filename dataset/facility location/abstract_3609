An important goal for any advanced X-ray FEL is an option for providing
Fourier-limited X-ray pulses. In this way, no monochromator is needed in the
experimental hall. Self-seeding is a promising approach to significantly narrow
the SASE bandwidth to produce nearly transform-limited pulses. These are
important for many experiments including 3D diffraction imaging. We discuss the
implementation of a single-crystal self-seeding scheme in the hard X-ray lines
of the European XFEL. For this facility, transform-limited pulses are
particularly valuable since they naturally support the extraction of more FEL
power than at saturation by exploiting tapering in the tunable-gap baseline
undulators. Tapering consists of a stepwise change of the undulator gap from
segment to segment. Based on start-to-end simulations dealing with the
up-to-date parameters of the European XFEL, we show that the FEL power reaches
about 400 GW, or one order of magnitude higher power than the SASE saturation
level (20 GW). This analysis indicates that our self-seeding scheme is not
significantly affected by non-ideal electron phase-space distribution, and
yields about the same performance as in the case for an electron beam with
ideal parameters. The self-seeding scheme with a single crystal monochromator
is extremely compact (about 5 m long), and cost estimations are low enough to
consider adding it to the European XFEL capabilities from the very beginning of
the operation phase.
