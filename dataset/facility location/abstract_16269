Context: Hierarchal models of large scale structure (LSS) formation predict
that galaxy clusters grow via gravitational infall and mergers of (smaller)
mass concentrations, such as clusters and galaxy groups. Diffuse radio
emission, in the form of radio halos and relics, is found in clusters
undergoing a merger, indicating that shocks or turbulence associated with the
merger are capable of accelerating electrons to highly relativistic energies.
Here we report on radio observations of ZwCl 2341.1+0000, a complex merging
structure of galaxies located at z=0.27, using Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope
(GMRT) observations.
  Aims: The main aim of the observations is to study the nature of the diffuse
radio emission in the galaxy cluster ZwCl 2341.1+0000.
  Methods: We have carried out GMRT 610, 241, and 157 MHz continuum
observations of ZwCl 2341.1+0000. The radio observations are combined with
X-ray and optical data of the cluster.
  Results: The GMRT observations show the presence of a double peripheral radio
relic in the cluster ZwCl 2341.1+0000. The spectral index is -0.49 \pm 0.18 for
the northern relic and -0.76 \pm 0.17 for the southern relic respectively. We
have derived values of 0.48-0.93 microGauss for the equipartition magnetic
field strength. The relics are probably associated with an outwards traveling
merger shock waves.
