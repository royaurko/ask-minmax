Locational marginal pricing (LMP) is a widely employed method for pricing
electricity in the wholesale electricity market. Although it is well known that
the LMP mechanism is vulnerable to market manipulation, there is little
literature providing a systematic analysis of this phenomenon. In the first
part of this paper, we investigate the economic dispatch outcomes of the LMP
mechanism with strategic agents. We show via counterexamples, that contrary to
popular belief, a Nash equilibrium may not exist. And when it exists, the price
of anarchy may be arbitrarily large. We then provide two sufficient conditions
under either of which an efficient Nash equilibria exists. Last, we propose a
new market mechanism for electricity markets, the Power Network Second Price
(PNSP) mechanism that always induces an efficient Nash equilibrium. We briefly
address the extensions on the demand side.
