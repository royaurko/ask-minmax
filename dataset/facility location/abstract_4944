It was decided in May 2012 that the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will be
built in Africa and Australia, two Southern Hemisphere continents. Here we
discuss the plan for SKA design and construction, and how New Zealand radio
astronomers can participate in this project and contribute to astronomy and
astrophysics research. Geodesy and the study of tectonic plate motion is
another important area of research for New Zealand radio astronomy to
contribute to. As New Zealand is located at the boundary between two colliding
tectonic plates (Australian and Pacific) and most of geological activity in New
Zealand originates from their motion, it is important to monitor the relative
plate motion with high precision using both GPS and radio astronomical
techniques. We discuss radio frequency interference (RFI) as a limiting factor
for radio astronomy, and provide results of RFI measurements in different
locations in New Zealand.
