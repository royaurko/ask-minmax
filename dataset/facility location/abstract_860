We study inclusive omega photoproduction in nuclei and propose a measurement
of the nuclear transparency ratio as a means to learn about the in-medium
properties of the omega meson. To this end we are using the semi-classical
coupled-channel BUU transport approach that allows for a consistent treatment
of all nuclear effects. The conditions of our calculations are chosen such as
to match the setup of existing experimental facilities at ELSA or MAMI C. We
show that the observables (total production cross section and transparency)
indeed are sensitive to the omega N interaction in the nuclear medium.
