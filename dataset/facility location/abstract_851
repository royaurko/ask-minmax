We investigate $\phi$ meson electroproduction to probe the hidden strangeness
content of the nucleon. We found that even a small amount of the $s\bar{s}$
admixture in the nucleon wavefunction can lead to a significant change in
several double polarization asymmetries in $\phi$ electroproduction, which can
be tested experimentally at current electron facilities.
