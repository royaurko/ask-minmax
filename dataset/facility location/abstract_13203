We consider the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state with an angle
dependent-gap (ADG) for the arbitrary angle \theta_0 between the direction of
the Cooper pair momentum and the symmetry axis of the ADG in asymmetric nuclear
matter. We find two kinds of locally stable states, i.e., the
FFLO-ADG-orthogonal and FFLO-ADG-parallel states, which correspond to
\theta_0=\pi/2 and \theta_0=0, respectively. Furthermore,
the-FFLO-ADG-orthogonal state is located at small asymmetry, whereas the
FFLO-ADG-parallel state is favored for large asymmetry. The critical isospin
asymmetry \alpha_c, where the superfluid vanishes, is enhanced largely by
considering the Cooper pair momentum with an ADG.
