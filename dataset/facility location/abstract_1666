The phenomenon of CP violation and strategies for extracting the angles of
the unitarity triangle are reviewed. Special emphasis is given to the B-meson
system, as it plays an outstanding role to test the Standard Model description
of CP violation at future experimental B-physics facilities. Both general
aspects and recent developments are discussed. It is pointed out that combined
branching ratios for $B_{u,d}\to\pi K$ modes, which have been observed recently
by the CLEO collaboration, and untagged $B_s\to K\bar{K}$ decays may allow us
to derive interesting constraints on the CKM angle $\gamma$ and may eventually
lead to a solid determination of this angle.
