The foundational theory of differentiation was developed as part of the
original release of ACL2(r). In work reported at the last ACL2 Workshop, we
presented theorems justifying the usual differentiation rules, including the
chain rule and the derivative of inverse functions. However, the process of
applying these theorems to formalize the derivative of a particular function is
completely manual. More recently, we developed a macro and supporting functions
that can automate this process. This macro uses the ACL2 table facility to keep
track of functions and their derivatives, and it also interacts with the macro
that introduces inverse functions in ACL2(r), so that their derivatives can
also be automated. In this paper, we present the implementation of this macro
and related functions.
