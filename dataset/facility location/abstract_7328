We derive factorization relations for the transverse helicity amplitudes in
the rare decays B-> K\pi l+l- at leading order in Lambda/m_b, in the
kinematical region with an energetic kaon and a soft pion. We identify and
compute a new contribution of leading order in Lambda/m_b to the B->K\pi l+l-
amplitude, which is not present in the one-body decay B-> K*l+l-. As an
application we study the forward-backward asymmetry (FBA) of the lepton
momentum angular distribution in B-> K\pi l+l- decays away from the K*
resonance. The FBA in these decays has a zero at q0^2 = q0^2(M_{Kpi}), which
can be used, in principle, for determining the Wilson coefficients C_{7,9} and
testing the Standard Model. We point out that the slope of the q0^2(M_{Kpi}^2)
curve contains the same information about the Wilson coefficients as the
location of the zero, but is less sensitive to unknown nonperturbative
dynamics. We estimate the location of the zero at leading order in
factorization, and using a resonant model for the B -> K\pi l+l-
nonfactorizable amplitude.
