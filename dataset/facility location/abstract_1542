We present first and preliminary submillimeter continuum images of the
Galactic Center region obtained with the new Caltech Submillimeter Observatory
facility camera SHARC II. The instrument allows 350 micron observations with
unprecedented sensitivity and instantaneous spatial coverage. The stability of
the SHARC II detectors combined with the large number of available pixels
allows a non-differential scanning mode that does not require the observation
of a reference off-source position. Here we present large-scale 350 micron dust
continuum images from the Sgr A and Sgr C regions, as well as the detection of
sub-mm dust continuum emission from the IRAS 25 micron source AFGL5376. This
source is produced in a large-scale shock that extends well above the Galactic
plane.
