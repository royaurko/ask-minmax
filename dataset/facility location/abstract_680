In this short note we will provide a sufficient and necessary condition to
have uniqueness of the location of the maximum of a stochastic process over an
interval. The result will also express the mean value of the location in terms
of the derivative of the expectation of the maximum of a linear perturbation of
the underlying process. As an application, we will consider a Brownian motion
with variable drift. The ideas behind the method of proof will also be useful
to study the location of the maximum, over the real line, of a two-sided
Brownian motion minus a parabola and of a stationary process minus a parabola.
