Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) divide into two classes: "long", which typically have
initial durations of T90>2s, and "short", with durations of T90<2s (where T90
is the time to detect 90% of the observed fluence). Long bursts, which on
average have softer gamma-ray spectra, are known to be associated with with
stellar core-collapse events-- in some cases simultaneously producing powerful
Type Ic supernovae. In contrast, the origin of short bursts has remained
mysterious until recently. A subsecond intense "spike" of gamma-rays during a
giant flare from the Galactic soft gamma-ray repeater, SGR 1806-20, reopened an
old debate over whether some short GRBs could be similar events seen in
galaxies out to ~70Mpc (redshift z=0.016). Shortly after that, localizations of
a few short GRBs (with optical afterglows detected in two cases) have shown an
apparent association with a variety of host galaxies at moderate redshifts.
Here we report a correlation between the locations of previously observed short
bursts and the positions of galaxies in the local Universe, indicating that
between 10 and 25 per cent of short GRBs originate at low redshifts (z<0.025).
