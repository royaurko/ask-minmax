The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) is designed to enhance the scientific
return from Fermi in studying gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In its first two years
of operation GBM triggered on 491 GRBs. We summarize the criteria used for
triggering and quantify the general characteristics of the triggered GRBs,
including their locations, durations, peak flux, and fluence. This catalog is
an official product of the Fermi GBM science team, and the data files
containing the complete results are available from the High-Energy Astrophysics
Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC).
