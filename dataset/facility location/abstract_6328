There is accumulating evidence in lattice QCD that attempts to locate
confining fields in vacuum configurations bring results explicitly depending on
tha lattice spacing (that is, ultraviolet cut off). Generically, one deals with
low-dimensional vacuum defects which occupy a vanishing fraction of the total
four-dimensional space. We review briefly existing data on the vacuum defects
and their significance for confinement and other nonperturbative phenomena. We
introduce the notion of `quantum numbers' of the defects and draw an analogy,
rather formal one, to developments which took place about 50 years ago and were
triggered by creation of the Sakata model.
