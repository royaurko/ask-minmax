Since January 1, 2005 we have launched "OPTO" Portal, a website dedicated to
optical communities in Indonesia. The address of this portal is
http://www.opto.lipi.go.id and is self-supporting managed and not for
commercial purposes. Our aims in launching this portal are to benefit Internet
facility in increasing the communities' scientific activity; to provide an
online reference in Indonesian language for optics-based science and technology
subjects; as well as to pioneer the communities' online activities with real
impacts and benefits for our society. We will describe in the paper the
features of this portal that can be utilized by all individuals or members of
optical communities to store and share information and to build networks or
partnership as well. We realized that this portal is still not popular and most
of our aims are still not reached. This conference should be a good place for
all of us to collaborate to properly utilize this portal for the advantages to
the optical communities in Indonesia and our society at large.
