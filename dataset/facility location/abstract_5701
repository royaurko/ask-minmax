I discuss the spectral features of pi-0 decay gamma-radiation from
clouds/targets located in proximity of relatively young proton accelerators,
and speculate that such ``accelerator+target'' systems in our Galaxy can be
responsible for a subset of unidentified EGRET sources. Also, I argue that the
recent observations of high energy gamma-rays from the Orion complex contain
evidence that the level of the ``sea'' of galactic cosmic rays may differ
significantly from the flux and the spectrum of local (directly detected)
particles.
