This article introduces an adaptive sorting algorithm that can relocate
elements accurately by substituting their values into a function which we name
it the guessing function. We focus on building this function which is the
mapping relationship between record values and their corresponding sorted
locations essentially. The time complexity of this algorithm O(n),when records
distributed uniformly. Additionally, similar approach can be used in the
searching algorithm.
