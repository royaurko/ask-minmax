We have modeled irradiated planets located near a dM5 and a G2 primary star.
The impinging radiation field was explicitly included in the solution of the
radiative transfer equation and in the computation of the atmospheric
structure. We find that large errors in both the thermal and reflected flux
will result from models which do not include the impinging radiation in a
self-consistent manner. A cool (teff = 500K) and a hot (teff = 1000K) planet
were modeled at various orbital separations from both the dM5 and the G2
primary. In all scenarios, we compared the effects of the irradiation in two
extreme cases: one where dust clouds form and remain suspended in the
atmosphere, and another where dust clouds form but completely settle out of the
atmosphere. The atmospheric structure and emergent spectrum strongly depend on
the presence or absence of dust clouds. We find that, in the absence of dust
opacity, the impinging radiation significantly alters the innermost layers of
an EGP atmosphere and that they are actually brighter in the optical than dusty
planets. Our models also indicate that the planet-to-star brightness ratio in
the optical will be less that 1 x 10^-5 for objects like tau bootis which is
consistent with recently reported upper limit values.
