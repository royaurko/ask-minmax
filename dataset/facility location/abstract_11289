We present Zeeman-Doppler images of the active K2 star II Peg for the years
2004 and 2007. The surface magnetic field was reconstructed with our new ZDI
code "iMap" which provides a full polarized radiative transfer driven inversion
to simultaneously reconstruct the surface temperature and magnetic vector field
distribution. II Peg shows a remarkable large scale magnetic field structure
for both years. The magnetic field is predominantly located at high latitudes
and is arranged in active longitudes. A dramatic evolution in the magnetic
field structure is visible for the two years, where a dominant and largely
unipolar field in 2004 has developed into two distinct and large scale bipolar
structures in 2007.
