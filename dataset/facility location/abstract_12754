We identify open charm effects in a direct production process $e^+e^-\to
J/\psi \pi^0$. A unique feature of this process is that the $D\bar{D}^*+c.c.$
threshold is located at a relatively isolated energy region, i.e. $\sim 3.876 \
\mathrm{GeV}$, which is far away from the well-established charmonia
$\psi(3770)$ and $\psi(4040)$. Therefore, the cross section line-shape of this
reaction provides an opportunity for singling out the open charm effects. A
model-independent narrow enhancement between the thresholds of
$D^0\bar{D}^{*0}+c.c.$ and $D^+D^{*-}+c.c.$ is predicted. This study can also
help understand the X(3900) enhancement recently observed by the Belle and
BaBar Collaboration in $e^+e^-\to D\bar{D}+c.c.$ We also show that the open
charm effects play a crucial role for our understanding of the long-standing
"$\rho\pi$ puzzle".
