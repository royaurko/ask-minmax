Using the integrable spin chain picture we study the one-loop anomalous
dimension of certain single trace scalar operators of N=4 SYM expected to
correspond to semi-classical string states on AdS_5 x S^5 with three large
angular momenta (J_1,J_2,J_3) on S^5. In particular, we investigate the
analyticity structure encoded in the Bethe equations for various distributions
of Bethe roots. In a certain region of the parameter space our operators reduce
to the gauge theory duals of the folded string with two large angular momenta
and in another region to the duals of the circular string with angular momentum
assignment (J,J',J'), J>J'. In between we locate a critical line. We propose
that the operators above the critical line are the gauge theory duals of the
circular elliptic string with three different spins and support this by a
perturbative calculation.
