We report on the discovery of a substellar companion or a massive Jupiter
orbiting the G5V star HD16760 with the spectrograph SOPHIE installed on the OHP
1.93-m telescope. Characteristics and performances of the spectrograph are
presented, as well as the SOPHIE exoplanet consortium program. With a minimum
mass of 14.3 Mjup, an orbital period of 465 days and an eccentricity of 0.067,
HD16760b seems to be located just at the end of the mass distribution of giant
planets, close to planet/brown-dwarf transition. Its quite circular orbit
supports a formation in a gaseous protoplanetary disk.
