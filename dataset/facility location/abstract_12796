Many qualitative observations on the glass transition in classical fluids are
well described by the mode coupling theory (MCT) but the extent of the
non-ergodicity domain is often over-estimated by this theory. Making it more
quantitative while preserving its microscopic nature remains thus a current
challenge. We propose here a simple heuristic modification that achieves this
for the long-time limit quantities by reducing the excess of static
correlations that are presumably responsible for its inaccuracy. The location
of the ideal glass transition predicted from this modified MCT compares very
well with simulation for a wide range of interaction potentials in pure fluids
and in mixtures.
