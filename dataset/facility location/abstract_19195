We report the first detection of asymmetry in a supernova (SN) photosphere
based on SN light echo (LE) spectra of Cas A from the different perspectives of
dust concentrations on its LE ellipsoid. New LEs are reported based on
difference images, and optical spectra of these LEs are analyzed and compared.
After properly accounting for the effects of finite dust-filament extent and
inclination, we find one field where the He I and H alpha features are
blueshifted by an additional ~4000 km/s relative to other spectra and to the
spectra of the Type IIb SN 1993J. That same direction does not show any shift
relative to other Cas A LE spectra in the Ca II near-infrared triplet feature.
We compare the perspectives of the Cas A LE dust concentrations with recent
three-dimensional modeling of the SN remnant (SNR) and note that the location
having the blueshifted He I and H alpha features is roughly in the direction of
an Fe-rich outflow and in the opposite direction of the motion of the compact
object at the center of the SNR. We conclude that Cas A was an intrinsically
asymmetric SN. Future LE spectroscopy of this object, and of other historical
SNe, will provide additional insight into the connection of explosion mechanism
to SN to SNR, as well as give crucial observational evidence regarding how
stars explode.
