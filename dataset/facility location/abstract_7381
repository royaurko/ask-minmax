Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a novel modality of magnetic resonance
imaging that allows noninvasive mapping of the brain's white matter. A
particular map derived from DTI measurements is a map of water principal
diffusion directions, which are proxies for neural fiber directions. We
consider a study in which diffusion direction maps were acquired for two groups
of subjects. The objective of the analysis is to find regions of the brain in
which the corresponding diffusion directions differ between the groups. This is
attained by first computing a test statistic for the difference in direction at
every brain location using a Watson model for directional data. Interesting
locations are subsequently selected with control of the false discovery rate.
More accurate modeling of the null distribution is obtained using an empirical
null density based on the empirical distribution of the test statistics across
the brain. Further, substantial improvements in power are achieved by local
spatial averaging of the test statistic map. Although the focus is on one
particular study and imaging technology, the proposed inference methods can be
applied to other large scale simultaneous hypothesis testing problems with a
continuous underlying spatial structure.
