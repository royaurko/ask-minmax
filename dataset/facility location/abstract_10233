Spectacular processes in astrophysical sites produce high-energy cosmic rays
which are further accelerated by Fermi-shocks into a power-law spectrum. These,
in passing through radiation fields and matter, produce neutrinos. Neutrino
telescopes are designed with large detection volumes to observe such
astrophysical sources. A large volume is necessary because the fluxes and
cross-sections are small. We estimate various telescopes' sensitivities and
expected event rates from astrophysical sources of high-energy neutrinos. We
find that an ideal detector of km^2 incident area can be sensitive to a flux of
neutrinos integrated over energy from 10^5 and 10^{7} GeV as low as 1.3 *
10^(-8) * E^(-2) (GeV/cm^2 s sr) which is three times smaller than the
Waxman-Bachall conservative upper limit on potential neutrino flux. A real
detector will have degraded performance. Detection from known point sources is
possible but unlikely unless there is prior knowledge of the source location
and neutrino arrival time.
