We compare a number of methods used to locate resonances. These include the
speed plot, the time-delay method of Eisenbud and Wigner, the time-delay matrix
of Smith, and a modification by Ohmura. Numerical results show a consistency
not previously reported. One time delay method gives the most consistent
results, supporting the conclusions of a recent theoretical study.
