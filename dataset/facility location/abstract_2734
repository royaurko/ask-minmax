A large-area and light-weight Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detector was
built at the University of Virginia as a prototype for the detector R$\&$D
program of the future Electron Ion Collider. The prototype has a trapezoidal
geometry designed as a generic sector module in a disk layer configuration of a
forward tracker in collider detectors. It is based on light-weight material and
narrow support frames in order to minimize multiple scattering and
dead-to-sensitive area ratio. The chamber has a novel type of two dimensional
(2D) stereo-angle readout board with U-V strips that provides (r,$\varphi$)
position information in the cylindrical coordinate system of a collider
environment. The prototype was tested at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility in
October 2013 and the analysis of the test beam data demonstrates an excellent
response uniformity of the large area chamber with an efficiency higher than
95%. An angular resolution of 60 $\mu$rad in the azimuthal direction and a
position resolution better than 550 $\mu$m in the radial direction were
achieved with the U-V strip readout board. The results are discussed in this
paper.
