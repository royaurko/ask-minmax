A computer-aided detection (CADe) system for microcalcification cluster
identification in mammograms has been developed in the framework of the
EU-founded MammoGrid project. The CADe software is mainly based on wavelet
transforms and artificial neural networks. It is able to identify
microcalcifications in different datasets of mammograms (i.e. acquired with
different machines and settings, digitized with different pitch and bit depth
or direct digital ones). The CADe can be remotely run from GRID-connected
acquisition and annotation stations, supporting clinicians from geographically
distant locations in the interpretation of mammographic data. We report and
discuss the system performances on different datasets of mammograms and the
status of the GRID-enabled CADe analysis.
