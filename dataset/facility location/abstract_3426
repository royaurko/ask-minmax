At the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) at KEK intrabeam scattering (IBS) is a
strong effect for an electron machine. It is an effect that couples all
dimensions of the beam, and in April 2000, over a short period of time, all
dimensions were measured as functions of current. In this report we derive a
simple relation for the growth rates of emittances due to IBS. We apply the
theories of Bjorken-Mtingwa, Piwinski, and a formula due to Raubenheimer to the
ATF parameters, and find that the results all agree (if in Piwinski's formalism
we replace the dispersion squared over beta by the dispersion invariant).
Finally, we compare theory, including the effect of potential well bunch
lengthening, with the April 2000 measurements, and find reasonably good
agreement in the energy spread and horizontal emittance dependence on current.
The vertical emittance measurement, however, implies that either: there is
error in the measurement (equivalent to an introduction of 0.6% x-y coupling
error), or the effect of intrabeam scattering is stronger than predicted (35%
stronger in growth rates).
