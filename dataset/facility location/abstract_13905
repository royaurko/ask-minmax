The combined considerations of both the bulk liquid-drop-type behavior and
the quantized aligned rotation with cranked Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach
revealed previously that even-even, N=Z, toroidal high-spin isomeric states
have general occurrences for light nuclei with A between 28 and 52. We find
that in this mass region there are in addition N not equal to Z toroidal
high-spin isomers when the single-particle shells for neutrons and protons
occur at the same cranked frequency $\hbar \omega$. Examples of N not equal to
Z toroidal high-spin isomers, $^{36}_{16}$S$_{20}$($I$=74$\hbar$) and
$^{40}_{18}$Ar$_{22}$($I$=80,102$\hbar$), are located and examined. The
systematic properties of these N not equal to Z toroidal high-spin isomers fall
into the same regular (muti-particle)-(muti-hole) patterns as other N=Z
toroidal high-spin isomers.
