Metastasis is the process by which cells from a primary tumor disperse and
form new tumors at distant anatomical locations. The treatment and prevention
of metastatic cancer remains an extremely challenging problem. This work
introduces a novel biologically motivated objective function to the radiation
optimization community that takes into account metastatic risk instead of the
status of the primary tumor. In this work, we consider the problem of
developing fractionated irradiation schedules that minimize production of
metastatic cancer cells while keeping normal tissue damage below an acceptable
level. A dynamic programming framework is utilized to determine the optimal
fractionation scheme. We evaluated our approach on a breast cancer case using
the heart and the lung as organs-at-risk (OAR). For small tumor $\alpha/\beta$
values, hypo-fractionated schedules were optimal, which is consistent with
standard models. However, for relatively larger $\alpha/\beta$ values, we found
the type of schedule depended on various parameters such as the time when
metastatic risk was evaluated, the $\alpha/\beta$ values of the OARs, and the
normal tissue sparing factors. Interestingly, in contrast to standard models,
hypo-fractionated and semi-hypo-fractionated schedules (large initial doses
with doses tapering off with time) were suggested even with large tumor
$\alpha$/$\beta$ values. Numerical results indicate potential for significant
reduction in metastatic risk.
