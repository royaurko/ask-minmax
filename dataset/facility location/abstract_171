Heavy ion collisions in the low energy run at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(RHIC) and future Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) in Germany
are expected to produce a quark-gluon plasma that has a finite baryon chemical
potential, allowing thus the possibility to study the location of the critical
endpoint in the QCD phase diagram. In this talk, using a multiphase transport
model, that includes interactions in both initial partonic and final hadronic
matters and the transition between these two phases of matter, we discuss the
effects of partonic interactions on observables such as the elliptic flow that
have played essential roles in studying the properties of the net baryon free
quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions at higher energies at RHIC.
Also, we study the effect of density fluctuations due to a first-order
transition between the quark-gluon plasma and hadronic matter on fluctuations
of hadron mean transverse momentum and produced deuteron number as well as on
two-pion correlations. We further discuss the possibility of studying the
mechanism of charm energy loss in the baryon-rich quark-gluon plasma and the
properties of phi mesons in hot-dense matter produced in these collisions.
