Technique: We present a method to determine the pressure at which significant
cloud opacity is present between 2 and 6 bars on Jupiter. We use: a) the
strength of a Fraunhofer absorption line in a zone to determine the ratio of
reflected sunlight to thermal emission, and b) pressure-broadened line profiles
of deuterated methane (CH3D) at 4.66 microns to determine the location of
clouds. We use radiative transfer models to constrain the altitude region of
both the solar and thermal components of Jupiter's 5-micron spectrum. Results:
For nearly all latitudes on Jupiter the thermal component is large enough to
constrain the deep cloud structure even when upper clouds are present. We find
that Hot Spots, belts, and high latitudes have broader line profiles than do
zones. Radiative transfer models show that Hot Spots in the North and South
Equatorial Belts (NEB, SEB) typically do not have opaque clouds at pressures
greater than 2 bars. The South Tropical Zone (STZ) at 32 degrees S has an
opaque cloud top between 4 and 5 bars. From thermochemical models this must be
a water cloud. We measured the variation of the equivalent width of CH3D with
latitude for comparison with Jupiter's belt-zone structure. We also constrained
the vertical profile of water in an SEB Hot Spot and in the STZ. The Hot Spot
is very dry for P<4.5 bars and then follows the water profile observed by the
Galileo Probe. The STZ has a saturated water profile above its cloud top
between 4 and 5 bars.
