The uniaxial structure of Si and Ge (001) facets leads to nontrivial
topological properties of steps and hence to interesting equilibrium phase
transitions. The disordered flat phase and the preroughening transition can be
stabilized without the need for step-step interactions. A model describing this
is studied numerically by transfer matrix type finite-size-scaling of interface
free energies. Its phase diagram contains a flat, rough, and disordered flat
phase, separated by roughening and preroughening transition lines. Our estimate
for the location of the multicritical point where the preroughening line merges
with the roughening line, predicts that Si and Ge (001) undergo preroughening
induced simultaneous deconstruction transitions.
