Multimedia educational resources play an important role in education,
particularly for distance learning environments. With the rapid growth of the
multimedia web, large numbers of education articles video resources are
increasingly being created by several different organizations. It is crucial to
explore, share, reuse, and link these educational resources for better
e-learning experiences. Most of the video resources are currently annotated in
an isolated way, which means that they lack semantic connections. Thus,
providing the facilities for annotating these video resources is highly
demanded. These facilities create the semantic connections among video
resources and allow their metadata to be understood globally. Adopting Linked
Data technology, this paper introduces a video annotation and browser platform
with two online tools: Notitia and Sansu-Wolke. Notitia enables users to
semantically annotate video resources using vocabularies defined in the Linked
Data cloud. Sansu-Wolke allows users to browse semantically linked educational
video resources with enhanced web information from different online resources.
In the prototype development, the platform uses existing video resources for
education articles. The result of the initial development demonstrates the
benefits of applying Linked Data technology in the aspects of reusability,
scalability, and extensibility
