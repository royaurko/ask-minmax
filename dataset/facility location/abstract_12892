In this study, a low energy beam transport (LEBT) channel for the proton
linac section of the Turkic Accelerator Complex (TAC) has been designed by
using TRACE 2D and TRAVEL codes. The LEBT channel is located between an ion
source and a radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) structure. The aims of the design
studies are perfect matching between input and output beams with two solenoid
magnets, small emittance growth and sufficient space for beam diagnostics.
Total length of such LEBT channel is about 1.3 m. The current of H- ion beam
from ion source is 80 mA. In the beam dynamical simulations, we have taken into
account some space charge compensation (SCC) factors between %93.75 and %100.
The results of both codes have been compared for the selected SCC factors.
Additionally, beam aperture study for % 95 SCC factor has been done to discard
unwanted particles and increase the beam brightness.
