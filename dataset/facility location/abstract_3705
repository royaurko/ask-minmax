The present supply of 3He can no longer meet the detector demands of the
upcoming ESS facility and continued detector upgrades at current neutron
sources. Therefore viable alternative technologies are required to support the
development of cutting-edge instrumentation for neutron scattering science. In
this context, 10B-based detectors are being developed by collaboration between
the ESS, ILL, and Link\"{o}ping University. This paper reports on progress of
this technology and the prospects applying it in modern neutron scattering
experiments. The detector is made-up of multiple rectangular gas counter tubes
coated with B4C, enriched in 10B. An anode wire reads out each tube, thereby
giving position of conversion in one of the lateral co-ordinates as well as in
depth of the detector. Position resolution in the remaining co-ordinate is
obtained by segmenting the cathode tube itself. Boron carbide films have been
produced at Link\"{o}ping University and a detector built at ILL. The
characterization study is presented in this paper, including measurement of
efficiency, effects of the fill gas species and pressure, coating thickness
variation on efficiency and sensitivity to gamma-rays.
