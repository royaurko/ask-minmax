Using first-principles total-energy pseudopotential calculations, we have
studied the properties of chains of potassium and aluminum in nanotubes. For BN
tubes, there is little interaction between the metal chains and the tubes, and
the conductivity of these tubes is through carriers located at the inner part
of the tube. In contrast, for small radius carbon nanotubes, there are two
types of interactions: charge-transfer (dominant for alkali atoms) leading to
strong ionic cohesion, and hybridization (for multivalent metal atoms)
resulting in a smaller cohesion. For Al-atomic chains in carbon tubes, we show
that both effects contribute. New electronic properties related to these
confined atomic chains of metal are analyzed.
