The Polyakov loop potential serves to distinguish between the confined
hadronic and the deconfined quark-gluon plasma phases of QCD. For Nf=2+1 quark
flavors with physical masses we determine the Polyakov loop potential at finite
temperature and density and extract the location of the deconfinement
transition. We find a cross-over at small values of the chemical potential
running into a critical end-point at mu/T > 1.
