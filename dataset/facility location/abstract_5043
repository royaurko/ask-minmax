Uncovering urban mobility patterns is crucial for further predicting and
controlling spatially embedded events. In this article, we analyze millions of
geographical check-ins crawled from a Chinese leading location-based social
networking service, Jiepang.com, which contains demographical information and
thus allows the group-specific studies. We found distinguishable mobility
patterns of natives and non-natives in all five large cities under
consideration, and by assigning different algorithms onto natives and
non-natives, the accuracy of location prediction can be largely improved
compared with pure algorithms. We further propose the so-called indigenization
coefficients to quantify to which extent an individual behaves like a native,
which depend only on check-in behaviors, instead of any demographical
information. To our surprise, a hybrid algorithm weighted by the indigenization
coefficients outperforms the mixed algorithm accounting for additional
demographical information.
