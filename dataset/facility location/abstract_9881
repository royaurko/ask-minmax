The possibility of coexistence of superconductivity (SC) and
antiferromagnetic long range order (AFLRO) of the two-dimensional extended
$t-J$ model in the very underdoped region is studied by the variational
Monte-Carlo (VMC) method. In addition to using previously studied wave
functions, a recently proposed new wave function generated from the half-filled
Mott insulator is used. For hole-doped systems, the phase boundary between
AFLRO and $d-$wave SC for the physical parameters, $J/t=0.3$, $t'/t=-0.3$ and
$t''/t=0.2$, is located near hole density $\delta_c = 0.06$, and there is {\it
no} coexistence. The phase transition is first-order between these two
homogeneous phases at $\delta_c$.
