Neutron capture cross sections of unstable isotopes are important for neutron
induced nucleosynthesis as well as for technological applications. The Rare
Isotope Accelerator (RIA) or comparable facilities will be able to produce
radioactive ion beams up to 10**12 particles/s and would therefore be a
suitable place for (n,g) studies on radioactive isotopes with half-lives
between days and months. We propose a facility for measurements of (n,g) cross
sections of unstable isotopes in the keV range suited for minimal sample masses
down to 10**15 atoms, corresponding to minimum half-lives of only 10 d.
