We present for the first time the evolution of the photospheric electric
currents during an eruptive X-class flare, accurately predicted by the standard
3D flare model. We analyze this evolution for the February 15, 2011 flare using
HMI/SDO magnetic observations and find that localized currents in \J-shaped
ribbons increase to double their pre-flare intensity. Our 3D flare model,
developed with the OHM code, suggests that these current ribbons, which develop
at the location of EUV brightenings seen with AIA imagery, are driven by the
collapse of the flare's coronal current layer. These findings of increased
currents restricted in localized ribbons are consistent with the overall free
energy decrease during a flare, and the shape of these ribbons also give an
indication on how much twisted the erupting flux rope is. Finally, this study
further enhances the close correspondence obtained between the theoretical
predictions of the standard 3D model and flare observations indicating that the
main key physical elements are incorporated in the model.
