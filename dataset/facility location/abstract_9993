The prehistoric site of Vin\u{c}a, on the right bank of the River Danube, the
territory of the City of Belgrade, first excavated by Dr Miloje Vasi\'c;
(1931-1934) provides Neolithic pottery dating back to 5200 - 4200 B.C. Shards
excavated in 1998 (Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts) have a yellow coating
on the external (convex) and red deposit on the internal (concave) side. Raman,
IR and X-ray identification prove that yellow-to-red decor deposited on the
external faces of pottery is made of ochre, a mixture of hematite, quartz and
phyllosilicates. Red deposit, found on some internal surfaces of a pottery,
consists of cinnabar (HgS) with some quartz and phyllosilicates. This indicates
that cinnabar was not used for decor but for some other purposes, preparations
made in ceramic utensils. A comparison is made with the mercury ore from a
Suplja Stena mine located ~ 20 km from the Vin\u{c}a village.
