We propose and investigate a unifying class of sparse random graph models,
based on a hidden coloring of edge-vertex incidences, extending an existing
approach, Random graphs with a given degree distribution, in a way that admits
a nontrivial correlation structure in the resulting graphs.
  The approach unifies a number of existing random graph ensembles within a
common general formalism, and allows for the analytic calculation of observable
graph characteristics.
  In particular, generating function techniques are used to derive the size
distribution of connected components (clusters) as well as the location of the
percolation threshold where a giant component appears.
