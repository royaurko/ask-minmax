Generally, Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) needs special designed high current
superconducting RF cavities. In this paper, the threshold current of BBU for
compact ERL facilities with 9-cell Tesla type cavities are investigated. The
results show that it is feasible to adopt 9-cell Tesla cavity for compact ERL
test facilities with just a few cavities and beam current around tens mA.
