A Dyson-Schwinger equation calculation of the light hadron spectrum, which
correlates the masses of meson and baryon ground- and excited-states within a
single framework, produces a description of the Roper resonance that
corresponds closely with conclusions drawn recently by EBAC. Namely, the Roper
is a particular type of radial excitation of the nucleon's dressed-quark core
augmented by a material meson cloud component. There are, in addition, some
surprises.
