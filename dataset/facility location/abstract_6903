The space-borne observatories CoRoT (Convection Rotation and planetary
Transits) and Kepler have provided photometric time series data of
unprecedented precision for large numbers of stars. These data have
revolutionized the fields of transiting exoplanets and asteroseismology. In
this review some important asteroseismic results obtained using data from the
CoRoT and Kepler space missions concerning stars that show solar-like
oscillations are discussed. These results comprise, among others, measurements
of the location of the base of the convection zone and helium second-ionization
zone in main-sequence stars, the presence (or not) of core-helium burning in
red-giant stars, as well as differential rotation in these stars.
