It is found that the carriers of the high-T_c cuprates are polaron-like
"stripons" carrying charge and located in stripe-like inhomogeneities,
"quasi-electrons" carrying charge and spin, and "svivons" carrying spin and
lattice distortion. This is shown to result in the observed anomalous
spectroscopic properties of the cuprates. The AF/stripe-like inhomogeneities
result from the Bose condensation of the svivon field, and the speed of their
dynamics is determined by the width of the double-svivon neutron-resonance
peak. Pairing results from transitions between pair states of stripons and
quasi-electrons through the exchange of svivons. The obtained pairing symmetry
is of the d_{x^2-y^2} type; however, sign reversal through the charged stripes
results in features not characteristic of this symmetry. The phase diagram is
determined by a pairing and a coherence line, associated with a Mott
transition, and the pseudogap state corresponds to incoherent pairing.
