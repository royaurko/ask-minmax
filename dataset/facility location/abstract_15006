We present the discovery of a high redshift, X-ray selected AGN by the
Calan-Yale Deep Extragalactic Research (CYDER) survey: CXOCY J033716.7-050153,
located at $z=4.61$, the second high redshift AGN discovered by this survey.
Here, we present its optical, near-IR and X-ray properties and compare it with
other optical and X-ray selected high redshift AGN. The optical luminosity of
this object is significantly lower than most optically selected high redshift
quasars. It also has a lower rest frame UV to X-ray emission ratio than most
known quasars at this redshift. This mild deviation can be explained either by
dust obscuring the UV radiation of a normal radio quiet AGN emitting at 10% of
its Eddington luminosity or because this is intrinsically a low luminosity
radio loud AGN, with a super-massive Black Hole of $\sim 10^8M_\sun$ emitting
at 1% of its Eddington luminosity. Deep radio observations can discriminate
between these two hypotheses.
