We present low-frequency, GMRT (Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope) observations
at 333 and 617 MHz of the most-distant giant quasar, J1432+158, which is at a
redshift of 1.005. The radio source has a total angular extent of 168 arcsec,
corresponding to a projected linear size of 1.35 Mpc. This makes it presently
the largest single object observed beyond a redshift of one. The objectives of
the GMRT observations were to investigate the possibility of detecting a bridge
of emission at low frequencies, which may be suppressed due to inverse-Compton
losses against the cosmic microwave background radiation. We detect a jet-like
structure connecting the core to the western hotspot, while the eastern hotspot
is found to be largely tail-less with no significant bridge emission. The
estimated life-time for the radiating electrons in the tail of the western lobe
appears smaller than the travel time of the radiating particles from the
hotspot, suggesting either in-situ acceleration or dissipation of energy by the
jet at this location. The pressure of the intergalactic medium at $z\sim1$
estimated from the minimum energy density calculations appears to be marginally
lower than the value extrapolated from nearby giant radio galaxies.
