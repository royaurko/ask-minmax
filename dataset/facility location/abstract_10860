In this paper, several proposals of optically simulating Yang-Baxter
equations have been presented. Motivated by the recent development of anyon
theory, we apply Temperley-Lieb algebra as a bridge to recast four-dimentional
Yang-Baxter equation into its two-dimensional counterpart. In accordance with
both representations, we find the corresponding linear-optical simulations,
based on the highly efficient optical elements. Both the freedom degrees of
photon polarization and location are utilized as the qubit basis, in which the
unitary Yang-Baxter matrices are decomposed into combination of actions of
basic optical elements.
