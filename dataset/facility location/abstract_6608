A one - parameter dynamical system is associated to the mathematical problem
governing the membrane excitability of a ventricular cardiomyocyte, according
to the Luo-Rudy I model. An algorithm used to construct the equilibrium curve
is presented. Some test functions are used in order to locate limit points and
Hopf bifurcation points. Two extended systems allow to calculate these points.
The numerical results are presented in a bifurcation diagram.
