We derive the essential space-time spectrum of the Maxwell equations in
linear isotropic inhomogeneous media together with the corresponding essential
modes. These modes represent the collapse of the electromagnetic field into a
single point in space at a single angular frequency. The location and frequency
of the essential mode are random variables obeying the Born statistical
postulate.
