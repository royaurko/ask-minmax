A beam position monitor (BPM) upgrade at the KEK Accelerator Test Facility
(ATF) damping ring has been accomplished, carried out by a KEK/FNAL/SLAC
collaboration under the umbrella of the global ILC R&D effort. The upgrade
consists of a high resolution, high reproducibility read-out system, based on
analog and processing, and also implements a new automatic gain error
correction schema. The technical concept and realization as well as results of
beam studies are presented.
