Fragment-fragment-$\gamma$ triple coincident measurements of the $^{28}$Si +
$^{28}$Si reaction at E$_{lab.}$ = 111.6 MeV carefully chosen to populate J =
38$^{+}$ resonance have been performed at the VIVITRON tandem facility by using
Eurogam Phase II $\gamma$-ray spectrometer. In the $^{28}$Si + $^{28}$Si
exit-channel, the resonance behavior of the $^{28}$Si + $^{28}$Si reaction at
the beam energy is clearly confirmed. An unexpected spin disalignment has been
observed in the measured angular distributions in the elastic, inelastic, and
mutual excitation channels. This disalignment is found to be consistent with
particle-$\gamma$ angular correlations and supported by the molecular model
prediction of a "butterfly motion". The K$^{\pi}$ = 0$^{+}_{3}$ band
corresponding to the large prolate deformation of the $^{28}$Si is more
intensely fed in the resonance region. The selective population of high-excited
states are discussed within a statistical fusion-fission model. In the $^{32}$S
+ $^{24}$Mg exit-channel, the spectroscopic study of the $^{32}$S, has revealed
the contribution of a new $\gamma$-ray transition $0^{+} (8507.8 keV) \to
2^{+}_{1} (2230.2 keV) $.
