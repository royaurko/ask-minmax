The downlink of a wireless network where multi-antenna base stations (BSs)
communicate with single-antenna mobile stations (MSs) using maximal ratio
transmission (MRT) is considered here. The locations of BSs are modeled by a
homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) and the channel gains between the
multiple antennas of each BS and the single antenna of each MS are modeled as
spatially arbitrarily correlated Rayleigh random variables. We first present
novel closed-form expressions for the distribution of the power of the
interference resulting from the coexistence of one intended and one unintended
MRT over the considered correlated fading channels. The derived expressions are
then used to obtain closed-form expressions for the success probability and
area spectral efficiency of the wireless communication network under
investigation. Simulation results corroborate the validity of the presented
expressions. A key result of this work is that the effect of spatial
correlation on the network throughput may be contrasting depending on the
density of BSs, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) level, and
the background noise power.
