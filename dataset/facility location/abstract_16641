In this work I communicate the detection of a new Galactic Wolf-Rayet star
(WR60a) in Centaurus. The H- and K-band spectra of WR60a, show strong carbon
near-infrared emission lines, characteristic of Wolf-Rayet stars of the WC5-7
sub-type. Adopting mean absolute magnitude M$_K$ and mean intrinsic ($J-K_S$)
and ($H-K_S$) colours, it was found that WR60a suffer a mean visual extinction
of 3.8$\pm$1.3 magnitudes, being located at a probable heliocentric distance of
5.2$\pm$0.8 Kpc, which for the related Galactic longitude (l=312) puts this
star probably in the Carina-Sagittarius arm at about 5.9 kpc from the Galactic
center. I searched for clusters in the vicinity of WR60a, and in principle
found no previously known clusters in a search radius region of several tens
arc-minutes. The detection of a well isolated WR star induced us to seek for
some still unknown cluster, somewhere in the vicinity of WR60a. From inspection
of 5.8$\mu$m and 8.0$\mu$m Spitzer/IRAC GLIMPSE images of the region around the
new WR star, it was found strong mid-infrared extended emission at about 13.5
arcmin south-west of WR60a. The study of the the H-K$_S$ colour distribution of
point sources associated with the extended emission, reveals the presence of a
new Galactic cluster candidate probably formed by at least 85 stars.
