What is meant by the "inner edge" of an accretion disk around a black hole
depends on the property that defines the edge. We discuss four such definitions
using data from recent high-resolution numerical simulations. These are: the
"turbulence edge", where flux-freezing becomes more important than turbulence
in determining the magnetic field structure; the "stress edge", where plunging
matter loses dynamical contact with the outer accretion flow; the "reflection
edge", the smallest radius capable of producing significant X-ray reflection
features; and the "radiation edge", the innermost place from which significant
luminosity emerges. All these edges are dependent on the accretion rate and are
non-axisymmetric and time-variable. Although all are generally located in the
vicinity of the marginally stable orbit, significant displacements can occur,
and data interpretations placing the disk edge precisely at this point can be
misleading. If observations are to be used successfully as diagnostics of
accretion in strong gravity, the models used to interpret them must take
careful account of these distinctions.
