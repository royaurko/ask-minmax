New AAT near-infrared and SEST 12CO J=2-1 observations are combined with
existing ISO mid-infrared and ATCA cm radio continuum observations to examine
the protostellar content of the Bok globule BHR 71. Together with observations
of Herbig-Haro objects, these data show: (1) Two protostellar sources, IRS1 and
IRS2, with a separation of ~17 arcsec (3400 AU) are located within BHR 71. (2)
Each protostar is driving its own molecular outflow. The outflow from IRS1 is
much larger in extent, is more massive, and dominates the CO emission. (3) Both
protostars are associated with Herbig-Haro objects and shock excited 2.122
micron H2 v=1-0S(1) emission, which coincide spatially with their CO outflows.
(4) IRS1 is associated with cm continuum emission, with a flat or rising
spectrum which is consistent with free-free emission, a signpost of
protostellar origin.
