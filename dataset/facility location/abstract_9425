The X-ray persistent source 1E 1743.1-2843, located in the Galactic Centre
region, has been detected by all X-ray telescope above 2 keV, whereas it is not
visible in the soft X-rays (i. e. Rosat) because of the high column density
along the line-of-sight. Moreover, the nature of this source remains still
unknown. The gamma-ray satellite INTEGRAL has long observed the Galactic Centre
region in the framework of the Core Programme. We report on results of two
years of INTEGRAL observations of 1E 1743.1--2843 detected for the first time
in the soft gamma-ray band. Since the source does not show any evidence for
strong variability, we present the broad-band spectral analysis using not
simultaneous XMM-Newton observations.
