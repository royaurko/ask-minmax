Windows are used quite frequently in a GUI environment. The greatest
advantage of using windows is that each window creates a virtual screen space.
Hence, although the physical screen space is limited to a few inches, use of
windows can create unlimited screen space to display innumerable items.
  The use of windows facilitates the user to open and interact with multiple
programs or documents simultaneously in different windows. Sometimes a single
program may also open multiple windows to display various items. The user can
resize the windows and move their location time to time as desired.
  However, there are several concerns of a window relating to its size,
appearance, positioning, color, visibility, resizability etc. For example, the
window should have a minimum and a maximum size, dragging and resizing the
window should be easy, one window should not be obscured by another window,
windows should adjust their size and location in order to match with the
changes in the resolution and display environment etc.
  This article illustrates six patents from US Patent database solving problems
relating to displaying and resizing of windows. The inventions include
automatic resizing and relocating of windows, alternative modes of displaying
windows to accommodate within the limited display area, combining both spatial
and temporal methods to resize the window, locking and minimizing windows and
making the windows invisible on specific situations.
