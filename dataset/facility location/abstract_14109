The trajectory design for the Dark Ages Radio Explorer (DARE) mission
con-cept involves launching the DARE spacecraft into a geosynchronous transfer
orbit (GTO) as a secondary payload. From GTO, the spacecraft then transfers to
a lunar orbit that is stable (i.e., no station-keeping maneuvers are required
with minimum perilune altitude always above 40 km) and allows for more than
1,000 cumulative hours for science measurements in the radio-quiet region
located on the lunar farside.
