We present an analysis of the optical spectroscopy of 58 stars in the
Galactic plane at $l=27$\arcdeg, where a prominent excess in the flux
distribution and star counts have been observed in several spectral regions, in
particular in the Two Micron Galactic Survey (TMGS) catalog. The sources were
selected from the TMGS, to have a $K$ magnitude brighter than +5 mag and be
within 2 degrees of the Galactic plane. More than 60% of the spectra correspond
to stars of luminosity class I, and a significant proportion of the remainder
are very late giants which would also be fast evolving. This very high
concentration of young sources points to the existence of a major star
formation region in the Galactic plane, located just inside the assumed origin
of the Scutum spiral arm. Such regions can form due to the concentrations of
shocked gas where a galactic bar meets a spiral arm, as is observed at the ends
of the bars of face-on external galaxies. Thus, the presence of a massive star
formation region is very strong supporting evidence for the presence of a bar
in our Galaxy.
