We investigate the spectral properties of the brightest gamma-ray flares of
blazars detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope. We search for the presence
of spectral breaks and measure the spectral curvature on typical time scales of
a few days. We identify significant spectral breaks in fewer than half of the
analyzed flares, but their parameters do not show any discernible regularities,
and in particular there is no indication for gamma-ray absorption at any fixed
source-frame photon energy. More interestingly, we find that the studied
blazars are characterized by significant spectral variability. Gamma-ray flares
of short duration are often characterized by strong spectral curvature, with
the spectral peak located above 100 MeV. Since these spectral variations are
observed despite excellent photon statistics, they must reflect temporal
fluctuations in the energy distributions of the emitting particles. We suggest
that highly regular gamma-ray spectra of blazars integrated over long time
scales emerge from a superposition of many short-lived irregular components
with relatively narrow spectra. This would imply that the emitting particles
are accelerated in strongly turbulent environments.
