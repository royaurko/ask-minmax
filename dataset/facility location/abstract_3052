We study the effect of uniaxial strain on the electronic band structure of
gapped graphene. We consider two types of gapped graphene, one which breaks the
symmetry between the two triangular sublattices (staggered model), and another
which alternates the bonds on the honeycomb lattice (Kekul\'e model). In the
staggered model, the effect of strains below a critical value is only a shift
of the band gap location. In the Kekul\'e model, as strain is increased, band
gap location is initially pinned to a corner of the Brillouin zone while its
width diminishes, and after gap closure the location of the contact point
begins to shift. Analytic and numerical results are obtained for both the
tight-binding and Dirac fermion descriptions of gapped graphene.
