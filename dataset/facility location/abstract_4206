We present the Fourier Transform of continuous gravitational wave for
arbitrary location of detector and source and for any duration of observation
time in which both rotational motion of earth about its spin axis and orbital
motion around sun has been taken into account. We also give the method to
account the spin down of continuous gravitational wave.
