The superconducting gap structure of heavy fermion UPd_2Al_3, in which
unconventional superconductivity coexists with antiferromagnetic (AF) order
with atomic size local moments, was investigated by the thermal conductivity
measurements in a magnetic field rotating in various directions relative to the
crystal axes. The results provide strong evidence that the gap function
\Delta(k) has a single line node orthogonal to the c-axis located at the AF
Brillouin zone boundary, while \Delta(k) is isotropic within the basal plane.
The determined nodal structure is compatible with the resonance peak in the
dynamical susceptibility observed in neutron inelastic scattering experiments.
Based on these results, we conclude that the superconducting pairing function
of UPd_2Al_3 is most likely to be d-wave with a form \Delta(k)=\Delta_0
