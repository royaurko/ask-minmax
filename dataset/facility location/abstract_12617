We introduce the notion of dissipative periodic lattice as an optical lattice
with periodically distributed dissipative sites and argue that it allows to
engineer unconventional Bose-Einstein superfluids with the complex-valued order
parameter. We consider two examples, the one-dimensional dissipative optical
lattice, where each third site is dissipative, and the dissipative honeycomb
optical lattice, where each dissipative lattice site neighbors three
non-dissipated sites. The tight-binding approximation is employed, which allows
one to obtain analytical results. In the one-dimensional case the condensate is
driven to a coherent Bloch-like state with non-zero quasimomentum, which breaks
the translational periodicity of the dissipative lattice. In the
two-dimensional case the condensate is driven to a zero quasimomentum
Bloch-like state, which is a coherent superposition of four-site discrete
vortices of alternating vorticity with the vortex centers located at the
dissipative sites.
