CO is thought to be a vital building block for prebiotic molecules that are
necessary for life. Thus, understanding where CO existed in a solid phase
within the solar nebula is important for understanding the origin of life. We
model the evolution of the CO snow line in a protoplanetary disk. We find that
the current observed location of the CO snow line in our solar system, and in
the solar system analogue TW Hydra, cannot be explained by a fully turbulent
disk model. With time-dependent disk models we find that the inclusion of a
dead zone (a region of low turbulence) can resolve this problem. Furthermore,
we obtain a fully analytic solution for the CO snow line radius for late disk
evolutionary times. This will be useful for future observational attempts to
characterize the demographics and predict the composition and habitability of
exoplanets.
