Quasinormal modes of asymptotically AdS black holes can be interpreted as
poles of retarded correlators in the dual gauge theory. To determine the
response of the system to small external perturbations it is not enough to know
the location of the poles: one also needs to know the residues. We compute them
for R-charge currents and find that they are complex except for the
hydrodynamic mode, whose residue is purely imaginary. For different quasinormal
modes the residue grows with momentum q, whereas for the hydrodynamic mode it
behaves as a damped oscillation with distinct zeroes at finite q. Similar to
collective excitations at weak coupling the hydrodynamic mode decouples at
short wavelengths. Knowledge of the residues allows as well to define the time
scale t_H from when on the system enters the hydrodynamic regime, restricting
the validity of hydrodynamic simulations to times t>t_H.
