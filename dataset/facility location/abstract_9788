A motion of neutral and charged particles located nearby a metal surface
under joint action of time-periodic electric field E(t) directed normally to
the surface and permanent magnetic field H directed along the surface has been
considered. I has been shown that due to a nonlinearity of the system there
exists a directed transport of the particles perpendicularly to both magnetic
and electric fields with velocity which is proportional to H and a square of E.
  The mean velocity has been evaluated for charged (ions,electrons etc.) and
neutral (atoms, molecules, nano-size clusters etc.) particles adsorbed on a
metal surface. Corresponding surface electric current has been found as a
function of a frequency of the electric field and material parameters. It has
been noted that the similar phenomena appear in a bulk of electrically
inhomogeneous media.
