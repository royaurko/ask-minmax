Intensity interferometry permits very long optical baselines and the
observation of sub-milliarcsecond structures. Using planned kilometric arrays
of air Cherenkov telescopes at short wavelengths, intensity interferometry may
increase the spatial resolution achieved in optical astronomy by an order of
magnitude, inviting detailed studies of the shapes of rapidly rotating hot
stars with structures in their circumstellar disks and winds, or mapping out
patterns of nonradial pulsations across stellar surfaces. Signal-to-noise in
intensity interferometry favors high-temperature sources and emission-line
structures, and is independent of the optical passband, be it a single spectral
line or the broad spectral continuum. Prime candidate sources have been
identified among classes of bright and hot stars. Observations are simulated
for telescope configurations envisioned for large Cherenkov facilities,
synthesizing numerous optical baselines in software, confirming that
resolutions of tens of microarcseconds are feasible for numerous astrophysical
targets.
