We report experimental observations of sound waves in a granular material
during resonant silo discharge called silo music. The grain motion was tracked
by high speed imaging while the resonance of the silo was detected by
accelerometers and acoustic methods. The grains do not oscillate in phase at
neighboring vertical locations, but information propagates upward in this
system in the form of sound waves. We show that the wave velocity is not
constant throughout the silo, but considerably increases towards the lower end
of the system, suggesting increased pressure in this region, where the flow
changes from cylindrical to converging flow. In the upper part of the silo the
wave velocity matches the sound velocity measured in the same material when
standing (in the absence of flow). Grain oscillations show a stick-slip
character only in the upper part of the silo.
