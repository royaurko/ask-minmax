The self-organized Monte Carlo simulations of 2D Ising ferromagnet on the
square lattice are performed. The essence of devised simulation method is the
artificial dynamics consisting of the single-spin-flip algorithm of Metropolis
supplemented by the random walk in the temperature space. The walk is biased to
the critical region through the feedback equation utilizing the memory-based
filtering recursion instantly estimating the energy cumulants. The simulations
establish that the peak of the temperature probability density function is
located nearly the pseudocritical temperature pertaining to canonical
equilibrium. In order to eliminate the finite-size effects, the self-organized
approach is extended to multi-lattice systems, where feedback is constructed
from the pairs of the instantaneous running fourth-order cumulants of the
magnetization. The replica-based simulations indicate that several properly
chosen steady statistical distributions of the self-organized Monte Carlo
systems resemble characteristics of the standard self-organized critical
systems.
