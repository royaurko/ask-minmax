We propose a scheme to create distant entangled atomic states. It is based on
driving two (or more) atoms with a weak laser pulse, so that the probability
that two atoms are excited is negligible. If the subsequent spontaneous
emission is detected, the entangled state is created. We have developed a model
to analyze the fidelity of the resulting state as a function of the dimensions
and location of the detector, and the motional properties of the atoms.
