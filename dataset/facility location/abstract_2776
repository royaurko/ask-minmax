In this paper, we investigate the general case of black hole on horizon by
the method of Damour-Ruffini-Zhao. The proof of identification of the location
of horizons determined both by Damour-Ruffini-Zhao's (D-R-Z) method and by
equation of null super-surface is given. The formula of temperature on the
horizon for general black holes is obtained and is successfully checked by a
variety of models of black holes.
