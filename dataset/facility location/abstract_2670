Classical radiation reaction is the effect of the radiation emitted by an
accelerated electric charge on the trajectory of the charge itself. The
self-consistent underlying classical equation of motion including
radiation-reaction effects, the Landau-Lifshitz equation, has never been tested
experimentally, in spite of the first theoretical treatments having been
developed more than a century ago. Here, we show that classical radiation
reaction effects, as predicted by the Landau-Lifshitz equation, can be measured
using presently available facilities, in the energy emission spectrum of a
parallel $10$-$\text{GeV}$ electron beam crossing a $1.1$-$\text{mm}$ thick
diamond crystal in the axial channeling regime. Our theoretical results
demonstrate the feasibility of the suggested setup, e.g., at the CERN Secondary
Beam Areas (SBA) beamlines.
