Intra-session network coding is known to be vulnerable to pollution attacks.
In this work, first, we introduce a novel homomorphic MAC scheme called
SpaceMac, which allows an intermediate node to verify if its received packets
belong to a specific subspace, even if the subspace is expanding over time.
Then, we use SpaceMac as a building block to design a cooperative scheme that
provides complete defense against pollution attacks: (i) it can detect polluted
packets early at intermediate nodes and (ii) it can identify the exact location
of all, even colluding, attackers, thus making it possible to eliminate them.
Our scheme is cooperative: parents and children of any node cooperate to detect
any corrupted packets sent by the node, and nodes in the network cooperate with
a central controller to identify the exact location of all attackers. We
implement SpaceMac in both C/C++ and Java as a library, and we make the library
available online. Our evaluation on both a PC and an Android device shows that
(i) SpaceMac's algorithms can be computed quickly and efficiently, and (ii) our
cooperative defense scheme has low computation and significantly lower
communication overhead than other comparable state-of-the-art schemes.
