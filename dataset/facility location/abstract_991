Current and future experimental studies of the high-energy limit of QCD,
dominated by non-linear gluon dynamics in the low-x sector of the hadron
wavefunctions, are presented. Results at HERA (proton) and RHIC (nucleus)
pointing to the possible onset of parton saturation phenomena, and perspectives
at the LHC and new proposed DIS facilities are outlined.
