In the frame of the international campaign to observe potential target
asteroids for the Rosetta mission, remote observations have been carried out
between Observatoire de Paris, in Meudon-France, and the NASA Infrared
Telescope Facility on Mauna Kea. The SpeX instrument was used in the 0.8-2.5
microns spectral region, for two observing runs in March and June 2003.
  This paper presents near-IR spectra of the asteroids 21 Lutetia, 89 Julia,
140 Siwa, 2181 Fogelin, and 5480 (1989YK8).
  Near-IR spectra of the asteroids 21 Lutetia and 140 Siwa are flat and
featureless.
 The spectrum of 89 Julia reveals absorption bands around 1 and 2 microns,
which may indicate the presence of olivine and olivine-pyroxene mixtures and
confirm the S-type designation.
  The small main-belt asteroids 2181 Fogelin and 5480 (1989YK8) are
investigated spectroscopically for the first time. Near-IR spectra of these
asteroids also show an absorption feature around 1 micron, which could be and
indicator of igneous/metamorphic surface of the objects; new observations in
visible as well as thermal albedo data are necessary to draw a reliable
conclusion on the surface mineralogy of both asteroids.
