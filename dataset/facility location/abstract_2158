Beta Beam,the concept of generating a pure and intense (anti) neutrino beam
by letting accelerated radioactive ions beta decay in a storage ring, called
Decay Ring (DR), is the base of one of the proposed next generation neutrino
oscillation facilities, necessary for a complete study of the neutrino
oscillation parameter space. Sensitivities of the unknown neutrino oscillation
parameters depend on the Decay Ring's ion intensity and of it's duty factor
(the filled ratio of the ring). Therefore efficient ion production, stripping,
bunching, acceleration and storing are crucial sub-projects under study and
development within the Beta Beam collaboration. Specifically the feasibility of
these tasks as parts of a Beta Beam implementation at CERN will be discussed in
this report. The positive impact of the large {\theta}13 indications from T2K
on the Beta Beam performance will also be discussed.
