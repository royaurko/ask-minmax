The Sombrero galaxy, NGC 4594, contains the most numerous globular cluster
system of any nearby spiral. It is an ideal candidate in which to study the
globular clusters and contrast them with those in Local Group spirals. Here we
present B and I imaging from the CTIO Schmidt telescope which gives a
field-of-view of 31' x 31'. Using DAOPHOT we have detected over 400 globular
clusters and derived their magnitudes, B--I colors and photometric
metallicities. We have attempted to separate our sample into disk and
bulge/halo globular cluster populations, based on location in the galaxy. There
is some evidence that the disk population is more metal--rich than the
bulge/halo globular clusters, however contamination, dust reddening and small
number statistics makes this result very tentative. We find that the median
metallicity of the bulge/halo globular clusters is [Fe/H] = -0.8. This
metallicity is consistent with previous estimates based on smaller samples. It
is also similar to the metallicity predicted by the globular cluster
metallicity -- galaxy luminosity relation. As with our Galaxy, there is no
radial metallicity gradient in the halo globular clusters. This suggests that
the spheriodal component of NGC 4594 did not form by a dissipational process.
