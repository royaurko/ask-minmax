We consider scalar field entanglement entropy generated with black hole of
(sub)planck mass scale thus implying the unitary evolution of gravity. The
dependence on the dimension of the Hilbert space for degrees of freedom located
behind the horizon is taken into account. The obtained results contain
polylogarithmic terms.
