Absolute neutrino cross section measurements are presently limited by
uncertainties on $\nu$ fluxes. In this paper, we propose a technique that is
based on the reconstruction of large angle positrons in the decay tunnel to
identify three-body semileptonic $K^+ \rightarrow e^+ \pi^0 \nu_e$ decays. This
tagging facility operated in positron counting mode ("event count mode") can be
employed to determine the absolute $\nu_e$ flux at the neutrino detector with
${\cal O}(1\%)$ precision. Facilities operated in "event by event tag mode"
i.e. tagged neutrino beams that exploit the time coincidence of the positron at
source and the $\nu_e$ interaction at the detector, are also discussed.
