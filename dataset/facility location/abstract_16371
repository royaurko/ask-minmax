We investigate the dynamics of a circumbinary disc that responds to the loss
of mass and to the recoil velocity of the black hole produced by the merger of
a binary system of supermassive black holes. We perform the first
two-dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of
\textit{extended} non-Keplerian discs and employ a new technique to construct a
"shock detector", thus determining the precise location of the shocks produced
in the accreting disc by the recoiling black hole. In this way we can study how
the properties of the system, such as the spin, mass and recoil velocity of the
black hole, affect the mass accretion rate and are imprinted on the
electromagnetic emission from these sources. We argue that the estimates of the
bremsstrahlung luminosity computed without properly taking into account the
radiation transfer yield cooling times that are unrealistically short. At the
same time we show, through an approximation based on the relativistic
isothermal evolution, that the luminosity produced can reach a peak value above
$L \simeq 10^{43} \ {\rm erg/s} $ at about $\sim 30\,{\rm d}$ after the merger
of a binary with total mass $M\simeq 10^6 M_\odot$ and persist for several days
at values which are a factor of a few smaller. If confirmed by more
sophisticated calculations such a signal could indeed lead to an
electromagnetic counterpart of the merger of binary black-hole system.
