Following the possibility of a new mass scale at the 3 PeV knee energy of the
cosmic ray energy spectrum, the contributor suggests that the mass for the dark
matter particle should be 8.1 TeV, using GLMR supersymmetry theory . The contributor
discusses the possibility of detecting such a signature in various
observational facilities, gamma ray, neutrino and other underground detectors.
An analysis of recent data from HESS yields a gamma ray peak at 7.6 +/- 0.1
TeV, providing observational evidence for a dark matter particle mass
consistent with the theoretical prediction. The contributor also suggests that the
observed discontinuity in the power law index in galaxy correlation functions
is the knee energy counterpart in cosmology.
