The nature and extent of the Great Attractor (GA) has been the subject of
much debate in the past decade, partly due to the fact that a large fraction of
the GA overdensity is hidden by the southern Milky Way. Based on our deep
optical galaxy search behind the southern Milky Way and a subsequent redshift
survey we discovered that the Norma cluster (ACO 3627) in the GA region is a
very massive cluster of galaxies. The cluster is comparable in size, richness
and mass to the Coma cluster. It is located at the intersection of two distinct
large structures, the Centaurus Wall and the Norma Supercluster. The velocity
flow fields in the GA region are most likely caused by the confluence of these
two massive structures where the Norma cluster constitutes its previously
unseen but predicted core. The possibility that another, heavily obscured and
yet uncharted rich cluster might form part of the GA overdensity is also
discussed.
