Calibration of a sensor array is more involved if the antennas have direction
dependent gains and multiple calibrator sources are simultaneously present. We
study this case for a sensor array with arbitrary geometry but identical
elements, i.e. elements with the same direction dependent gain pattern. A
weighted alternating least squares (WALS) algorithm is derived that iteratively
solves for the direction independent complex gains of the array elements, their
noise powers and their gains in the direction of the calibrator sources. An
extension of the problem is the case where the apparent calibrator source
locations are unknown, e.g., due to refractive propagation paths. For this
case, the WALS method is supplemented with weighted subspace fitting (WSF)
direction finding techniques. Using Monte Carlo simulations we demonstrate that
both methods are asymptotically statistically efficient and converge within two
iterations even in cases of low SNR.
