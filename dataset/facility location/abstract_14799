Design and performance details are given for the Cosmic Background Imager
(CBI), an interferometer array that is measuring the power spectrum of
fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) for multipoles
in the range 400 < l < 3500. The CBI is located at an altitude of 5000 m in the
Atacama Desert in northern Chile. It is a planar synthesis array with 13 0.9-m
diameter antennas on a 6-m diameter tracking platform. Each antenna has a
cooled, low-noise receiver operating in the 26-36 GHz band. Signals are
cross-correlated in an analog filterbank correlator with ten 1 GHz bands. This
allows spectral index measurements which can be used to distinguish CMBR
signals from diffuse galactic foregrounds. A 1.2 kHz 180-deg phase switching
scheme is used to reject cross-talk and low-frequency pick-up in the signal
processing system. The CBI has a 3-axis mount which allows the tracking
platform to be rotated about the optical axis, providing improved (u,v)
coverage and a powerful discriminant against false signals generated in the
receiving electronics. Rotating the tracking platform also permits polarization
measurements when some of the antennas are configured for the orthogonal
polarization.
