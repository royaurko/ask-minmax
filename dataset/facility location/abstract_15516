Context: The location of coronal heating in magnetic loops has been the
subject of a long-lasting controversy: does it occur mostly at the loop
footpoints, at the top, is it random, or is the average profile uniform?
  Aims: We try to address this question in model loops with MHD turbulence and
a profile of density and/or magnetic field along the loop.
  Methods: We use the ShellAtm MHD turbulent heating model described in Buchlin
& Velli (2006), with a static mass density stratification obtained by the
HydRad model (Bradshaw & Mason 2003). This assumes the absence of any flow or
heat conduction subsequent to the dynamic heating.
  Results: The average profile of heating is quasi-uniform, unless there is an
expansion of the flux tube (non-uniform axial magnetic field) or the variation
of the kinetic and magnetic diffusion coefficients with temperature is taken
into account: in the first case the heating is enhanced at footpoints, whereas
in the second case it is enhanced where the dominant diffusion coefficient is
enhanced.
  Conclusions: These simulations shed light on the consequences on heating
profiles of the complex interactions between physical effects involved in a
non-uniform turbulent coronal loop.
