We present observations of background charge fluctuators near an Al-AlO_x-Al
single-electron transistor on an oxidized Si substrate. The transistor design
incorporates a heavily doped substrate and top gate, which allow for
independent control of the substrate and transistor island potentials. Through
controlled charging of the Si/SiO_2 interface we show that the fluctuators
cannot reside in the Si layer or in the tunnel barriers. Combined with the
large measured signal amplitude, this implies that the defects must be located
very near the oxide surface.
