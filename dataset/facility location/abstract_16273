We report the discovery of three pulsars whose large dispersion measures and
angular proximity to \sgr indicate the existence of a Galactic center
population of neutron stars. The relatively long periods (0.98 to 1.48 s) most
likely reflect strong selection against short-period pulsars from radio-wave
scattering at the observation frequency of 2 GHz used in our survey with the
Green Bank Telescope. One object (PSR J1746-2850I) has a characteristic
spindown age of only 13 kyr along with a high surface magnetic field $\sim
4\times 10^{13}$ G. It and a second object found in the same telescope
pointing, PSR J1746-2850II (which has the highest known dispersion measure
among pulsars), may have originated from recent star formation in the Arches or
Quintuplet clusters given their angular locations. Along with a third object,
PSR J1745-2910, and two similar high-dispersion, long-period pulsars reported
by Johnston et al. (2006), the five objects found so far are 10 to 15 arc min
from \sgr, consistent with there being a large pulsar population in the
Galactic center, most of whose members are undetectable in relatively
low-frequency surveys because of pulse broadening from the same scattering
volume that angularly broadens \sgr and OH/IR masers.
