The band spectrum of bosonic atoms in two-dimensional honeycomb optical
lattices with the graphene-type structure has been studied. The dispersion laws
in the bands and the one-particle spectral densities are calculated for the
normal phase in the random phase approximation. The temperature-dependent
gapless spectrum with Dirac points located at the Brillouin zone boundary is
obtained for the lattice with energetically equivalent sites, with the
corresponding chemical potential lying outside the allowed energy band.
Different on-site energies in the sublattices are shown to induce the
appearance of a gap in the spectrum, so that the chemical potential can be
located between the subbands, which gives rise to a substantial reconstruction
of the band spectrum. The frequency dependences of the one-particle spectral
density for both sublattices are determined as functions of the chemical
potential level, the spectral gap magnitude, and the temperature.
