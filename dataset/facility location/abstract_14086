The recent discovery of ten new dwarf galaxy candidates by the Dark Energy
Survey (DES) and the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System
(Pan-STARRS) could increase the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope's sensitivity
to annihilating dark matter particles, potentially enabling a definitive test
of the dark matter interpretation of the long-standing Galactic Center
gamma-ray excess. In this paper, we compare the previous analyses of Fermi data
from the directions of the new dwarf candidates (including the relatively
nearby Reticulum II) and perform our own analysis, with the goal of
establishing the statistical significance of any gamma-ray signal from these
sources. We confirm the presence of an excess from Reticulum II, with a
spectral shape that is compatible with the Galactic Center signal. The
significance of this emission is greater than that observed from 99.84% of
randomly chosen high-latitude blank-sky locations, corresponding to a local
detection significance of 3.2 sigma. We improve upon the standard blank-sky
calibration approach through the use of multi-wavelength catalogs, which allow
us to avoid regions that are likely to contain unresolved gamma-ray sources.
