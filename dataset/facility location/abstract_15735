A proof of the Riemann's hypothesis (RH) about the non-trivial zeros of the
Riemann zeta-function is presented. It is based on the construction of an
infinite family of operators D^{(k,l)} in one dimension, and their respective
eigenfunctions \psi_s (t), parameterized by continuous real indexes k and l.
Orthogonality of the eigenfunctions is connected to the zeros of the Riemann
zeta-function. Due to the fundamental Gauss-Jacobi relation and the Riemann
fundamental relation Z (s') = Z (1-s'), one can show that there is a direct
concatenation among the following symmetries, t goes to 1/t, s goes to \beta -
s (\beta a real), and s' goes to 1 - s', which establishes a one-to-one
correspondence between the label s of one orthogonal state to a unique vacuum
state, and a zero s' of the \zeta. It is shown that the RH is a direct
consequence of these symmetries, by arguing in particular that an exclusion of
a continuum of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function results in the discrete
set of the zeros located at the points s_n = 1/2 + i \lambda_n in the complex
plane.
