Photometry of the Galactic bulge, collected during the OGLE-II microlensing
search, indicates high and non-uniform interstellar extinction toward the
observed fields. We use the mean I-band magnitude and V-I color of red clump
stars as a tracer of interstellar extinction toward four small regions of the
Galactic bulge with highly variable reddening. Similar test is performed for
the most reddened region observed in the LMC.
  We find that the slope of the location of red clump stars in the
color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) in the Galactic bulge is significantly smaller
than the slope of the reddening line following the standard extinction law
(R_V=3.1) for approximations of the extinction curve by both Cardelli, Clayton
and Mathis (1989, CCM89) and Fitzpatrick (1999, F99). The differences are much
larger for the CCM89 approximation which, on the other hand, indicates the same
slopes for the control field in the LMC, contrary to the F99 approximation. We
discuss possible systematic effects that could cause the observed discrepancy.
Anomalous extinction toward the Galactic bulge seems to be the most natural
explanation. Our data indicate that, generally, the ratio of the total to
selective absorption, R_VI, is much smaller toward the Galactic bulge than the
value corresponding to the standard extinction curve (R_V=3.1). However, R_VI
varies from one line-of-sight to another.
  Our results explain why the red clump and RR Lyr stars in the Baade's window
dereddened with standard value of R_VI are redder compared to those of the
local population.
