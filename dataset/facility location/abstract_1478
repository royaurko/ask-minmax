We present a study, done with the Australian LBA, of HI absorption for two
compact radio galaxies (PKS 1549-79 and PKS 1814-63). In both the radio
galaxies, the HI appears to give us information about the environment in which
the radio sources are embedded, the effect that the ISM can have on the
observed characteristics and the possible presence of interaction between the
ISM and the radio plasma.
