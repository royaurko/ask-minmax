We study both the spin-average and spin-dependent structure functions of the
lithium isotopes, $^{6-11}$Li, which could be measured at RIKEN and other
nuclear facilities in the future. It is found that the light-cone momentum
distribution of the valence neutron in the halo of $^{11}$Li is very sharp and
symmetric around y = 1, because of the weak binding. The EMC ratios for Li
isotopes are then calculated. We study the possibility of extracting the
neutron structure function from data for the nuclear structure functions of the
Li isotopes. Next we calculate the spin-dependent structure functions of
$^{7,9,11}$Li isotopes, which have spin of 3/2. The effect of the nuclear
binding and Fermi motion on the multipole spin structure function,
$^{3/2}_{~1}g_1$, is about 10% in the region x < 0.7, but it becomes quite
important at large x. The spin structure function of $^{3/2}_{~3}g_1$ is also
investigated. Finally, we discuss the modification of the Gottfried and Bjorken
integrals in a nuclear medium and point out several candidates for a pair of
mirror nuclei to study the flavor-nonsinglet quark distributions in nuclei.
