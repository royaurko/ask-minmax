Previous studies have shown that the energy release mechanism of some solar
flares follow the Standard magnetic-reconnection model, but the detailed
properties of high-energy electrons produced in the flare are still not well
understood. We conducted a unique, multi-wavelength study that discloses the
spatial, temporal and energy distributions of the accelerated electrons in the
X2.2 solar flare on 2011, Feb. 15. We studied the source locations of seven
distinct temporal peaks observed in hard X-ray (HXR) and microwave (MW)
lightcurves using the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager
(RHESSI) in 50 to 75 keV channels and Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) in 34
GHz, respectively. We found that the seven emission peaks did not come from
seven spatially distinct sites in HXR and MW, but rather in HXR we observed a
sudden change in location only between the second and the third peak, with the
same pattern occurring, but evolving more slowly in MW. Comparison between the
HXR lightcurve and the temporal variations in intensity in the two MW source
kernels also confirmed that the seven peaks came predominantly from two
sources, each with multiple temporal peaks. In addition, we studied the
polarization properties of MW sources, and time delay between HXR and MW. We
discuss our results in the context of the tether-cutting model.
