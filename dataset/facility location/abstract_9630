The energy level spacing distribution of a tight-binding hamiltonian is
monitored across the mobility edge for a fixed disorder strength. Any mixing of
extended and localized levels is avoided in the configurational averages, thus
approaching the critical point very closely and with high energy resolution. By
finite size scaling the method is shown to provide a very accurate estimate of
the mobility edge and of the critical exponent for a cubic lattice with
lorentzian distributed diagonal disorder. Since no averaging in wide energy
windows is required, the method appears as a powerful tool for locating the
mobility edges in more complex models of real physical systems.
