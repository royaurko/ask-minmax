We obtain highly accurate solutions to the Thomas-Fermi equations for atoms
and atoms in very strong magnetic fields. We apply the Pad\'e-Hankel method,
numerical integration, power series with Pad\'e and Hermite-Pad\'e approximants
and Chebyshev polynomials. Both the slope at origin and the location of the
right boundary in the magnetic-field case are given with unprecedented
accuracy.
