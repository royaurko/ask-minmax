We investigate the analytic structure of the magnon S-matrix in the
spin-chain description of planar ${\cal N}=4$ SUSY Yang-Mills/$AdS_{5}\times
S^{5}$ strings. Semiclassical analysis suggests that the exact S-matrix must
have a large family of poles near the real axis in momentum space. In this
article we show that these are double poles corresponding to the exchange of
pairs of BPS magnons. Their locations in the complex plane are uniquely fixed
by the known dispersion relation for the BPS particles. The locations precisely
agree with the recent conjecture for the $S$ matrix by Beisert, Hernandez,
Lopez, Eden and Staudacher (hep-th/0609044 and hep-th/0610251). These poles do
not signal the presence of new bound states. In fact, a certain non-BPS
localized classical solution, which was thought to give rise to new bound
states, can actually decay into a pair of BPS magnons.
