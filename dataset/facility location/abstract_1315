We investigate the matching of continuous gravitational wave (CGW) signals in
an all sky search with reference to Earth based laser interferometric
detectors. We consider the source location as the parameters of the signal
manifold and templates corresponding to different source locations. It has been
found that the matching of signals from locations in the sky that differ in
their co-latitude and longitude by $\pi$ radians decreases with source
frequency. We have also made an analysis with the other parameters affecting
the symmetries. We observe that it may not be relevant to take care of the
symmetries in the sky locations for the search of CGW from the output of
LIGO-I, GEO600 and TAMA detectors.
