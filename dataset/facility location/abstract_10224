The consequences of large radius extra space-time compactified dimensions on
the four dimensional one loop effective potential are investigated for a model
which includes scalar self interactions and Yukawa coupling to fermions. The
Kaluza-Klein tower of states associated with the extra compact dimensions
shifts the location of the effective potential minimum and modifies its
curvature. The dependence of these effects on the radius of the extra dimension
is illustrated for various choices of coupling constants and masses. For large
radii, the consequence of twisting the fermion boundary condition on the
compactified dimensions is numerically found to produce but a negligible effect
on the effective potential.
