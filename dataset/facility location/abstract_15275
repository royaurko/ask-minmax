The IC 348 young star cluster contains more than 300 confirmed members. It is
embedded in the Perseus molecular cloud, making any clustering analysis subject
to an extinction bias. In this work, we derive the extinction map of the cloud
and revisit the content of IC 348 through a statistical approach that uses the
2MASS data. Our goal was to address the question of the completeness of IC 348
and of young clusters in general. We performed a combined analysis of the star
color and density in this region, in order to establish the surface density map
of the cluster. We reached the conclusion that IC 348 has structures up to 25'
from the cluster center, and we estimate that about 40 members brighter than
Ks=13 mag are still unidentified. Although we cannot use our statistical method
to identify these new members individually, the surface density map gives a
strong indication of their actual location. They are distributed in the outer
regions of the cluster, where very few dedicated observations have been made so
far, which is probably why they escaped previous identification. In addition,
we propose the existence of a new embedded cluster associated to the infrared
source MSX6C G160.2784-18.4216, about 38' south of IC 348.
