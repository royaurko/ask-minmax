Recent results have shown that many of the known extrasolar planetary systems
contain regions which are stable for massless test particles. We examine the
possibility that Saturn-mass planets exist in these systems, just below the
detection threshold, and attempt to predict likely orbital parameters for such
unseen planets. To do this, we insert a Saturn-mass planet into the stable
regions of these systems and integrate its orbit for 100 million years. We
conduct 200-600 of these experiments to test parameter space in HD37124,
HD38529, 55Cnc, and HD74156. In HD37124 the global maximum of the survival rate
of Saturns in parameter space is at semimajor axis a = 1.03 AU, eccentricity
e=0.1. In HD38529, only 5% of Saturns are unstable, and the region in which a
Saturn could survive is very broad, centered on 0.5<a<0.6, e<0.2. In 55Cnc we
find three maxima at (a,e) = (1.0 AU, 0.02), (2.0 AU, 0.08), and (3.0 AU,
0.17). In HD74156 we find a broad maximum with $a$ = 0.9-1.2 AU, e<=0.15.
Several of these maxima are located in the habitable zones of their parent
stars and are therefore of astrobiological interest. We suggest the possibility
that companions may lie in these locations of parameter space, and encourage
further observational investigation of these systems.
