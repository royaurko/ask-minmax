Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common abnormal heart rhythm and the
single biggest cause of stroke. Ablation, destroying regions of the atria, is
applied largely empirically and can be curative but with a disappointing
clinical success rate. We design a simple model of activation wavefront
propagation on a structure mimicking the branching network architecture of
heart muscle and show how AF emerges spontaneously as age-related parameters
change. We identify regions responsible for the initiation and maintenance of
AF, the ablation of which terminates AF. The simplicity of the model allows us
to calculate analytically the risk of arrhythmia. This analytical result allows
us to locate the transition in parameter space and highlights that the
transition from regular to fibrillatory behaviour is a finite-size effect
present in systems of any size. These clinically testable predictions might
inform ablation therapies and arrhythmic risk assessment.
