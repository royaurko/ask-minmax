Consider the model where nodes are initially distributed as a Poisson point
process with intensity $\lambda$ over $\mathbb{R}^d$ and are moving in
continuous time according to independent Brownian motions. We assume that nodes
are capable of detecting all points within distance $r$ of their location and
study the problem of determining the first time at which a target particle,
which is initially placed at the origin of $\mathbb{R}^d$, is detected by at
least one node. We consider the case where the target particle can move
according to any continuous function and can adapt its motion based on the
location of the nodes. We show that there exists a sufficiently large value of
$\lambda$ so that the target will eventually be detected almost surely. This
means that the target cannot evade detection even if it has full information
about the past, present and future locations of the nodes. Also, this
establishes a phase transition for $\lambda$ since, for small enough $\lambda$,
with positive probability the target can avoid detection forever. A key
ingredient of our proof is to use fractal percolation and multi-scale analysis
to show that cells with a small density of nodes do not percolate in space and
time.
