We present some results pertaining quantities which are regarded as good
indicators of the pseudo-critical temperatures for the deconfinement and
partial chiral restoration transitions using a polynomial form for the Polyakov
potential part and an extended version of the NJL model which includes 6 and 8
quark interaction terms. Some comparisons with results from the lattice
formulation of QCD (lQCD) are performed and results for the location of the
critical endoint in the phase diagram are also presented. It is shown that the
comparison with lQCD results favors a moderately strong OZI-violating 8 quark
interaction term.
