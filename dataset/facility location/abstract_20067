We present the first set of maps and band-merged catalog from the Herschel
Stripe 82 Survey (HerS). Observations at 250, 350, and 500 micron were taken
with the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) instrument aboard
the Herschel Space Observatory. HerS covers 79 deg$^2$ along the SDSS Stripe 82
to a depth of 13.0, 12.9, and 14.8 mJy beam$^{-1}$ (including confusion) at
250, 350, and 500 micron, respectively. HerS was designed to measure
correlations with external tracers of the dark matter density field --- either
point-like (i.e., galaxies selected from radio to X-ray) or extended (i.e.,
clusters and gravitational lensing) --- in order to measure the bias and
redshift distribution of intensities of infrared-emitting dusty star-forming
galaxies and AGN. By locating HeRS in Stripe 82, we maximize the overlap with
available and upcoming cosmological surveys. The band-merged catalog contains
3.3x10$^4$ sources detected at a significance of >3 $\sigma$ (including
confusion noise). The maps and catalog are available at
