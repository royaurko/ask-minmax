Advances in the technologies of networking, wireless communication and
trimness of computers lead to the rapid development in mobile communication
infrastructure, and have drastically changed information processing on mobile
devices. Users carrying portable devices can freely move around, while still
connected to the network. This provides flexibility in accessing information
anywhere at any time. For improving more flexibility on mobile device, the new
challenges in designing software systems for mobile networks include location
and mobility management, channel allocation, power saving and security. In this
paper, we are proposing intelligent software tool for software design on mobile
devices to fulfill the new challenges on mobile location and mobility
management. In this study, the proposed Business Process Redesign (BPR) concept
is aims at an extension of the capabilities of an existing, widely used process
modeling tool in industry with 'Intelligent' capabilities to suggest favorable
alternatives to an existing software workflow design for improving
flexibilities on mobile devices.
