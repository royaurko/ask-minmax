A literature review of related articles, either by affinity or by contrast,
to a fundamental theory of time and space - time previously developed. It shows
how from a primitive concept of preparticle and membership relation of set
theory, and four postulates that refer to simple concepts, derived concepts of
time, space-time, reference frame, particle, fields, and interaction between
fields are obtained. The problem of the "direction " of time is analyzed and a
paradox whose solution goes against the idea that this direction is fixed by
the increase of entropy prescribed by the second law of thermodynamics is
examined. In our theory this direction is unique to each reference frame, and
is an intrinsic property of time. Two kinds of particles are described as
derived concepts, and it is shown that one of them fullfills the Bose-Einstein
statistics, and the other one fullfills the Fermi-Dirac statistics. We also
consider the analysis of the wave function concepts and particle detector as
concepts derived from the mentioned theory. Using these concepts, the process
of locating both a macroscopic body (typical location) as well as one of a
microscopic scale (quantum localization) is analyzed, and the significance of
the location is examined in both cases.
