Radio continuum observations at 20 and 6 cm of the highly inclined Virgo
spiral galaxy NGC 4522 are presented. Both, 20 and 6 cm total emission
distributions are asymmetric with an extended component to the west where
extraplanar atomic gas and Halpha emission are found. The 6 cm polarized
emission is located at the eastern edge of the galactic disk. Its peak is
located about 1 kpc to the east of the total emission peak. We argue that this
phenomena is a characteristic feature for cluster galaxies which are
experiencing significant pressure from the intracluster medium. The degree of
polarization decreases from the east to the west. The flattest spectral index
between 20 and 6 cm coincides with the peak of the 6 cm polarized emission.
These findings are consistent with a picture of a large scale shock due to ram
pressure located at the east of the galaxy where cosmic rays are accelerated.
We conclude that it is likely that the galaxy experiences active ram pressure.
