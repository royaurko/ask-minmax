KEK has emphasized efforts to develop the RHQNb3Al superconductor and a
sub-scale magnet reaching 13 T towards the HL-LHC upgrade in last years. In
addition, relevant R&D regarding radiation resistance has been carried out. For
higher field magnets beyond 15 T, HTS in combination with A15 superconductors
should be one of baseline materials. However, all these superconductors are
very sensitive to stress and strain and thorough understanding of behaviour is
truly desired for realization of high field magnets. KEK has launched a new
research subject on stress/strain sensitivity of HTS and A15 superconductors in
collaboration with the neutron diffraction facility at J-PARC and High Field
Laboratory in Tohoku University. Present activity for high field magnets at KEK
is reported.
