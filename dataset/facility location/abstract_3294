A precise derivation of the evolution of the Tully Fisher is crucial to
understand the interplay between dark matter and baryonic matter in
cosmological models, Using 15 deployable integral field units of FLAMES/GIRAFFE
at VLT, we have recovered the velocity fields of 35 galaxies at intermediate
redshift (0.4 < z < 0.75). This facility is able to recover the velocity fields
of almost all the emission line galaxies with Iab <=22.5 and W_0(OII)>=15A In
our sample, we find only 35% rotating disks. These rotating disks produce a
Tully-Fisher relationship (stellar mass or M_K versus V_max) which has
apparently not evolved in slope, zero point and scatter since z=0.6. The only
evolution found is a brightening of the B band luminosity of a third of the
disks, possibly due to an enhancement of the star formation. The very large
scatters found in previously reported Tully-Fisher relationships at moderate
redshifts are caused by the numerous (65%) galaxies with perturbed or complex
kinematics. Those galaxies include minor or major mergers, merger remnants
and/or inflow/outflows and their kinematics can be easily misidentified by slit
spectroscopy. Their presence suggests a strong evolution in the dynamical
properties of galaxies during the last 7 Gyrs.
