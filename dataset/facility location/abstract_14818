In this paper we report and discuss the results of a radio survey in the
A3571 cluster complex, a structure located in the Shapley Concentration core,
and formed by the three clusters A3571, A3572 and A3575. The survey was carried
out simultaneously at 22 cm and 13 cm with the Australia Telescope Compact
Array, and led to the detection of 124 radio sources at 22 cm. The radio source
counts in this region are in agreement with the background counts. Among the 36
radio sources with optical counterpart, six have measured redshift which places
them at the distance of the A3571 cluster complex, and nine radio sources have
optical counterparts most likely members of this cluster complex. All radio
galaxies emit at low power level, i.e. logP$_{22cm}$ (W Hz$^{-1}$) $\le$ 22.6.
A number of them are likely to be starburst galaxies. The radio luminosity
function of early type galaxies is in agreement with that derived by Ledlow &
Owen (1996) if we restrict our analysis to the A3571 cluster. On the basis of
the multiwavelength properties of the A3571 cluster complex, we propose that it
is a very advanced merger, and explain the radio properties derived from our
study in the light of this hypothesis.
