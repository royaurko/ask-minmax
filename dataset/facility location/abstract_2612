It is proposed that a multi-MW superconducting proton/electron linac (SCL)
and a proton injector (PI) be built at KEK. The 3 GeV PI would serve both as an
injector to the SCL and a source of proton beams that could be used to
copiously produce neutrons and muons. Protons accelerated by the SCL to 20 GeV
would be transferred through the KEK Tristan ring in order to create neutrino,
kaon and muon beams for fixed-target experiments. At a later stage, a 60 GeV
proton synchrotron could be installed inside the Tristan ring. The SCL,
comprising 1.3 GHZ superconducting ILC-type rf cavities, could also accelerate
polarized or unpolarized electron beams. After acceleration, electrons may
traverse an XFEL undulator, or could be used to produce polarized positrons. An
SCL-based synchrotron light source for applications in materials science and
medicine is also envisaged. The proposed facility would be constructed using
the existing KEK accelerator infrastructure.
