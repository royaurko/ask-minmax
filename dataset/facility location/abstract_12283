The effect of dephasing on electron transport through a benzene molecule is
carefully examined using a phenomenological model introduced by B\"{u}ttiker.
Within a tight-binding framework all the calculations are performed based on
the Green's function formalism. We investigate the influence of dephasing on
transmission probability and current-voltage characteristics for three
different configurations ({\em ortho}, {\em meta} and {\em para}) of the
molecular system depending on the locations of two contacting leads. The
presence of dephasing provides a significant change in the spectral properties
of the molecule and exhibits several interesting patterns that have so far
remain unexplored.
