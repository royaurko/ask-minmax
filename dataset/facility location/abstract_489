ILC detectors are required to have unprecedented precision. Achieving this
requires significant investment for test beam activities to complete the
detector R&D needed, to test prototypes and (later) to qualify final detector
system designs, including integrated system test. This document summarizes the
discussion at this workshop on the test beam facilities and detector R&D
programs to be performed there.
