Ultracold neutrons (UCNs) were produced in a 4 liter volume of superfluid
helium using the PF1B cold neutron beam facility at the Institut Laue-Langevin
and then extracted to a detector at room temperature. With a converter
temperature of 1.08 K the number of accumulated UCNs was counted to be
$91,\!700 \pm 300$. From this, we derive a volumetric UCN production rate of
$(6.9 \pm 1.7)\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}\,s^{-1}}$, which includes a correction for
losses in the converter during UCN extraction caused by a short storage time,
but not accounting for UCN transport and detection efficiencies. The
up-scattering rate of UCNs due to excitations in the superfluid was studied by
scanning the temperature between 1.2-2.4 K. Using the temperature-dependent UCN
production rate calculated from inelastic neutron scattering data in the
analysis, the only UCN up-scattering process found to be present was from
two-phonon scattering. Our analysis rules out contributions from the other
scattering processes to $\lesssim 10\%$ of their predicted levels.
