We consider a highly unconventional approach to generating muon and antimuon
bunches for a neutrino factory or muon collider: electron-positron annihilation
just above muon-antimuon threshold. This approach can produce low-emittance
bunches at high energy, easing the muon-cooling and acceleration challenges in
such facilities. However, the small (< 1 $\mu$b) useable production cross
section means that extraordinary beam-power and targeting challenges would have
to be met. We speculate on what this might entail.
