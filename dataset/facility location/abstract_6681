The combined considerations of both the bulk liquid-drop-type behawior and
the quantized angular momentum reveal that high-spin toroidal isomeric states
may have general occurrences for light nuclei with 28 <= A <= 48. High-spin N=Z
toroidal isomers in this mass region have been located theoretically using
cranked self-consistent constraint Skyrme-Hartree-Fock model calculations.
