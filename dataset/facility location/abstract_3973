We present polarimetric observations of 7 pre-main-sequence (PMS)
spectroscopic binaries located in the rho Oph and Upper Sco star forming
regions (SFRs). The average observed polarizations at 7660A are between 0.5%
and 3.5%. After estimates of the interstellar polarization are removed, all
binaries have an intrinsic polarization above 0.4%. Two binaries,
NTTS162814-2427 and NTTS162819-2423S, present high levels of intrinsic
polarization between 1.5% and 2.1%. All 7 PMS binaries have a statistically
variable or possibly variable polarization. Combining these results with our
previous sample of binaries located in the Tau, Aur and Ori SFRs, 68% of the
binaries have an intrinsic polarization above 0.5%, and 90% of the binaries are
polarimetrically variable or possibly variable. NTTS160814-1857,
NTTS162814-2427, and NTTS162819-2423S are clearly polarimetrically variable.
The first two also exhibit phase-locked variations over ~10 and ~40 orbits
respectively. NTTS160905-1859 shows periodic variations that are not
phased-locked and only present for short intervals of time. The amplitudes of
the variations reach a few tenths of a percent. The high-eccentricity system
NTTS162814-2427 shows single-periodic variations, in agreement with our
previous numerical simulations. Non-periodic events introduce stochastic noise
that partially masks the periodic variations and prevents the Brown, McLean, &
Emslie (1978) formalism from finding a reasonable estimate of the inclination.
