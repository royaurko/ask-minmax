Trumpler 16 is a well--known rich star cluster containing the eruptive
supergiant $\eta$ Carin\ae\ and located in the Carina star-forming complex. In
the context of the Chandra Carina Complex Project, we study Trumpler 16 using
new and archival X-ray data. A revised X-ray source list of the Trumpler 16
region contains 1232 X-ray sources including 1187 likely Carina members. These
are matched to 1047 near-infrared counterparts detected by the HAWK-I
instrument at the VLT allowing for better selection of cluster members. The
cluster is irregular in shape. Although it is roughly circular, there is a high
degree of sub-clustering, no noticeable central concentration and an extension
to the southeast. The high--mass stars show neither evidence of mass
segregation nor evidence of strong differential extinction. The derived
power-law slope of the X-ray luminosity function for Trumpler 16 reveals a much
steeper function than the Orion Nebula Cluster implying different ratio of
solar- to higher-mass stars. We estimate the total Trumpler 16 pre-main
sequence population to be > 6500 Class II and Class III X-ray sources. An
overall K-excess disk frequency of ~ 8.9% is derived using the X-ray selected
sample, although there is some variation among the sub-clusters, especially in
the Southeastern extension. X-ray emission is detected from 29 high--mass stars
with spectral types between B2 and O3.
