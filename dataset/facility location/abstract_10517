A comparison of calculated and experimental Q_alpha values of superheavy
even-even nuclei and a few selected odd-N nuclei is presented in the framework
of the relativistic mean-field model with the parameterization NL-Z2. Blocking
effects are found to be important for a proper description of Q_alpha of odd
mass nuclei. The model gives a good overall description of the available
experimental data. The mass and charge assignment of the recently measured
decay chains from Dubna and Berkeley is in agreement with the predictions of
the model. The analysis of the new data does not allow a final conclusion about
the location of the expected island of spherical doubly-magic superheavy
nuclei.
