We present the first measurement of the muon neutrino spectrum at the T2K
near detector, ND280, using the data collected at the JPARC acc\ elerator
facility in Tokai, Japan. ND280 is located 280 meters downstream from the
target and 2.5$^\circ$ off-axis from the direction of the beam. The measured
spectrum at ND280 constrains the flux and cross section uncertainties\ in the
T2K oscillation analysis. We select inclusive charged-current (CC) events from
muon \ neutrinos in ND280. These are separated into a charged current
quasi-elastic (CCQE) enhanced sample and a CC non\ -QE sample. We then fit the
muon spectrum for both samples to extract flux and cross section parameters,
which are used as inputs into T2K's os\ cillation analysis. We separately
produce a flux-averaged differential inclusive CC cross-se\ ction in the
2-dimensional plane of muon momentum and angle. For the cross-section
measurement the flux is given by the MC and tuned to data from the NA61
experiment. We present the event selection, detector uncertainties, and final
measurement result for both the spectrum and for the cross-section.
