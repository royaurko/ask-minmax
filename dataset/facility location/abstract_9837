Motivated by ferrimagnetic oligonuclear and chain compounds synthesized by
Caneschi et al., both of which consist of alternating manganese(II) ions and
nitronyl-nitroxide radicals, we calculate the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation
rate 1/T_1 employing a recently developed modified spin-wave theory. 1/T_1 as a
function of temperature drastically varies with the location of probe nuclei in
both clusters and chains, though the relaxation time scale is much larger in
zero dimension than in one dimension. 1/T_1 as a function of an applied field
in long chains forms a striking contrast to that in finite clusters, diverging
with decreasing field like inverse square root at low temperatures and
logarithmically at high temperatures.
