In transportation and other types of facilities, various queues arise when
the demands of service are higher than the supplies, and many point and fluid
queue models have been proposed to study such queueing systems. However, there
has been no unified approach to deriving such models, analyzing their
relationships and properties, and extending them for networks. In this paper,
we derive point queue models as limits of two link-based queueing model: the
link transmission model and a link queue model. With two definitions for demand
and supply of a point queue, we present four point queue models, four
approximate models, and their discrete versions. We discuss the properties of
these models, including equivalence, well-definedness, smoothness, and queue
spillback, both analytically and with numerical examples. We then analytically
solve Vickrey's point queue model and stationary states in various models. We
demonstrate that all existing point and fluid queue models in the literature
are special cases of those derived from the link-based queueing models. Such a
unified approach leads to systematic methods for studying the queueing process
at a point facility and will also be helpful for studies on stochastic queues
as well as networks of queues.
