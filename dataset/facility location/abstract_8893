While most gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are now believed to be from cosmological
distances, the origin of very short-time GRBs is still not known. In the past,
we have shown that GRBs with time duration (T90) less than 100 ms may form a
separate class of GRBs based on the hardness and time distribution of these
events. We have also shown that the ln N ln S distribution is consistent with
the expectation of quasi-Euclidean distribution of sources. In this paper, we
report the study of the angular location of these GRBs showing a strong
deviation from isotropy within the Galactic coordinates of plus 180 degrees <
longitude < 90 degrees and -30 degrees < latitude < 30 degrees. We have studied
the rest of the GRBs and do not find a similar deviation. This further
indicates that the very-short GRBs likely form a separate class of GRBs, most
probably from sources of Galactic or near solar origin.
