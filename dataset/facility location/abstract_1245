The current progress of materials science regarding multifunctional materials
(MFM) has put forward the challenges to understand the microscopic origin of
their properties. Most of such MFMs have magneto-elastic correlations. To
investigate the underlying mechanism, it is therefore essential to investigate
the structural properties in the presence of magnetic field. Keeping this in
view low temperature and high magnetic field (LTHM) powder x-ray diffraction
(XRD), a unique state-of-art facility in India has been developed at CSR
Indore. This setup works on symmetric Bragg Brentano geometry using a parallel
incident x-ray beam from a rotating anode source working at 17 kW. Using this
one can do structural studies at non-ambient conditions i.e. at low-
temperatures (2-300 K) and high magnetic field (+8 to -8 T). The available
scattering angle ranges from 5{\deg} to 115{\deg} 2{\theta} with a resolution
better than 0.1{\deg}. The proper functioning of the setup has been checked
using Si sample. The effect of magnetic field on the structural properties has
been demonstrated on Pr0.5Sr0.5MnO3 sample. Clear effect of field induced phase
transition has been observed. Moreover, the effect of zero field cooled and
field cooled conditions is also observed.
