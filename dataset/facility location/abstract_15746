A d-dimensional rational polytope P is a polytope whose vertices are located
at the nodes of d-dimensional Z-lattice. Consider a number of points inside the
inflated polytope (with coefficient of inflation k, k=1,2, 3...). The Ehrhart
polynomial of P counts the number of such lattice points (nodes) inside the
inflated P and (may be) at its faces (including vertices). In Part I
(hep-th/0410242) of our four parts work we noticed that the Veneziano amplitude
is just the Laplace transform of the generating function (considered as a
partition function in the sence of statistical mechanics) for the Ehrhart
polynomial for the regular inflated simplex obtained as a deformation retract
of the Fermat (hyper) surface living in complex projective space. This
observation is sufficient for development of new symplectic (this work) and
supersymmetric (hep-th/0411241)physical models reproducing the Veneziano (and
Veneziano-like) amplitudes. General ideas (e.g.those related to the properties
of Ehrhart polynomials) are illustrated by simple practical examples (e.g. use
of mirror symmetry for explanation of available experimental data on pion-pion
scattering) worked out in some detail. Obtained final results are in formal
accord with those earlier obtained by Vergne [PNAS 93 (1996) 14238].
