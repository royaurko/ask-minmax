We have modified the single pulse target experimental facility[ ] on the
Experimental Test Accelerator II (ETA-II) to perform the double pulse target
experiments to validate the DARHT-II[, ] multi-pulse target concept. The 1.15
MeV, 2 kA Snowtron injector will provide the first electron pulse. The 6 MeV, 2
kA ETA-II beam will be used as the probe beam. Our modeling indicates that the
ETA-II/Snowtron experiment is a reasonable scaling experiment.
