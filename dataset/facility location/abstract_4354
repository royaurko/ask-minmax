We define the class of Left Located Divisor (LLD) meromorphic functions and
their vertical order $m_0(f)$ and their convergence exponent $d(f)$. When
$m_0(f)\leq d(f)$ we prove that their Weierstrass genus is minimal. This
explains the phenomena that many classical functions have minimal Weierstrass
genus, for example Dirichlet series, the $\Gamma$-function, and trigonometric
functions.
