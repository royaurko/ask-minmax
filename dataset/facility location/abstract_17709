The supermassive black hole at the Galactic center, Sagittarius A*, has
experienced periods of higher activity in the past. The reflection of these
past outbursts is observed in the molecular material surrounding the black hole
but reconstructing its precise lightcurve is difficult since the distribution
of the clouds along the line of sight is poorly constrained. Using Chandra
high-resolution data collected from 1999 to 2011 we studied both the 6.4 keV
and the 4-8 keV emission of the region located between Sgr A* and the Radio
Arc, characterizing its variations down to 15" angular scale and 1-year time
scale. The emission from the molecular clouds in the region varies
significantly, showing either a 2-year peaked emission or 10-year linear
variations. This is the first time that such fast variations are measured.
Based on the cloud parameters, we conclude that these two behaviors are likely
due to two distinct past outbursts of Sgr A* during which its luminosity rose
to at least 10^39 erg/s.
