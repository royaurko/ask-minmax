This paper explores the potential of brain-computer interfaces in segmenting
objects from images. Our approach is centered around designing an effective
method for displaying the image parts to the users such that they generate
measurable brain reactions. When an image region, specifically a block of
pixels, is displayed we estimate the probability of the block containing the
object of interest using a score based on EEG activity. After several such
blocks are displayed, the resulting probability map is binarized and combined
with the GrabCut algorithm to segment the image into object and background
regions. This study shows that BCI and simple EEG analysis are useful in
locating object boundaries in images.
