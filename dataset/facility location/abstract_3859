Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) in the soft x-ray range is an
element-specific energy-loss spectroscopy used to probe the electronic and
magnetic excitations in strongly correlated solids. In the recent years, RIXS
has been progressing very quickly in terms of energy resolution and
understanding of the experimental results, but the interpretation of spectra
could further improve, sometimes decisively, from a full knowledge of the
polarization of incident and scattered photons. Here we present the first
implementation, in a high resolution RIXS spectrometer used to analyze the
scattered radiation, of a device allowing the measurement of the degree of
linear polarization. The system, based on a graded W/B4C multilayer mirror
installed in proximity of the CCD detector, has been installed on the AXES
spectrometer at the ESRF; it has been fully characterized and it has been used
for a demonstration experiment at the Cu L3 edge on a high-Tc superconducting
cuprate. The loss in efficiency suffered by the spectrometer equipped with this
test facility was a factor 17.5. We propose also a more advanced version,
suitable for a routine use on the next generation of RIXS spectrometers and
with an overall efficiency up to 10%.
