In the context of the LAUE project for focusing hard X-/gamma rays, a petal
of the complete lens is being assembled at the LARIX facility in the Department
of Physics and Earth Science of the University of Ferrara. The lens petal
structure is composed of bent Germanium and Gallium Arsenide crystals in
transmission geometry. We present the expectations derived from a mathematical
model of the lens petal. The extension of the model for the complete LAUE
project in the 90 -- 600 keV energy range will be discussed as well. A
quantitative analysis of the results of these simulations is also presented.
