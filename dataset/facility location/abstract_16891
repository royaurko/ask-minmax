Present applications of the dispersive-optical-model analysis are restricted
by the use of a local but energy-dependent version of the generalized
Hartree-Fock potential. This restriction is lifted by the introduction of a
corresponding nonlocal potential without explicit energy dependence. Such a
strategy allows for a complete determination of the nucleon propagator below
the Fermi energy with access to the expectation value of one-body operators
(like the charge density), the one-body density matrix with associated natural
orbits, and complete spectral functions for removal strength. The present
formulation of the dispersive optical model (DOM) therefore allows the use of
elastic electron-scattering data in determining its parameters. Application to
${}^{40}$Ca demonstrates that a fit to the charge radius leads to too much
charge near the origin using the conventional assumptions of the functional
form of the DOM. A corresponding incomplete description of high-momentum
components is identified, suggesting that the DOM formulation must be extended
in the future to accommodate such correlations properly. Unlike the local
version, the present nonlocal DOM limits the location of the deeply-bound hole
states to energies that are consistent with (\textit{e,e}$^{\prime}$\textit{p})
and (\textit{p,2p}) data.
