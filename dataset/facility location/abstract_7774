We present a study of 7 large solar proton events (SPEs) of current solar
cycle 24 (from 2009 January up to date). They were recorded by GOES spacecraft
with highest proton fluxes over 200 pfu for energies $>$10 MeV. In situ
particle measurements show that: (1) The profiles of the proton fluxes are
highly dependent of the locations of their solar sources, namely flares or
coronal mass ejections (CMEs); (2) The solar particle release (SPR) times fall
in the decay phase of the flare emission, and are in accordance with the times
when the CMEs travel to an average height of 7.9 solar radii; (3) The time
differences between the SPR and the flare peak are also dependent of the
locations of the solar active regions (ARs). The results tend to support the
concept of proton acceleration by the CME-driven shock, even though there
exists a possibility of particle acceleration at flare site with subsequent
perpendicular diffusion of accelerated particles in the interplanetary magnetic
field (IMF). We derive the integral time-of-maximum (TOM) spectra of solar
protons in two forms: a single power-law distribution and a power law broken
with an exponential tail. It is found that the unique Ground Level Enhancement
(GLE) event on 2012 May 17 displays a hardest spectrum and a largest broken
energy that may explain why the this event could extend to relativistic energy.
