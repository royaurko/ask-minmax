We propose using the self energy defined for the electron removal Green's
function. Starting from the electron removal Green's function, we obtained
expressions for the removal self energy Sigma^ER (k,omega) that are applicable
for non-quasiparticle photoemission spectral functions from a single band
system. Our method does not assume momentum independence and produces the self
energy in the full k-omega space. The method is applied to the angle resolved
photoemission from Ca_2CuO_2Cl_2 and the result is found to be compatible with
the self energy value from the peak width of sharp features. The self energy is
found to be only weakly k-dependent. In addition, the Im Sigma shows a maximum
at around 1 eV where the high energy kink is located.
