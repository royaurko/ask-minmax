Observations of the yellow hypergiant Rho Cas obtained in 2007-2011 in a wide
wavelength region with spectral resolution about 60000 have enabled studies of
features of its optical spectrum in detail and brought to light previously
unknown characteristics of the extended atmosphere of the star. The radial
velocity measured from symmetric absorptions of metals varies with an amplitude
of about +/-7 km/s around the systemic velocity Vsys=-47 km/s, due to
low-amplitude pulsations of the atmospheric layers near the photosphere. At
some times, a velocity gradient was found in deep atmospheric layers of the
star. A slight velocity stratification in the stellar atmosphere was detected
for the first time, manifested as a difference of 3-4 km/s in the velocities
measured from absorption lines of neutral metals and of ions. The
long-wavelength components of split absorptions of BaII, SrII, TiII, and other
strong lines with low excitation potentials for their lower levels are
distorted by nearby emission lines. It is suggested that the short-wavelength
components, whose locations correspond to the narrow velocity range Vr(blue)
from approximately -60 to -70 km/s, are formed in a circumstellar envelope; one
component of the D~NaI doublet and the emission components of the FeII 6369.46
and 6432.68 ions are also formed there.
