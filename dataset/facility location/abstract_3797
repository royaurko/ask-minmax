As todays world grows with the technology on the other hand it seems to be
small with the World Wide Web. With the use of Internet more and more
information can be search from the web. When Users fires a query they want
relevancy in obtained results. In general, search engines perform the ranking
of web pages in an offline mode, which is after the web pages have been
retrieved and stored in the database. But most of the time this method does not
provide relevant results as most of the search engines were using some ranking
algorithms like page Rank, HITS, SALSA and Hilltop. Where these algorithms does
not always provides the results based on the semantic web. So a concept of
Ontology is been introduced in search engines to get more meaningful and
relevant results with respect to the users query.Ontologies are used to capture
knowledge about some domain of interest. Ontology describes the concepts in the
domain and also the relationships that hold between those concepts. Different
ontology languages provide different facilities. The most recent development in
standard ontology languages is OWL (Ontology Web Language) from the World Wide
Web Consortium. OWL makes it possible to describe concept to its full extent
and enables the search engines to provide accurate results to the user.
