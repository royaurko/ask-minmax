Consistent Lagrangian description of lightlike p-branes (LL-branes) is
presented in two equivalent forms - a Polyakov-type formulation and a dual to
it Nambu-Goto-type formulation. An important characteristic feature of the
LL-branes is that the brane tension appears as a non-trivial additional
dynamical degree of freedom. Next, properties of p=2 LL-brane dynamics (as a
test brane) in D=4 Kerr or Kerr-Newman gravitational backgrounds are discussed
in some detail. It is shown that the LL-brane automatically positions itself on
the horizon and rotates along with the same angular velocity. Finally, a
Misner-Wheeler-type of Reissner-Nordstroem wormhole is constructed in a
self-consistent electrically sourceless Einstein-Maxwell system in the D=4 bulk
interacting with a LL-brane. The pertinent wormhole throat is located precisely
at the LL-brane sitting on the outer Reissner-Nordstroem horizon with the
Reissner-Nordstroem mass and charge being functions of the dynamical LL-brane
tension.
