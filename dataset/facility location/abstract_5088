A new watt balance is being constructed at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) in preparation for the redefinition of the
International System of Units and the realization of mass through an exact
value of the Planck constant. The total relative uncertainty goal for this
instrument of a few parts in $10^{8}$ requires that the local acceleration due
to gravity be known at the location of a test mass with a relative uncertainty
on the order of only a few parts in $10^{9}$. To make this determination, both
the horizontal and vertical gradients of gravity must be known such that
gravity may be tied from an absolute reference in the laboratory to the precise
mass location. We describe the procedures used to model and measure gravity
variations throughout the laboratory and give our results.
