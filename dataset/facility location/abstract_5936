A microcanonical finite-size scaling ansatz is discussed. It exploits the
existence of a well-defined transition point for systems of finite size in the
microcanonical ensemble. The best data collapse obtained for small systems
yields values for the critical exponents in good agreement with other
approaches. The exact location of the infinite system critical point is not
needed when extracting critical exponents from the microcanonical finite-size
scaling theory.
