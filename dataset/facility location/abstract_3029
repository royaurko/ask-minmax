We derive the value of the dark matter density at the Sun's location (rho_0)
without globally mass-modeling the Galaxy. The proposed method relies on the
local equation of centrifugal equilibrium and is independent of i) the shape of
the dark matter density profile, ii) knowledge of the rotation curve from the
galaxy center out to the virial radius, and iii) the uncertainties and the
non-uniqueness of the bulge/disk/dark halo mass decomposition. The result can
be obtained in analytic form. It explicitly includes the dependence on the
relevant observational quantities and takes their uncertainties into account.
By adopting the reference, state-of-the-art values for these, we find rho_0 =
0.43(11)(10)GeV/cm3, where the quoted uncertainties are respectively due to the
uncertainty in the slope of the circular-velocity at the Sun location and the
ratio between this radius and the length scale of the stellar exponential thin
disk. We obtain a reliable estimate of rho_0, that, in addition, is ready to
take into account any future change/improvement in the measures of the
observational quantities it depends on.
