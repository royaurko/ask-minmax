The late light curves of SN 1989B exhibited an emission excess relative to
other type Ia supernovae. We investigate whether this emission excess suggests
light echo emission from this supernova, or rather intense background galaxy
contamination at the location of the supernova. We conclude that stellar
emission can better explain the late spectra, and that the emission excess is
likely due to background contamination.
