The evolution of the non-thermal emission emitted by pulsar wind nebulae is
generally calculated using spatially-independent particle transport models.
Although useful, these models implicitly assume that the source of non-thermal
particles is located uniformly throughout the system, contrary to the nature of
pulsar wind nebulae where the source is located at the centre of the system.
Additionally, it is not possible to take into account the spatial properties of
the magnetic field and flow velocity, or the effects of diffusion and gradient
and curvature drifts in these models. In this paper we present an extension to
the current nebula models by including a spatial dependence in our numerical
solutions of a Fokker-Planck particle transport equation. These solutions also
show the effect that the magnetic field structure has on the evolution of the
particle spectrum. Although applied within the context of pulsar wind nebulae,
the presented solutions are equally valid for any similar central source system
such as globular clusters.
