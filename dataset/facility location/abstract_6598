We investigated the magnetic properties of hydrogen plasma treated ZnO single
crystals by SQUID magnetometry. In agreement with the expected hydrogen
penetration depth we found ferromagnetic behavior located at the first 20 nm of
the H-treated surface of ZnO with magnetization at saturation up to 6 emu/g at
300 K and Curie temperature T$_c$ $\gtrsim $ 400 K. In the ferromagnetic
samples a hydrogen concentration of a few atomic percent in the first 20 nm
surface layer was determined by nuclear reaction analysis. The saturation
magnetization of H-treated ZnO increases with the concentration of hydrogen.
