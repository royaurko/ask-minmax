Results of optical identification of the ASCA Lynx deep survey are presented.
Six X-ray sources are detected in the 2-7 keV band using the SIS in a 20'x20'
field of view with fluxes larger than ~4x10^{-14} erg s-1 cm-2 in the band.
Follow-up optical spectroscopic observations were made, and five out of six
sources are identified with AGNs/QSOs at redshifts of 0.5-1.3. We also identify
two more additional X-ray sources detected in a soft X-ray band with AGNs/QSOs.
It is found that three QSOs identified are located at z~1.3. Two rich clusters
and several groups of galaxies are also placed at the same redshift in the
surveyed field, and projected separations between the QSOs and the clusters are
3-8 Mpc at the redshift.
