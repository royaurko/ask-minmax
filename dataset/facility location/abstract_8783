In modern hierarchical theories of structure formation, rich clusters of
galaxies form at the vertices of a weblike distribution of matter, with
filaments emanating from them to large distances and with smaller objects
forming and draining in along these filaments. The amount of mass contained in
structure near the cluster can be comparable to the collapsed mass of the
cluster itself. As the lensing kernel is quite broad along the line of sight
around cluster lenses with typical redshifts near z=0.5, structures many Mpc
away from the cluster are essentially at the same location as the cluster
itself, when considering their effect on the cluster's weak lensing signal. We
use large-scale numerical simulations of structure formation in a
Lambda-dominated cold dark matter model to quantify the effect that large-scale
structure near clusters has upon the cluster masses deduced from weak lensing
analysis. A correction for the scatter in possible observed lensing masses
should be included when interpreting mass functions from weak lensing surveys.
