Consider $n+m$ nonintersecting Brownian bridges, with $n$ of them leaving
from 0 at time $t=-1$ and returning to 0 at time $t=1$, while the $m$ remaining
ones (wanderers) go from $m$ points $a_i$ to $m$ points $b_i$. First, we keep
$m$ fixed and we scale $a_i,b_i$ appropriately with $n$. In the large-$n$
limit, we obtain a new Airy process with wanderers, in the neighborhood of
$\sqrt{2n}$, the approximate location of the rightmost particle in the absence
of wanderers. This new process is governed by an Airy-type kernel, with a
rational perturbation. Letting the number $m$ of wanderers tend to infinity as
well, leads to two Pearcey processes about two cusps, a closing and an opening
cusp, the location of the tips being related by an elliptic curve. Upon tuning
the starting and target points, one can let the two tips of the cusps grow very
close; this leads to a new process, which might be governed by a kernel,
represented as a double integral involving the exponential of a quintic
polynomial in the integration variables.
