Properties of the free energy landscape in phase space of a dense hard sphere
system characterized by a discretized free energy functional of the
Ramakrishnan-Yussouff form are investigated numerically. A considerable number
of glassy local minima of the free energy are located and the distribution of
an appropriately defined ``overlap'' between minima is calculated. The process
of transition from the basin of attraction of a minimum to that of another one
is studied using a new ``microcanonical'' Monte Carlo procedure, leading to a
determination of the effective height of free energy barriers that separate
different glassy minima. The general appearance of the free energy landscape
resembles that of a putting green: deep minima separated by a fairly flat
structure. The growth of the effective free-energy barriers with increasing
density is consistent with the Vogel-Fulcher law, and this growth is primarily
driven by an entropic mechanism.
