Cherenkov telescopes could have the capability of detecting high energy tau
neutrinos by searching for very inclined showers. If a tau lepton, produced by
a tau neutrino, escapes from the Earth crust, it will decay and initiate an air
shower which can be detected by a fluorescence/Cherenkov telescope. Here we
present a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of event rates induced by tau
neutrinos in the energy range from 1 PeV to 1 EeV. Topographic conditions are
taken into account for a set of example locations. As expected, we find a
neutrino sensitivity which depends on the shape of the energy spectrum from
astrophysical sources. We compare our findings with the sensitivity of the
dedicated IceCube neutrino telescope under different conditions. We also find
that a difference of several factors can be observed depending on the
topographic conditions of the sites sampled.
