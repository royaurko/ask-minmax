We report measurements of the exclusive electroproduction of $K^+\Lambda$ and
$K^+\Sigma^0$ final states from an unpolarized proton target using the CLAS
detector at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The separated
structure functions $\sigma_U$, $\sigma_{LT}$, $\sigma_{TT}$, and
$\sigma_{LT'}$ were extracted from the $\Phi$-dependent differential cross
sections acquired with a longitudinally polarized 5.499 GeV electron beam. The
data span a broad range of momentum transfers $Q^2$ from 1.4 to 3.9 GeV$^2$,
invariant energy $W$ from threshold to 2.6 GeV, and nearly the full
center-of-mass angular range of the kaon. The separated structure functions
provide an unprecedented data sample, which in conjunction with other meson
photo- and electroproduction data, will help to constrain the higher-level
analyses being performed to search for missing baryon resonances.
