The problem of universal search and stop using an adaptive search policy is
considered. When the target location is searched, the observation is
distributed according to the target distribution, otherwise it is distributed
according to the absence distribution. A universal sequential scheme for search
and stop is proposed using only the knowledge of the absence distribution, and
its asymptotic performance is analyzed. The universal test is shown to yield a
vanishing error probability, and to achieve the optimal reliability when the
target is present, universally for every target distribution. Consequently, it
is established that the knowledge of the target distribution is only useful for
improving the reliability for detecting a missing target. It is also shown that
a multiplicative gain for the search reliability equal to the number of
searched locations is achieved by allowing adaptivity in the search.
