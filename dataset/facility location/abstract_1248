We investigated the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) using an inductive
method. The following conclusions can be derived from our study: (i) when the
Fermi energy is located between Landau levels the only extended states at the
Fermi energy are located at the physical edges of the sample. (ii) the extended
states located at the bulk of the sample below the Fermi energy are capable of
carrying a substantial amount of Hall current, but cannot screen an external
electrostatic potential.
