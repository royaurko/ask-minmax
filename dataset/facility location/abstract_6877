Pellet's theorem determines when the zeros of a polynomial can be separated
into two regions, according to their moduli. We refine one of those regions and
replace it with the closed interior of a lemniscate that provides more precise
information on the location of the zeros. Moreover, Pellet's theorem is
considered the generalization of a zero inclusion region due to Cauchy. Using
linear algebra tools, we derive a different generalization that leads to a
sequence of smaller inclusion regions, which are also the closed interiors of
lemniscates.
