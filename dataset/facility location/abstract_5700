Using the Heinrich-Hertz-Telescope on Mt. Graham, Arizona, we have observed
several nearby galaxies in the CO(3-2) line. The CO(3-2) emission traces - in
contrast to lower rotational transitions - a warmer and denser component of the
molecular gas.
  We find that this emission is spatially extended in the target galaxies. The
excitation conditions seem to vary with the location of the gas within the
galaxy, and also with the overall properties of the target objects. However, a
clear correlation between the CO(3-2) emission and other quantities, such as
Hubble type or IR luminosity, is not present.
