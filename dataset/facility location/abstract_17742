The studies of pulsating variable stars are traditional subjects of
astronomers in Odessa. In the last half of the 20th century, the studies of the
physical variable stars were the topics of 15 PhD theses of the collaborators
of the Odessa State (now National) University. Continuing the tradition of
studies of long-period variable stars in the Astronomical Observatory of Odessa
University, we try to conduct a detailed classification of the Mira-type stars,
semi-regular variable stars and also find out the location of symbiotic stars
among other long-period variables in their evolution to the planetary nebulae,
using the compiled material from own observations and that of other contributors.
For the research, we have used observations from the databases of the French
Association of Variable Stars Observers (AFOEV) and Variable Stars Observers
League of Japan (VSOLJ), which allow study of the variability of these stars
during the time interval of about 100 years. Some stars were studied using the
observations of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO).
Modern research of long-period variable stars in Odessa is conducted in several
directions: 1. The analysis of correlations between the photometric parameters.
2. The study of changes on time of individual characteristics of the light
curves. 3. The study of variability of the objects which are transitional
between the Mira-type and the semi-regular variables. The conclusions are
discussed.
