With its cometary appearance and a reflection nebula near its edge facing
some bright Orion stars, the Lynd's cloud L1616 shows ample evidence for being
affected by one or more of these massive stars. To estimate its mass and star
formation efficiency as well as to determine if it is gravitationally bound, we
mapped this cloud in J=1${\rightarrow}$0 transitions of $^{12}$CO and
$^{13}$CO. It is found that the distribution of the emission in the line {\it
wings} show clear evidence for substantial mass motions. Also, the ``virial''
mass of the cloud is found to be five times the actual cloud mass determined
from the $^{13}$CO column density map. It is argued that this cloud has
abnormally high star formation efficiency and is possibly disintegrating. The
morphology and the location of the cloud indicate that it is being affected by
the star ${\epsilon}$ Orionis which is also possibly responsible for the
cloud's unusual star formation efficiency. Over a range of values of the
relevant parameters, the star is found to quantitatively satisfy the
requirements of being the cause of the observed characteristics of the cloud.
