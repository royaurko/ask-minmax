We use replica exchange Monte-Carlo simulations to measure the equilibrium
equation of state of the disordered fluid state for a binary hard sphere
mixture up to very large densities where standard Monte-Carlo simulations do
not easily reach thermal equilibrium. For the moderate system sizes we use (up
to N=100), we find no sign of a pressure discontinuity near the location of
dynamic glass singularities extrapolated using either algebraic or simple
exponential divergences, suggesting they do not correspond to genuine
thermodynamic glass transitions. Several scenarios are proposed for the fate of
the fluid state in the thermodynamic limit.
