Bluetooth is a promising short-range radio network technology. We present a
low cost and easily deployed, scalable infrastructure for indoor location-based
computing of mobile devices based on Bluetooth technology. The system consists
of 2 main components, namely the Bluetooth (BT) Sensor System and the Central
Navigation System which have been developed using the JDK 6.0. The Bluetooth
Sensor System allows mobile devices whose Bluetooth mode is set to
discoverable, to be scanned and detected, and they receive customizable text
message of their positioning information, e.g. room identity. The positioning
information is also sent to the Central Navigation System which in turn
displays and updates the navigation map. The system is also used to track the
movement of different BT mobile devices within the implemented environment.
