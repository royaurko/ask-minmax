The production of the high brightness femtosecond electron bunch is now one
of the hot research topics. This paper describes one electron linac facility
used to produce the subpicosecond electron bunch. We analyze the main structure
parameters, and study the beam dynamics of the facility. Finally, we discuss
the application of this facility in Compton scattering.
