We present a two dimensional map of the gas temperature distribution in the
Centaurus cluster, based on ASCA observations derived using a novel approach to
account for the energy dependent point spread function. Along with a cool
region, centered on NGC4696, asymmetric temperature variations of moderate
amplitude are detected. The hottest region roughly coincides with the position
of the second brightest galaxy NGC4709, known to be the dominant galaxy of one
of the subgroups in the Centaurus cluster. ROSAT images show faint surface
brightness emission also centered on this galaxy. The imaging and spectral
results suggest that a subcluster, centered on NGC4709 is merging with the main
cluster centered on NGC4696, in agreement with the earlier suggestion by Lucey
et al. (1986) that these two systems are located at the same distance despite
their different line-of-sight velocities.
