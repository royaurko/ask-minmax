Inspired by the warped Randall Sundrum scenario proposed to solve the mass
scale hierarchy problem with a compactified fifth extra dimension, a similar
model with no metric singularities has been elaborated. In this framework, the
Kaluza-Klein reduction equations for a real massless scalar field propagating
in the bulk have been studied carefully from the point of view of hermiticity
so as to formulate in a mathematically rigorous way all the possible boundary
conditions and corresponding mass eigenvalue towers and tachyon states. The
physical masses as observable in our four-dimensional brane are deduced from
these mass eigenvalues depending on the location of the brane on the extra
dimension axis. Examples of mass towers and tachyons and related field
probability densities are presented from numerical computations performed for
some arbitrary choices of the parameters of the model.
