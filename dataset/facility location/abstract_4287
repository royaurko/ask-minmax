In this paper, expansions for the maximum likelihood estimator of location
and its distribution funtion are extended to fifth order. Since the proofs are
straightforward extentions of proofs given in earlier papers for orders less
than the fifth, they are not given here. The purpose of the paper is mainly to
present the higher order expansions.
