Mobile Ad hoc Networks are dynamic networks populated by mobile devices, or
mobile nodes.The Mobile Nodes are free to move anywhere and at any time. The
population of the nodes may have some influence on the mobility rate of the
mobile nodes. This paper presents simulation results using Matrix Laboratory
software. The study investigates the influence of mobile nodes parameters such
as number of nodes on the nodes speeds and nodes distribution in a given area.
The results have indicated that the number of mobile nodes have impact on the
speeds of the nodes in a location.
