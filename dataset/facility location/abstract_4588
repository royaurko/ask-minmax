It is shown that hadronic matter formed at high temperatures, according to
the prescription of the statistical bootstrap principle, develops a critical
point at nonzero baryon chemical potential. The location of the critical point
in the phase diagram, however, depends on the detailed knowledge of the
partition function of the deconfined phase, near the critical line. In a
simplified version of the quark-gluon partition function, the resulting
location of the critical point is compared with the solutions of other
approaches and in particular with the results of lattice QCD. The proximity of
our solution to the freeze-out area in heavy-ion experiments is also discussed.
