Cross section measurements of the exclusive p(e,e'K+)Lambda,Sigma^0
electroproduction reactions have been performed at the Mainz Microtron MAMI in
the A1 spectrometer facility using for the first time the Kaos spectrometer for
kaon detection. These processes were studied in a kinematical region not
covered by any previous experiment. The nucleon was probed in its third
resonance region with virtual photons of low four-momenta, Q^2= 0.030-0.055
(GeV/c)^2. The MAMI data indicate a smooth transition in Q^2 from
photoproduction to electroproduction cross sections. Comparison with
predictions of effective Lagrangian models based on the isobar approach reveal
that strong longitudinal couplings of the virtual photon to the N* resonances
can be excluded from these models.
