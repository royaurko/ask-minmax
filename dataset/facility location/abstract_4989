In this contribution, an image-guided therapy system supporting gynecologic
radiation therapy is introduced. The overall workflow of the presented system
starts with the arrival of the patient and ends with follow-up examinations by
imaging and a superimposed visualization of the modeled device from a PACS
system. Thereby, the system covers all treatments stages (pre-, intra- and
postoperative) and has been designed and constructed by a computer scientist
with feedback from an interdisciplinary team of physicians and engineers. This
integrated medical system enables dispatch of diagnostic images directly after
acquisition to a processing workstation that has an on-board 3D Computer Aided
Design model of a medical device. Thus, allowing precise identification of
catheter location in the 3D imaging model which later provides rapid feedback
to the clinician regarding device location. Moreover, the system enables the
ability to perform patient-specific pre-implant evaluation by assessing the
placement of interstitial needles prior to an intervention via virtual template
matching with a diagnostic scan.
