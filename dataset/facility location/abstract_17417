A collective-risk social dilemma implies that personal endowments will be
lost if contributions to the common pool within a group are too small. Failure
to reach the collective target thus has dire consequences for all group
members, independently of their strategies. Wanting to move away from
unfavorable locations is therefore all but surprising. Inspired by these
observations, we here propose and study a collective-risk social dilemma where
players are allowed to move if the collective failure becomes too probable.
More precisely, this so-called risk-driven migration is launched depending on
the difference between the actual contributions and the declared target.
Mobility therefore becomes an inherent property that is utilized in an entirely
self-organizing manner. We show that under these assumptions cooperation is
promoted much more effectively than under the action of manually determined
migration rates. For the latter, we in fact identify parameter regions where
the evolution of cooperation is incredibly inhibited. Moreover, we find
unexpected spatial patterns where cooperators that do not form compact clusters
outperform those that do, and where defectors are able to utilize strikingly
different ways of invasion. The presented results support the recently revealed
importance of percolation for the successful evolution of public cooperation,
while at the same time revealing surprisingly simple ways of self-organization
towards socially desirable states.
