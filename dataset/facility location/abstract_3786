The AMY experiment aims to measure the microwave bremsstrahlung radiation
(MBR) emitted by air-showers secondary electrons accelerating in collisions
with neutral molecules of the atmosphere. The measurements are performed using
a beam of 510 MeV electrons at the Beam Test Facility (BTF) of Frascati INFN
National Laboratories. The goal of the AMY experiment is to measure in
laboratory conditions the yield and the spectrum of the GHz emission in the
frequency range between 1 and 20 GHz. The final purpose is to characterise the
process to be used in a next generation detectors of ultra-high energy cosmic
rays. A description of the experimental setup and the first results are
presented.
