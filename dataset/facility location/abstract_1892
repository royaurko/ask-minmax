At present, the GDT facility of the Budker Institute Novosibirsk, which is an
axially symmetric magnetic mirror device of gas dynamic trap type, is being
upgraded. The first stage of the upgrade is the Synthesised Hot Ion Plasmoid
(SHIP) experiment. The experiments will be performed in a small mirror section
that is installed at one side of the GDT. The magnetic field on axis will be in
the range of 1-7 T and the mirror ratio will amount 1.2-1.4. The mirror is
filled with background plasma streaming in from the central cell. Two neutral
beam injectors perpendicularly inject a total current up to 120 equ. Amperes of
hydrogen atoms with an energy of 25 keV as pulse with a duration of about 1 ms.
Ionisation of the beams generates the high-energetic ion component with the
high density and mean energy about 17 keV. The plasma bata ~ 0.8. This
contribution explains the concept of the SHIP experiment and presents the
results of SHIP simulation. The first experimental activity is also presented.
