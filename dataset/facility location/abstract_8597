A gravitational lens model is presented for the newly discovered 10-image
system B1933+503. The underlying object, revealed by modeling, is a triple
radio source on the scale of a couple of hundred mas that is well-aligned along
the line of sight with a foreground and somewhat flattened lensing galaxy,
whose orientation and location match that of an observed galaxy, known to be at
a redshift of 0.755. Uncertainties in the modeling are obtained by a Monte
Carlo exercise. Observational tests of the lens model are proposed, and the
time delays between various pairs of images are determined as the core of the
source is known to be significantly variable. Future observations of the lens
hold the key to using B1933+503 to constrain Hubble's Constant. Despite the
absence of a source redshift, the system's utility as a probe of the lens
galaxy's structure is unparalleled as it provides a surfeit of easily
identifiable constraints for modeling the system.
