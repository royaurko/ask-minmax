The locations of the fully despun, double synchronous end states of tidal
evolution are derived for spherical components. With the exception of nearly
equal-mass binaries, binary asteroid systems are in the midst of lengthy tidal
evolutions, far from their fully synchronous tidal end states. Calculations of
material strength indicate that binaries in the main belt with 100-km-scale
primary components are consistent with being made of monolithic or fractured
rock as expected for binaries likely formed from sub-catastrophic impacts in
the early solar system. To tidally evolve in their dynamical lifetime,
near-Earth binaries with km-scale primaries or smaller must be much weaker
mechanically than their main-belt counterparts even if formed in the main belt
prior to injection into the near-Earth region. Small main-belt binaries with
primary components less than 10 km in diameter, depending on their ages, could
either be as strong as large main-belt binaries or as weak as near-Earth
binaries because the inherent uncertainty in the age of a binary system can
affect the calculation of material strength by orders of magnitude. Several
other issues are considered, though these typically affect the calculation of
material strength by no more than a factor of two. We also find indirect
evidence within all three groups of binary asteroids that the inter-component
separation may evolve via another mechanism(s) with the binary YORP effect
being a likely candidate.
