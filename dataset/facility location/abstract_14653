We have used the NRAO Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) to image OH(1720 MHz)
masers in the supernova remnants W28 and W44 at a resolution of 40 mas. We also
used MERLIN to observe the same OH(1720 MHz) masers in W44 at a resolution of
290 x 165 mas. All the masers are resolved by these VLBA and MERLIN
observations. The measured sizes range from 50 to 180 mas and yield brightness
temperature estimates from 0.3--20 x 10**8 K. We investigate whether these
measured angular sizes are intrinsic and hence originate as a result of the
physical conditions in the supernova remnant shock, or whether they are scatter
broadened sizes produced by the turbulent ionized gas along the line of sight.
While the current data on the temporal and angular broadening of pulsars,
masers and extragalactic soures toward W44 and W28 can be understood in terms
of scattering, we cannot rule out that these large sizes are intrinsic. Recent
theoretical modeling by Lockett et al. suggests that the physical parameters in
the shocked region are indicative of densities and OH abundances which lead to
estimates of sizes as large as what we measure. If the sizes and structure are
intrinsic, then the OH(1720 MHz) masrs may be more like the OH(1612 MHz) masers
in circumstellar shells than OH masers associated with HII regions. At two
locations in W28 we observe the classical S-shapes in the Stokes V profiles
caused by Zeeman splitting and use it to infer magnetic fields of order 2
milliGauss.
