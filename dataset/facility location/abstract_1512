The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is conceived as an 8.4-m telescope
with CCD or CMOS focal plane covering most of a field 0.6 m in diameter, the
latter exceeding the size of the largest photographic plates ever used in
astronomy. The telescope design is driven by the desire to cover much of the
accessible sky to faint magnitudes on a timescale of $\sim$ one night, with
major science drivers the search for near Earth-orbit asteroids down to a
diameter of 300 m, discovering supernovae to z $\sim 2$, and mass tomography of
the Universe via gravitational weak lensing. Here the suitability of this
facility for more ``traditional'' variable star research is investigated.
