We study the deconfinement transition of $N_f=1$ QCD by the hybrid Monte
Carlo algorithm with Wilson fermions. We calculate the Polyakov loop, its
susceptibility and Binder cumulant and use the $\chi^2$ method to locate the
phase transition point. Our results are similar to the previous results
obtained by the multiboson algorithm.
