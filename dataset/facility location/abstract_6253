Analysis using new calculations with 3 times the resolution of the earlier
linked magnetic flux tubes confirms the transition from singular to saturated
growth rate reported by Grauer and Marliani \cite{GrauerMar99} for the
incompressible cases is confirmed. However, all of the secondary tests point to
a transition back to stronger growth rate at a different location at late
times. Similar problems in ideal hydrodynamics are discussed, pointing out that
initial negative results eventually led to better initial conditions that did
show evidence for a singularity of Euler. Whether singular or near-singular
growth in ideal MHD is eventually shown, this study could have bearing on fast
magnetic reconnection, high energy particle production and coronal heating.
