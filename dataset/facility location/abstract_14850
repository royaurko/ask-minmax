The dynamical evolution of Classical Kuiper Belt Objects (CKBOs) divides into
two parts, according to the secular theory of test particle orbits. The first
part is a forced oscillation driven by the planets, while the second part is a
free oscillation whose amplitude is determined by the initial orbit of the test
particle. We extract the free orbital inclinations and free orbital
eccentricities from the osculating elements of 125 known CKBOs. The free
inclinations of 32 CKBOs strongly cluster about 2 degrees at orbital semi-major
axes between 44 and 45 AU. We propose that these objects comprise a collisional
family, the first so identified in the Kuiper Belt. Members of this family are
plausibly the fragments of an ancient parent body having a minimum diameter of
\~800 km. This body was disrupted upon colliding with a comparably sized
object, and generated ejecta having similar free inclinations. Our candidate
family is dynamically akin to a sub-family of Koronis asteroids located at
semi-major axes less than 2.91 AU; both families exhibit a wider range in free
eccentricity than in free inclination, implying that the relative velocity
between parent and projectile prior to impact lay mostly in the invariable
plane of the solar system. We urge more discoveries of new CKBOs to test the
reality of our candidate family and physical studies of candidate family
members to probe the heretofore unseen interior of a massive, primitive
planetesimal.
