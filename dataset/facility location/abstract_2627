The beam energy spread at the entrance of undulator system is of paramount
importance for efficient density modulation in high-gain seeded free-electron
lasers (FELs). In this paper, the dependences of high harmonic micro-bunching
in the high-gain harmonic generation (HGHG), echo-enabled harmonic generation
(EEHG) and phase-merging enhanced harmonic generation (PEHG) schemes on the
electron energy spread distribution are studied. Theoretical investigations and
multi-dimensional numerical simulations are applied to the cases of uniform and
saddle beam energy distributions and compared to a traditional Gaussian
distribution. It shows that the uniform and saddle electron energy
distributions significantly enhance the performance of HGHG-FELs, while they
almost have no influence on EEHG and PEHG schemes. A numerical example
demonstrates that, with about 84keV RMS uniform and/or saddle slice energy
spread, the 30th harmonic radiation can be directly generated by a single-stage
seeding scheme for a soft x-ray FEL facility.
