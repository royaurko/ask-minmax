Based on lattice QCD-adjusted SU(2) nonlocal Polyakov--Nambu--Jona-Lasinio
(PNJL) models, we investigate how the location of the critical endpoint in the
QCD phase diagram depends on the strenght of the vector meson coupling, as well
as the Polyakov-loop (PL) potential and the form factors of the covariant
model. The latter are constrained by lattice QCD data for the quark propagator.
The strength of the vector coupling is adjusted such as to reproduce the slope
of the pseudocritical temperature for the chiral phase transition at low
chemical potential extracted recently from lattice QCD simulations. Our study
supports the existence of a critical endpoint in the QCD phase diagram albeit
the constraint for the vector coupling shifts its location to lower
temperatures and higher baryochemical potentials than in the case without it.
