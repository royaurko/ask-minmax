We find a coupling-strength configuration for a linear chain of N spins which
gives rise to simultaneous multiple Bell states. We suggest a way such an
interesting entanglement pattern can be used in order to distribute maximally
entangled channels to remote locations and generate multipartite entanglement
with a minimum-control approach. Our proposal thus provides a way to achieve
the core resources in distributed information processing. The schemes we
describe can be efficiently tested in chains of coupled cavities interacting
with three-level atoms.
