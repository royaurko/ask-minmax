The question of interest in the present study is: ``Given a body subject to
mechanical loads, how to define the initial geometry so that the deformed one
matches precisely a prescribed shape?'' This question is particularly relevant
in forming processes where the tolerated mismatch between the deformed and
desired geometries may be lower than a Micron. The method proposed here uses as
a first ``guess'' to the required initial geometry the desired one, then it
updates iteratively the locations of a set of boundary points so that their
locations in the deformed configuration come closer and closer to the desired
ones. The scheme is shown to converge unconditionally for small deformations in
the sense that arbitrarily small mismatch between the deformed and desired
shape can be achieved. Moreover, since it is based entirely on geometric
considerations, the convergence should not be affected by the nature of
material, i.e. it is independent of the constitutive law. The success of the
method is illustrated by considering an example.
