Using lattice simulations, we study the infrared behavior of a particularly
interesting SU(2) gauge theory, with six massless Dirac fermions in the
fundamental representation. We compute the running gauge coupling derived
non-perturbatively from the Schrodinger functional of the theory, finding no
evidence for an infrared fixed point up through gauge couplings of order 20.
This implies that the theory either is governed in the infrared by a fixed
point of considerable strength, unseen so far in non-supersymmetric gauge
theories, or breaks its global chiral symmetries producing a large number of
composite Nambu-Goldstone bosons relative to the number of underlying degrees
of freedom. Thus either of these phases exhibits novel behavior.
