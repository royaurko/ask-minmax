Acute shortage of good, clean drinking water is a major problem for most
developing countries of the world. In most cases, ponds, streams, wells and
rivers are often polluted that they are unsafe for direct use as drinking water
>.Often water sources are brackish and or contain harmful bacteria. Therefore
cannot be used for drinking .In addition there are many coastal locations where
sea water is abundant but potable water is not available. Solar distillation is
one of the important methods of utilizing solar energy for the supply of
potable water to small communities where natural supply of fresh water is
inadequate or of poor quality .In this direction an experimental performance
analysis was carried out on a single basin still compared with FPC coupled one.
Test were carried out for different water samples namely borewell water, sea
water, river water for a water depth of 20 mm
