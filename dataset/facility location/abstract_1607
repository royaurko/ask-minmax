The Gemini Observatory is planning to implement a Multi Conjugate Adaptive
Optics (MCAO) System as a facility instrument for the Gemini-South telescope.
The system will include 5 Laser Guide Stars, 3 Natural Guide Stars, and 3
Deformable mirrors optically conjugated at different altitudes to achieve
near-uniform atmospheric compensation over a 1 arc minute square field of view.
The control of such a system will be split into 3 main functions: the control
of the opto-mechanical assemblies of the whole system (including the Laser, the
Beam Transfer Optics and the Adaptive Optics bench), the control of the
Adaptive Optics System itself at a rate of 800FPS and the control of the safety
system. The control of the Adaptive Optics System is the most critical in terms
of real time performances. The control system will be an EPICS based system. In
this paper, we will describe the requirements for the whole MCAO control
system, preliminary designs for the control of the opto-mechanical devices and
architecture options for the control of the Adaptive Optics system and the
safety system.
