We have carried out a search for co-moving stellar and substellar companions
around 18 exoplanet host stars with the infrared camera MAGIC at the 2.2m Calar
Alto telescope, by comparing our images with images from the all sky surveys
2MASS, POSS I and II. Four stars of the sample namely HD80606, 55Cnc, HD46375
and BD-103166, are listed as binaries in the Washington Visual Double Star
Catalogue (WDS). The binary nature of HD80606, 55Cnc, and HD46375 is confirmed
with both astrometry as well as photometry, thereby the proper motion of the
companion of HD46375 was determined here for the first time. We derived the
companion masses as well as the longterm stability regions for additional
companions in these three binary systems. We can rule out further stellar
companions around all stars in the sample with projected separations between
270AU and 2500AU, being sensitive to substellar companions with masses down to
\~60MJup (S/N=3). Furthermore we present evidence that the two components of
the WDS binary BD-103166 are unrelated stars, i.e this system is a visual pair.
The spectrophotometric distance of the primary (a K0 dwarf) is ~67pc, whereas
the presumable secondary BD-103166B (a M4 to M5 dwarf) is located at a distance
of 13pc in the foreground.
