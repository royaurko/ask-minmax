We propose a deterministic remote state preparation scheme for photon
polarization qubit states, where entanglement, local operations and classical
communication are used. By consuming one maximally entangled state and two
classical bits, an arbitrary (either pure or mixed) qubit state can be prepared
deterministically at a remote location. We experimentally demonstrate the
scheme by remotely preparing 12 pure states and 6 mixed states. The fidelities
between the desired and achieved states are all higher than 0.99 and have an
average of 0.9947.
