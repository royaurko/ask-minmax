We address a cognitive radio scenario, where a number of secondary users
performs identification of which primary user, if any, is transmitting, in a
distributed way and using limited location information. We propose two fully
distributed algorithms: the first is a direct identification scheme, and in the
other a distributed sub-optimal detection based on a simplified Neyman-Pearson
energy detector precedes the identification scheme. Both algorithms are studied
analytically in a realistic transmission scenario, and the advantage obtained
by detection pre-processing is also verified via simulation. Finally, we give
details of their fully distributed implementation via consensus averaging
algorithms.
