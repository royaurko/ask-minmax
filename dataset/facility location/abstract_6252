Some facts about 4-spinors listed and discussed. None, well perhaps some, of
the work is original. However, locating formulas in other places has proved a
time-consuming process in which one must always worry that the formulas found
in any given source assume the other metric (I use {-1,-1,-1,+1}) or assume
some other unexpected preconditions. Here I list some formulas valid in general
representations first, then formulas using a chiral representation are
displayed, and finally formulas in a special reference frame (the rest frame of
the `current' j) in the chiral representation are listed. Some numerical and
algebraic exercises are provided.
