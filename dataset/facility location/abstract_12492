We compare the \gamma-ray light curves of the blazars, constructed with data
provided by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, with flux and polarization
variations in the VLBI core and bright superluminal knots obtained via monthly
monitoring with the Very Long Baseline Array at 43 GHz. For all blazars in the
sample that exhibit a high \gamma-ray state on time scales from several weeks
to several months, an increase of the total flux in the mm-wave core is
contemporaneous with the \gamma-ray activity (more than a third of the sample).
Here we present the results for quasars with the most extreme \gamma-ray
behavior (3C 454.3, 3C 273, 3C 279, 1222+216, and 1633+382). The sources show
that in addition to the total flux intensity behavior, a maximum in the degree
of polarization in the core or bright superluminal knot nearest to the core
coincides with the time of a \gamma-ray peak to within the accuracy of the
sampling of the radio data. These argue in favor of location of many of
\gamma-ray outbursts in blazars outside of the broad line region, either in the
vicinity or downstream of the mm-wave VLBI core.
