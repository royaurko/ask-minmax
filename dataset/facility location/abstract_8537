We present the results of our ASCA SIS and GIS observations of the supernova
remnant VRO42.05.01. Our spectral fits indicate that the SNR is isothermal
(about 8.3 X 10^6 K), consistent with our ROSAT analysis results. The absorbing
column density (about 2.9 X 10^21 cm^-2) obtained from these spectral fits is
much smaller than expected for the nominal distance of 5 kpc, indicating that
the line of sight toward VRO42.05.01 has an unusually low gas density. The
spectral resolution of ASCA allows us to determine elemental abundances for the
hot X-ray emitting plasma in the bright ``wing'' component of this remnant. We
find that Mg, Si, and Fe are underabundant, and attribute these low abundances
to the galactic metallicity gradient and to the location of the remnant in the
outer Milky Way.
