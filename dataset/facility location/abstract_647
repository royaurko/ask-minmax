The Advanced Superconducting Test Accelerator (ASTA) currently under
commissioning at Fermilab will enable a broad range of beam-based experiments
to study fundamental limitations to beam intensity and to develop
transformative approaches to particle-beam generation, acceleration and
manipulation. ASTA incorporates a superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) linac
coupled to a photoinjector and small-circumference storage ring capable of
storing electrons or protons. ASTA will establish a unique resource for R&D
towards Energy Frontier facilities and a test-bed for SRF accelerators and
high-brightness beam applications, including ERLs. The unique features of ASTA
include: (1) a high repetition-rate, (2) one of the highest peak and average
brightness within the U.S., (3) a GeV-scale beam energy, (4) an extremely
stable beam, (5) the availability of SRF and high quality beams together, and
(6) a storage ring capable of supporting a broad range of ring-based advanced
beam dynamics experiments. These unique features will foster a broad program in
advanced accelerator R&D which cannot be carried out elsewhere. We describe
ASTA and its experimental program, with particular emphasis on the ERL-related
accelerator R&D opportunities.
