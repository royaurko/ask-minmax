One of the main scientific drivers of the Space InfraRed Telescope Facility
(SIRTF) is the search for brown dwarfs and extrasolar superplanets. We discuss
observational strategies for identification of these objects, and conclude that
an optimal strategy is a wide IRAC survey (18 deg$^2$) with a 5 $\sigma$
sensitivity of 3.9 $\mu$Jy in channel 2 (M$\sim19.1^m$). For this sensitivity,
we provide estimates of the number of low mass brown dwarfs and isolated
planets detected per square degree for power-law mass functions with
$\alpha$=1.5, and 1.0. Shallower surveys covering a larger area are inefficient
because of large overheads and detector noise. Deeper surveys covering a
smaller area become more and more affected by crowding with galaxies. A survey
like the one that we propose would determine the field mass function down to a
few Jupiter masses through the identification of a large sample of brown dwarfs
and isolated planets. The proposed SIRTF survey would also allow the first
detection of ultracool substellar objects with temperatures between 700 K and
200 K. The cooling curves of substellar objects with masses less than 20
Jupiters imply that they should spend most of their lifetimes at temperatures
below 700 K. Preliminary models indicate that their atmospheres could be
dominated by water clouds, which would diminish their optical and near-infrared
fluxes. The properties of those objects are still completely unexplored.
