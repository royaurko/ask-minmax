We propose to use an internal polarized hydrogen storage cell gas target in
the AD ring to determine for the first time the two total spin-dependent pbar-p
cross sections sigma_1 and sigma_2 at antiproton beam energies in the range
from 50 to 450 MeV. The data obtained are of interest by themselves for the
general theory of pbar-p interactions since they will provide a first
experimental constraint of the spin-spin dependence of the nucleon-antinucleon
potential in the energy range of interest. In addition, measurements of the
polarization buildup of stored antiprotons are required to define the optimum
parameters of a future, dedicated Antiproton Polarizer Ring (APR), intended to
feed a double-polarized asymmetric pbar-p collider with polarized antiprotons.
Such a machine has recently been proposed by the PAX collaboration for the new
Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) at GSI in Darmstadt, Germany.
The availability of an intense stored beam of polarized antiprotons will
provide access to a wealth of single- and double-spin observables, thereby
opening a new window on QCD spin physics.
