A definition of intelligence is given in terms of performance that can be
quantitatively measured. In this study, we have presented a conceptual model of
Intelligent Agent System for Automatic Vehicle Checking Agent (VCA). To achieve
this goal, we have introduced several kinds of agents that exhibit intelligent
features. These are the Management agent, internal agent, External Agent,
Watcher agent and Report agent. Metrics and measurements are suggested for
evaluating the performance of Automatic Vehicle Checking Agent (VCA). Calibrate
data and test facilities are suggested to facilitate the development of
intelligent systems.
