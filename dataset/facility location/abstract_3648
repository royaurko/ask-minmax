In-source resonant ionization laser spectroscopy of the even-$A$ polonium
isotopes $^{192-210,216,218}$Po has been performed using the $6p^37s$ $^5S_2$
to $6p^37p$ $^5P_2$ ($\lambda=843.38$ nm) transition in the polonium atom
(Po-I) at the CERN ISOLDE facility. The comparison of the measured isotope
shifts in $^{200-210}$Po with a previous data set allows to test for the first
time recent large-scale atomic calculations that are essential to extract the
changes in the mean-square charge radius of the atomic nucleus. When going to
lighter masses, a surprisingly large and early departure from sphericity is
observed, which is only partly reproduced by Beyond Mean Field calculations.
