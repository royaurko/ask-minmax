Recent high-resolution measurements suggest that the soft X-ray spectrum of
obscured Radio Galaxies (RG) exhibits signatures of photoionised gas (e.g. 3C
445 and 3C 33) similar to those observed in radio-quiet obscured Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN). While signatures of warm absorbing gas covering a wide
range of temperature and ionisation states have been detected in about one half
of the population of nearby Seyfert 1 galaxies, no traces of warm absorber gas
have been reported to date in the high-resolution spectra of Broad Line Radio
Galaxies (BLRG). We present here the first detection of a soft X-ray warm
absorber in the powerful FRII BLRG 3C 382 using the Reflection Grating
Spectrometer (RGS) on-board XMM-Newton. The absorption gas appears to be highly
ionised, with column density of the order of 10^{22} cm^{-2}, ionisation
parameter log\xi>2 erg cm s^{-1} and outflow velocities of the order of 10^{3}
km s^{-1}. The absorption lines may come from regions located outside the
torus, however at distances less than 60 pc. This result may indicate that a
plasma ejected at velocities near the speed of light and a photoionised gas
with slower, outflow velocities can coexist in the same source beyond the Broad
Line Regions.
