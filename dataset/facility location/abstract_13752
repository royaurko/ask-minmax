Analyzing heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs) has become increasingly
complex, particularly due to irregular base station locations, massive
deployment of small cells, and flexible resource allocation. The latter is
usually not captured by existing stochastic models for analytical tractability.
In this work, we develop a more realistic stochastic model for a generic
$K$-tier HCN, where users are served in the downlink under frequency diversity.
We derive the rate coverage probability for this case, taking into account the
interference correlation across different parts of the allocated spectrum. Our
results indicate that ignoring this type of correlation may considerably
overestimate the offered date rate. Furthermore, the gain of spectrum
diversification is significant, particularly at low to moderate target data
rates.
