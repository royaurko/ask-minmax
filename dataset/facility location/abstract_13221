We consider time-reversal of electromagnetic waves in a closed, wave-chaotic
system containing a discrete, passive, harmonic-generating nonlinearity. An
experimental system is constructed as a time-reversal mirror, in which
excitations generated by the nonlinearity are gathered, time-reversed,
transmitted, and directed exclusively to the location of the nonlinearity. Here
we show that such nonlinear objects can be purely passive (as opposed to the
active nonlinearities used in previous work), and develop a high-rate secure
communication system based on nonlinear time-reversal. A model of the
experimental system is developed, using a star-graph network of transmission
lines, with one of the lines terminated by a model diode. The model simulates
time-reversal of linear and nonlinear signals, demonstrates features seen in
the experimental system, and supports our interpretation of the experimental
results.
