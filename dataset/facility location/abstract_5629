We have searched deep optical images of the globular cluster M4 for a
possible optical counterpart for the third body in the PSR B1620-26 system. We
identify as a possible optical counterpart a star located within $0.3''$ of the
nominal pulsar position with $V\approx 20$. This magnitude is consistent with a
main sequence cluster member with $M\approx 0.45M_\odot$. However, this star
may be blended with fainter stars, and the probability of a chance
superposition is non-negligible.
