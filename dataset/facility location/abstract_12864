It is shown through analytical modeling and numerical simulations that
external magnetic fields can relax the self-trapping thresholds in plasma based
accelerators. In addition, the transverse location where self-trapping occurs
can be selected by adequate choice of the spatial profile of the external
magnetic field. We also find that magnetic-field assisted self-injection can
lead to the emission of betatron radiation at well defined frequencies. This
controlled injection technique could be explored using state-of-the-art
magnetic fields in current/next generation plasma/laser wakefield accelerator
experiments.
