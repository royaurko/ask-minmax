The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is a new low-frequency interferometric
radio telescope built in Western Australia at one of the locations of the
future Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We describe the automated radio-frequency
interference (RFI) detection strategy implemented for the MWA, which is based
on the AOFlagger platform, and present 72-231-MHz RFI statistics from 10
observing nights. RFI detection removes 1.1% of the data. RFI from digital TV
(DTV) is observed 3% of the time due to occasional ionospheric or atmospheric
propagation. After RFI detection and excision, almost all data can be
calibrated and imaged without further RFI mitigation efforts, including
observations within the FM and DTV bands. The results are compared to a
previously published Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) RFI survey. The remote
location of the MWA results in a substantially cleaner RFI environment compared
to LOFAR's radio environment, but adequate detection of RFI is still required
before data can be analysed. We include specific recommendations designed to
make the SKA more robust to RFI, including: the availability of sufficient
computing power for RFI detection; accounting for RFI in the receiver design; a
smooth band-pass response; and the capability of RFI detection at high time and
frequency resolution (second and kHz-scale respectively).
