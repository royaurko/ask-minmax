The spectrometer SPI, one of the two main instruments of the INTEGRAL
spacecraft, has strong capabilities in the Field of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB)
detections. In its 16 degree Field of view (FoV) SPI is able to trigger and to
localize GRBs. With its large anticoincidence shield (ACS) of 512 kg of BGO
crystals SPI is able to detect GRBs quasi omnidirectionally with a very high
sensitivity. The ACS GRB alerts will provide GRB arrival times with high
accuracy but with no or very rough positional information. The expected GRB
detection rate in SPI's FoV will be one per month and for the ACS around 300
per year. At MPE two SPI software contributions to the real-time INTEGRAL
burst-alert system (IBAS) at the INTEGRAL science data centre ISDC have been
developed. The SPI-ACS branch of IBAS will produce burst alerts and
light-curves with 50 ms resolution. It is planned to use ACS burst alerts in
the 3rd interplanetary network. The SPI-FoV branch of IBAS is currently under
development at MPE. The system is using the energy and timing information of
single and multiple events detected by the Germanium-camera of SPI. Using the
imaging algorithm developed at the University of Birmingham the system is
expected to locate strong bursts with an accuracy of better than 1 degree.
