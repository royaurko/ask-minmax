We revisit the issue of the quark masses and mixing angles in the framework
of large extra dimension. We consider three identical standard model families
resulting from higher-dimensional fields localized on different branes embedded
in a large extra dimension. Furthermore we use a decaying profile in the bulk
different form previous works. With the Higgs field also localized on a
different brane, the hierarchy of masses between the families results from
their different positions in the extra space. When the left-handed doublet and
the right-handed singlets are localized with different couplings on the branes,
we found a set of brane locations in one extra dimension which leads to the
correct quark masses and mixing angles with the sufficient strength of
CP-violation. We see that the decaying profile of the Higgs field plays a
crucial role for producing the hierarchies in a rather natural way.
