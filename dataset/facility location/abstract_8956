We report the discovery of both intermediate-order gravity mode and low-order
pressure mode pulsation in the same star, HD 209295. It is therefore both a
gamma Doradus and a delta Scuti star, which makes it the first confirmed member
of two classes of pulsating star.
  This object is located in a close binary system with an unknown, but likely
degenerate companion in an eccentric orbit, and some of the gamma Doradus
pulsation frequencies are exact integer multiples of the orbital frequency. We
suggest that these pulsations are tidally excited. HD 209295 may be the
progenitor of an intermediate-mass X-Ray binary.
