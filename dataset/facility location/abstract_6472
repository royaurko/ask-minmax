Double Chooz main target is to measure Theta13 oscillation parameter by
comparing reactor neutrino fluxes in two identical detectors located
respectively at 400 m and 1 km away from the 2 Chooz reactor cores. The far
detector is now under construction, while we have just completed the design
phase of the near one. In this report I will discuss the detector principle,
sensitivity and its present construction status.
