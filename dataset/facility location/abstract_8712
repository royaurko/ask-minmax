We have searched for gamma-ray bursts (GRB) in the BATSE DISCLA data covering
the period TJD 8365-10528. We employ an algorithm that uses the background both
before and after the onset of the burst, and that requires an excess of at
least 5 sigma over background in the energy range 50-300 keV. For the initial
set of 7536 triggers, we find strong concentrations at given geographic
locations of the satellite. After excluding these geographic areas, we are left
with 4485 triggers. We exclude triggers close in position to solar flares,
CygX-1, and Nova Persei 1992 when active, as well as soft bursts close to the
sun. We accept 1018 triggers that occur within 230 sec of a GRB listed in the
BATSE catalog, and upon visual inspection classify 881 triggers as
magnetospheric events and 404 as GRBs. The final sample of 1422 GRBs represents
effectively 2.0 years of isotropic exposure, for an annual rate of 710 GRBs per
year.
