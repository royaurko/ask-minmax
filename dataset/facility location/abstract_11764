Cerro Las Campanas located at Las Campanas Observatory (LCO) in Chile has
been selected as the site for the Giant Magellan Telescope. We report results
obtained since the commencement, in 2005, of a systematic site testing survey
of potential GMT sites at LCO. Meteorological (cloud cover, temperature,
pressure, wind, and humidity) and DIMM seeing data have been obtained at three
potential sites, and are compared with identical data taken at the site of the
twin Magellan 6.5m telescopes. In addition, measurements of the turbulence
profile of the free-atmosphere above LCO have been collected with a MASS/DIMM.
Furthermore, we consider photometric quality, light pollution, and precipitable
water vapor (PWV). LCO, and Co. Las Campanas in particular, have dark skies,
little or no risk of future light pollution, excellent seeing, moderate winds,
PWV adequate for mid-IR astronomy during a reasonable fraction of the nights,
and a high fraction of clear nights overall. Finally, Co. Las Campanas meets or
exceeds all the defined science requirements.
