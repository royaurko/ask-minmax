The recent discovery that neutrinos have masses opens a wide new field of
experimentation. Accelerator-made neutrinos are essential in this program.
Ideas for future facilities include high intensity muon neutrino beams from
pion decay (`SuperBeam'), electron neutrino beams from nuclei decays (`Beta
Beam'), or muon and electron neutrino beams from muon decay (`Neutrino
Factory'), each associated with one or several options for detector systems.
Each option offers synergetic possibilities, e.g. some of the detectors can be
used for proton decay searches, while the Neutrino Factory is a first step
towards muon colliders.
 A summary of the perceived virtues and shortcomings of the various options,
and a number of open questions are presented.
