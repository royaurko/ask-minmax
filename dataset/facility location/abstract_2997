By using the so-called Information Metric on the moduli space of an
anti-selfdual (ASD) Instanton in a Self-Dual (SD) Non-Commutative background,
we investigate the geometry of moduli space. The metric is evaluated
perturbatively in non-commutativity parameter and we show that by putting a
cut-off in the location of instanton in the definition of Information Metric we
can recover the five dimensional space time in the presence of a B-field. This
result shows that the non-commutative YM-Instanton Moduli corresponds to
D-Instanton Moduli in the gravity side where the radial and transverse location
of D-Instanton are corresponding to YM-Instanton size and location,
respectively. The match is shown in the first order of non-commutativity
parameter.
