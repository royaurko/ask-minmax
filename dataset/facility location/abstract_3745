High power, relativistic electron beams from energy recovery linacs have
great potential to realize new experimental paradigms for pioneering innovation
in fundamental and applied research. A major design consideration for this new
generation of experimental capabilities is the understanding of the halo
associated with these bright, intense beams. In this Letter, we report on
measurements performed using the 100 MeV, 430 kWatt CW electron beam from the
energy recovery linac at the Jefferson Laboratory's Free Electron Laser
facility as it traversed a set of small apertures in a 127 mm long aluminum
block. Thermal measurements of the block together with neutron measurements
near the beam-target interaction point yielded a consistent understanding of
the beam losses. These were determined to be 3 ppm through a 2 mm diameter
aperture and were maintained during a 7 hour continuous run.
