Following similar analysis to that in Lacoin (PTRF 159, 777-808, 2014), we
can show that the quenched critical point for self-avoiding walk on random
conductors on the d-dimensional integer lattice is almost surely a constant,
which does not depend on the location of the reference point. We provide its
upper and lower bounds that are valid for all dimensions.
