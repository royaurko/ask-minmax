Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an emerging technique in the field of
biomedical imaging, with applications in ophthalmology, dermatology, coronary
imaging etc. Due to the underlying physics, OCT images usually suffer from a
granular pattern, called speckle noise, which restricts the process of
interpretation. Here, a sparse and low rank decomposition based method is used
for speckle reduction in retinal OCT images. This technique works on input data
that consists of several B-scans of the same location. The next step is the
batch alignment of the images using a sparse and low-rank decomposition based
technique. Finally the denoised image is created by median filtering of the
low-rank component of the processed data. Simultaneous decomposition and
alignment of the images result in better performance in comparison to simple
registration-based methods that are used in the literature for noise reduction
of OCT images.
