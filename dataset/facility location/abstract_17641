In this paper, we first show that the definition of the universal horizons
studied recently in the khrononmetric theory of gravity can be
straightforwardly generalized to other theories that violate the Lorentz
symmetry, by simply considering the khronon as a probe field and playing the
same role as a Killing vector field. As an application, we study static charged
($D+1$)-dimensional spacetimes in the framework of the healthy
(non-projectable) Horava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity in the infrared limit, and find
various solutions. Some of them represent Lifshitz space-times with
hyperscaling violations, and some have black hole structures. In the latter
universal horizons always exist inside the Killing horizons. The surface
gravity on them can be either larger or smaller than the surface gravity on the
Killing horizons, depending on the space-times considered. Although such black
holes are found only in the infrared, we argue that black holes with universal
horizons also exist in the full theory of the HL gravity. A simple example is
the Schwarzschild solution written in the Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates,
which is also a solution of the full theory of the HL gravity and has a
universal horizon located inside the Schwarzschild Killing horizon.
