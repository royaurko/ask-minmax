Beta Lyrae is an eclipsing, semi-detached binary system whose state of active
mass transfer can reveal details of the nonconservative evolution of binary
stars. Roche lobe overflow has caused the system to evolve to a complex state.
A thick accretion disk almost completely obscures the secondary, mass-gaining
star while the rapid mass transfer likely drives mass loss through the system's
bipolar outflows. Polarimetry can provide important information about the
physical structure of complex systems; in fact, the discovery of bipolar
outflows in beta Lyrae was confirmed through polarimetry. Here we present
results from 6 years of new and recalibrated spectropolarimetric data taken
with the University of Wisconsin's Half-Wave Spectropolarimeter (HPOL). We
discuss their implications for our current understanding of the system's
disk-jet geometry. Using both broadband and line polarization analysis
techniques, we derive new information about the structure of the disk, the
presence and location of a hot spot, and the distribution of hot line-emitting
gas.
