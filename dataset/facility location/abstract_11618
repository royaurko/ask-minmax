A tunable and switchable multi-wavelength erbium-doped fiber ring laser based
on a new type tunable comb filter is proposed and demonstrated. By adjusting
the polarization controllers, dual-function operation of the channel spacing
tunability and the wavelength switching (interleaving) can be readily achieved.
Up to 29 stable lasing lines with 0.4 nm spacing and 14 lasing wavelengths with
0.8 nm spacing in 3 dB bandwidth were obtained at room temperature. In
addition, the lasing output, including the number of the lasing lines, the
lasing evenness and the lasing locations, can also be flexibly adjusted through
the wavelength-dependent polarization rotation mechanism.
