Our low-temperature magneto-Raman scattering measurements performed on
graphene-like locations on the surface of bulk graphite reveal a new series of
magneto-phonon resonances involving both K-point and Gamma-point phonons. In
particular, we observe for the first time the resonant splitting of three
crossing excitation branches. We give a detailed theoretical analysis of these
new resonances. Our results highlight the role of combined excitations and the
importance of multi-phonon processes (from both K and Gamma points) for the
relaxation of hot carriers in graphene.
