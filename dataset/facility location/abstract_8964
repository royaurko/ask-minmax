In a 6h Halpha exposure of the N-W region of the cluster of galaxies A1367 we
discovered a 75 kpc cometary emission of ionized gas trailing behind two
Irregular galaxies. The Halpha trails correspond in position and length with
tails of syncrotron radiation. At the galaxy side opposite to the tails the two
galaxies show bright HII regions aligned along arcs, where the star formation
takes place at the prodigeous rate of about 1 solar mass per yr. From the
morphology of the galaxies and of the trailing material, we infer that the two
galaxies are suffering from ram pressure due to their high velocity motion
through the cluster IGM. We estimate that about 10^9 solar masses of gas,
probably ionized in the giant HII regions, is swept out forming the tails. The
tails cross each other at some 100 kpc from the present galaxy location,
indicating that a major tidal event occurred some about 5x10^7 yr ago. We
exclude that mutual harassment produced the observed morphology and we show
with numerical simulations that it could have marginally aided ram pressure
stripping by loosening the potential well of the galaxies.
