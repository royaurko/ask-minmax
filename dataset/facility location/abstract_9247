We present the preliminary results of 235 MHz, 327 MHz and 610 MHz
observations of the galaxy cluster A3562 in the core of the Shapley
Concentration. The purpose of these observations, carried out with the Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT, Pune, India) was to study the radio halo
located at the centre of A3562 and determine the shape of its radio spectrum at
low frequencies, in order to understand the origin of this source. In the
framework of the re--acceleration model, the preliminary analysis of the halo
spectrum suggests that we are observing a young source (few $10^8$ yrs) at the
beginning of the re--acceleration phase.
