The lithium ions in Lithium iron arsenide phases with compositions close to
LiFeAs have been located using powder neutron diffraction. These phases exhibit
superconductivity at temperatures at least as high as 16 K demonstrating that
superconductivity in compounds with [FeAs]- anti-PbO-type anionic layers occurs
in compounds with at least three different structure types and occurs for a
wide range of As-Fe-As bond angles.
