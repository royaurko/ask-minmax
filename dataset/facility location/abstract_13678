We have investigated dissociative recombination (DR) of NH$^+$ with electrons
using a merged beams configuration at the TSR heavy-ion storage ring located at
the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. We present
our measured absolute merged beams recombination rate coefficient for collision
energies from 0 to 12 eV. From these data we have extracted a cross section
which we have transformed to a plasma rate coefficient for the collisional
plasma temperature range from $T_{\rm pl} = 10$ to $18000$ K. We show that the
NH$^+$ DR rate coefficient data in current astrochemical models are
underestimated by up to a factor of $\sim 9$. Our new data will result in
predicted NH$^+$ abundances lower than calculated by present models. This is in
agreement with the sensitivity limits of all observations attempting to detect
NH$^+$ in interstellar clouds.
