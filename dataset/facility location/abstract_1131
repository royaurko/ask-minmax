We are presenting the electronic photo fragment spectra of the protonated
pyrimidine DNA bases homo-dimers. Only the thymine dimer exhibits a well
structured vibrational progression, while protonated monomer shows broad
vibrational bands. This shows that proton bonding can block some non radiative
processes present in the monomer.
