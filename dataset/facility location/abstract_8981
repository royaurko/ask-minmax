On 3 and 4 October, 1995, we obtained high spectral resolving power
(R=\lambda/\Delta\lambda = 60,000) observations of comet 122P/de Vico using the
2DCoude cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph on the 2.7-m telescope of McDonald
Observatory. The spectra cover the wavelength range from 3830A--10192A. The
spectra from 3830--5776A are continuous; from 5777--10192A there are increasing
interorder gaps. The comet was at a heliocentric distance of 0.66au and a
geocentric distance of 1.0au. Comet de Vico has a very high gas-to-dust ratio
and the spectra have excellent signal/noise. These two factors combined to
yield spectra with a large number of emission lines. We have collected
laboratory molecular line lists and have used these line lists in order to
identify as many of the detected lines as possible. We have identified 12,219
emission lines and have located another 4,055 lines which we cannot identify.
We present representative spectra and identifications along with a description
of our plans to make these spectra and identifications available to the
community. This atlas should prove a valuable tool for future studies of
comets.
