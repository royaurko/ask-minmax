We present $BVI$ photometry for about 16000 stars from a 220 arcmin$^{2}$
field centered 8 arcmin east of the center of 47 Tuc. We have identified eight
likely blue stragglers located in the outer parts of the cluster. Four of these
objects are easy targets for spectroscopic studies with ground-based
telescopes. Six candidates for blue horizontal branch stars were identified.
However, it is possible that all or most of them belong in fact to the SMC
halo. One faint blue star being candidate for a cataclysmic variable was found
close to the cluster center.
  The average $I$-band magnitude for stars forming the red giant branch clump
is determined at $I_{0}=13.09\pm 0.005 $mag. This in turn implies distance
modulus of the cluster $(m-M)_{0,47Tuc}=13.32\pm 0.03\pm 0.036 $mag
(statistical plus systematic error), if we adopt $M_{I,m}=-0.23 \pm 0.03 $mag
for the average absolute luminosity of {\em Hipparcos}-calibrated clump giants,
following Paczy\'nski & Stanek and Stanek & Garnavich. This distance modulus of
47 Tuc is lower by $0.2-0.25 $mag than its recent estimates based on Hipparcos
parallaxes for subdwarfs. We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy. The
photometric data are available through the anonymous ftp service.
