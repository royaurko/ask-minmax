A list of 4,131 dwarfs, subgiants, and giants located, or suspected to be
located, within 33 parsecs of the Sun is presented. All the stars are drawn
from the new LSPM-north catalog of 61,976 stars with annual proper motions
larger than 0.15''/yr$. Trigonometric parallax measurements are found in the
literature for 1,676 of the stars in the sample; photometric and spectroscopic
distance moduli are found for another 783 objects. The remaining 1,672 objects
are reported here as nearby star candidates for the first time. Photometric
distance moduli are calculated for the new stars based on the (M_V,V-J)
relationship, calibrated with the subsample of stars which have trigonometric
parallaxes. The list of new candidates includes 539 stars which are suspected
to be within 25 parsecs of the Sun, including 63 stars estimated to be within
only 15 parsecs. The current completeness of the census of nearby stars in the
northern sky is discussed in light of the new candidates presented here. It is
estimated that 32% (18%) of nuclear burning stars within 33 parsecs (25
parsecs) of the Sun remain to be located. The missing systems are expected to
have proper motions below the 0.15''/yr limit of the LSPM catalog.
