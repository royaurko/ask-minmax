The Small Photon Entangling Quantum System is an integrated instrument where
the pump, photon pair source and detectors are combined within a single optical
tray and electronics package that is no larger than 10cm x 10cm x 3cm. This
footprint enables the instrument to be placed onboard nanosatellites or the
CubeLab facility within the International Space Station. The first mission is
to understand the different environmental conditions that may affect the
operation of an entangled photon source in low Earth orbit. This understanding
is crucial for the construction of cost-effective entanglement based
experiments that utilize nanosatellite architecture. We will discuss the
challenges and lessons we have learned over three years of development and
testing of the integrated optical platform and review the perspectives for
future advanced experiments.
