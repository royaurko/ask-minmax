The exploration of the QCD phase diagram particularly the search for a phase
transition from hadronic to partonic degrees of freedom and possibly a critical
endpoint, is one of the most challenging tasks in present heavy-ion physics. As
observed by the NA49 experiment, several hadronic observables in central Pb+Pb
collisions at the CERN SPS show qualitative changes in their energy dependence.
These features are not observed in elementary interactions and indicate the
onset of a phase transition in the SPS energy range. The existence of a
critical point is expected to result in the increase of event-by-event
fluctuations of various hadronic observables provided that the freeze-out of
the measured hadrons occurs close to its location in the phase diagram and the
evolution of the final hadron phase does not erase the fluctuations signals. A
selection of NA49 results on di-pion and proton intermittency from the scan of
the phase diagram will be discussed.
