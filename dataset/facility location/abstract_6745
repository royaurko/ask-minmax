This paper presents a numerical method to calculate the value function for a
general discounted impulse control problem for piecewise deterministic Markov
processes. Our approach is based on a quantization technique for the underlying
Markov chain defined by the post jump location and inter-arrival time.
Convergence results are obtained and more importantly we are able to give a
convergence rate of the algorithm. The paper is illustrated by a numerical
example.
