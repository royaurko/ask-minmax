Hysteresis and the non-equilibrium dynamic phase transition in thin magnetic
films subject to an oscillatory external field have been studied by Monte Carlo
simulation. The model under investigation is a classical Heisenberg spin system
with a bilinear exchange anisotropy in a planar thin film geometry with
competing surface fields. The film exhibits a non-equilibrium phase transition
between dynamically ordered and dynamically disordered phases characterized by
a critical temperature Tcd, whose location of is determined by the amplitude H0
and frequency w of the applied oscillatory field. In the presence of competing
surface fields the critical temperature of the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic
transition for the film is suppressed from the bulk system value, Tc, to the
interface localization-delocalization temperature Tci. The simulations show
that in general Tcd < Tci for the model film. The profile of the time-dependent
layer magnetization across the film shows that the dynamically ordered and
dynamically disordered phases coexist within the film for T < Tcd. In the
presence of competing surface fields, the dynamically ordered phase is
localized at one surface of the film.
