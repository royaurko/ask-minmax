In a first paper, HIPPARCOS astrometric and kinematic data were used to
calibrate both infrared K and IRAS luminosities at the same time as kinematic
parameters of Long Period Variable stars (LPVs). Individual estimated absolute
magnitudes and a probabilistic assignation to galactic populations were deduced
from these calibrations for each LPV of our sample. Here we propose a scenario
of simultaneous stellar and circumstellar evolution according to the galactic
populations. The transitory states of S and Tc stars allow us to confirm the
location of the first dredge-up at $M_{bol}=-3.5$. There is also evidence
suggesting that a previous enrichment in s-elements from a more evolved
companion may accelerate the evolution along the AGB. The possible evolution to
OH LPVs is included in this scenario, and any of these stars may have a mass at
the limit of the capability for a C enrichment up to C/O > 1.
  A list of bright massive LPVs with peculiar envelope and luminosity
properties is proposed as Hot Bottom Burning candidates. The He-shell flash
star, R Cen, is found to be exceptionally bright and could become, before
leaving the AGB, a C-rich LPV brighter than the usual luminosity limit of
carbon stars.
