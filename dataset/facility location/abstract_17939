V959 Mon is a classical nova detected at GeV gamma-ray wavelengths on 2012
June 19. While classical novae are now routinely detected in gamma-rays, the
origin of the shocks that produce relativistic particles has remained unknown.
We carried out electronic European VLBI Network (e-EVN) observations that
revealed a pair of compact synchrotron emission features in V959 Mon on 2012
Sep 18. Since synchrotron emission requires strong shocks as well, we identify
these features as the location where the gamma rays were produced. We also
detected the extended ejecta in the follow-up EVN observations. They expanded
much faster in East-West direction than the compact knots detected in the
aforementioned e-EVN measurements. By comparing the VLBI results with lower
resolution images obtained using e-MERLIN and the VLA - as reported by Chomiuk
et al. (2014) - it appears that 1) influenced by the binary orbit, the nova
ejecta was highly asymmetric with a dense and slow outflow in the equatorial
plane and low-density and faster ejecta along the poles; and 2) the VLBI knots
were related to shocks formed in the interaction region of these outflows.
