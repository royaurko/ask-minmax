We examine lepton flavor violating couplings of the neutrinos to W boson in
medium energy setup of a beta-beam experiment. We show that muon production via
quasielastic scattering and deep inelastic scattering processes nu_e n-> mu p
and nu_e N-> mu X are very sensitive to W-mu-nu_e couplings. We perform a model
independent analysis and obtain 95% confidence level bounds on these couplings.
