With the Plateau de Bure interferometer, we have measured the C, N, O and S
isotopic abundance ratios in the arm of a spiral galaxy with a redshift of
0.89. The galaxy is seen face-on according to HST images. Its bulge intercepts
the line of sight to the radio-loud quasar PKS 1830-211, giving rise at mm
wavelengths to two Einstein images located each behind a spiral arm. The arms
appear in absorption in the lines of several molecules, giving the opportunity
to study the chemical composition of a galaxy only a few Gyr old. The isotopic
ratios in this spiral galaxy differ markedly from those observed in the Milky
Way. The $^{17}$O/$^{18}$O and $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratios are low, as one would
expect from an object too young to let low mass stars play a major role in the
regeneration of the gas.
