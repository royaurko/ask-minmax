We report measurements of anamolously large dissipative conductivities in
BiSrCaCuO(2212) at low temperatures. We have measured the complex conductivity
of BSCCO thin films at 100-600 GHz as a function of doping from the underdoped
to the overdoped state. At low temperatures there exists a residual dissipative
conductivity which scales with the T=0 superfluid density as the doping is
varied. This residual dissipative conductivity is larger than the possible
contribution from a thermal population of quasiparticles at the d-wave gap
nodes.
