We have carried out multi-colour imaging of the fields of a statistically
complete sample of low-frequency selected radio loud quasars at 0.6<z<1.1, in
order to determine the characteristics of their environments. The largest radio
sources are located in the field, and smaller steep-spectrum sources are more
likely to be found in richer environments, from compact groups through to
clusters. This radio-based selection (including source size) of high redshift
groups and clusters is a highly efficient method of detecting rich environments
at these redshifts. Although our single filter clustering measures agree with
those of other workers, we show that these statistics cannot be used reliably
on fields individually, colour information is required for this.
