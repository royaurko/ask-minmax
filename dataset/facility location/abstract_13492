A fast nonparametric procedure for classifying functional data is introduced.
It consists of a two-step transformation of the original data plus a classifier
operating on a low-dimensional hypercube. The functional data are first mapped
into a finite-dimensional location-slope space and then transformed by a
multivariate depth function into the $DD$-plot, which is a subset of the unit
hypercube. This transformation yields a new notion of depth for functional
data. Three alternative depth functions are employed for this, as well as two
rules for the final classification on $[0,1]^q$. The resulting classifier has
to be cross-validated over a small range of parameters only, which is
restricted by a Vapnik-Cervonenkis bound. The entire methodology does not
involve smoothing techniques, is completely nonparametric and allows to achieve
Bayes optimality under standard distributional settings. It is robust,
efficiently computable, and has been implemented in an R environment.
Applicability of the new approach is demonstrated by simulations as well as a
benchmark study.
