The location of the unique supremum of a stationary process on an interval
does not need to be uniformly distributed over that interval. We describe all
possible distributions of the supremum location for a broad class of such
stationary processes. We show that, in the strongly mixing case, this
distribution does tend to the uniform in a certain sense as the length of the
interval increases to infinity.
