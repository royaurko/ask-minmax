The future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is a proposed new facility to collide
high-energy electrons with beams of polarized protons/light nuclei and
unpolarized nuclei. We overview the goals of the project and key measurements
at the EIC. We also briefly comment on recent developments of the project.
