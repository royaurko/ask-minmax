We derive a general quasiclassical approach for long-range magnetic-field
quantization effects in superconductors. The method is applied to superclean
d-wave superconductors in the mixed state. We study the delocalized states with
energies $\epsilon \gg \Delta_{0}\sqrt{H/H_{c2}}$. We find that the energy
spectrum consists of narrow energy bands whose centers are located at the
Landau levels calculated in absence of the vortex potential. We show that
transitions between the states belonging to the different Landau levels give
rise to resonances in the a.c. quasiparticle conductivity and in the a.c.
vortex friction.
