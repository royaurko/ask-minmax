We stabilize nematic droplets with handles against surface-tension-driven
instabilities using a yield-stress material as outer fluid and study the
complex nematic textures and defect structures that result from the competition
between topological constraints and the elasticity of the nematic liquid
crystal. We uncover a surprisingly persistent twisted configuration of the
nematic director inside the droplets when tangential anchoring is established
at their boundaries, which we explain after considering the influence of
saddle-splay on the elastic free energy. For toroidal droplets, we find that
the saddle-splay energy screens the twisting energy resulting in a spontaneous
breaking of mirror symmetry; the chiral twisted state persists for aspect
ratios as large as ~20. For droplets with additional handles, we observe in
experiments and computer simulations that there are two additional -1 surface
defects per handle; these are located in regions with local saddle geometry to
minimize the nematic distortions and hence the corresponding elastic free
energy.
