We suggest a novel mechanism to induce the motion of a chiral material body
towards an optical source. Our solution is based on the interference between a
chiral light beam and its reflection on an opaque mirror. Surprisingly, it is
theoretically shown that the electromagnetic response of the material may be
tailored in such a way that independent of the specific body location with the
respect to the mirror, it is always pushed upstream against the photon flow
associated with the incoming wave. Moreover, it is proven that by controlling
the handedness of the incoming light it may be possible to harness the sign of
the optical force, switching from a pulling force to a pushing force.
