The Ground-Level Event (GLE) associated with the X5.7 solar flare of July 14,
2000 is studied by the Project GRAND proportional wire chamber array. Results
are compared to those obtained by the Climax Neutron Monitor experiment which
detects secondary neutrons. The Climax monitor, located in Climax, Colorado, is
operated by the University of Chicago. The time of the GLE signal of the Climax
station is examined for a possible coincident signal in the data of Project
GRAND. Project GRAND is an array of 64 proportional wire chamber stations. The
stations are sensitive to secondary muons with energies greater than 0.1 GeV.
The mean energy of primaries which produce these ground level muons depends on
the spectral index of the primary spectrum. For a differential spectral index
of 2.4, the most probable primary energy is 10 GeV falling rapidly below this
energy and falling slowly above this energy.
