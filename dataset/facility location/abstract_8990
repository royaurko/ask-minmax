We present a study of X-ray column density variability in Seyfert 2 galaxies.
We show that variations in N_H are observed in almost all the objects with
multiple hard X-ray observations. Variation timescales (as short as a few
months in several cases) are not in agreement with the standard scenario of a
parsec-scale toroidal absorber. We propose that the X-ray absorber in Seyfert
galaxies is located much nearer to the center than previously assumed, on the
Broad Line Region Scale. An extension of the model by M. Elvis (2000) can
explain the observed variability. We also show preliminary results of N_H
variability search inside single X-ray observations, which suggest that
variations can occur on timescales of a few 10^4 seconds.
