The cold, dry and stable air above the summits of the Antarctic plateau
provides the best ground-based observing conditions from optical to sub-mm
wavelengths to be found on the Earth. PILOT is a proposed 2 m telescope, to be
built at Dome C in Antarctica, able to exploit these conditions for conducting
astronomy at optical and infrared wavelengths. While PILOT is intended as a
pathfinder towards the construction of future grand-design facilities, it will
also be able to undertake a range of fundamental science investigations in its
own right. This paper provides the performance specifications for PILOT,
including its instrumentation. It then describes the kinds of science projects
that it could best conduct. These range from planetary science to the search
for other solar systems, from star formation within the Galaxy to the star
formation history of the Universe, and from gravitational lensing caused by
exo-planets to that produced by the cosmic web of dark matter. PILOT would be
particularly powerful for wide-field imaging at infrared wavelengths, achieving
near-diffraction limited performance with simple tip-tilt wavefront correction.
PILOT would also be capable of near-diffraction limited performance in the
optical wavebands, as well be able to open new wavebands for regular ground
based observation; in the mid-IR from 17 to 40 microns and in the sub-mm at 200
microns.
