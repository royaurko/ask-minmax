The B(E2; Ii -> If) values for transitions in 71Ga and 73Ga were deduced from
a Coulomb excitation experiment at the safe energy of 2.95 MeV/nucleon using
post-accelerated beams of 71,73Ga at the REX-ISOLDE on-line isotope mass
separator facility. The emitted gamma rays were detected by the
MINIBALL-detector array and B(E2; Ii->If) values were obtained from the yields
normalized to the known strength of the 2+ -> 0+ transition in the 120Sn
target. The comparison of these new results with the data of less neutron-rich
gallium isotopes shows a shift of the E2 collectivity towards lower excitation
energy when adding neutrons beyond N = 40. This supports conclusions from
previous studies of the gallium isotopes which indicated a structural change in
this isotopical chain between N = 40 and N = 42. Combined with recent
measurements from collinear laser spectroscopy showing a 1/2- spin and parity
for the ground state, the extracted results revealed evidence for a 1/2-; 3/2-
doublet near the ground state in 73 31Ga42 differing by at most 0.8 keV in
energy.
