A new measure to identify a small-scale dissipation region in collisionless
magnetic reconnection is proposed. The energy transfer from the electromagnetic
field to plasmas in the electron's rest frame is formulated as a
Lorentz-invariant scalar quantity. The measure is tested by two-dimensional
particle-in-cell simulations in typical configurations: symmetric and
asymmetric reconnection, with and without the guide field. The innermost region
surrounding the reconnection site is accurately located in all cases. We
further discuss implications for nonideal MHD dissipation.
