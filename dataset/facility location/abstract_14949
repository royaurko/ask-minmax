We have monitored the Seyfert galaxy NGC 3227 with the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer (RXTE) since January 1999. During late 2000 and early 2001 we observed
an unusual hardening of the 2-10 keV X-ray spectrum which lasted several
months. The spectral hardening was not accompanied by any correlated variation
in flux above 8 keV. We therefore interpret the spectral change as transient
absorption by a gas cloud of column density 2.6 10^23 cm^-2 crossing the line
of sight to the X-ray source. A spectrum obtained by XMM-Newton during an early
phase of the hard-spectrum event confirms the obscuration model and shows that
the absorbing cloud is only weakly ionised. The XMM-Newton spectrum also shows
that ~10% of the X-ray flux is not obscured, but this unabsorbed component is
not significantly variable and may be scattered radiation from a large-scale
scattering medium. Applying the spectral constraints on cloud ionisation
parameter and assuming that the cloud follows a Keplerian orbit, we constrain
the location of the cloud to be R~10-100 light-days from the central X-ray
source, and its density to be n_H~10^8cm^-3, implying that we have witnessed
the eclipse of the X-ray source by a broad line region cloud.
