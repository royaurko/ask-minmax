Local spin and charge properties were studied on beta-Ag0.33V2O5, a
pressure-induced superconductor, at ambient pressure using 51V-NMR and
zero-field-resonance (ZFR) techniques. Three inequivalent Vi sites (i=1, 2, and
3) were identified from 51V-NMR spectra and the principal axes of the
electric-field-gradient (EFG) tensor were determined in a metallic phase and
the following charge-ordering phase. We found from the EFG analysis that the V1
sites are in a similar local environment to the V3 sites. This was also
observed in ZFR spectra as pairs of signals closely located with each other.
These results are well explained by a charge-sharing model where a 3d1 electron
is shared within a rung in both V1-V3 and V2-V2 two-leg ladders.
