Astrophysical black hole candidates are thought to be the Kerr black holes of
general relativity, but there is currently no direct observational evidence
that the spacetime geometry around these objects is described by the Kerr
solution. The study of the properties of the electromagnetic radiation emitted
by gas or stars orbiting these objects can potentially test the Kerr black hole
hypothesis. In this paper, I review the state of the art of this research
field, describing the possible approaches to test the Kerr metric with current
and future observational facilities and discussing current constraints.
