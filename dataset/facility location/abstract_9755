The vortex states in a thin mesoscopic disk are investigated within the
phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory in the presence of a step-like external
magnetic field with zero average which could model the field resulting from a
ferromagnetic disk or a current carrying loop. The regions of existence of the
multi-vortex state and the giant vortex state are found. We analyzed the phase
transitions between them and found regions in which ring-shaped vortices
contribute. Furthermore, we found a vortex state consisting of a central giant
vortex surrounded by a collection of anti-vortices that are located in a ring
around this giant vortex.
