The EPICS based control system of the ISAC radioactive beam facility uses the
CapFast schematic editor to construct the IOC function-block databases. This
allows a self-documenting graphical representation of the IOC software using a
hierarchical, object-like software structure with reusable components. On the
other hand, the control system is quarterbacked by a relational database, which
contains all device information. Using database reports and Perl scripts, a
device instantiation method was developed which generates top-level schematic
files in CapFast format. This method exploits the advantages of device data
entry and reporting using a relational database system while maintaining the
graphical representation of the IOC database.
