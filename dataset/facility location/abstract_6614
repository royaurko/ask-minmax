There is proposed a phenomenological theory of quasi-elastic neutron
scattering in the itinerant ferromagnets UGe$_2$ and UCoGe based on their
property that magnetization supported by the moments located at uranium atoms
is not conserved quantity relaxing to equilibrium by the interaction with
itinerant electrons subsystem. As result the line width of quasi elastic
neutron scattering at $q\to 0$ acquires nonvanishing value at all temperatures
but the Curie temperature.
