The reaction pp->pppi0pi0 has been investigated at a beam energy of 1.4 GeV
using the WASA-at-COSY facility. The total cross section is found to be (324 +-
21_systematic +- 58_normalization) mub. In order to to study the production
mechanism, differential kinematical distributions have been evaluated. The
differential distributions indicate that both initial state protons are excited
into intermediate Delta(1232) resonances, each decaying into a proton and a
single pion, thereby producing the pion pair in the final state. No significant
contribution of the Roper resonance N*(1440) via its decay into a proton and
two pions is found
