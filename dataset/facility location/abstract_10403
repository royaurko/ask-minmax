The behaviour of real zeroes of the Hurwitz zeta function $$\zeta
(s,a)=\sum_{r=0}^{\infty}(a+r)^{-s}\qquad\qquad a > 0$$ is investigated. It is
shown that $\zeta (s,a)$ has no real zeroes $(s=\sigma,a)$ in the region $a
>\frac{-\sigma}{2\pi e}+\frac{1}{4\pi e}\log (-\sigma) +1$ for large negative
$\sigma$. In the region $0 < a < \frac{-\sigma}{2\pi e}$ the zeroes are
asymptotically located at the lines $\sigma + 4a + 2m =0$ with integer $m$. If
$N(p)$ is the number of real zeroes of $\zeta(-p,a)$ with given $p$ then
$$\lim_{p\to\infty}\frac{N(p)}{p}=\frac{1}{\pi e}.$$ As a corollary we have a
simple proof of Inkeri's result that the number of real roots of the classical
Bernoulli polynomials $B_n(x)$ for large $n$ is asymptotically equal to
$\frac{2n}{\pi e}$.
