With the prolific growth in usage of smartphones across the spectrum of
people in the society it becomes mandatory to handle and configure these
devices effectively to achieve optimum results from it. This paper proposes a
context sensitive model termed COSMOS (COntext Sensitive MOdel for Smartphones)
for configuring the smartphones using multifactor analysis with the help of
decision trees. The COSMOS model proposed in this paper facilitates the
configuration of various smartphone settings implicitly based on the user's
current context, without interrupting the user for various inputs. The COSMOS
model also proposes multiple context parameters like location, scheduler data,
recent call log settings etc to decide the appropriate settings for the
smartphones. The proposed model is validated by a prototype implementation in
the Android platform. Various tests were conducted in the implementation and
the settings relevancy metric value of 90.95% confirms the efficiency of the
proposed model.
