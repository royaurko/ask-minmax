We report infrared reflectivity spectra for a new correlated cupric oxide
system Sr2Cu(Re0.69Ca0.31)Oy with y ~ 0.6 at several temperatures ranging
between 8 and 380 K. The reflectivity spectrum at 300 K comprises of several
optical phonons. A couple of residual bands located around 315 and 653 cm-1
exhibit exceptionally large intensity as compared to the other ones. The
overall reflectivity spectrum lifts up slightly with increasing temperature.
The energy and damping factor of transverse-optical phonons are determined by
fitting the imaginary dielectric constant by Lorentz oscillator model and
discussed as a function of temperature in terms of lattice anharmonicity.
