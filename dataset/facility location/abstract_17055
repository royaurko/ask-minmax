We report XMM-Newton observations of the Galactic supernova remnant
G296.8-0.3, together with complementary radio and infrared data. The spatial
and spectral properties of the X-ray emission, detected towards G296.8-0.3, was
investigated in order to explore the possible evolutionary scenarios and the
physical connexion with its unusual morphology detected at radio frequencies.
G296.8-0.3 displays diffuse X-ray emission correlated with the peculiar radio
morphology detected in the interior of the remnant and with the shell-like
radio structure observed to the northwest side of the object. The X-ray
emission peaks in the soft/medium energy range (0.5-3.0 keV). The X-ray
spectral analysis confirms that the column density is high (NH \sim 0.64 x
10^{22} cm^{-2}) which supports a distant location (d>9 kpc) for the SNR. Its
X-ray spectrum can be well represented by a thermal (PSHOCK) model, with kT
\sim 0.86 keV, an ionization timescale of 6.1 x 10^{10} cm^{-3} s, and low
abundance (0.12 Z_sun). The 24 microns observations show shell-like emission
correlated with part of the northwest and southeast boundaries of the SNR. In
addition a point-like X-ray source is also detected close to the geometrical
center of the radio SNR. The object presents some characteristics of the
so-called compact central objects (CCO). Its X-ray spectrum is consistent with
those found at other CCOs and the value of NH is consistent with that of
G296.8-0.3, which suggests a physical connexion with the SNR.
