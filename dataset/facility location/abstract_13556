We propose a general multi-class visual recognition model, termed the
Classifier Graph, which aims to generalize and integrate ideas from many of
today's successful hierarchical recognition approaches. Our graph-based model
has the advantage of enabling rich interactions between classes from different
levels of interpretation and abstraction. The proposed multi-class system is
efficiently learned using step by step updates. The structure consists of
simple logistic linear layers with inputs from features that are automatically
selected from a large pool. Each newly learned classifier becomes a potential
new feature. Thus, our feature pool can consist both of initial manually
designed features as well as learned classifiers from previous steps (graph
nodes), each copied many times at different scales and locations. In this
manner we can learn and grow both a deep, complex graph of classifiers and a
rich pool of features at different levels of abstraction and interpretation.
Our proposed graph of classifiers becomes a multi-class system with a recursive
structure, suitable for deep detection and recognition of several classes
simultaneously.
