Coherent 65 mHz pulsations in the X-ray flux of the Small Magellantic Cloud
(SMC) transient source RX J0052.1-7319 have been detected by us in an analysis
of ROSAT data. We report on the pulsations we detected in ROSAT HRI data and
simultaneous detection of these pulses in hard X-rays using BATSE data. The
BATSE data show an outburst of the source lasting 60 days. We report on optical
observations of the candidate companion, and a new source position we
determined from the HRI data, which is consistent with the candidate's
location. From the measured fluxes and observed frequency derivatives we
exclude the possiblity that the pulsar is in the foreground of the SMC, and
show that an accretion disk is present during the outburst, which peaked near
Eddington luminosity.
