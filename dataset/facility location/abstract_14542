LOTIS is a gamma-ray burst optical counterpart search experiment located near
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. Since operations began in
October 1996, LOTIS has responded to five triggers as of July 30, 1997, which
occurred during good weather conditions.
  GRB970223 (BATSE Trigger #6100) was an exceptionally strong burst lasting
$\sim30$ s with a peak at $\sim8$ s. LOTIS began imaging the error box $\sim
11$ s after the burst began, and achieved simultaneous optical coverage of 100%
of the region enclosed by the BATSE $3\sigma$ error circle and the IPN annulus.
No optical transients were observed brighter than the m$_V \sim 11$
completeness limit of the resulting images providing a new upper limit on the
simultaneous optical to gamma-ray fluence ratio of $R_L < 1.1 \times 10^{-4}$
and on the simultaneous optical (at 700 nm) to gamma-ray (at 100 keV) flux
density ratio of $R_F < 305$ for a B type spectrum and $R_F < 475$ for an M
type spectrum.
