We characterize the different morphologies adopted by a drop of liquid placed
on two randomly oriented fibers, which is a first step toward understanding the
wetting of fibrous networks. The present work reviews previous modeling for
parallel and touching crossed fibers and extends it to an arbitrary orientation
of the fibers characterized by the tilting angle and the minimum spacing
distance. Depending on the volume of liquid, the spacing distance between
fibers and the angle between the fibers, we highlight that the liquid can adopt
three different equilibrium morphologies: (1) a column morphology in which the
liquid spreads between the fibers, (2) a mixed morphology where a drop grows at
one end of the column or (3) a single drop located at the node. We capture the
different morphologies observed using an analytical model that predicts the
equilibrium configuration of the liquid based on the geometry of the fibers and
the volume of liquid.
