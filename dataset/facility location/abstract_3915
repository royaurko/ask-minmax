We discuss whether modern machine learning methods can be used to
characterize the physical nature of the large number of objects sampled by the
modern multi-band digital surveys. In particular, we applied the MLPQNA (Multi
Layer Perceptron with Quasi Newton Algorithm) method to the optical data of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey - Data Release 10, investigating whether photometric
data alone suffice to disentangle different classes of objects as they are
defined in the SDSS spectroscopic classification. We discuss three groups of
classification problems: (i) the simultaneous classification of galaxies,
quasars and stars; (ii) the separation of stars from quasars; (iii) the
separation of galaxies with normal spectral energy distribution from those with
peculiar spectra, such as starburst or starforming galaxies and AGN. While
confirming the difficulty of disentangling AGN from normal galaxies on a
photometric basis only, MLPQNA proved to be quite effective in the three-class
separation. In disentangling quasars from stars and galaxies, our method
achieved an overall efficiency of 91.31% and a QSO class purity of ~95%. The
resulting catalogue of candidate quasars/AGNs consists of ~3.6 million objects,
of which about half a million are also flagged as robust candidates, and will
be made available on CDS VizieR facility.
