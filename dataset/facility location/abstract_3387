The defining characteristics of fragment emission resulting from the
non-central collision of 114Cd ions with 92Mo target nuclei at E/A = 50 MeV are
presented. Charge correlations and average relative velocities for mid-velocity
fragment emission exhibit significant differences when compared to standard
statistical decay. These differences associated with similar velocity
dissipation are indicative of the influence of the entrance channel dynamics on
the fragment production process.
