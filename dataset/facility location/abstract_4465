We present high angular resolution (~0.5") 10 and 18 micron images of the
region around G29.96-0.02 taken from the Gemini North 8-m telescope using the
mid-infrared imager and spectrometer OSCIR. These observations were centered on
the location of a group of water masers, which delineate the site of a hot
molecular core believed to contain an extremely young, massive star. We report
here the direct detection of a hot molecular core at mid-infrared wavelengths
at this location. The size and extent of the core at 18 microns appears to be
very similar to the morphology as seen in integrated NH3 maps. However, our
observations indicate that the mid-infrared emission may not be exactly
coincident with the NH3 emission.
