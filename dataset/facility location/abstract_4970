This work investigates the preferred environment of local Luminous IR
Galaxies (LIRGs) in terms of the host halos that they inhabit, and in
comparison to a control galaxy sample. The LIRGs are drawn from the IRAS Point
Source Catalogue redshift survey (PSCz), while the control sample is drawn from
the 2MASS redshift survey (2MRS). A friends-of-friends algorithm was run on the
2MRS sample to identify galaxies living in the same dark matter halos and the
PSCz galaxies were then associated with these identified halos. We show that
the relative probability of finding local LIRGs with respect to 2MASS galaxies
is largest in approximately group size halos (Mhalo~10^13M_sun), and declines
both in the cluster regime and in smaller halos. This confirms, using a
different technique than in previous work, that local LIRGs are indeed more
abundant in group environments than elsewhere. We also find a trend between the
LIR values of LIRGs and their location within their host dark matter halos,
such that the average location of LIRGs with high IR luminosity is closer to
the halo centre than for low IR luminosity galaxies. Moreover, this trend does
not seem to depend on halo mass.
