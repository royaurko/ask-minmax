Here we report a facile method to generate a high density of point defects in
graphene on metal foil and show how the point defects affect the electronic
structures of graphene layers. Our scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
measurements, complemented by first principle calculations, reveal that the
point defects result in both the intervalley and intravalley scattering of
graphene. The Fermi velocity is reduced in the vicinity area of the defect due
to the enhanced scattering. Additionally, our analysis further points out that
periodic point defects can tailor the electronic properties of graphene by
introducing a significant bandgap, which opens an avenue towards all-graphene
electronics.
