In this paper we present the results obtained with a monitoring programme (23
days long) performed with Swift-XRT on the local Seyfert galaxy Mrk 915. The
light-curve analysis shows a significant count rate variation (about a factor
of 2-3) on a time-scale of a few days, while the X-ray colours show a change in
the spectral curvature below 2 keV and the presence of two main spectral
states. From the spectral analysis we find that the observed variations can be
explained by the change of the intrinsic nuclear power (about a factor of 1.5)
coupled with a change of the properties of an ionized absorber. The quality of
the data prevents us from firmly establishing if the spectral variation is due
to a change in the ionization state and/or in the covering factor of the
absorbing medium. The latter scenario would imply a clumpy structure of the
ionized medium. By combining the information provided by the light curve and
the spectral analyses, we can derive some constraints on the location of the
absorber under the hypotheses of either homogeneous or clumpy medium. In both
cases, we find that the absorber should be located inside the outer edge of an
extended torus and, in particular, under the clumpy hypothesis, it should be
located near, or just outside, to the broad emission line region.
