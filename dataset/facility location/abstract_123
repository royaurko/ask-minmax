We describe our ongoing work and view on simulation, validation and
visualization of cyber-physical systems in industrial automation during
development, operation and maintenance. System models may represent an existing
physical part - for example an existing robot installation - and a software
simulated part - for example a possible future extension. We call such systems
cyber-virtual systems.
  In this paper, we present the existing VITELab infrastructure for
visualization tasks in industrial automation. The new methodology for
simulation and validation motivated in this paper integrates this
infrastructure. We are targeting scenarios, where industrial sites which may be
in remote locations are modeled and visualized from different sites anywhere in
the world.
  Complementing the visualization work, here, we are also concentrating on
software modeling challenges related to cyber-virtual systems and simulation,
testing, validation and verification techniques for them. Software models of
industrial sites require behavioural models of the components of the industrial
sites such as models for tools, robots, workpieces and other machinery as well
as communication and sensor facilities. Furthermore, collaboration between
sites is an important goal of our work.
