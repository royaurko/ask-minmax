We reanalyze the ASCA and BeppoSAX data of MCG-6-30-15, using a double zone
model for the Iron line profile. In this model, the X-ray source is located
around $\approx 10$ Schwarzschild radius and the regions interior and exterior
to the X-ray source produce the line emission. We find that this model fits the
data with similar reduced $\chi^2$ as the standard single zone model. The best
fit inclination angle of the source ($i \approx 10^o$) for the medium intensity
ASCA data set is compatible with that determined by earlier modeling of optical
lines. The observed variability of the line profile with intensity can be
explained as variations of the X-ray source size. That several AGN with broad
lines have the peak centroid near 6.4 keV can be explained within the framework
of this model under certain conditions.
  We also show that the simultaneous broad band observations of this source by
BeppoSAX rules out the Comptonization model which was an alternative to the
standard inner disk one. We thereby strengthen the case that the line
broadening occurs due to the strong gravitational influence of a Black Hole.
