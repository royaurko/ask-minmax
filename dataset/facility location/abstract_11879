Modern earthwork compaction rollers collect location and compaction
information as they traverse a compaction site. These roller measurement values
present a challenging spatio-temporal statistical problem that requires careful
implementation of a proper stochastic model and estimation procedure. Heersink
and Furrer (2013) proposed a sequential, spatial mixed-effects model and a
sequential, spatial backfitting routine for estimation of the modeling terms
for such data. The estimated fields produced from this backfitting procedure
are analyzed using a multiresolution scale space analysis developed by
Holmstrom et al. (2011). This image analysis is proposed as a viable solution
to improved intelligent compaction and quality assurance of the compaction
process.
