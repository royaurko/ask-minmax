We combine deep Subaru near-infrared images of the massive lensing clusters
A2390 and A370 with Keck optical data to map the spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of Chandra X-ray sources lying behind the clusters. The three sources
behind A2390 are found to have extremely red colors with SEDs consistent with
evolved galaxies at redshifts z>1.4. One source has extremely anomalous colors,
which we interpret as evidence for a type Sa SED at a redshift around 2.5. The
photometric redshift of another source has been confirmed at z=1.467 from
near-infrared spectroscopy using the CISCO spectrograph on Subaru. Mapping of
optically faint hard X-ray sources may prove to be an extremely efficient way
to locate luminous evolved galaxies at high redshifts.
