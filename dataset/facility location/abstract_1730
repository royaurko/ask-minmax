Collisions of Au on Au at incident energies of 150, 250 and 400 A MeV were
studied with the FOPI-facility at GSI Darmstadt. Nuclear charge (Z < 16) and
velocity of the products were detected with full azimuthal acceptance at
laboratory angles of 1-30 degrees. Isotope separated light charged particles
were measured with movable multiple telescopes in an angular range of 6-90
degrees. Central collisions representing about 1 % of the reaction cross
section were selected by requiring high total transverse energy, but vanishing
sideflow. The velocity space distributions and yields of the emitted fragments
are reported. The data are analysed in terms of a thermal model including
radial flow. A comparison with predictions of the Quantum Molecular Model is
presented.
