On 2007 December 7, a small filament located in a small active region AR
10977 erupted and led to a B1.4 flare. An EIT wave associated with this
eruption was observed both by SOHO/EIT and by EUVI on board STEREO. According
to the observations from SOHO/LASCO and STEREO/COR A, we found that there was
no CME associated with the EIT wave. This seems to challenge the argument that
the cause of EIT waves is CME. However the data from STEREO/COR B indicated
that there was a narrow CME associated with the EIT wave. This suggests that
studying CMEs by investigating observations made in one direction alone may not
be able to guarantee the reliability of the results.
