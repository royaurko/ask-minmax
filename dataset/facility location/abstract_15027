Most models of double-barred galaxies suggest that a molecular gas component
is crucial for maintaining long-lived nuclear bars. We have undertaken a CO
survey in an attempt to determine the gas content of these systems and to
locate double barred galaxies with strong CO emission that could be candidates
for high resolution mapping. We observed 10 galaxies in CO J=2-1 and J=3-2 and
did not detect any galaxies that had not already been detected in previous CO
surveys. We preferentially detect emission from galaxies containing some form
of nuclear activity. Simulations of these galaxies require that they contain 2%
to 10% gas by mass in order to maintain long-lived nuclear bars. The fluxes for
the galaxies for which we have detections suggest that the gas mass fraction is
in agreement with these models requirements. The lack of emission in the other
galaxies suggests that they contain as little as 7 x 10^6 solar masses of
molecular material which corresponds to < 0.1% gas by mass. This result
combined with the wide variety of CO distributions observed in double barred
galaxies suggests the need for models of double-barred galaxies that do not
require a large, well ordered molecular gas component.
