Studies with GONG Standard Solar Evolution Models sampling the evolution of
the sun from its ZAMS stage show the following. The location of the tachocline
zone is nearly fixed as it is not affected by shell burning although it
co-moves with the expansion of the sun up to the present age of 4.6 Gyr. The
luminosity transport time scale of the sun is entirely dominated by photon
diffusion and during the evolution has decreased from over 204000 years to
187000 years. The rotational inertia of the sun shows a small gradual increase
from 6.73x10^46 kg m^2 to 7.09x10^46 kg m^2 at present but the inertia constant
decreases from 0.0911 to 0.0736 during the same period.
