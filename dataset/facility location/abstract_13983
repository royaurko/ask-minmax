A new physical mechanism of formation of runaway electron (RE) beams during
plasma disruptions in tokamaks is proposed. The plasma disruption is caused by
a strong stochastic magnetic field formed due to nonlinearly excited low-mode
number magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes. It is conjectured that the runaway
electron beam is formed in the central plasma region confined inside the intact
magnetic surface located between $q=1$ and the closest low--order rational
magnetic surfaces [$q=5/4$ or $q=4/3$, \dots]. It results in that runaway
electron beam current has a helical nature with a predominant $m/n=1/1$
component. The thermal quench and current quench times are estimated using the
collisional models for electron diffusion and ambipolar particle transport in a
stochastic magnetic field, respectively. Possible mechanisms for the decay of
the runaway electron current owing to an outward drift electron orbits and
resonance interaction of high--energy electrons with the $m/n=1/1$ MHD mode are
discussed.
