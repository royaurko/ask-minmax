Whether binaries can harbor potentially habitable planets depends on several
factors including the physical properties and the orbital characteristics of
the binary system. While the former determines the location of the habitable
zone (HZ), the latter affects the dynamics of the material from which
terrestrial planets are formed (i.e., planetesimals and planetary embryos), and
drives the final architecture of the planets assembly. In order for a habitable
planet to form in a binary star system, these two factors have to work in
harmony. That is, the orbital dynamics of the two stars and their interactions
with the planet-forming material have to allow terrestrial planet formation in
the habitable zone, and ensure that the orbit of a potentially habitable planet
will be stable for long times. We have organized this chapter with the same
order in mind. We begin by presenting a general discussion on the motion of
planets in binary stars and their stability. We then discuss the stability of
terrestrial planets, and the formation of potentially habitable planets in a
binary-planetary system.
