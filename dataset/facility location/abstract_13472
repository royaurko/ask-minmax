The galaxy pair NGC 5580 and NGC 5588 are part of a loose group of galaxies.
They are surrounded by steep-spectrum, extended radio emission which was
previously suggested to be a down-scaled example of Mpc-size radio haloes
present in galaxies clusters.
  We present a multi-frequency study of the radio-emission aimed to clarify its
nature. The source has been observed with the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope
at 235, 325 and 610 MHz and the images obtained were combined with archival
data to cover the frequency range 150-1400 MHz.
  The new observations revealed the presence of a second, fainter lobe on the
South-East of NGC 5580. The spectral index study of the source shows a
flattening of the spectrum (which implies a younger particle population) close
to the two galaxies. We argue that the extended radio emission is the remnant
of a past activity cycle of the active galactic nucleus present in NGC 5580 and
therefore a notable example of a dying radio galaxy located outside a dense
environments.
