We examine the effect of a nonmagnetic impurity in a two-dimensional spin
liquid in the spin-gap phase, employing a drone-fermion representation of
spin-1/2 operators. The properties of the local moment induced in the vicinity
of the impurity are investigated and an expression for the nuclear-magnetic-
resonance Knight shift is derived, which we compare with experimental results.
Introducing a second impurity into the spin liquid an antiferromagnetic
interaction between the moments is found when the two impurities are located on
different sublattices. The presence of many impurities leads to a screening of
this interaction as is shown by means of a coherent-potential approximation.
Further, the Kondo screening of an impurity-induced local spin by charge
carriers is discussed.
