With a goal of supporting the timely and cost-effective analysis of Terabyte
datasets on commodity components, we present and evaluate StoreTorrent, a
simple distributed filesystem with integrated fault tolerance for efficient
handling of small data records. Our contributions include an application-OS
pipelining technique and metadata structure to increase small write and read
performance by a factor of 1-10, and the use of peer-to-peer communication of
replica-location indexes to avoid transferring data during parallel analysis
even in a degraded state. We evaluated StoreTorrent, PVFS, and Gluster
filesystems using 70 storage nodes and 560 parallel clients on an 8-core/node
Ethernet cluster with directly attached SATA disks. StoreTorrent performed
parallel small writes at an aggregate rate of 1.69 GB/s, and supported reads
over the network at 8.47 GB/s. We ported a parallel analysis task and
demonstrate it achieved parallel reads at the full aggregate speed of the
storage node local filesystems.
