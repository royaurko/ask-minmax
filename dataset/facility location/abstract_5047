We report the growth temperature dependence of the properties of the
group-IV-based ferromagnetic semiconductor Ge1-xFex films (x = 6.5% and 10.5%),
including the lattice constant, Curie temperature (TC), and Fe-atom locations.
While TC strongly depends on the growth temperature, we find a universal
relationship between TC and the lattice constant, which does not depend on the
Fe content x. By using the channeling Rutherford backscattering and
particle-induced X-ray emission measurements, it is clarified that about 15% of
the Fe atoms exist in the tetrahedral interstitial sites in the Ge0.935Fe0.065
lattice and that the substitutional Fe concentration is not correlated with TC.
Considering these results, we suggest that the non-uniformity of the Fe
concentration plays an important role in determining the ferromagnetic
properties of GeFe.
