A new method for locating analytically critical temperatures is discussed. It
is exact for selfdual systems. When applied the two coupled layers of Ising
spins it deviates from our preliminary Monte Carlo estimates by 1.5 standard
deviations. It predicts critical temperature of the three dimensional Ising
model in terms of the solution of the two layer Ising system.
