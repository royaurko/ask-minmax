If $(C_n)$ is a Markov chain on a discrete state space ${\mathcal{S}}$, a
Markov chain $(C_n,M_n)$ on the product space
${\mathcal{S}}\times{\mathcal{S}}$, the cat and mouse Markov chain, is
constructed. The first coordinate of this Markov chain behaves like the
original Markov chain and the second component changes only when both
coordinates are equal. The asymptotic properties of this Markov chain are
investigated. A representation of its invariant measure is, in particular,
obtained. When the state space is infinite it is shown that this Markov chain
is in fact null recurrent if the initial Markov chain $(C_n)$ is positive
recurrent and reversible. In this context, the scaling properties of the
location of the second component, the mouse, are investigated in various
situations: simple random walks in ${\mathbb{Z}}$ and ${\mathbb{Z}}^2$
reflected a simple random walk in ${\mathbb{N}}$ and also in a continuous time
setting. For several of these processes, a time scaling with rapid growth gives
an interesting asymptotic behavior related to limiting results for occupation
times and rare events of Markov processes.
