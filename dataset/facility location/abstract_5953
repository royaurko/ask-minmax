In this paper, a systematic analysis of hourly wind speed data obtained from
four potential wind generation sites in North Dakota is conducted. The power
spectra of the data exhibited a power law decay characteristic of
$1/f^{\alpha}$ processes with possible long range correlations. The temporal
scaling properties of the records were studied using multifractal detrended
fluctuation analysis {\em MFDFA}. It is seen that the records at all four
locations exhibit similar scaling behavior which is also reflected in the
multifractal spectrum determined under the assumption of a binomial
multiplicative cascade model.
