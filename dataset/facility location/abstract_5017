CCAT will be a 25-meter telescope for sub millimeter astronomy located at
5600m altitude on Cerro Chajnantor in northern Chile. CCAT will combine high
sensitivity, a wide field of view, and a broad wavelength range (0.35 to 2.1mm)
to provide an unprecedented capability for deep, large-area multicolor
submillimeter surveys. It is planned to have a suite of instruments including
large format KID cameras, a large heterodyne array and a KID-based direct
detection multi-object spectrometer. The remote location drives a desire for
fully autonomous observing coupled with data reduction pipelines and fast
feedback to principal investigators.
