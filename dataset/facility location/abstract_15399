We discuss the synthesis of some short-lived isotopes and of 23Na in
thermally pulsing AGB stars with initial mass of 2 Msun and two different
metallicities (Z=1.5e-2, corresponding to the metal amount in the Sun, and
Z=1e-4), representative of disk and halo stars, respectively. The different
nucleosynthesis channels are illustrated in some details. As previously found,
the 13C formed after each third dredge up episode is usually completely
consumed by alpha captures before the onset of the subsequent thermal pulse,
releasing neutrons. This is the most efficient neutron source in low mass AGB
stars and the resulting s-process nucleosynthesis is at the origin of the solar
main component. However, in the solar metallicity model, we find that the
temperature of the first formed 13C pocket remains too low during the
interpulse and the 13C is not completely burnt, being partially engulfed in the
convective zone generated by the following thermal pulse. Due to the rapid
convective mixing in this zone, the 13C is exposed to a larger temperature and
a nucleosynthesis characterized by a relatively high neutron density develops.
The main effect is the strong enhancement of isotopes located beyond some
critical branching in the neutron-capture path, like 60Fe, otherwise only
marginally produced during a standard s-process nucleosynthesis.
