The reaction $\gamma p \to \pi^0 \pi^0 p$ has been measured using the TAPS
BaF$_2$ calorimeter at the tagged photon facility of the Mainz Microtron
accelerator. Chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) predicts that close to threshold
this channel is significantly enhanced compared to double pion final states
with charged pions. In contrast to other reaction channels, the lower order
tree terms are strongly suppressed in 2$\pi^0$ photoproduction. The consequence
is the dominance of pion loops in the 2$\pi^0$ channel close to threshold - a
result that opens new prospects for the test of ChPT and in particular its
inherent loop terms. The present measurement is the first which is sensitive
enough for a conclusive comparison with the ChPT calculation and is in
agreement with its prediction. The data also show good agreement with a
calculation in the unitary chiral approach.
