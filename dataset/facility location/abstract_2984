Calculation of the Floquet quasi-energies of a system driven by a
time-periodic field is an efficient way to understand its dynamics. In
particular, the phenomenon of dynamical localization can be related to the
presence of close approaches between quasi-energies (either crossings or
avoided crossings). We consider here a driven two-level system, and study how
the locations of crossings in the quasi-energy spectrum alter as the field
parameters are changed. A perturbational scheme provides a direct connection
between the form of the driving field and the quasi-energies which is exact in
the limit of high frequencies. We firstly obtain relations for the
quasi-energies for some common types of applied field in the high-frequency
limit. We then show how the locations of the crossings drift as the frequency
is reduced, and find a simple empirical formula which describes this drift
extremely well in general, and appears to be exact for the specific case of
square-wave driving.
