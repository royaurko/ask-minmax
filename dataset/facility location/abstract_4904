Some known results for locating the roots of polynomials are extended to the
case of matrix polynomials. In particular, a theorem by A.E. Pellet [Bulletin
des Sciences Math\'ematiques, (2), vol 5 (1881), pp.393-395], some results of
D.A. Bini [Numer. Algorithms 13:179-200, 1996] based on the Newton polygon
technique, and recent results of M. Akian, S. Gaubert and M. Sharify (see in
particular [LNCIS, 389, Springer p.p.291-303] and [M. Sharify, Ph.D. thesis,
\'Ecole Polytechnique, ParisTech, 2011]). These extensions are applied for
determining effective initial approximations for the numerical computation of
the eigenvalues of matrix polynomials by means of simultaneous iterations, like
the Ehrlich-Aberth method. Numerical experiments that show the computational
advantage of these results are presented.
