The dust cannot survive closer to the star from the point where a grain
reaches a temperature equal to the sublimation temperature. The boundary
between a dust-free and a dusty region defines the sublimation wall. In the
literature two models for the structure of the wall are used: a wall with a
fixed sublimation temperature and a wall with a density-dependent sublimation
temperature. In the former, the wall is vertical and in the latter, the wall is
curved. We find important differences between these models SEDs in the
wavelength range from 3 to 8\mu m, being the emission of the former larger than
that of the latter model. We quantify the differences in IRAC colors when these
models are used to explain the observations. In the IRAC color-color diagram
([3.6]-[4.5] vs. [5.8]-[8.0]), the models are located in specific regions,
either depending on the inclination, the mass accretion rate, or which model is
used.
