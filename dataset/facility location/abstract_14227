In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the outliers of the sum a
Hermitian random matrix and a finite rank matrix which is not necessarily
Hermitian. We observe several possible convergence rates and outliers locating
around their limits at the vertices of regular polygons as in a previous work
by Benaych-Georges and Rochet, as well as possible correlations between
outliers at macroscopic distance as in works by Knowles, Yin, Benaych-Georges
and Rochet. We also observe that a single spike can generate several outliers
in the spectrum of the deformed model, as already noticed in several previous
works. In the particular case where the perturbation matrix is Hermitian, our
results complete a previous work of Benaych-Georges, Guionnet and Ma\"ida, as
we consider fluctuations of outliers lying in "holes" of the limit support,
which happen to exhibit surprising correlations.
