We report the discovery of three new star clusters in the halo of the Local
Group dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 6822. These clusters were found in the deep
images taken with the MegaPrime at the CFHT, covering a total field of 2 deg x
2 deg. The most remote cluster is found to be located as far as 79 arcmin away
from the center of NGC 6822. This distance is several times larger than the
size of the region in NGC 6822 where star clusters were previously found.
Morphological structures of the clusters and color-magnitude diagrams of the
resolved stars in the clusters show that at least two of these clusters are
proabably old globular clusters.
