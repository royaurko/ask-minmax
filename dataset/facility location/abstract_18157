We present preliminary results on Dark Matter searches from observations of
the Perseus galaxy cluster with the MAGIC Telescopes. MAGIC is a system of two
Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes located in the Canary island of La
Palma, Spain. Galaxy clusters are the largest known gravitationally bound
structures in the Universe, with masses of ~10^15 Solar masses. There is strong
evidence that galaxy clusters are Dark Matter dominated objects, and therefore
promising targets for Dark Matter searches, particularly for decay signals.
MAGIC has taken almost 300 hours of data on the Perseus Cluster between 2009
and 2015, the deepest observational campaign on any galaxy cluster performed so
far in the very high energy range of the electromagnetic spectrum. We analyze
here a small sample of this data and search for signs of dark matter in the
mass range between 100 GeV and 20 TeV. We apply a likelihood analysis optimized
for the spectral and morphological features expected in the dark matter decay
signals. This is the first time that a dedicated Dark Matter optimization is
applied in a MAGIC analysis, taking into account the inferred Dark Matter
distribution of the source. The results with the full dataset analysis will be
published soon by the MAGIC Collaboration.
