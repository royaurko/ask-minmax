New Halpha emission-line observations of the Virgo cluster galaxy NGC 4438
are presented. Fabry-Perot interferometry data at an effective angular
resolution of
 ~2" are used to map the kinematics of the ionized gas in the galaxy. For the
first time we obtain a velocity field covering a large area in NGC 4438, much
larger than that deduced from previous HI and CO maps. The kinematics of the
extended, low surface brightness Halpha filaments to the West of the galactic
disk is discussed. We report on the discovery of a northern Halpha structure
which is clumpier than the other filaments. Evidence for multiple spectral
components through the data-cube are presented in a nuclear shell and in the
approaching half of the disk. The role of VCC 1040, a dwarf elliptical galaxy
located to the South of NGC 4438, is presented to investigate the origin of a
small-scale stellar tail of NGC 4438. It could be due to a minor tidal
interaction between the two galaxies.
