We revisit the "Cluster-Cluster" or multi-view
Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometry (VLBI) technique from the perspective of its
synergy with the multi-beam features inherent in the Australian Square
Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP)and its potential to improve the outcomes of
VLBI observations with ASKAP. We include a list of candidate VLBI sites that
already support or can be upgraded to support multi-view VLBI located in
Australia and overseas, and which have common visibility with ASKAP. The
results of our previous "cluster-cluster" observations at 1.6 GHz demonstrated
the advantages of this configuration to calibrate the ionospheric distortions
responsible for the loss of positional accuracy at low frequencies, using
multiple calibrators in a range between 1 to 6 degrees away from the target.
Therefore, we conclude that joint observations of ASKAP with other multi-view
sites using "cluster-cluster" techniques would improve the outcomes of the high
spatial resolution component of ASKAP applied to astrometric projects,
achieving higher precision for many more targets, and with lower detection
thresholds. Also very wide-field VLBI mapping becomes a possibility. Looking to
the future, this would contribute to the development of new techniques that are
relevant for future high resolution observations with the SKA.
