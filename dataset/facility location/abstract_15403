We have developed an analytical model to describe the evolution of
anisotropic galactic outflows. With it, we investigate the impact of varying
opening angle on galaxy formation and the evolution of the IGM. We have
implemented this model in a Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate galaxy formation
and outflows in a cosmological context. Using this algorithm, we have simulated
the evolution of a comoving volume of size [12h^(-1)Mpc]^3 in the LCDM
universe. Starting from a Gaussian density field at redshift z=24, we follow
the formation of ~20,000 galaxies, and simulate the galactic outflows produced
by these galaxies. When these outflows collide with density peaks, ram pressure
stripping of the gas inside the peak may result. This occurs in around half the
cases and prevents the formation of galaxies. Anisotropic outflows follow the
path of least resistance, and thus travel preferentially into low-density
regions, away from cosmological structures (filaments and pancakes) where
galaxies form. As a result, the number of collisions is reduced, leading to the
formation of a larger number of galaxies. Anisotropic outflows can
significantly enrich low-density systems with metals. Conversely, the
cross-pollution in metals of objects located in a common cosmological
structure, like a filament, is significantly reduced. Highly anisotropic
outflows can travel across cosmological voids and deposit metals in other,
unrelated cosmological structures.
