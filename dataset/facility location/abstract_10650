The decay rate and the classical radiation power of an excited molecule
(atom) located in the center of a dispersive and absorbing dielectric sphere
taken as a simple model of a cavity are calculated adopting the Onsager model
for the local field. The local-field correction factor to the external
(radiation and absorption) power loss of the molecule is found to be
$|3\epsilon(\omega)/[3\epsilon(\omega)+1]|^2$, with $\epsilon(\omega)$ being
the dielectric function of the sphere. However, local-field corrections to the
total decay rate (power loss) of the molecule are found to be much more
complex, including those to the decay rate in the infinite cavity medium, as
derived very recently by Scheel et al. [Rev. A 60, 4094 (1999)], and similiar
corrections to the cavity-induced decay rate. The results obtained can be cast
into model-independent forms. This suggests the general results for the
local-field corrections to the decay rate and to the external power loss of a
molecule in an absorbing cavity valid for molecule positions away from the
cavity walls.
