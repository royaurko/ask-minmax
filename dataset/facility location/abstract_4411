Recent observations of microlensing events in the Large Magellanic Cloud
suggest that a sizeable fraction of the galactic halo is in form of MACHOs with
mass less than abou 0.1 M_{\odot}. Here we argue that molecular clouds (mainly
H_2) located in the galactic halo can contribute substantially to its total
mass. We outline a scenario in which dark clusters of MACHOs and molecular
clouds naturally form in the halo at large galactocentric distances. Possible
ways of detecting MACHOs via infrared emission and molecular clouds via the
induced gamma-ray flux are discussed. Molecular clouds located in the M31 dark
halo could be discovered through cosmic background radiation (CBR) anisotropies
or emission lines in the microwave band.
