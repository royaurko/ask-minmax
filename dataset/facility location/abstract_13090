For a Selkov--Schnakenberg model as a prototype reaction-diffusion system on
two dimensional domains we use the continuation and bifurcation software
pde2path to numerically calculate branches of patterns embedded in patterns,
for instance hexagons embedded in stripes and vice versa, with a planar
interface between the two patterns. We use the Ginzburg-Landau reduction to
approximate the locations of these branches by Maxwell points for the
associated Ginzburg-Landau system. For our basic model, some but not all of
these branches show a snaking behaviour in parameter space, over the given
computational domains. The (numerical) non-snaking behaviour appears to be
related to too narrow bistable ranges with rather small Ginzburg-Landau energy
differences. This claim is illustrated by a suitable generalized model. Besides
the localized patterns with planar interfaces we also give a number of examples
of fully localized atterns over patterns, for instance hexagon patches embedded
in radial stripes, and fully localized hexagon patches over straight stripes.
