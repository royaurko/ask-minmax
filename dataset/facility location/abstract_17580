We probe the interstellar medium towards the objects Circinus X-1, a low-mass
X-ray binary with relativistic jets; and the highly energetic Westerlund 2
stellar cluster, which is located towards TeV gamma-ray emission and
interesting arc- and jet-like features seen in Nanten 12CO data. We have mapped
both regions with the Mopra radio telescope, in 7 mm and 12 mm wavebands,
looking for evidence of disrupted/dense gas caused by the interaction between
high energy outflows and the ISM. Towards Westerlund 2, peaks in CS(J=1-0)
emission indicate high density gas towards the middle of the arc and the
endpoint of the jet; and radio recombination line emission is seen overlapping
the coincident HII region RCW49. Towards Circinus X-1, 12CO(J=1-0) Nanten data
reveals three molecular clouds that lie in the region of Cir X-1. Gas
parameters for each cloud are presented here.
