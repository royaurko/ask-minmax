High-resolution observations of a quiet Sun internetwork region taken with
the Solar 1-m Swedish Telescope in La Palma are analyzed. We determine the
location of small-scale vortex motions in the solar photospheric region by
computing the horizontal proper motions of small-scale structures on time
series of images. These plasma convectively-driven swirl motions are associated
to: (1) downdrafts (that have been commonly explained as corresponding to sites
where the plasma is cooled down and hence returned to the interior below the
visible photospheric level), and (2) horizontal velocity vectors converging
into a central point. The sink cores are proved to be the final destination of
passive floats tracing plasma flows towards the center of each vortex. We
establish the occurrence of these events to be 1.4 x 10^(-3) and 1.6 x 10^(-3)
vortices Mm^(-2) min^(-1) respectively for two time series analyzed here.
