We present UBVRI photometry obtained from Mosaic images of M31 and M33 using
the KPNO 4-m telescope. The survey covers 2.2 sq degrees of M31, and 0.8 sq
degrees of M33, chosen so as to include all of the regions currently active in
forming massive stars. The catalog contains 371,781 and 146,622 stars in M31
and M33, respectively, where every star has a counterpart (at least) in B, V,
and R. We compare our photometry to previous studies. We provide cross
references to the stars confirmed as members by spectroscopy, and compare the
location of these to the complete set in color-magnitude diagrams. While
follow-up spectroscopy is needed for many projects, we demonstrate the success
of our photometry in being able to distinguish M31/M33 members from foreground
Galactic stars. We also present the results of newly obtained spectroscopy,
which identifies 34 newly confirmed members, including B-A supergiants, the
earliest O star known in M31, and two new Luminous Blue Variable candidates
whose spectra are similar to that of P Cygni.
