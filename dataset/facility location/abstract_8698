During a BeppoSAX observation of the X-ray burst source X1732-304 located in
the globular cluster Terzan 1 in 1999 April, the source was detected in an
anomalously low-state with an X-ray luminosity of 1.4 x 10^33 erg/s$, about 300
times fainter than the lowest previously reported measure of the persistent
flux. The spectral shape and intensity of this low-state emission is similar to
that of a number of neutron star soft X-ray transients in quiescence, being
well fit by a ~0.34 keV blackbody together with a power-law with a photon index
of ~1.0. These similarities suggest that the same mechanism, such as the
inhibition of accretion due to the propeller effect, is also operating in
X1732-304. Alternatively, the X1732-304 low-state may be due to obscuration of
the line of sight to the central neutron star, with only scattered and/or
reflected X-rays being detected. The possibility that the source detected by
BeppoSAX is not X1732-304, but a nearby dim source of the cluster field (what
would make the observed dimming of X1732-304 even more remarkable) is also
discussed.
