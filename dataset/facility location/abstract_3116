Contrasting to advances in street/outdoor navigation, wall mounted maps and
signs continue to be the primary reference indoor navigation in hospitals,
malls, museums, etc. The proliferation of mobile devices and the growing demand
for location aware systems that filter information based on currently device
location have led to an increase in research and product development in this
field. An attempt has been made to provide solution for indoor navigation on
Google maps and to provide location of a user in a building using Wi-Fi signal
strength on android Smartphone.
