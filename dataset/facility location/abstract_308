The Japan Hadron Facility will provide an unprecedented opportunity for the
study of baryon resonance properties. This talk will focus on the chiral
nonanalytic behaviour of magnetic moments exclusive to baryons with open decay
channels. To illustrate the novel features associated with an open decay
channel, we consider the ``Access'' quark model, where an analytic continuation
of chiral perturbation theory is employed to connect results obtained using the
constituent quark model in the limit of SU(3)-flavour symmetry to empirical
determinations.
