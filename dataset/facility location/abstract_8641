Deep images of the galactic globular cluster M4 taken at various locations
with the NIC3 and the WFPC2 cameras on HST were used to derive detailed local
optical and near IR luminosity functions. White dwarfs have been detected for
the first time on a color sequence at constant luminosity in the F110W band.
Transformation of the observed luminosity functions into mass functions via the
most up to date theoretical mass luminosity relations currently available
results in best fit local mass functions, that consist of a power-law with
single exponent x = -0.8 for the inner regions and a two-segment power-law
which rises with x = 1 down to M_{814}=8.5 and then drops all the way to the
detection limit with x = -0.3 for the outer regions.
