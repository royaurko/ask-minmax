The {\sc Majorana} collaboration is searching for neutrinoless double beta
decay using $^{76}$Ge, which has been shown to have a number of advantages in
terms of sensitivities and backgrounds. The observation of neutrinoless
double-beta decay would show that lepton number is violated and that neutrinos
are Majorana particles and would simultaneously provide information on neutrino
mass. Attaining sensitivities for neutrino masses in the inverted hierarchy
region, $15 - 50$ meV, will require large, tonne-scale detectors with extremely
low backgrounds, at the level of $\sim$1 count/t-y or lower in the region of
the signal. The {\sc Majorana} collaboration, with funding support from DOE
Office of Nuclear Physics and NSF Particle Astrophysics, is constructing the
{\sc Demonstrator}, an array consisting of 40 kg of p-type point-contact
high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors, of which $\sim$30 kg will be enriched
to 87% in $^{76}$Ge. The {\sc Demonstrator} is being constructed in a clean
room laboratory facility at the 4850' level (4300 m.w.e.) of the Sanford
Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, SD. It utilizes a compact graded
shield approach with the inner portion consisting of ultra-clean Cu that is
being electroformed and machined underground. The primary aim of the {\sc
Demonstrator} is to show the feasibility of a future tonne-scale measurement in
terms of backgrounds and scalability.
