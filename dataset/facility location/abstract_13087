The concepts of alpha- and beta-packets of the periodic table of chemical
elements and chemical compounds are defined. The first of the 47 minerals
alpha-packets is composed. In it all minerals are arranged in increasing Iav
index of proportionality of atomic weights of composing chemical elements, the
same way as chemical elements are located in increasing atomic weights in the
Periodic table. The packet includes 93 known minerals and two compounds - N2O5
and CO2 - being actually minerals. Beta-packet of oxides and hydroxides
minerals includes 88 known minerals and five chemical compounds - N2O5, CO2,
CO, SO3 and SO2. Two minerals of the packet have not been determined yet.
Besides, beta-packet of minerals with sulfur, selenium or arsenic is composed,
with one mineral not defined yet. The results of the calculations can be used
for further development of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements and Chemical
Compounds and their properties investigation.
