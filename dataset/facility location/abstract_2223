The reactions $\gamma p \rightarrow K^{+}\Sigma^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$ were studied
with the SAPHIR detector using a tagged photon beam at the electron stretcher
facility ELSA in Bonn. The decays $\Sigma^{-} \rightarrow n\pi^{-}$ and
$\Sigma^{+} \rightarrow n\pi^{+}, p\pi^0$ were fully reconstructed. Reaction
cross sections were measured as a function of the photon energy from threshold
up to $2.6\,$GeV with considerably improved statistics compared to a previous
bubble chamber measurement. The cross sections rise monotonously with
increasing photon energy. The two-particle mass distributions of
$\Sigma^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$ and $K^+\pi^-$ show substantial production of resonant
states.
