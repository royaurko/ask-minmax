A review of data on the nucleon electromagnetic form factors in the
space-like region is presented. Recent results from experiments using polarized
beams and polarized targets or nucleon recoil polarimeters have yielded a
significant improvement on the precision of the data obtained with the
traditional Rosenbluth separation. Future plans for extended measurements are
outlined.
