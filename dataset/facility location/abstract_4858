We detected peaks of oscillatory power at 3 and ~6.5 minutes in the umbra of
the central sunspot of the active region NOAA AR 10707 in data obtained in the
near infrared (NIR) continuum at 1565.7 nm. The NIR dataset captured umbral
dynamics around 50 km below the photospheric level. The umbra does not
oscillate as a whole, but rather in distinct parts that are distributed over
the umbral surface. The most powerful oscillations, close to a period of ~ 6.5,
do not propagate upward. We noted a plethora of large umbral dots that
persisted for more than 30 minutes and stayed in the same locations. The peaks
of oscillatory power above the detected umbral dots are located at 3 and 5
minutes oscillations, but are very weak in comparison with the oscillations of
~ 6.5 minutes.
