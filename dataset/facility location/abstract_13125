For mirror nuclei with masses A=42-95, the effects of isospin nonconserving
nuclear forces are studied with nuclear shell model using the Coulomb
displacement energy and triplet displacement energy as probes. It is shown that
the characteristic behavior of the displacement energies can be well reproduced
if the isovector and isotensor nuclear interactions with J=0 and T=1 are
introduced into the f7/2 shell. These forces, with their strengths being found
consistent with the nucleon-nucleon scattering data, tend to modify nuclear
binding energies near the N=Z line. At present, no evidence is found that these
forces are needed for the upper fp-shell. Theoretical one- and two-proton
separation energies are predicted accordingly, and locations of the proton
drip-line are thereby suggested.
