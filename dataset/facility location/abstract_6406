We demonstrate experimentally that a single Rb atom excited to the
$79d_{5/2}$ level blocks the subsequent excitation of a second atom located
more than $10 \mu\rm m$ away. The observed probability of double excitation of
$\sim 30%$ is consistent with a theoretical model based on calculations of the
long range dipole-dipole interaction between atoms.
