The present study makes use of polynomial chaos expansions to compute Sobol'
indices in the frame of a global sensitivity analysis of hydro-dispersive
parameters in a synthetic multi-layered hydrogeological model. The model
introduced in this paper is a simplified vertical cross-section of a segment of
the subsurface of the Paris Basin. This 15-layer numerical model is aimed at
exploring the behavior of groundwater and solute fluxes when accounting for
uncertain advective and dispersive parameters. Applying conservative ranges,
the uncertainty in the input variables is propagated upon the mean lifetime
expectancy of water molecules departing from a specific location within a
highly confining layer situated in the middle of the numerical model. The
sensitivity analysis indicates that the variability in the mean lifetime
expectancy can be sufficiently explained by the uncertainty in the petrofacies,
\ie the sets of porosity and hydraulic conductivity, of only a few layers of
the model.
