The Galactic Center Ridge has been observed extensively in the past by both
GeV and TeV instruments revealing a wealth of structure, including both a
diffuse component, the point sources G0.9+0.1 (a composite supernova remnant)
and SgrA* (believed to be associated with the super massive black hole located
at the center of our galaxy). Previous observations (> 300 GeV) with the
H.E.S.S. array have also detected an extended TeV component along the Galactic
plane due to either diffuse emission or a host of unresolved point sources.
Here we report on the VERITAS observations of the Galactic Center Ridge from
2010-2014 in the energy range above 2 TeV. From these observations we 1.)
Provide improved measurements of the differential energy spectra for SgrA* in
the multi-TeV regime, 2.) Provide a detection in the >2 TeV band of the
composite SNR G0.9+0.1 and an improvement of its multi-TeV energy spectrum. 3.)
Report on the detection of an extended component of emission along the Galactic
plane by VERITAS. 4.) Report on the detection of VER J1746-289, a localized
enhancement of TeV emission along the Galactic plane.
