A 1-meter-long trapezoidal Triple-GEM detector with wide readout strips was
tested in hadron beams at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility in October 2013. The
readout strips have a special zigzag geometry and run along the radial
direction with an azimuthal pitch of 1.37 mrad to measure the azimuthal
phi-coordinate of incident particles. The zigzag geometry of the readout
reduces the required number of electronic channels by a factor of three
compared to conventional straight readout strips while preserving good angular
resolution. The average crosstalk between zigzag strips is measured to be an
acceptable 5.5%. The detection efficiency of the detector is (98.4+-0.2)%. When
the non-linearity of the zigzag-strip response is corrected with track
information, the angular resolution is measured to be (193+-3) urad, which
corresponds to 14% of the angular strip pitch. Multiple Coulomb scattering
effects are fully taken into account in the data analysis with the help of a
stand-alone Geant4 simulation that estimates interpolated track errors.
