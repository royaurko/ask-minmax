We report on the discovery of four new radio galaxies with tailed morphology.
Tailed radio galaxies are generally found in rich environments, therefore their
presence can be used as tracer of a cluster. The radio galaxies were found in
the fields of Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations carried out
at 610 MHz and 327 MHz devoted to other studies. We inspected the literature
and archives in the optical and X-ray bands to search for galaxy clusters or
groups hosting them. All the tailed radio galaxies serendipitously found in the
GMRT fields are located in rich environments. Two of them belong to the
candidate cluster NCS J090232+204358, located at z(phot)=0.0746; one belongs to
the cluster MaxBCGJ223.97317+22.15620 at z(phot)=0.2619; finally we suggest
that the fourth one is probing a galaxy cluster at z=0.1177, located behind
A262, and so far undetected in any band. Our results strenghten the relevance
of high sensitivity and high resolution radio data in the detection of galaxy
clusters at intermediate redshift.
