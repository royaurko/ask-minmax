An electron accelerator in the 100 MeV range, similar to the one used at
BNL's Accelerator test Facility, for example, would have some advantages as a
calibration tool for water cerenkov or Liquid Argon neutrino detectors. We
describe a compact secondary beam design that could be used for this
application.
