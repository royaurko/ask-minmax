A novel mediator-free, non-enzymatic electrochemical sensor, based on a
graphene-Schottky junction, was fabricated for glucose detection. The sensor
offers a promising alternative to the conventional enzyme-catalyzed
electrochemical continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGM), as it overcomes
many of the drawbacks attributed to the enzymatic nature; namely,
irreversibility, drift, and interference with body fluids, which affect their
accuracy, reliability and longevity. Enhanced performance of the sensors is
demonstrated through the band interaction at the graphene-Schottky junction,
which yields stronger forward/reverse currents in response to 50 {\mu}L glucose
drop. Under optimized conditions, the linear response of the sensor to glucose
concentration was valid in the range from 0 to 15 mmol/L with a detection limit
of 0.5 mmol/L. The results indicated that the proposed sensor provided a highly
sensitive, more facile method with good reproducibility for continuous glucose
detection.
