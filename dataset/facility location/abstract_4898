It is demonstrated that the coordinates of the fcc-bcc-fluid triple point of
various model systems are located in a relatively narrow region, when expressed
in terms of the two proper variables, characterizing the softness and strength
of the interaction force at the mean interparticle separation. This can be
regarded as a consequence of the "corresponding states principle" for strongly
interacting particle systems we have put forward recently [S. A. Khrapak, M.
Chaudhuri, and G. E. Morfill, J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 134}, 241101 (2011)]. The
related possibilities to predict the existence and approximate location of the
fcc-bcc-fluid triple point for a wide range of pair interactions with variable
softness are illustrated. Relation of the obtained results to experimental
studies of complex (dusty) plasmas are briefly discussed.
