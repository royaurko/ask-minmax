The deuteron-emission channel in the beta-decay of the halo-nucleus 11Li was
measured at the ISAC facility at TRIUMF by implanting post-accelerated 11Li
ions into a segmented silicon detector. The events of interest were identified
by correlating the decays of 11Li with those of the daughter nuclei. This
method allowed the energy spectrum of the emitted deuterons to be extracted,
free from contributions from other channels, and a precise value for the
branching ratio B_d = 1.30(13) x 10-4 to be deduced for E(c.m.) > 200 keV. The
results provide the first unambiguous experimental evidence that the decay
takes place essentially in the halo of 11Li, and that it proceeds mainly to the
9Li + d continuum, opening up a new means to study of the halo wave function of
11Li.
