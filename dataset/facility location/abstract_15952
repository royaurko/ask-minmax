We demonstrate the prominent modification of the outer shell photoionization
cross-section in noble gas (NG) endohedral atoms NG@F under the action of the
fullerene F electron shell. This shell leads to two important effects, namely
to strong enhancement of the cross-section due to fullerenes shell polarization
under the action of the incoming electromagnetic wave and to prominent
oscillation of this cross-section due to the reflection of the photoelectron
from NG by the F shell.
  All but He noble gas atoms are considered. The polarization of the fullerene
shell is expressed via the total photoabsorption cross-section of F. The
reflection of the photoelectron is taken into account in the frame of the
so-called bubble potential that is a spherical zero --thickness potential.
  It is assumed in the derivations that NG is centrally located in the
fullerene. It is assumed also, in accord with the existing experimental data,
that the fullerenes radius R is much bigger than the atomic radius and the
thickness of the fullerenes shell . These assumptions permit, as it was
demonstrated recently, to present the NG@F photoionization cross-section as a
product of the NG cross-section and two well defined calculated factors.
