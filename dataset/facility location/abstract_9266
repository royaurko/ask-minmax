Using the Early Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) we
investigated the clustering properties of Low Surface Brightness (LSB) galaxies
in comparison to normal, High Surface Brightness (HSB) galaxies. We selected
LSB galaxies and HSB galaxies with well measured redshifts from the SDSS data
base and performed three-dimensional neighbour counting analysis within spheres
of radii between 0.8 Mpc and 8.0 Mpc. As a second analysis method we used an
N-th neighbour analysis with N varying from one to ten galaxies. Our results
show significant differences between the galaxy densities of LSB galaxies and
HSB galaxies on scales from 2 to 5 Mpc. At scales larger than 5 Mpc LSB and HSB
galaxies share the same clustering properties. In the pie-slice diagrams the
LSB galaxies appear to favour the inner rims of filaments as defined by the HSB
galaxies, with a couple of LSB galaxies even being located inside the voids.
Our results support the idea of gas-rich LSB galaxies forming and developing in
low density regions without many galaxy interactions and just now reaching the
filaments of the large scale structure.
