We present an analysis of 7Li/6Li isotope ratios along four sight lines that
probe diffuse molecular gas near the supernova remnant IC 443. Recent gamma-ray
observations have revealed the presence of shock-accelerated cosmic rays
interacting with the molecular cloud surrounding the remnant. Our results
indicate that the 7Li/6Li ratio is lower in regions more strongly affected by
these interactions, a sign of recent Li production by cosmic rays. We find that
7Li/6Li ~ 7 toward HD 254755, which is located just outside the visible edge of
IC 443, while 7Li/6Li ~ 3 along the line of sight to HD 43582, which probes the
interior region of the supernova remnant. No evidence of 7Li synthesis by
neutrino-induced spallation is found in material presumably contaminated by the
ejecta of a core-collapse supernova. The lack of a neutrino signature in the
7Li/6Li ratios near IC 443 is consistent with recent models of Galactic
chemical evolution, which suggest that the nu-process plays only a minor role
in Li production.
