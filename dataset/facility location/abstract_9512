We have analyzed 5.5 years of timing observations of 7 'slowly' rotating
radio pulsars, made with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. We present
improved timing solutions and 30, mostly small, new glitches. Particularly
interesting are our results on PSR J1814-1744, which is one of the pulsars with
similar rotation parameters and magnetic field strength to the Anomalous X-ray
Pulsars (AXPs). Although the high-B radio pulsars do not show X-ray emission,
and no radio emission is detected for AXPs, the roughly similar glitch
parameters provide us with another tool to compare these classes of neutron
stars. Furthermore, we were able to detect glitches one to two orders of
magnitude smaller than before, for example in our well-sampled observations of
PSR B0355+54. We double the total number of known glitches in PSR B1737-30, and
improve statistics on glitch sizes for this pulsar individually and pulsars in
general. We detect no significant variations in dispersion measure for PSRs
B1951+32 and B2224+65, two pulsars located in high-density surroundings. We
discuss the effect of small glitches on timing noise, and show it is possible
to resolve timing-noise looking structures in the residuals of PSR B1951+32 by
using a set of small glitches.
