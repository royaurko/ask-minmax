We present ESR results for 35-134GHz in the antiferromagnet CsCuCl3 at
T=1.5K. The external field is applied perpendicular to the hexagonal c-axis.
With our pulsed field facility we reach 50T an unprecedented field for low
temperature ESR. We observe strong resonances up to fields close to the
ferromagnetic region of ~30T. These results are discussed in a model for
antiferromagnetic modes in a two-dimensional frustrated triangular spin system.
