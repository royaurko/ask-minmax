Expansion of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is studied, in the presence of
a random potential. The expansion is controlled by a single parameter,
$(\mu\tau_{eff} /\hbar)$, where $\mu$ is the chemical potential, prior to the
release of the BEC from the trap, and $\tau_{eff}$ is a transport relaxation
time which characterizes the strength of the disorder. Repulsive interactions
(nonlinearity) facilitate transport and can lead to diffusive spreading of the
condensate which, in the absence of interactions, would have remained localized
in the vicinity of its initial location.
