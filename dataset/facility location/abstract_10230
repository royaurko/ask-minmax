The analytical expression for angular integral flux of atmospheric muons in
matter with the explicit relation of its parameters with those of the sea level
spectrum is obtained. The fitting formula for the sea level muon spectrum at
different zenith angles for spherical atmosphere is proposed. The concrete
calculations for pure water are presented. Fluctuations of muon energy losses
are taken into account by means of parametrized correction factor calculated
using survival probabilities resulted from Monte Carlo simulations.
Parametrizations of all continuous energy losses are obtained with using the
most recent expressions for muon interaction cross-sections. The corresponding
parametrization errors and field of method application are comprehensively
discussed. The proposed formulae could be useful primarily for experimentalists
processing data of arrays located deep under water or under ice.
