In the present change blindness study subjects explored stereoscopic three
dimensional (3D) environments through a virtual reality (VR) headset. A novel
method that tracked the subjects' head movements was used for inducing changes
in the scene whenever the changing object was out of the field of view. The
effect of change location (foreground or background in 3D depth) on change
blindness was investigated. Two experiments were conducted, one in the lab (n =
50) and the other online (n = 25). Up to 25% of the changes were undetected and
the mean overall search time was 27 seconds in the lab study. Results indicated
significantly lower change detection success and more change cycles if the
changes occurred in the background, with no differences in overall search
times. The results confirm findings from previous studies and extend them to 3D
environments. The study also demonstrates the feasibility of online VR
experiments.
