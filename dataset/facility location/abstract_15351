We have used phase-resolved high-resolution images and low resolution spectra
taken at the ESO Very Large Telescope, to study the properties of the low-mass
Helium White Dwarf companion to the millisecond pulsar \psr (hereafter COM
J1911$-$5958A), in the halo of the Galactic Globular Cluster NGC 6752. The
radial velocity curve confirms that \com is orbiting the pulsar and allows to
derive a systemic velocity of the binary system nicely in agreement with that
of NGC 6752. This strongly indicates that the system is a member of the
cluster, despite its very offset position ($\sim 74$ core radii) with respect
to the core. Constraints on the orbital inclination ($\gapp 70^\circ$) and
pulsar mass ($1.2-1.5 {\rm M_\odot}$) are derived from the mass ratio
$M_{PSR}/M_{COM}= 7.49\pm0.64$ and photometric properties of COM J1911$-$5958A.
The light curve in B-band shows two phases of unequal brightening
($\Delta$mag$\sim 0.3$ and 0.2, respectively) located close to quadratures and
superimposed on an almost steady baseline emission: this feature is quite
surprising and needs to be further investigated.
