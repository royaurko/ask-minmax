This document summarizes the findings of the Accelerator Working Group (AWG)
of the International Scoping Study (ISS) of a Future Neutrino Factory and
super-beam Facility. The work of the group took place at three plenary meetings
along with three workshops, and an oral summary report was presented at the
NuFact06 workshop held at UC-Irvine in August, 2006. The goal was to reach
consensus on a baseline design for a Neutrino Factory complex. One aspect of
this endeavor was to examine critically the advantages and disadvantages of the
various Neutrino Factory schemes that have been proposed in recent years.
