Radar data collected at an experimental facility arranged on purpose suggest
that the footprint of atmospheric turbulence might be encoded in the radar
signal statistics. Radar data probability distributions are calculated and
nicely fitted by a one parameter family of generalized Gumbel (GG)
distributions, G(a). A relation between the wind strength and the measured
shape parameter "a" is obtained. Strong wind fluctuations return pronounced
asymmetric leptokurtic profiles, while Gaussian profiles are eventually
recovered as the wind fluctuations decrease. Besides stressing the crucial
impact of air turbulence for radar applications, we also confirm the adequacy
of G(a) statistics for highly correlated complex systems.
