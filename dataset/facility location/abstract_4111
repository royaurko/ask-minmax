Information garnered from activity on location-based social networks can be
harnessed to characterize urban spaces and organize them into neighborhoods. In
this work, we adopt a data-driven approach to the identification and modeling
of urban neighborhoods using location-based social networks. We represent
geographic points in the city using spatio-temporal information about
Foursquare user check-ins and semantic information about places, with the goal
of developing features to input into a novel neighborhood detection algorithm.
The algorithm first employs a similarity metric that assesses the homogeneity
of a geographic area, and then with a simple mechanism of geographic
navigation, it detects the boundaries of a city's neighborhoods. The models and
algorithms devised are subsequently integrated into a publicly available,
map-based tool named Hoodsquare that allows users to explore activities and
neighborhoods in cities around the world.
  Finally, we evaluate Hoodsquare in the context of a recommendation
application where user profiles are matched to urban neighborhoods. By
comparing with a number of baselines, we demonstrate how Hoodsquare can be used
to accurately predict the home neighborhood of Twitter users. We also show that
we are able to suggest neighborhoods geographically constrained in size, a
desirable property in mobile recommendation scenarios for which geographical
precision is key.
