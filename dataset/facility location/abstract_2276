Neutrino Factory is a facility for future precision studies of neutrino
oscillations. A so called near detector is essential for reaching the aimed
precision of neutrino oscillation analysis. Main task of the near detector is
to measure the flux of the neutrino beam. Such brilliant neutrino source like
Neutrino Factory provides also opportunity for precision studies of various
neutrino interaction processes in the near detector. We discuss design concepts
of such a detector. Results of simulations of a high resolution scintillating
fiber tracker show that it is capable to measure the neutrino flux through pure
leptonic interactions with an uncertainty of the order of 1%. A full set-up of
the near detector consisting of high granularity vertex detector, high
resolution tracker and muon catcher is also presented.
