We report our numerical lattice QCD calculations of the isovector nucleon
form factors for the vector and axialvector currents: the vector, induced
tensor, axialvector, and induced pseudoscalar form factors. The calculation is
carried out with the gauge configurations generated with N_f=2+1 dynamical
domain wall fermions and Iwasaki gauge actions at beta = 2.13, corresponding to
a cutoff 1/a = 1.73 GeV, and a spatial volume of (2.7 fm)^3. The up and down
quark masses are varied so the pion mass lies between 0.33 and 0.67 GeV while
the strange quark mass is about 12% heavier than the physical one. We calculate
the form factors in the range of momentum transfers, 0.2 < q^2 < 0.75 GeV^2.
The vector and induced tensor form factors are well described by the
conventional dipole forms and result in significant underestimation of the
Dirac and Pauli mean-squared radii and the anomalous magnetic moment compared
to the respective experimental values. We show that the axialvector form factor
is significantly affected by the finite spatial volume of the lattice. In
particular in the axial charge, g_A/g_V, the finite volume effect scales with a
single dimensionless quantity, m_pi L, the product of the calculated pion mass
and the spatial lattice extent. Our results indicate that for this quantity,
m_pi L > 6 is required to ensure that finite volume effects are below 1%.
