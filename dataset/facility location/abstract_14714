We present the first comprehensive catalogue of variable stars in the Leo II
dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We have identified 148 RR Lyrae type variables, of
which 140 were amenable to derivation of variability parameters with our data.
We have also confirmed the existence of four anomalous Cepheids as identified
in previous studies.
  The average period of the RR Lyrae ab variables (0.62 days), the fraction of
c variables (0.24) and the minimum period of the RR Lyrae ab variables (0.51
days) all define Leo II as an "Oosterhoff intermediate" galaxy. We have used
the properties of these variables to derive a metallicity for Leo II of
approximately [Fe/H]=-1.9. The presence of longer period, higher amplitude RR
Lyrae variable implies a metallicity distribution that extends to as poor as
[Fe/H]=-2.3.
  Leo II's location on the period-metallicity relation of clusters, like that
of other ``Ootershoff intermediate'' objects, falls between the Oosterhoff
Class I and Oosterhoff Class II clusters. The properties of the variable
populations of these objects are consistent with the idea that the Oosterhoff
"dichotomy" is a continuum. The gap between the classes seems to be explained
by the horizontal branch of Galactic globular clusters shifting away from the
instability strip at at intermediate metallicities. However, Leo II, as well as
other Oosterhoff intermediate objects, has a second parameter effect strong
enough to leave horizontal branch stars in the instability strip.
