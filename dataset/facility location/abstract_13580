We study the dynamics of a single and a corotating vortex pair in a dipolar
Bose-Einstein condensate in the framework of dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii
equation. This simple model enables us to simulate the effect of finite
temperature on the vortex dynamics. We study the effect of dipolar interactions
on the dynamics of a single vortex in the presence of phenomenological
dissipation. In the case of a corotating vortex pair, an initial asymmetry in
the locations of the vortices can lead to different decay rates for the
constituent vortices as is the case for the condensates interacting via pure
contact interactions. We observe that the anisotropic interaction between the
component vortices manifests itself as the perceptible difference in the
trajectories traversed by the vortices in the condensate at finite
temperatures.
