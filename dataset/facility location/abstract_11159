The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), located at Oak Ridge Laboratory in the
United States, will be coming online over the next few years. In addition to
producing fluxes of high-intensity neutrons, the interaction of the proton beam
with the liquid mercury target produces copious pions. The pi+ and subsequent
mu+ decay at rest, providing a neutrino beam comprising numu, nue, and
anti-numu components. This neutrino beam is ideal for high-precision neutrino
experiments. OscSNS is a proposed multi-purpose experiment that will perform a
search for light sterile neutrinos, search for beyond the Standard Model
interactions using neutrino oscillations, and provide tests of Standard Model
predictions through world-record precision neutrino cross section measurements.
OscSNS plans to submit a full proposal for funding in 2009.
