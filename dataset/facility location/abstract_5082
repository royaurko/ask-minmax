The sign and the signed-rank tests for univariate data are perhaps the most
popular nonparametric competitors of the t test for paired sample problems.
These tests have been extended in various ways for multivariate data in finite
dimensional spaces. These extensions include tests based on spatial signs and
signed ranks, which have been studied extensively by Hannu Oja and his
cocontributors. They showed that these tests are asymptotically more powerful than
Hotelling's $T^{2}$ test under several heavy tailed distributions. In this
paper, we consider paired sample tests for data in infinite dimensional spaces
based on notions of spatial sign and spatial signed rank in such spaces. We
derive their asymptotic distributions under the null hypothesis and under
sequences of shrinking location shift alternatives. We compare these tests with
some mean based tests for infinite dimensional paired sample data. We show that
for shrinking location shift alternatives, the proposed tests are
asymptotically more powerful than the mean based tests for some heavy tailed
distributions and even for some Gaussian distributions in infinite dimensional
spaces. We also investigate the performance of different tests using some
simulated data.
