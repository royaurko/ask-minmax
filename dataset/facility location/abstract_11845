Sensitive high angular resolution ($\sim$ 2$"$) CO(2-1) line observations
made with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) of the flow emanating from the
high-mass star forming region DR21 located in the Cygnus X molecular cloud are
presented. These new interferometric observations indicate that this well known
enigmatic outflow appears to have been produced by an explosive event that took
place about 10,000 years ago, and that might be related with the disintegration
of a massive stellar system, as the one that occurred in Orion BN/KL 500 years
ago, but about 20 times more energetic. This result therefore argues in favor
of the idea that the disintegration of young stellar systems perhaps is a
frequent phenomenon present during the formation of the massive stars. However,
many more theoretical and observational studies are still needed to confirm our
hypothesis.
