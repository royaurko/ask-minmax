Photometric follow-ups of transiting exoplanets may lead to discoveries of
additional, less massive bodies in extrasolar systems. This is possible by
detecting and then analysing variations in transit timing of transiting
exoplanets. We present photometric observations gathered in 2009 and 2010 for
exoplanet WASP-3b during the dedicated transit-timing-variation campaign. The
observed transit timing cannot be explained by a constant period but by a
periodic variation in the observations minus calculations diagram. Simplified
models assuming the existence of a perturbing planet in the system and
reproducing the observed variations of timing residuals were identified by
three-body simulations. We found that the configuration with the hypothetical
second planet of the mass of about 15 Earth masses, located close to the outer
2:1 mean motion resonance is the most likely scenario reproducing observed
transit timing. We emphasize, however, that more observations are required to
constrain better the parameters of the hypothetical second planet in WASP-3
system. For final interpretation not only transit timing but also photometric
observations of the transit of the predicted second planet and the high
precision radial-velocity data are needed.
