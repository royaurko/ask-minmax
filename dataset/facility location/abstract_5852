We report results of wetting on non-planar and heterogeneous surfaces
calculated from an effective interfacial Hamiltonian model. The lack of
translational invariance along the substrate induces a series of structural
changes on the interface such as unbending and a number of non-thermodynamic
singularities and can modify the location of the wetting transition. We show
that the order of the wetting transition in the planar homogeneous system
strongly affects the behaviour of the non-planar and heterogeneous surfaces.
