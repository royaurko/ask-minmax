We present a high-resolution study of NGC 2264 IRS1 in CS(2-1) and in the
3-mm continuum using the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer. We complement
these radio data with images taken at 2.2, 4.6, and 11.9 micron. The combined
information allow a new interpretation of the closest environment of NGC 2264
IRS1. No disk around the B-type star IRS1 was found. IRS1 and its low-mass
companions are located in a low-density cavity which is surrounded by the
remaining dense cloud core which has a clumpy shell-like structure. Strong
evidence for induced on-going star formation was found in the surroundings of
IRS1. A deeply embedded very young stellar object 20 arcsec to the north of
IRS1 is powering a highly collimated bipolar outflow. The object 8 in the
closer environment of IRS1 is a binary surrounded by dusty circumbinary
material and powering two bipolar outflows.
