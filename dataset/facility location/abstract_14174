We introduce methods for efficiently computing the Gaussian likelihood for
stationary Markov random field models, when the data locations fall on a
possibly incomplete regular grid. The calculations rely on the availability of
the covariances, which we show can be computed to any user-specified accuracy
with fast Fourier transform algorithms. Several methods are presented, covering
models with and without additive error terms and situations where either
conserving memory or reducing computation time are favored, and some of the
algorithms are easily parallelized. The examples presented highlight
frequentist inference, but access to the likelihood allows for Bayesian
inference as well. We demonstrate our results in simulation and timing studies
and with an application to gridded satellite data, where we use the likelihood
both for parameter estimation and likelihood ratio model comparison. In the
data analysis, stochastic partial differential equation approximations are
outperformed by an independent block approximation.
