It is suggested that the inner energetic engine of Gamma ray burst (GRB) may
be the result of the transition of normal hadron to quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in
rapidly-rotating and spin-down newborn neutron star. When such a nascent
neutron star slows down through dipole electromagnetic and quadruple
gravitational radiation, the increasing center density may reach the QCD
transition density, i.e., 5-10 nuclear density. Such kind of energy release
from the phase transition would be responsible for GRB and its possible beaming
effect. The relative dense gaseous environment of GRB location and the iron
line observed in the X-ray afterglow support this idea. Some predictions in
this model are given. keywords: Gamma-ray Bursts, Supernova, Quark-gluon plasma
