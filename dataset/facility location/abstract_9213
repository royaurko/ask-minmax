Here we report the detection, with the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, of
the 894-GHz HDO(111-000) transition, observed in absorption against the
background continuum emission of the SgrB2 cores M and N. Radiative transfer
modeling of this feature, together with the published data set of mm and submm
HDO and H2O-18 transitions, suggests that ground-state absorption features from
deuterated and non-deuterated water trace different gas components along the
line of sight. In particular, while the HDO line seems to be produced by the
large column densities of gas located in the SgrB2 warm envelope, the H2O-18
ground-state transition detected by SWAS and KAO at 548 GHz (Neufeld et al.
2000; Zmuidzinas et al. 1995) is instead a product of the hot, diffuse, thin
gas layer lying in the foreground of the SgrB2 complex.
