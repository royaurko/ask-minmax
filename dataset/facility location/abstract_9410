We have imaged the recently discovered stellar overdensity located
approximately one core radius from the center of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal
galaxy using the Magellan Clay 6.5m telescope with the Magellan Instant Camera
(MagIC). Superb seeing conditions allowed us to probe the stellar populations
of this overdensity and of a control field within Fornax to a limiting
magnitude of R=26. The color-magnitude diagram of the overdensity field is
virtually identical to that of the control field with the exception of the
presence of a population arising from a very short (less than 300 Myr in
duration) burst of star formation 1.4 Gyr ago. Coleman et al. have argued that
this overdensity might be related to a shell structure in Fornax that was
created when Fornax captured a smaller galaxy. Our results are consistent with
this model, but we argue that the metallicity of this young component favors a
scenario in which the gas was part of Fornax itself.
