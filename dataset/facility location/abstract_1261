We study various derivations of Hawking radiation in conformally rescaled
metrics. We focus on two important properties, the location of the horizon
under a conformal transformation and its associated temperature. We find that
the production of Hawking radiation cannot be associated in all cases to the
trapping horizon because its location is not invariant under a conformal
transformation. We also find evidence that the temperature of the Hawking
radiation should transform simply under a conformal transformation, being
invariant for asymptotic observers in the limit that the conformal
transformation factor is unity at their location.
