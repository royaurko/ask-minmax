The level structure of the very neutron rich and unbound $^9$He nucleus has
been the subject of significant experimental and theoretical study. Many recent
works have claimed that the two lowest energy $^9$He states exist with spins
$J^\pi=1/2^+$ and $J^\pi=1/2^-$ and widths on the order of hundreds of keV.
These findings cannot be reconciled with our contemporary understanding of
nuclear structure. The present work is the first high-resolution study with low
statistical uncertainty of the relevant excitation energy range in the
$^8$He$+n$ system, performed via a search for the T=5/2 isobaric analog states
in $^9$Li populated through $^8$He+p elastic scattering. The present data show
no indication of any narrow structures. Instead, we find evidence for a broad
$J^{\pi}=1/2^+$ state in $^9$He located approximately 3 MeV above the neutron
decay threshold.
