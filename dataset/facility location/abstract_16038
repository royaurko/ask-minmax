Recently we proposed that K fields, that is, fields with a non-standard
kinetic term, may provide a mechanism for the generation of thick branes, based
on the following observations. Firstly, K field theories allow for soliton
solutions with compact support, i.e., compactons. Compactons in 1+1 dimensions
may give rise to topological defects of the domain wall type and with finite
thickness in higher dimensions. Secondly, propagation of linear perturbations
is confined inside the compacton domain wall. Further, these linear
perturbations inside the topological defect are of the standard type, in spite
of the non-standard kinetic term. Thirdly, when gravity is taken into account,
location of gravity in the sense of Randall--Sundrum works for these compacton
domain walls provided that the backreaction of gravity does not destabilize the
compacton domain wall. It is the purpose of the present paper to investigate in
detail the existence and stability of compacton domain walls in the full K
field and gravity system, using both analytical and numerical methods. We find
that the existence of the domain wall in the full system requires a correlation
between the gravitational constant and the bulk cosmological constant, which is
thoroughly analyzed.
