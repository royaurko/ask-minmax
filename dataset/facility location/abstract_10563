An economical procedure to upgrade the existing Fairport water Cherenkoff
detector is described. The detector will lower its energy threshold by
increased photocoverage and light yield. Furthermore, by addition of a Gd salt
it will become sensitive to neutrons produced by the inverse beta decay of
anti-neutrinos on protons. The new detector can then take advantage of the
existence of the Perry power nuclear reactor, located 12.9km away, as a large
source of anti-neutrinos. The present gap in the exclusion plot of the neutrino
oscillation parameters ($\Delta m^2$ from $2\times 10^{-4}$ to $10^{-2} eV^2$)
may be explored and closed within 12-18 months of run-time. The detector will
be able to observe other types of neutrino sources (Boron-8 solar, atmospheric,
and supernova) with unprecedented advantages. The low threshold also will allow
searching for exotic modes of proton-decay.
