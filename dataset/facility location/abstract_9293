We have used observations taken under the FUSE S405/S505 channel realignment
program to explore the diffuse FUV (1000 - 1200 \AA) radiation field. Of the 71
independent locations in that program, we have observed a diffuse signal in 32,
ranging in brightness from 1600 photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ \AA$^{-1}$
to a maximum of $2.9 \times 10^5$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$
\AA$^{-1} in Orion. The FUSE data confirm that the diffuse FUV sky is patchy
with regions of intense emission, usually near bright stars, but also with dark
regions, even at low Galactic latitudes. We find a weak correlation between the
FUV flux and the 100 micron ratio but with wide variations, perhaps due to
differences in the local radiation field.
