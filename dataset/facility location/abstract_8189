The Herschel Lensing Survey (HLS) takes advantage of gravitational lensing by
massive galaxy clusters to sample a population of high-redshift galaxies which
are too faint to be detected above the confusion limit of current
far-infrared/submillimeter telescopes. Measurements from 100-500 micron bracket
the peaks of the far-infrared spectral energy distributions of these galaxies,
characterizing their infrared luminosities and star formation rates. We
introduce initial results from our science demonstration phase observations,
directed toward the Bullet cluster (1E0657-56). By combining our observations
with LABOCA 870 micron and AzTEC 1.1 mm data we fully constrain the spectral
energy distributions of 19 MIPS 24 micron selected galaxies which are located
behind the cluster. We find that their colors are best fit using templates
based on local galaxies with systematically lower infrared luminosities.This
suggests that our sources are not like local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies
in which vigorous star formation is contained in a compact highly dust-obscured
region. Instead, they appear to be scaled up versions of lower luminosity local
galaxies with star formation occurring on larger physical scales.
