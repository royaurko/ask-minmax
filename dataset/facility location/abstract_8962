In this paper we illustrate with the case of GRB 000926 how Gamma Ray Bursts
(GRBs) can be used as cosmological lighthouses to identify and study star
forming galaxies at high redshifts. The optical afterglow of the burst was
located with optical imaging at the Nordic Optical Telescope 20.7 hours after
the burst. Rapid follow-up spectroscopy allowed the determination of the
redshift of the burst and a measurement of the host galaxy HI-column density in
front of the burst. With late-time narrow band Ly-alpha as well as broad band
imaging, we have studied the emission from the host galaxy and found that it is
a strong Ly-alpha emitter in a state of active star formation.
