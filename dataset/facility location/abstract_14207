We report on proximity-induced superconductivity of Ag(111) islands on
Nb(110). We determine the superconductive energy gap in the electronic density
of states of Ag by low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy. The energy
of the two-dimensional Ag(111) electronic surface states varies laterally over
the island due to inhomogeneous strain induced by the Nb substrate. In
particular, we find locations where the bottom of the surface-state band is
either below or above the Fermi level. This allows to investigate the effect of
bulk superconductivity in Ag on the surface-state electrons. For thick islands,
the two-dimensional Ag surface states are decoupled from the bulk and do not
exhibit a superconductive gap. For thin islands, surface-state electrons
develop superconducting correlations as observed by an energy gap in the
density of electronic bulk and surface states of Ag. This is attributed to the
penetration of the surface-state wave function to the Ag/Nb interface.
