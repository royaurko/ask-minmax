We are in a privileged location in the Universe which allows us to observe
galactic interactions from close range -- the merger of our two nearest dwarf
satellite galaxies, the LMC and SMC. It is important to understand the local
merger process before we can have confidence in understanding mergers at high
redshift. We present high resolution Nbody+SPH simulations of the disruption of
the LMC and SMC and the formation of the Magellanic Stream, and discuss the
implications for galaxy formation and evolution.
