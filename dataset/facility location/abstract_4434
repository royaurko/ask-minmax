The HST archival UV imaging polarimetry data of NGC 1068 is re-examined.
Through an extensive estimation of the observational errors, we discuss whether
the distribution of the position angles (PAs) of polarization is simply
centrosymmetric or not. Taking into account the effect of a bad focus at the
time of the observation, we conclude that, within the accuracy of HST/FOC
polarimetry, the PA distribution is completely centrosymmetric. This means that
the UV polarization originates only from scattering of the radiation from a
central point-like source.
  However, our analysis shows that the most probable location of the nucleus is
only ~0.''08 (~6pc) south from the brightest cloud called ``cloud B''. The
error circle of 99% confidence level extends to cloud B and to ``cloud A''
which is about 0.''2 south of cloud B. By this FOC observation, Cloud B is only
marginally rejected as the nucleus.
  Assuming that the UV flux is dominated by electron-scattered light, we have
also derived a three-dimensional structure of the nuclear region. The inferred
distribution suggests a linear structure which could be related to the radio
jet.
