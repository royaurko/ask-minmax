ARGO-YBJ is a full coverage air shower array located at the YangBaJing Cosmic
Ray Laboratory (Tibet, P.R. China, 4300 m a.s.l., 606 g/cm^2) recording data
with a duty cycle $\geq$85% and an energy threshold of a few hundred GeV. In
this paper the latest results in Gamma-Ray Astronomy are summarized.
