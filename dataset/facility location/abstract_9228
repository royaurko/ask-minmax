We present high resolution optical spectroscopy of three candidate members of
the Taurus-Auriga star forming region. Based on the spectral type, the
strength, profile and width of the H(alpha) line, the detected lithium at 6708
angstrom, the location of these objects in a H-R diagram and the comparison
with similar objects belonging to young stellar associations, we determine that
they are bona fide members of the SFR, with about ~3 Myr, have masses at or
below the substellar limit and, at least in one case, there is active accretion
from a circum(sub)stellar disk. This result suggests that high mass brown
dwarfs go through a Classical TTauri phase and form like stars, from colapse
and fragmentation of a molecular cloud.
