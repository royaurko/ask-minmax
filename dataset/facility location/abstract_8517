Old isolated accreting neutron stars may show up among unidentified soft
X--ray sources detected by the ROSAT All Sky Survey. We argue that the chances
of identification are greater for ONSs located in the closest overdense regions
of the solar neighbourhood. In particular, we consider the neutral hydrogen
wall in the second Galactic quadrant ($15^\circ < l < 150^\circ$) which shrinks
the estimated contour of the Local Bubble to $\approx 16-30$ pc. Due to their
vicinity, we expect $\sim 10$ ONSs to be detectable at a relatively high flux
limit ($\sim 0.1$ counts/s) in the 0.2--2.4 keV band. This implies that about 5
\% of unidentified sources above this threshold could be ONSs. No optical
counterpart is present, but EUV emission from these objects could be detected
using EUVE Lex filter at the highest sensitivity limits.
