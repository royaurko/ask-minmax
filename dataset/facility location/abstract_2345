Stainless steel-to-titanium bimetallic transitions have been fabricated with
an explosively bonded joint. This novel joining technique was conducted by the
Russian Federal Nuclear Center, working under contract for the Joint Institute
for Nuclear Research. These bimetallic transitions are being considered for use
in future superconducting radio-frequency cavity cryomodule assemblies. This
application requires cryogenic testing to demonstrate that this transition
joint remains leak-tight when sealing superfluid helium. To simulate a titanium
cavity vessel connection to a stainless steel service pipe, bimetallic
transition joints were paired together to fabricate piping assemblies. These
piping assemblies were then tested in superfluid helium conditions at Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory test facilities. The transition joint test
program will be described. Fabrication experience and test results will be
presented.
