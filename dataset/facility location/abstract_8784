The observed splittings of solar oscillation frequencies can be employed to
separate the effects of internal solar rotation and to estimate the
contribution from a large-scale magnetic field or any latitude-dependent
thermal perturbation inside the Sun. The surface distortion estimated from the
rotation rate in the solar interior is found to be in good agreement with the
observed oblateness at solar surface. After subtracting out the estimated
contribution from rotation, there is some residual signal in the even splitting
coefficients, which may be explained by a magnetic field of approximately 20 kG
strength located at a depth of 30000 km below the surface or an equivalent
aspherical thermal perturbation. An upper limit of 300 kG is derived for a
toroidal field near the base of the convection zone.
