A new amplification method, weaving the three basic compression techniques,
Chirped Pulse Amplification (CPA), Optical Parametric Chirped Pulse
Amplification (OPCPA) and Plasma Compression by Backward Raman Amplification
(BRA) in plasma, is proposed. It is called C3 for Cascaded Conversion
Compression. It has the capability to compress with good efficiency kilojoule
to megajoule, nanosecond laser pulses into femtosecond pulses, to produce
exawatt and beyond peak power. In the future, C3 could be used at large-scale
facilities such as the National Ignition Facility (NIF) or the Laser Megajoule
(LMJ) and open the way to zettawatt level pulses. The beam will be focused to a
wavelength spot size with a f#1. The very small beam size, i.e. few
centimeters, along with the low laser repetition rate laser system will make
possible the use of inexpensive, precision, disposable optics. The resulting
intensity will approach the Schwinger value, thus opening up new possibilities
in fundamental physics.
