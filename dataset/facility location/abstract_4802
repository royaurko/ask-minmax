The far site detector complex of the Daya Bay reactor experiment is proposed
as a location to search for sterile neutrinos with > eV mass. Antineutrinos
from a 500 kCi 144Ce-144Pr beta-decay source (DeltaQ=2.996 MeV) would be
detected by four identical 20-ton antineutrino targets. The site layout allows
flexible source placement; several specific source locations are discussed. In
one year, the 3+1 sterile neutrino hypothesis can be tested at essentially the
full suggested range of the parameters Delta m^2_{new} and sin^22theta_{new}
(90% C.L.). The backgrounds from six nuclear reactors at >1.6 km distance are
shown to be manageable. Advantages of performing the experiment at the Daya Bay
far site are described.
