The eta-prime meson production in the reaction pp-->pp eta-prime has been
studied at excess energies of Q = 26.5, 32.5 and 46.6 MeV using the internal
beam facility COSY-11 at the cooler synchrotron COSY. The total cross sections
as well as one angular distribution for the highest Q-value are presented. The
excitation function of the near threshold data can be described by a pure
s-wave phase space distribution with the inclusion of the proton-proton final
state interaction and Coulomb effects. The obtained angular distribution of the
eta-prime mesons is also consistent with pure s-wave production.
