It is shown that the exotic non-qqq hadrons of pentaquark $qqqq\bar{q}$
states can be clearly distinguished from the conventional qqq-baryon resonances
or their hybrids if the flavor of $\bar{q}$ is different from any of the other
four quarks. We suggest the physical process $p(e,e'K^-)Z(uuud\bar{s})$, which
can be investigated at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility
(JLab), as an ideal process to search for the existence or non-existence of the
exotic hadron of minimal pentaquark state $Z(uuud\bar{s})$. (The search for the
existence of $Z(uudd\bar{s})$ is also discussed in the paper. We added this
sentence after the original published form of this paper.)
