A new mechanism is suggested for efficient proton acceleration in the GeV
energy range; applications to non-conventional high intensity proton drivers
and, hence, to low-energy (10-200 MeV) neutrino sources are discussed. In
particular we investigate possible uses to explore subdominant $\bar{\nu}_\mu
\to \bar{\nu}_e$ oscillations at the atmospheric scale and their CP conjugate.
We emphasize the opportunity to develop these facilities in conjunction with
projects for inertial confined nuclear fusion and neutron spallation sources.
