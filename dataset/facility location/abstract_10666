We calculate the density of states of a layered superconductor in which there
are two layers per unit cell. One of the layers contains a d-wave pairing
interaction while the other is a normal metal. The goal of this article is to
understand how the d-wave behaviour of the system is modified by the coupling
between the layer-types. This coupling takes the form of coherent, single
particle tunneling along the c-axis. We find that there are two physically
different limits of behaviour, which depend on the relative locations of the
Fermi surfaces of the two layer-types. We also discuss the interference between
the interlayer coupling and pairing interaction and we find that this
interference leads to features in the density of states.
