A $\bar{K}\bar{K}N$ system with $I=1/2$ and $J^P=1/2^+$ is investigated with
non-relativistic three-body calculations by using effective $\bar{K}N$ and
$\bar K \bar K$ interactions. The present investigation suggests that a weakly
bound state for the $\bar{K}\bar{K}N$ system can be formed below the two-body
threshold of $\bar{K}$ and quasibound $\bar{K}N$ with a $40 \sim 60$ MeV decay
width of $\bar{K}\bar{K}N\to \pi Y\bar{K}$. This corresponds to an excited
$\Xi$ baryon with $J^P=1/2^+$ located around 1.9 GeV. Studying the wave
function of the $\bar{K}\bar{K}N$ system obtained in this formulation, we find
that the three-body bound system has a characteristic structure of $\bar K
N$+$\bar K$ cluster with spatial extent.
