The Chandra image of the merging, hot galaxy cluster 1E0657-56 reveals a bow
shock propagating in front of a bullet-like gas cloud just exiting the
disrupted cluster core. This is the first clear example of a shock front in a
cluster. From the jumps in the gas density and temperature at the shock, the
Mach number of the bullet-like cloud is 2-3. This corresponds to a velocity of
3000-4000 km/s relative to the main cluster, which means that the cloud
traversed the core just 0.1-0.2 Gyr ago. The 6-7 keV "bullet" appears to be a
remnant of a dense cooling flow region once located at the center of a merging
subcluster whose outer gas has been stripped by ram pressure. The bullet's
shape indicates that it is near the final stage of being destroyed by ram
pressure and gas dynamic instabilities, as the subcluster galaxies move well
ahead of the cool gas. The unique simplicity of the shock front and bullet
geometry in 1E0657-56 may allow a number of interesting future measurements.
The cluster's average temperature is 14-15 keV but shows large spatial
variations. The hottest gas (T>20 keV) lies in the region of the radio halo
enhancement and extensive merging activity involving subclusters other than the
bullet.
