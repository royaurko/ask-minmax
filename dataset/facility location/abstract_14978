An accurate value of the deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) ratio in the local
interstellar medium (LISM) and a better understanding of the D/H variations
with position in the Galactic disk can provide essential information on the
primordial D/H ratio in the Galaxy at the time of the protosolar nebula, and
the amount of astration and mixing in the Galaxy over time. Recent measurements
have been obtained with UV spectrographs on FUSE, HST, and IMAPS using hot
white dwarfs, OB stars, and late-type stars as background light sources against
which to measure absorption by D and H in the interstellar medium along the
lines of sight. Recent analyses of FUSE observations of seven white dwarfs and
subdwarfs provide a weighted mean value of D/H = (1.52 +/- 0.08) 10(-5) (15.2
+/- 0.8 ppm), consistent with the value of (1.50 +/- 0.10) 10(-5) (15.0 +/- 1.0
ppm) obtained from analysis of lines of sight toward nearby late-type stars.
Both numbers refer to the ISM within about 100 pc of the Sun, which samples
warm clouds located within the Local Bubble. Outside of the Local Bubble at
distances of 200 to 500 pc, analyses of far-UV spectra obtained with IMAPS
indicate a much wider range of D/H ratios between 0.8 to 2.2 ppm, providing
information on inhomogeneous astration in the Galactic disk.
