The cooling simulation of a high intensity ions beam by a new generation of a
buffer gas radio-frequency cooler within the SHIRaC (SPIRAL-2 High Intensity
Radiofrequency Cooler) project, installed at the SPIRAL 2/DESIR facility, is
presented. Two simulation methods for the cooling process in presence of the
space charge effect and the buffer gas diffusion will be studied. The beam
properties degradation in terms of the transmission efficienty, the
longitudinal spread energy and the transversal emittance by these effects will
be discussed. Finally, a comparison in term of transmission between simulated
and experimental results for Cs+ ions beam of intensity going up to 1{\mu}A,
will be outlined.
