We present infrared imaging and spectroscopic data of the complex massive
star-forming region G10.47+0.03. The detection of seven mid-infrared (MIR)
sources in our field combined with a sensitive Ks/ISAAC image allows to
establish a very accurate astrometry, at the level of 0.3". Two MIR sources are
found to be coincident with two ultracompact HII regions (UCHIIs) within our
astrometric accuracy. Another MIR source lies very close to three other UCHII
regions and to the hot molecular core (HMC) in G10.47+0.03. Spectroscopy of two
of the most interesting MIR sources allows to identify the location and
spectral type of the ionizing sources. We discuss in detail the relationship
between the HMC, the UCHII regions and the nearby MIR source. The nature of the
other MIR sources is also investigated.
