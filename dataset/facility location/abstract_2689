This is the first version (v1) of the Gravitational LENses and DArk MAtter
(GLENDAMA) database accessible at http://grupos.unican.es/glendama/database The
new database contains more than 6000 ready-to-use (processed) astronomical
frames corresponding to 15 objects that fall into three classes: (1) lensed QSO
(8 objects), (2) binary QSO (3 objects), and (3) accretion-dominated radio-loud
QSO (4 objects). Data are also divided into two categories: freely available
and available upon request. The second category includes observations related
to our yet unpublished analyses. Although this v1 of the GLENDAMA archive
incorporates an X-ray monitoring campaign for a lensed QSO in 2010, the rest of
frames (imaging, polarimetry and spectroscopy) were taken with NUV, visible and
NIR facilities over the period 1999-2014. The monitorings and follow-up
observations of lensed QSOs are key tools for discussing the accretion flow in
distant QSOs, the redshift and structure of intervening (lensing) galaxies, and
the physical properties of the Universe as a whole.
