The transverse spin correlations Axx and Ayy in the np-> d pi^0 reaction have
been measured for the first time in quasi-free kinematics at the COSY-ANKE
facility using a polarised deuteron beam incident on a polarised hydrogen cell
target. The results obtained for neutron energies close to 353 MeV and 600 MeV
are in good agreement with the partial wave analysis of data on the
isospin-related pp-> d pi^+ reaction, though the present results cover also the
small-angle region, which was largely absent from these data.
