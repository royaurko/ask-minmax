We investigate how models for neutrino-nucleus cross sections based on
different assumptions for the nuclear dynamics affect the forecasted
sensitivities to neutrino oscillation parameters at future neutrino facilities.
We limit ourselves to the quasi-elastic regime, where the neutrino cross
sections can be evaluated with less uncertainties, and discuss the sensitivity
reach to theta_{13} and the CP violation phase at a prototype low-gamma
beta-beam, mostly sensitive to the quasi-elastic regime.
