The adsorption of an ideal heteropolymer loop at a potential point well is
investigated within the frameworks of a standard random matrix theory. On the
basis of semi-analytical/semi-numerical approach the histogram of transition
points for the ensemble of quenched heteropolymer structures with bimodal
symmetric distribution of types of chain's links is constructed. It is shown
that the sequences having the transition points in the tail of the histogram
display the correlations between nearest-neighbor monomers.
