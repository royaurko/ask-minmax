The vivid debate concerning the paradox of information being lost when
objects are swallowed by a black hole is shown to be void. We argue that no
information is ever missing for any observer neither located above, nor falling
beneath the event horizon. The information is preserved in a classical scenario
of eternal black holes and semi-classical one allowing Hawking radiation.
