The frequency-dependent amplitude and phase in piezoresponse force microscopy
(PFM) measurements are shown to be a consequence of the Euler-Bernoulli (EB)
dynamics of atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever beams used to make the
measurements. Changes in the cantilever mode shape as a function of changes in
the boundary conditions determine the sensitivity of cantilevers to forces
between the tip and the sample. Conventional PFM and AFM measurements are made
with the motion of the cantilever measured at one optical beam detector (OBD)
spot location. A single OBD spot location provides a limited picture of the
total cantilever motion and in fact, experimentally observed cantilever
amplitude and phase are shown to be strongly dependent on the OBD spot position
for many measurements. In this work, the commonly observed frequency dependence
of PFM response is explained through experimental measurements and analytic
theoretical EB modeling of the PFM response as a function of both frequency and
OBD spot location on a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) sample. One
notable conclusion is that a common choice of OBD spot location, at or near the
tip of the cantilever is particularly vulnerable to frequency dependent
amplitude and phase variations stemming from dynamics of the cantilever sensor
rather than from the piezoresponse of the sample.
