HESS J1507-622 is one of the bright unidentified TeV objects. HESS J1507-622
is unique, since the location of the object is off the Galactic disk. We
observed the HESS J1507-622 region with the Suzaku XIS, and found no obvious
counterpart although there is no severe interstellar extinction. However, there
are two interesting X-ray objects; SRC1 is a bright extended source, and SRC2
is a faint diffuse object. If either of them is a counterpart, the flux ratio
between TeV and X-ray is large, and HESS J1507-622 is a real dark particle
accelerator.
