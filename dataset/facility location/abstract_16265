The Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) will significantly augment the science
return from the Fermi Observatory in the study of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). The
primary objective of GBM is to extend the energy range over which bursts are
observed downward from the energy range of the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on
Fermi into the hard X-ray range where extensive previous data exist. A
secondary objective is to compute burst locations on-board to allow
re-orientiong the spacecraft so that the LAT can observe delayed emission from
bright bursts. GBM uses an array of twelve sodium iodide scintillators and two
bismuth germanate scintillators to detect gamma rays from ~8 keV to ~40 MeV
over the full unocculted sky. The on-board trigger threshold is ~0.7
photons/cm2/s (50-300 keV, 1 s peak). GBM generates on-board triggers for ~250
GRBs per year.
