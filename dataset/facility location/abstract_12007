Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are the evolved descendants of massive O-type stars and
are considered to be progenitor candidates for Type Ib/c core-collapse
supernovae (SNe). Recent results of our HST/WFC3 survey of Wolf-Rayet stars in
M101 are summarised based on the detection efficiency of narrow-band optical
imaging compared to broad-band methods. Weshow that on average of 42% WR stars,
increasing to ~85% in central regions, are only detected in the narrow-band
imaging. Hence, the non-detection of a WR star at the location of ~10 Type Ib/c
SNe in broad-band imaging is no longer strong evidence for a non-WR progenitor
channel.
