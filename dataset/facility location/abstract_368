A novel method to produce neutrino beams has recently been proposed : the
beta-beams. This method consists in using the beta-decay of boosted radioactive
nuclei to obtain an intense, collimated and pure neutrino beam. Here we propose
to exploit the beta-beam concept to produce neutrino beams of low energy. We
discuss the applications of such a facility as well as its importance for
different domains of physics. We focus, in particular, on neutrino-nucleus
interaction studies of interest for various open issues in astrophysics,
nuclear and particle physics. We suggest possible sites for a low energy
beta-beam facility.
