We study a simple map as a minimal model of excitable cells. The map has two
fast variables which mimic the behavior of class I neurons, undergoing a
sub-critical Hopf bifurcation. Adding a third slow variable allows the system
to present bursts and other interesting biological behaviors. Bifurcation lines
which locate the excitability region are obtained for different planes in
parameter space.
