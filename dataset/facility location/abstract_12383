Recently, wireless communication industries have begun to extend their
services to machine-type communication devices as well as to user equipments.
Such machine-type communication devices as meters and sensors need intermittent
uplink resources to report measured or sensed data to their serving data
collector. It is however hard to dedicate limited uplink resources to each of
them. Thus, efficient service of a tremendous number of devices with low
activities may consider simple random access as a solution. The data collectors
receiving the measured data from many sensors simultaneously can successfully
decode only signals with signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) above a
certain value. The main design issues for this environment become how many data
collectors are needed, how much power sensor nodes transmit with, and how
wireless channels affect the performance. This paper provides answers to those
questions through a stochastic analysis based on a spatial point process and on
simulations.
