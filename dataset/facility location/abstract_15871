We present Spitzer/IRAC photometry on the star-forming HII region N 90,
related to the young stellar association NGC 602 in the Small Magellanic Cloud.
Our photometry revealed bright mid-infrared sources, which we classify with the
use of a scheme based on templates and models of red sources in the Milky Way,
and criteria recently developed from the Spitzer Survey of the SMC for the
selection of candidate Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). We detected 57 sources in
all four IRAC channels in a 6.2' x 4.8' field-of-view centered on N 90; 22 of
these sources are classified as candidate YSOs. We compare the locations of
these objects with the position of optical sources recently found in the same
region with high-resolution HST/ACS imaging of NGC 602, and we find that 17
candidate YSOs have one or more optical counterparts. All of these optical
sources are identified as pre-main sequence stars, indicating, thus, ongoing
clustered star formation events in the region. The positions of the detected
YSOs and their related PMS clusters give a clear picture of the current star
formation in N 90, according to which the young stellar association
photo-ionizes the surrounding interstellar medium, revealing the HII nebula,
and triggering sequential star formation events mainly along the eastern and
southern rims of the formed cavity of the parental molecular cloud.
