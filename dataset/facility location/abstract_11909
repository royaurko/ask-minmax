The goal of the present paper is to highlight the fundamental differences of
so-called synchronization or consensus algorithms when the agents to
synchronize evolve on a compact homogeneous manifold (like the circle, sphere
or the group of rotation matrices), instead of a vector space. For the benefit
of understanding, the discussion is restricted to the circle. First, a
fundamental consensus algorithm on R^n is reviewed, from which continuous- and
discrete-time synchronization algorithms on the circle are deduced by analogy.
It is shown how they are connected to Kuramoto and Vicsek models from the
literature. Their convergence properties are similar to vector spaces only for
specific graphs or if the agents are all located within a semicircle. Examples
are proposed to illustrate several other possible behaviors. Finally, new
algorithms are proposed to recover (almost-)global synchronization properties.
