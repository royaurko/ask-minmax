A new event visualization tool for the ZEUS experiment is nearing completion,
which will provide the functionality required by the new detector components
implemented during the recently achieved HERA luminosity upgrade. The new
design is centered around a client-server concept, which allows to obtain
random access to the ZEUS central event store as well as to events taken online
via the HTTP protocol, even from remote locations. The client is a lightweight
C++ application, and the ROOT system is used as underlying toolkit. Particular
attention has been given to a smooth integration of 3-dimensional and layered
2-dimensional visualizations. The functionality of server and client
application with its graphical user interface are presented.
