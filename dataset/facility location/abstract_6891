Based on ab-initio calculations we discuss Kondo effect due to Co adatom on
graphene zigzag nanoribbon. Co atom located at hollow site behaves as spin S =
1/2 impurity with dxz and dyz orbitals contributing to magnetic moment.
Dynamical correlations are analyzed with the use of complementary
approximations: mean field slave boson approach, noncrossing approximation and
equation of motion method. The impact of interplay between spin and orbital
degrees of freedom together with the effect of peculiarities of electronic and
magnetic structure of nanoribbon on many-body resonances is examined.
