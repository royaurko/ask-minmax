We present the results of an infrared photometric survey performed with
NICS@TNG in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 4214. We derived accurate
integrated JK magnitudes of 10 young massive clusters and compared them with
the already available Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet colors. These clusters
are located in the combined ultraviolet-infrared colors planes on well defined
sequences, whose shapes allow a precise determination of their age. By means of
the comparison with suitable stellar evolution models we estimated ages,
metallicities, reddening and masses of these clusters. All the analyzed
clusters appear to be younger than log(t/yr)<8.4, moderately metal-rich and
slightly less massive than present-day Galactic globular clusters. The derived
ages for clusters belonging to the secondary HII star forming complex are
significantly larger than those previously estimated in the literature. We also
discuss the possibility of using the ultraviolet-infrared color-color diagram
to select candidate young massive clusters hosting multiple stellar
populations.
