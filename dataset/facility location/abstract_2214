We demonstrate a new way of studying interplanetary magnetic field -- Ground
State Alignment (GSA). Instead of sending thousands of space probes, GSA allows
magnetic mapping with any ground telescope facilities equipped with
spectropolarimeter. The polarization of spectral lines that are pumped by the
anisotropic radiation from the Sun is influenced by the magnetic realignment,
which happens for magnetic field (<1G). As a result, the linear polarization
becomes an excellent tracer of the embedded magnetic field. The method is
illustrated by our synthetic observations of the Jupiter's Io and comet Halley.
Polarization at each point was constructed according to the local magnetic
field detected by spacecrafts. Both spatial and temporal variations of
turbulent magnetic field can be traced with this technique as well. The
influence of magnetic field on the polarization of scattered light is discussed
in detail. For remote regions like the IBEX ribbons discovered at the boundary
of interstellar medium, GSA provides a unique diagnostics of magnetic field.
