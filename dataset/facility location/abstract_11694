The ground state energy and entropy of the dilute mean field Ising model is
computed exactly by a single order parameter. An analogous exact solution is
obtained in presence of a magnetic field with random locations. Results allow
for a complete understanding of the geography of the associated random graph.
In particular we give the size of the giant component (continent) and the
number of isolated clusters of connected spins of all given size (islands). We
also compute the average number of bonds per spin in the continent and in the
islands. Then, we tackle the problem of computing the free energy of the dilute
Ising model at strictly positive temperature. We are able to find out the exact
solution in the paramagnetic region and exactly determine the phase transition
line. In the ferromagnetic region we provide a solution in terms of an
expansion with respect to a second parameter which can be made as accurate as
necessary. All results are reached in the replica frame by a strategy which is
not based on multi-overlaps.
