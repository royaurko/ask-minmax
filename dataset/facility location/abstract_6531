It has been pointed out that the Newtonian second law can be tested in the
very small acceleration regime by using the combined movement of the Earth and
Sun around the Galactic center of mass. It has been shown that there are only
two brief intervals during the year in which the experiment can be completed,
which correspond to only two specific spots on the Earth surface. An
alternative experimental setup is presented to allow the measurement to be made
on Earth at any location and at any time.
