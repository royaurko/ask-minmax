The multidimensional gravity on the total space of principal bundle is
considered. In this theory the gauge fields arise as nondiagonal components of
multidimensional metric. The spherically symmetric and cosmology solutions for
gravity on SU(2) principal bundle are obtained. The static spherically
symmetric solution is wormhole-like solution located between two null surfaces,
in contrast to 4D Einstein-Yang-Mills theory where corresponding solution
(black hole) located outside of event horizon. Cosmology solution (at least
locally) has the bouncing off effect for spatial dimensions. In spirit of
Einstein these solutions are vacuum solutions without matter.
