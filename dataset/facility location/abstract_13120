Wireless streaming of high-definition video is a promising application for 60
GHz links, since multi-Gigabit/s data rates are possible. In particular we
consider a sports stadium broadcasting system where video signals from multiple
cameras are transmitted to a central location. Due to the high pathloss of
60\,GHz radiation over the large distances encountered in this setting, the use
of relays is required. This paper designs a quality-aware coding and relaying
algorithm for maximization of the overall video quality. We consider the
setting that the source can split its data stream into parallel streams, which
can be transmitted via different relays to the destination. For this, we derive
the related formulation and re-formulate it as convex programming, which can
guarantee optimal solutions.
