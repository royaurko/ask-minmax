We have observed the central 45' region of the Galaxy at 620 MHz band of the
Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in radio continuum, and measured the
polarisation properties of 64 small diameter background extragalactic sources
seen through the -6 deg < l < 6 deg, -2 deg < b < 2 deg region with the
Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and the Very Large Array (VLA). Our
620 MHz observations show that Sgr A* is located behind the HII region Sgr A
West. Using the ATCA and the VLA observations, we measured the Faraday rotation
measure (RM) of the polarised sources. The measured RMs are mostly positive,
and show no reversal of sign across the rotation axis of the Galaxy. This rules
out any circularly symmetric model of magnetic field in the region. We estimate
the magnetic field strength in the region to be ~10 microGauss, which raises
doubts against an all pervasive milliGauss field in the central few hundred pc
of the Galaxy.
