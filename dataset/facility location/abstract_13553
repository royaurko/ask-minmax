This letter describes a direct method for computing the spatially averaged
outage probability of a network with interferers located according to a point
process and signals subject to fading. Unlike most common approaches, it does
not require transforms such as a Laplace transform. Examples show how to
directly obtain the outage probability in the presence of Rayleigh fading in
networks whose interferers are drawn from binomial and Poisson point processes
defined over arbitrary regions. We furthermore show that, by extending the
arbitrary region to the entire plane, the result for Poisson point processes
converges to the same expression found by Baccelli et al..
