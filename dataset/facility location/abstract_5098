In many atmospheric and earth sciences, it is of interest to identify
dominant spatial patterns of variation based on data observed at $p$ locations
with $n$ repeated measurements. While principal component analysis (PCA) is
commonly applied to find the patterns, the eigenimages produced from PCA may be
noisy or exhibit patterns that are not physically meaningful when $p$ is large
relative to $n$. To obtain more precise estimates of eigenimages
(eigenfunctions), we propose a regularization approach incorporating smoothness
and sparseness of eigenfunctions, while accounting for their orthogonality. Our
method allows data taken at irregularly spaced or sparse locations. In
addition, the resulting optimization problem can be solved using the
alternating direction method of multipliers, which is computationally fast,
easy to implement, and applicable to a large spatial dataset. Furthermore, the
estimated eigenfunctions provide a natural basis for representing the
underlying spatial process in a spatial random-effects model, from which
spatial covariance function estimation and spatial prediction can be
efficiently performed using a regularized fixed-rank kriging method. Finally,
the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by several numerical
examples.
