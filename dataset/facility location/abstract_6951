We have demonstrated that chirped Bragg gratings can compensate for a
chromatic dispersion by reflecting different wavelengths at different location
along the axis of the gratings. In this paper, we make use of such a
dispersion-compensating property to create a white light cavity (WLC) effect
that cancels the round trip phase shift due to propagation as the optical
frequency is tuned. A pair of LCBGs is used to make the cavity. To fulfill WLC
condition, the dispersion profile of the LCBGs is tailored by adjusting
parameters such as chirping rate, modulation depth and the length of the
grating region. Numerical simulation shows WLC bandwidth is ~10GHz.
