SDSS J030308.35+005444.1 is a close, detached, eclipsing white dwarf plus M
dwarf binary which shows a large infrared excess which has been interpreted in
terms of a circumbinary dust disk. In this paper we present optical and
near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic data for this system. At optical
wavelengths we observe heated pole caps from the white dwarf caused by
accretion of wind material from the main-sequence star on to the white dwarf.
At near-infrared wavelengths we see the eclipse of two poles on the surface of
the white dwarf by the main-sequence star, indicating that the white dwarf is
magnetic. Our spectroscopic observations reveal Zeeman split emission lines in
the hydrogen Balmer series, which we use to measure the magnetic field strength
as 8MG. This measurement indicates that the cyclotron lines are located in the
infrared, naturally explaining the infrared excess without the need for a
circumbinary dust disk. We also detect magnetically-confined material located
roughly midway between the two stars. Using measurements of the radial velocity
amplitude and rotational broadening of the M star we constrain the physical
parameters of the system, a first for a magnetic white dwarf, and the location
of the poles on the surface of the white dwarf. SDSS J030308.35+005444.1 is a
pre-cataclysmic variable that will likely evolve into an intermediate polar in
~1Gyr.
