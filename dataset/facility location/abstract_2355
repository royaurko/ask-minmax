Major advances in state-of-the-art theoretical methods coupled with advances
in computational architectures have opened the doorway to large-scale
computations on elements across the periodic table, allowing the inclusion of
fully relativistic effects. Whenever possible results have been benchmarked
against high resolution measurements obtained from either synchrotron radiation
facilities or satellite observations. Various stages of ionization, necessary
for the many applications in astrophysics, can be studied in the absence of
experimental values to obtain the necessary data. A simple review is presented
of photoionization, fluorescence and inner-shell processes recently
investigated.
