We use a new, improved version of the HI Parkes All-Sky Survey to search for
HI emission from nine new, ultra-faint Milky Way satellite galaxy candidates
recently discovered in data from the Dark Energy Survey. None of the candidates
is detected in HI, implying upper limits for their HI masses of typically
several hundred to a few thousand solar masses. The resulting upper limits on
M_HI / L_V and M_HI / M_star suggest that at least some of the new galaxy
candidates are HI deficient. This finding is consistent with the general HI
deficiency of satellite galaxies located within the Milky Way's virial radius
and supports the hypothesis that gas is being removed from satellites by tidal
and ram-pressure forces during perigalactic passages. In addition, some of the
objects may be embedded in, and interacting with, the extended neutral and
ionised gas filaments of the Magellanic Stream.
