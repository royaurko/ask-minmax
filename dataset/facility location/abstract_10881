I studied what role the US stock markets and money markets have possibly
played in the Gross Private Domestic Investment (GPDI) of the United States
from the year 1959 to the year 2001, Gross Private Domestic Investment refers
to the total amount of investment spending by businesses and firms located
within the borders of a nation. It includes both the values of the purchases of
non-residential fixed investment, which include capital goods used for
production, and the values of the purchases of residential fixed investment,
which include construction spending for factories or offices. And I created a
Multiple Linear Regression Model of the GDPI. To see if companies and private
citizens use the stock market and money markets as a way of financing capital
projects (business ventures, buying commercial and noncommercial property,
etc).
