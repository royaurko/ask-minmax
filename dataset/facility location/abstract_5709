BHR 71 is a well isolated Bok globule located at ~200 pc, which harbours a
highly collimated bipolar outflow. The outflow is driven by a very young Class
0 protostar with a luminosity of ~9 L_sun. It is one of a very small number
that show enhanced abundances of a number of molecular species, notably SiO and
CH3OH, due to shock processing of the ambient medium. In this paper the
properties of the globule and outflow are discussed.
