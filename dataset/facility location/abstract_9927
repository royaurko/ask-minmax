55Mn nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetization studies of the series of
La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 thin films have been performed at low temperature. Two
distinct lines were observed, at 322 MHz and 380 MHz, corresponding to two
different phases, the former located at the interface, with localized charges,
and the latter corresponding to the film bulk, with itinerant carriers (as it
was also found in Ca manganite films). The spin-echo amplitude was measured as
a function of a dc magnetic field applied either in the film plane or
perpendicular to it. The field dependence of both the main NMR signal intensity
and frequency shift is quite consistent with that calculated in a simple single
domain model. The best fit to the model shows that magnetization rotation
processes play a dominant role when the applied field exceeds the effective
anisotropy field. Distinctly different magnetic anisotropies are deduced from
the interface NMR signal.
