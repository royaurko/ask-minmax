We report the detection of ionized absorption in the ASCA spectrum of the
narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy IRAS 17020+4544. Subsequent optical
spectropolarimetry revealed high polarization increasing from 3% in the red to
5% in the blue, indicating electron or dust scattering as a likely origin. The
broad emission line H$\alpha$ is somewhat less polarized than the continuum,
supporting a location of the polarizing material within the AGN. The Balmer
line decrement and reddened optical spectrum support the presence of a dusty
warm absorber in this object.
  We compared the broad band optical polarization and ionized X-ray absorption
of a collection of Seyfert 1 and 1.5 galaxies, excluding classes of objects
that are likely to have significant neutral X-ray absorption. Warm absorber
objects are generally more likely to have high optical polarization than
objects with no detected ionized absorption. This result lends additional
support to the idea that the warm absorber is associated with dust and implies
either that dust transmission is responsible for at least part of the
polarization or that the polarization is revealed because of the dimming of the
optical spectrum. Spectropolarimetry of Seyfert 1s generally locates the
scattering material inside the narrow-line region and often close to or within
the broad line region, consistent with estimates of the location of the dusty
warm absorber.
