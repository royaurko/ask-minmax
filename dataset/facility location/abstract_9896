Neutron scattering studies on powder and single crystals have provided new
evidences for unconventional magnetism in Cu2Te2O5Cl2. The compound is built
from tetrahedral clusters of S=1/2 Cu2+ spins located on a tetragonal lattice.
Magnetic ordering, emerging at TN=18.2 K, leads to a very complex multi-domain,
most likely degenerate, ground state, which is characterized by an
incommensurate (ICM) wave vector k ~ [0.15, 0.42,1/2]. The Cu2+ ions carry a
magnetic moment of 0.67(1) mB/ Cu2+ at 1.5 K and form a four helices spin
arrangement with two canted pairs within the tetrahedra. A domain
redistribution is observed when a magnetic field is applied in the tetragonal
plane (Hc&#8776;0.5 T), but not for H||c up to 4 T. The excitation spectrum is
characterized by two well-defined modes, one completely dispersionless at 6.0
meV, the other strongly dispersing to a gap of 2 meV. The reason for such
complex ground state and spin excitations may be geometrical frustration of the
Cu2+ spins within the tetrahedra, intra- and inter-tetrahedral couplings having
similar strengths and strong Dzyaloshinski-Moriya anisotropy. Candidates for
the dominant intra- and inter-tetrahedral interactions are proposed.
