The Telescope Array (TA) has observed a statistically significant excess in
cosmic-rays with energies above 57 EeV in a region of approximately 1150 square
degrees centered on coordinates (R.A. = 146.7, Dec. = 43.2). We note that the
location of this excess correlates with two of the 28 extraterrestrial
neutrinos recently observed by IceCube. The overlap between the two IceCube
neutrinos and the TA excess is statistically significant at the 2$\sigma$
level. Furthermore, the spectrum and intensity of the IceCube neutrinos is
consistent with a single source which would also produce the TA excess.
Finally, we discuss possible source classes with the correct characteristics to
explain the cosmic-ray and neutrino fluxes with a single source.
