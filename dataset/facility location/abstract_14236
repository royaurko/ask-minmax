Many robotic tasks rely on the estimation of the location of moving bodies
with respect to the robotic workspace. This information about the robots pose
and velocities is usually either directly used for localization and control or
utilized for verification. Often motion capture systems are used to obtain such
a state estimation. However, these systems are very costly and limited in terms
of workspace size and outdoor usage. Therefore, we propose a lightweight and
easy to use, visual inertial Simultaneous Localization and Mapping approach
that leverages paper printable artificial landmarks, so called fiducials.
Results show that by fusing visual and inertial data, the system provides
accurate estimates and is robust against fast motions. Continuous estimation of
the fiducials within the workspace ensures accuracy and avoids additional
calibration. By providing an open source implementation and various datasets
including ground truth information, we enable other community members to run,
test, modify and extend the system using datasets or their own robotic setups.
