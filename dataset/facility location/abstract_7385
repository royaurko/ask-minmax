In recent years, Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (UAV) research and development
at Bandung Institute of Technology in Indonesia has achieved the testing stage
in the field. This testing was still being classified as the early testing,
since some of the preliminary tests were carried out in the scale of the
laboratory. The paper would discuss the laboratory test and several tests that
were done in the field. Discussions were stressed in the procedure and the aim
that will be achieved, along with several early results. The testing was
carried out in the lake with the area around 8300 Ha and the maximum depth of
50 meters. The location of the testing was chosen with consideration of
minimizing the effect of the current and the wave, as well as the location that
was not too far from the Laboratory. The type of testing that will be discussed
in paper was Heading Lock Maneuver Testing. The vehicle was tested to move with
a certain cruising speed, afterwards it was commanded by an arbitrarily
selected heading direction. The response and the behavior of the vehicle were
recorded as the data produced by the testing.
