We introduce a data analysis procedure for color transparency experiments
which is considerably less model dependent than the transparency ratio method.
The new method is based on fitting the shape of the A dependence of the nuclear
cross section at fixed momentum transfer to determine the effective attenuation
cross section for hadrons propagating through the nucleus. The hard scattering
cross section is then determined directly from the data. We apply this
procedure to the Brookhaven experiment of Carroll et al and find that it
clearly shows color transparency: the effective attenuation cross section in
events with momentum transfer $Q^2$ is approximately $40\ mb\ (2.2\
GeV^2/Q^2)$. The fit to the data also supports the idea that the hard
scattering inside the nuclear medium is closer to perturbative QCD predictions
than is the scattering of isolated protons in free space. We discuss the
application of our approach to electroproduction experiments.
