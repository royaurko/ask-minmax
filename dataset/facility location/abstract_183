The Belle experiment, part of a broad-based search for new physics, is a
collaboration of approximately 400 physicists from 55 institutions across four
continents. The Belle detector is located at the KEKB accelerator in Tsukuba,
Japan. The Belle detector was operated at the asymmetric electron-positron
collider KEKB from 1999-2010. The detector accumulated more than 1/ab of
integrated luminosity corresponding to more than 2 PB of data near 10 GeV
center-of-mass energy. Recently, KEK has initiated a $400 million accelerator
upgrade to be called SuperKEKB, designed to produce instantaneous and
integrated luminosity two orders of magnitude greater than KEKB. The new
international collaboration at SuperKEKB is called Belle II. The first data
from Belle II/SuperKEKB is expected in 2015.
  In October 2012, senior members of the Belle II collaboration gathered at
PNNL to discuss the computing and networking requirements of the Belle II
experiment with ESnet staff and other computing and networking experts. The
day-and-a-half-long workshop characterized the instruments and facilities used
in the experiment, the process of science for Belle II, and the computing and
networking equipment and configuration requirements to realize the full
scientific potential of the collaboration's work.
  The requirements identified at the Belle II Experiment Requirements workshop
are summarized in this report.
