We report on the R&D effort in the design and construction of a large size
Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) for the Proton Polarimeter Back Tracker (BT) of
the Super Bigbite Spectrometer (SBS) in Hall A at Thomas Jefferson National
Laboratory (JLab). The SBS BT GEM trackers consist of two sets of five large
GEM xchambers of size 60 x 200 cm2. The GEM chamber is a vertical stack of four
GEM modules, each with an active area of 60 x 50 cm2. We have built and tested
several prototypes and the construction of GEM modules for SBS BT is ongoing.
We describe in this paper the design and construction of the GEM module
prototype as well as the preliminary results on performance from tests carried
out in our detector lab and during test beam at Fermi National Laboratory
(Fermilab).
