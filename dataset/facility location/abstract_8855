The next generation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) will
open the regime between approx. 30 GeV and 200 GeV to ground-based gamma
observations with unprecedented point source sensitivity and source location
accuracy. I examine the prospects of observing the unidentified objects (UNIDs)
of the Third EGRET Catalog using the IACT observatories currently under
construction by the CANGAROO, HESS, MAGIC and VERITAS collaborations. Assuming
a modest spectral steepening similar to that observed in the inverse Compton
component of the Crab Nebula spectrum and taking into account the sensitivity
of the instruments and its zenith angle dependence, a detailed list of 78
observable objects is derived which is then further constrained to 38 prime
candidates. The characteristics of this agenda are discussed.
