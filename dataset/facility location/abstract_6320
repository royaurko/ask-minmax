We show that a linear molecule subjected to a short specific elliptically
polarized laser field yields postpulse revivals exhibiting alignment
alternatively located along the orthogonal axis and the major axis of the
ellipse. The effect is experimentally demonstrated by measuring the optical
Kerr effect along two different axes. The conditions ensuring an optimal
field-free alternation of high alignments along both directions are derived.
