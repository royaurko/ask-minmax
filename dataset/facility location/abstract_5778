NASA's Kepler mission will fly a photometer based on a wide-field Schmidt
camera with a 0.95 m aperture, staring at a single field continuously for at
least 4 years. Although the mission's principal aim is to locate transiting
extrasolar planets, it will provide an unprecedented opportunity to make
asteroseismic observations on a wide variety of stars. Plans are now being
developed to exploit this opportunity to the fullest.
