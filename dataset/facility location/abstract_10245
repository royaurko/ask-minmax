The dependence of the Z-resonance shape on the location of the threshold of
the N\bar{N} production (N is the 4th generation neutrino) is analyzed. The
bounds on the existence of 4th generation are derived from the comparison of
the theoretical expression for the Z-lineshape with the experimental data. The
4th generation is excluded at 95% C. L. for m_N<46.7\pm 0.2 GeV.
