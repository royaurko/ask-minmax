We present the viability of obtaining the particle size and surface coverage
in a monolayer of polystyrene particles adsorbed on a glass surface from
optical coherent reflectance data around the critical angle in an internal
reflection configuration. We have found that fitting a CSM to optical
reflectivity curves in an internal reflection configuration around the critical
angle with a dilute random monolayer of particles adsorbed on the surface can
in fact provide the particle's radius and surface coverage once the particles
are sufficiently large.
