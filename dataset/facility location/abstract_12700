A properly designed handoff algorithm is essential in reducing the connection
quality deterioration when a mobile node moves across the cell boundaries.
Therefore, to improve communication quality, we identified three goals in our
paper. The first goal is to minimize unnecessary handovers and increase
communication quality by reducing misrepresentations of RSSI readings due to
multipath and shadow effect with the use of additional parameters. The second
goal is to control the handover decisions depending on the users' mobility by
utilizing location factors as one of the input parameters in a fuzzy logic
handover algorithm. The third goal is to minimize false handover alarms caused
by sudden fluctuations of parameters by monitoring the trend of fuzzy logic
outputs for a period of time before making handover decision. In this paper, we
use RSSI, speed and distance as the input decision criteria of a handover
trigger algorithm by means of fuzzy logic. The fuzzy logic output trend is
monitored for a period of time before handover is triggered. Finally, through
simulations, we show the effectiveness of the proposed handover algorithm in
achieving better communication quality.
