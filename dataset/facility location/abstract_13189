The location of the critical end point (CEP) in the QCD phase diagram is
determined under different scenarios. The effect of strangeness, isospin/charge
asymmetry and an external magnetic field is investigated. The discussion is
performed within the 2+1 flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with Polyakov loop.
It is shown that isospin asymmetry shifts the CEP to larger baryonic chemical
potentials and smaller temperatures. At large asymmetries the CEP disappears.
However, a strong enough magnetic field drives the system into a first order
phase transition.
