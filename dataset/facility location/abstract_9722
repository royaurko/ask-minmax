We study numerically the formation of magnetization plateaux with the Lanczos
method in 2-leg ladders with mixed spins of magnitudes $(S_1,S_2)=(1,1/2)$
located at alternating positions along the ladder and with dimerization
$\gamma$. For interchain coupling $J'>0$ and $\gamma=0$, we find normalized
plateaux at $m=1/3$ starting at zero field and $m=1$ (saturation), while when
$\gamma \ne 0$ is columnar, another extra plateau at $m=2/3$ shows up. For
$J'<0$, when $\gamma<\gamma_c(J')$ we find no plateau while for
$\gamma>\gamma_c(J')$ we find four plateaux at $m=0,1/3,2/3,1$. We also apply
several approximate analytical methods (Spin Wave Theory, Low-Energy Effective
Hamiltonians and Bosonization) to understand these findings and to conjeture
the behaviour of ferrimagnetic ladders with a bigger number of legs.
