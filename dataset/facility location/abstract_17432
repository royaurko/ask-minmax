We present wide-field multiband photometry of globular cluster (GC) systems
in NGC 1399, NGC 1404, and NGC 1387 located at the central region of the Fornax
galaxy cluster. Observation was carried out through U, B, V, and I bands, which
marks one of the widest and deepest U-band studies on extragalactic GC systems.
The present U-band photometry enables us to significantly reduce the
contamination by a factor of two for faint sources (Vo~23.5). The main results
based on some 2000 GC candidates around NGC 1399, NGC 1404, and NGC 1387 are as
follows: (1) the GC system in each galaxy exhibits bimodal color distributions
in all colors examined, but the shape of color histograms varies systematically
depending on colors; (2) NGC 1399 shows that the mean colors of both blue and
red GCs become bluer with increasing galactocentric radius; (3) NGC 1399 shows
overabundance of GCs in the directions of NGC 1404 and NGC 1387, indicating
their ongoing interactions; and (4) NGC 1399 also exhibits a ~0.5' offset
between the center of the inner GC distribution and the galaxy's optical
center, suggesting that NGC 1399 is not yet dynamically relaxed and may be
undergoing merger events.
