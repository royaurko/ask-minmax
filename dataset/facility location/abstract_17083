We present a thorough description of the physical regimes for ultracold
bosons in double wells, with special attention paid to macroscopic
superpositions (MSs). We use a generalization of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick
Hamiltonian of up to eight single particle modes to study these MSs, solving
the Hamiltonian with a combination of numerical exact diagonalization and
high-order perturbation theory. The MS is between left and right potential
wells; the extreme case with all atoms simultaneously located in both wells and
in only two modes is the famous NOON state, but our approach encompasses much
more general MSs. Use of more single particle modes brings dimensionality into
the problem, allows us to set hard limits on the use of the original two-mode
LMG model commonly treated in the literature, and also introduces a new mixed
Josephson-Fock regime. Higher modes introduce angular degrees of freedom and MS
states with different angular properties.
