We present spectroscopic and photometric results for the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC) cluster Bruck 88. From the comparison of the cluster integrated
spectrum with template cluster spectra we found that the Milky Way globular
cluster template spectra are the ones which best resemble it. However, the
extracted cluster colour magnitude diagram reveals that Bruck 88 is a young
cluster (log(t) = 8.1 +- 0.1). The derived cluster age is compatible with the
presence of a Bright Red Giant (BRG) star located ~ 2.6 arcsec in the sky from
the cluster centre. We serendipitously observed HW 33, a star cluster located ~
3 arcmin to the south-east from Bruck 88. We obtained for the cluster the same
age than Bruck 88 and surprisingly, a BRG star located within the cluster
radius also appears to be compatible with the cluster age. We estimated the MK
type of the BRG star in the Bruck 88 field to be in the range G9 II/Ib - K1
III. By combining the spectrum of a star within this MK type range with a
100-150 Myr template cluster integrated spectrum, we found that a proportion
85/15 in the sense BRG/template results in a spectrum which best resembles that
of Bruck 88. This result confirms that a BRG star dominates the cluster
integrated spectrum, so that it causes the globular cluster appearance of its
integrated light.
