We present numerical results for the zero temperature persistent currents
carried by interacting spinless electrons in disordered one dimensional
continuous rings. The disorder potential is described by a collection of
delta-functions at random locations and strengths. The calculations are
performed by a self-consistent Hartree-Fock (H-F) approximation. Because the
H-F approximation retains the concept of single-electron levels, we compare the
statistics of energy levels of noninteracting electrons with those of
interacting electrons as well as of the level persistent currents. We find that
the e-e interactions alters the levels and samples persistent currents and
introduces a preffered diamagnetic current direction. In contrast to the
analogous calculations that recently appeared in the literature for interacting
spinless electrons in the presence of moderate disorder in tight-binding models
we find no suppression of the persistent currents due to the e-e interactions.
