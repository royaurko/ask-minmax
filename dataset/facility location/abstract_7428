We investigate the effect of single and multiple impurities on the
Zeeman-localized, spin polarized bound states in dilute magnetic semiconductor
hybrid system. Such bound states appear whenever a dilute magnetic
semiconductor showing giant Zeeman effect is exposed to an external magnetic
field showing nanoscale inhomogeneity. We consider the specific example of a
superconductor-dilute magnetic semiconductor hybrid, calculate the energy
spectrum and the wave functions of the bound states in the presence of a single
impurity, and monitor the evolution of the bound state as a function of the
impurity strength and impurity location with respect to the center of the
Zeeman trapping potential. Our results have important experimental implications
as they predict robust spin textures even for than than ideal samples. We find
that for all realistic impurity strengths the Zeeman bound state survives the
presence of the impurity. We also investigate the effect of a large number of
impurities and perform ensemble averages with respect to the impurity
locations. We find that the spin polarized Zeeman bound states are very robust,
and they remain bound to the external field inhomogeneity throughout the
experimentally relevant region of impurity concentration and scattering
strength.
