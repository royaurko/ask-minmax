We examine the orientations of galaxies in 43 rich Abell galaxy clusters
belonging to superclusters and containing at least 100 members in the
considered area as a function of supercluster multiplicity. It is found that
the orientation of galaxies in the analyzed clusters is not random and the
alignment decreases with supercluster richness, although the effect is
statistically significant only for azimuthal angles. The dependence of galaxy
alignment on cluster location inside or outside a supercluster and on
supercluster multiplicity clearly shows the importance of environmental effects
on the origin of galaxy angular momenta. The comparison with alignment of
galaxies in a sample of rich Abell clusters not belonging to superclusters is
made too.
