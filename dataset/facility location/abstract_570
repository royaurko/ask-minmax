Beta-decay branching ratios of 62Ga have been measured at the IGISOL facility
of the Accelerator Laboratory of the University of Jyvaskyla. 62Ga is one of
the heavier Tz = 0, 0+ -> 0+ beta-emitting nuclides used to determine the
vector coupling constant of the weak interaction and the Vud quark-mixing
matrix element. For part of the experimental studies presented here, the
JYFLTRAP facility has been employed to prepare isotopically pure beams of 62Ga.
The branching ratio obtained, BR= 99.893(24)%, for the super-allowed branch is
in agreement with previous measurements and allows to determine the ft value
and the universal Ft value for the super-allowed beta decay of 62Ga.
