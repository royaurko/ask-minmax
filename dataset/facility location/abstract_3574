If the fundamental mass scale of superstring theory is as low as few TeVs,
the massive modes of vibrating strings, Regge excitations, will be copiously
produced at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We discuss the complementary
signals of low mass superstrings at the proposed electron-positron facility
(CLIC), in e^+e^- and \gamma \gamma collisions. We examine all relevant
four-particle amplitudes evaluated at the center of mass energies near the mass
of lightest Regge excitations and extract the corresponding pole terms. The
Regge poles of all four-point amplitudes, in particular the spin content of the
resonances, are completely model independent, universal properties of the
entire landscape of string compactifications. We show that \gamma \gamma \to
e^+ e^- scattering proceeds only through a spin-2 Regge state. We estimate that
for this particular channel, string scales as high as 4 TeV can be discovered
at the 11\sigma level with the first fb^{-1} of data collected at a
center-of-mass energy \approx 5 TeV. We also show that for e^+e^- annihilation
into fermion-antifermion pairs, string theory predicts the precise value, equal
1/3, of the relative weight of spin 2 and spin 1 contributions. This yields a
dimuon angular distribution with a pronounced forward-backward asymmetry, which
will help distinguishing between low mass strings and other beyond the standard
model scenarios.
