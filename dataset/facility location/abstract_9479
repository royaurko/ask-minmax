To progress in galactic studies based on open clusters, e.g. cluster
formation rate or kinematical properties, one needs to improve the number of
open clusters observed. However, only half of the 1700 known galactic open
clusters have been properly observed so far, making any statistical
investigation insignificant, especially at larger distances from the Sun. We
study marginally investigated or neglected open clusters with Bessell CCD BVR
photometry, whose data were used to fit isochrones to the individual
color-magnitude diagrams. We examined the galactic clusters Basel 11b, King 14
and Czernik 43, the last being observed for the first time to this extent. As
well as a careful comparison to available photometry, their parameters such as
age, interstellar reddening, distance and apparent diameter were determined.
The obtained cluster properties were verified by near infrared 2MASS data. The
three investigated intermediate age clusters are all located in the galactic
disk with distances between 1.8 and 3.0kpc from the Sun.
