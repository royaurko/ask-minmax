We consider Lorentzian correlators of local operators. In perturbation
theory, singularities occur when we can draw a position-space Landau diagram
with null lines. In theories with gravity duals, we can also draw Landau
diagrams in the bulk. We argue that certain singularities can arise only from
bulk diagrams, not from boundary diagrams. As has been previously observed,
these singularities are a clear diagnostic of bulk locality. We analyze some
properties of these perturbative singularities and discuss their relation to
the OPE and the dimensions of double-trace operators. In the exact
nonperturbative theory, we expect no singularity at these locations. We prove
this statement in 1+1 dimensions by CFT methods.
