We present the PyHST2 code which is in service at ESRF for phase-contrast and
absorption tomography. This code has been engineered to sustain the high data
flow typical of the third generation synchrotron facilities (10 terabytes per
experiment) by adopting a distributed and pipelined architecture. The code
implements, beside a default filtered backprojection reconstruction, iterative
reconstruction techniques with a-priori knowledge. These latter are used to
improve the reconstruction quality or in order to reduce the required data
volume and reach a given quality goal. The implemented a-priori knowledge
techniques are based on the total variation penalisation and a new recently
found convex functional which is based on overlapping patches.
  We give details of the different methods and their implementations while the
code is distributed under free license.
  We provide methods for estimating, in the absence of ground-truth data, the
optimal parameters values for a-priori techniques.
