We compare the absolute visual magnitude of the majority of bright O stars in
the sky as predicted from their spectral type with the absolute magnitude
calculated from their apparent magnitude and the Hipparcos parallax. We find
that many stars appear to be much fainter than expected, up to five magnitudes.
We find no evidence for a correlation between magnitude differences and the
stellar rotational velocity as suggested for OB stars by Lamers et al. (1997),
whose small sample of stars is partly included in ours. Instead, by means of a
simulation we show how these differences arise naturally from the large
distances at which O stars are located, and the level of precision of the
parallax measurements achieved by Hipparcos. Straightforwardly deriving a
distance from the Hipparcos parallax yields reliable results for one or two O
stars only. We discuss several types of bias reported in the literature in
connection with parallax samples (Lutz-Kelker, Malmquist) and investigate how
they affect the O star sample. In addition, we test three absolute magnitude
calibrations from the literature (Schmidt-Kaler et al. 1982; Howarth & Prinja
1989; Vacca et al. 1996) and find that they are consistent with the Hipparcos
measurements. Although O stars conform nicely to the simulation, we notice that
some B stars in the sample of Lamers et al. (1997) have a magnitude difference
larger than expected.
