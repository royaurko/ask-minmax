For the first time, the workshop on High-Intensity and High-Brightness Hadron
Beams (HB2010), held at Morschach, Switzerland and organized by the Paul
Scherrer Institute, included a Working group dealing with the interaction
between beam and material. Due to the high power beams of existing and future
facilities, this topic is already of great relevance for such machines and is
expected to become even more important in the future. While more specialized
workshops related to topics of radiation damage, activation or thermo -
mechanical calculations, already exist, HB2010 provided the occasion to discuss
the interplay of these topics, focusing on components like targets, beam dumps
and collimators, whose reliability are crucial for a user facility. In
addition, a broader community of people working on a variety of issues related
to the operation of accelerators could be informed and their interest sparked.
