We investigate the feasibility of implementing a system called 'Follow the
BAT' that will coordinate ground-based robotic optical and near infrared (NIR)
telescopes to monitor the Swift BAT field-of-view (FoV). The system will
optimize the monitoring locations in the BAT FoV based on individual robotic
telescopes' location, FoV, sensitivity and local weather conditions. The aim is
to perform coordinated BAT FoV monitoring by professional as well as amateur
astronomers around the world. The scientific goal of the proposed system is to
facilitate detection of prompt optical and NIR emission from GRBs, especially
from short duration GRBs. We have performed a Monte Carlo simulation to
investigate the feasibility of the project.
