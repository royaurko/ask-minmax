We predict geoneutrino fluxes in a reference model based on a detailed
description of Earth's crust and mantle and using the best available
information on the abundances of uranium, thorium, and potassium inside Earth's
layers. We estimate the uncertainties of fluxes corresponding to the
uncertainties of the element abundances. In addition to distance integrated
fluxes, we also provide the differential fluxes as a function of distance from
several sites of experimental interest. Event yields at several locations are
estimated and their dependence on the neutrino oscillation parameters is
discussed. At Kamioka we predict N(U+Th)=35 +- 6 events for 10^{32} proton yr
and 100% efficiency assuming sin^2(2theta)=0.863 and delta m^2 = 7.3 X 10^{-5}
eV^2. The maximal prediction is 55 events, obtained in a model with fully
radiogenic production of the terrestrial heat flow.
