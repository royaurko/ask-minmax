The deviation from the power-law decline of the optical flux observed in GRB
970228 and GRB 980326 has been used recently to argue in favor of the
connection between GRBs and supernovae. We consider an alternative explanation
for this phenomenon, based on the scattering of a prompt optical burst by 0.1
solar masses of dust located beyond its sublimation radius 0.1-1 pc from the
burst. In both cases, the optical energy observed at the time of the first
detection of the afterglow suffices to produce an echo after 20-30 days, as
observed. Prompt optical monitoring of future bursts and multiband photometry
of the afterglows will enable quantitative tests of simple models of dust
reprocessing and a prediction of the source redshift.
