The acute disparity between increasing bandwidth demand and available
spectrum, has brought millimeter wave (mmW) bands to the forefront of candidate
solutions for the next-generation cellular networks. Highly directional
transmissions are essential for cellular communication in these frequencies to
compensate for high isotropic path loss. This reliance on directional
beamforming, however, complicates initial cell search since the mobile and base
station must jointly search over a potentially large angular directional space
to locate a suitable path to initiate communication. To address this problem,
this paper proposes a directional cell discovery procedure where base stations
periodically transmit synchronization signals, potentially in time-varying
random directions, to scan the angular space. Detectors for these signals are
derived based on a Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) under various
signal and receiver assumptions. The detectors are then simulated under
realistic design parameters and channels based on actual experimental
measurements at 28~GHz in New York City. The study reveals two key findings:
(i) digital beamforming can significantly outperform analog beamforming even
when the digital beamforming uses very low quantization to compensate for the
additional power requirements; and (ii) omni-directional transmissions of the
synchronization signals from the base station generally outperforms random
directional scanning.
