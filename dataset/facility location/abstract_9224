We present a detailed study of a binary system of tailed radio galaxies
which, along with 3C75, is the only such binary known to exist. The binary is
located in a region of low galaxy density at the periphery of a poor cluster
Abell S345, but lies close to the massive Horologium Reticulum supercluster.
The radio sources have bent tail morphologies and show considerable meandering
and wiggling along the jets, which are collimated throughout their lengths.
This work presents observations of the large-scale-structure environment of the
binary tailed radio sources with a view to examining the influence of
large-scale flows on the morphology and dynamics of the associated radio tails.
We argue that the orbital motions of the host galaxies together with tidal
accelerations toward the supercluster have resulted in the complex structure
seen in these radio tails.
