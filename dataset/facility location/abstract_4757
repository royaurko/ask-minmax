In addition to the Sun, six other stars are known to harbor multiple planets
and debris disks: HD 69830, HD 38529, HD 128311, HD 202206, HD 82943 and HR
8799. In this paper we set constraints on the location of the dust-producing
planetesimals around the latter four systems. We use a radiative transfer model
to analyze the spectral energy distributions of the dust disks (including two
new Spitzer IRS spectra presented in this paper), and a dynamical model to
assess the long-term stability of the planetesimals' orbits. As members of a
small group of stars that show evidence of harboring a multiple planets and
planetesimals, their study can help us learn about the diversity of planetary
systems.
