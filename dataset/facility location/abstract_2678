Students' satisfaction plays a vital role in success of an educational
institute. Hence, many educational institutes continuously improve their
service to produce a supportive learning environment to satisfy the student
need. For this reason, educational institutions collect student satisfaction
data to make decision about institutional quality, but till now it cannot be
determined because student satisfaction is a complex matter which is influenced
by variety of characteristics of students and institutions. There are many
studies have been performed to inspect student satisfaction in the form of
college services, programs, student accommodation facility, student-faculty
interaction, consulting hours etc. So, still we cannot have a standard method
to know what is going on about satisfaction in the case of a core course. In
this research we determined the attributes that heavily affect student
satisfaction in a core course of computer science and the current status of
other attributes as well.
