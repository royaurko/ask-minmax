Detrended fluctuation analysis is used to investigate power law relationship
between the monthly averages of the maximum daily temperatures for different
locations in the western US. On the map created by the power law exponents, we
can distinguish different geographical regions with different power law
exponents. When the power law exponents obtained from the detrended fluctuation
analysis are plotted versus the standard deviation of the temperature
fluctuations, we observe different data points belonging to the different
climates, hence indicating that by observing the long-time trends in the
fluctuations of temperature we can distinguish between different climates.
