An attempt is made in this work to decompose the "strange attractor like"
seismic electric precursor into more simple and elementary components. The
basic data files of the orthogonal (NS, EW) components of the Earth's electric
field used for the compilation of the corresponding phase maps are decomposed
by a joint non-linear inversion scheme into two basic oscillating electric
fields. The first one, called "signal", is attributed to a single current
source while the second, called "noise", is attributed to the mix-up of some
regional and randomly located current sources. The comparison of the phase maps
compiled from the raw data files to the ones compiled by the "signal" and
"noise" data shows that the newly compiled "strange attractor like" phase maps
preserve their predictive property while their appearance resembles simpler
geometrical shapes (pure hyperbolas and ellipses). Moreover, it is postulated
that its generating mechanism is the stress waves applied in the regional area
by the combined interaction of the Sun, Moon and Earth (tidal waves). The
latter mechanism, when the seismogenic area is under critical stress-charge
conditions, triggers new current sources at places where the stress has reached
locally critical stress levels and hence the "strange attractor like" seismic
precursor is generated.
