Inverse scattering and the algebraic Bethe ansatz can be used to reduce the
evaluation of form factors and correlation functions to the calculation of a
product of Bethe states. In this article we develop a method to compute
correlation functions of spin operators located at arbitrary sites of the spin
chain. We will focus our analysis on the SU(2) sector of N=4 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills at weak-coupling. At one-loop we provide a systematic treatment of
the apparent divergences arising from the algebra of the elements of the
monodromy matrix of an homogeneous spin chain. Beyond one-loop the analysis can
be extended through the map of the long-range Bethe ansatz to an inhomogeneous
spin chain. We also show that a careful normalization of states in the spin
chain requires choosing them as Zamolodchikov-Faddeev states.
