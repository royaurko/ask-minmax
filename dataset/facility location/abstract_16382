We study the stability regions and families of periodic orbits of two planets
locked in a co-orbital configuration. We consider different ratios of planetary
masses and orbital eccentricities, also we assume that both planets share the
same orbital plane. Initially we perform numerical simulations over a grid of
osculating initial conditions to map the regions of stable/chaotic motion and
identify equilibrium solutions. These results are later analyzed in more detail
using a semi-analytical model. Apart from the well known quasi-satellite (QS)
orbits and the classical equilibrium Lagrangian points L4 and L5, we also find
a new regime of asymmetric periodic solutions. For low eccentricities these are
located at $(\sigma,\Delta\omega) = (\pm 60\deg, \mp 120\deg)$, where \sigma is
the difference in mean longitudes and \Delta\omega is the difference in
longitudes of pericenter. The position of these Anti-Lagrangian solutions
changes with the mass ratio and the orbital eccentricities, and are found for
eccentricities as high as ~ 0.7. Finally, we also applied a slow mass variation
to one of the planets, and analyzed its effect on an initially asymmetric
periodic orbit. We found that the resonant solution is preserved as long as the
mass variation is adiabatic, with practically no change in the equilibrium
values of the angles.
