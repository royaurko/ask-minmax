A generalized two-brane Randall-Sundrum warped braneworld model admits of
solutions of the warp factor for both positive or negative cosmological
constant on the visible 3-brane which can resolve the naturalness problem in
connection with the fine tuning of Higgs mass in the standard model of
elementary particles. To explore the location of the standard model fermions in
such a generalized warped model, we, in this work, determine the dependence of
the localization profile of a bulk fermion on the brane cosmological constant
brane tension and the bulk fermion mass. Our results reveal that for a positive
and small value of the induced cosmological constant a bulk fermion is
localized close to the brane. On the other hand for a visible brane with
negative cosmological constant and positive tension, the fermions are localized
inside the bulk leading to phenomenologically interesting possibilities.
