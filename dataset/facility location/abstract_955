This work was inspired by contributor experiences with a telescope scheduling.
Author long time goal is to develop and further extend software for an
autonomous observatory. The software shall provide users with all the
facilities they need to take scientific images of the night sky, cooperate with
other autonomous observatories, and possibly more. This works shows how genetic
algorithm can be used for scheduling of a single observatory, as well as
network of observatories.
