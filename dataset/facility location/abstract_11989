We present an algorithm for sound analysis and resynthesis with local
automatic adaptation of time-frequency resolution. There exists several
algorithms allowing to adapt the analysis window depending on its time or
frequency location; in what follows we propose a method which select the
optimal resolution depending on both time and frequency. We consider an
approach that we denote as analysis-weighting, from the point of view of Gabor
frame theory. We analyze in particular the case of different adaptive
time-varying resolutions within two complementary frequency bands; this is a
typical case where perfect signal reconstruction cannot in general be achieved
with fast algorithms, causing a certain error to be minimized. We provide
examples of adaptive analyses of a music sound, and outline several
possibilities that this work opens.
