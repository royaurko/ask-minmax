An X-ray compact source was discovered with Chandra in a supernova remnant
(SNR) N23, located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The compact source (CXOU
J050552.3-680141) is seen in only the hard band (> 2 keV) image of N23, while
the soft band image (< 2 keV) shows diffuse emission of the SNR, with an extent
of ~60 arcsec times ~80 arcsec. The compact source is located at almost the
center of N23, and there is no identifiable object for the source from previous
observations at any other wavelength. The source spectrum is best explained by
a power-law model with a photon index of 2.2 (1.9-2.7) and an
absorption-corrected luminosity of 1.0 x 10^34 ergs s^-1 in the 0.5--10 keV
band for a distance of 50 kpc. Neither pulsation nor time variability of the
source was detected with this observation with a time resolution of 3.2 sec.
These results correspond with those of Hughes et al. (2006) who carried out
analysis independently around the same time as our work. Based on information
from the best-fit power-law model, we suggest that the source emission is most
likely from a rotation-powered pulsar and/or a pulsar wind nebula. It is
generally inferred that the progenitor of N23 is a core-collapsed massive star.
