Relations between the thermodynamics and dynamics of supercooled liquids
approaching a glass transition have been proposed over many years. The
potential energy surface of model liquids has been increasingly studied since
it provides a connection between the configurational component of the partition
function on one hand, and the system dynamics on the other. This connection is
most obvious at low temperatures, where the motion of the system can be
partitioned into vibrations within a basin of attraction and infrequent
inter-basin transitions. In this work, we present a description of the
potential energy surface properties of supercooled liquid water. The dynamics
of this model has been studied in great details in the last years.
Specifically, we locate the minima sampled by the liquid by ``quenches'' from
equilibrium configurations generated via molecular dynamics simulations. We
calculate the temperature and density dependence of the basin energy,
degeneracy, and shape. The temperature dependence of the energy of the minima
is qualitatively similar to simple liquids, but has anomalous density
dependence. The unusual density dependence is also reflected in the
configurational entropy, the thermodynamic measure of degeneracy. Finally, we
study the structure of simulated water at the minima, which provides insight on
the progressive tetrahedral ordering of the liquid on cooling.
