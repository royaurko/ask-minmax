We study the achievable rates by a single user in multibeam satellite
scenarios. We show alternatives to the conventional symbol-by-symbol detection
applied at user terminals. Single user detection is known to suffer from strong
degradation when the terminal is located near the edge of the coverage area,
and when aggressive frequency reuse is adopted. For this reason, we consider
multiuser detection, and take into account the strongest interfering signal.
Moreover, we analyze a different transmission strategy, where the signals from
two adjacent beams jointly serve two users in a time division multiplexing
fashion. We describe an information-theoretic framework to compare different
transmission/detection strategies by computing the information rate of the user
in the reference beam.
