The parameter-free predictions for the $N - P_{11}(1440)$ and $N -
P_{33}(1232)$ electromagnetic transition form factors, obtained within our
light-front constituent quark model using eigenfunctions of a baryon mass
operator which includes a large amount of configuration mixing, are reported.
The effects due to small components in the baryon wave functions, such as S'-
and D-wave, are also investigated.
