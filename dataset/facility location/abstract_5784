We investigated the low state of the polar VV Pup by collecting high S/N time
series spectra. We monitored VV Pup with VLT+FORS1 and analyzed the evolution
of its spectroscopic features across two orbits. We report the first detection
of photospheric Zeeman lines in VV Puppis. We argue that the photospheric field
structure is inconsistent with the assumption that the accretion shocks are
located close to the foot points of a closed field line in a dipolar field
distribution. A more complex field structure and coupling process is implied
making VV Puppis similar to other well studied AM Herculis type systems.
