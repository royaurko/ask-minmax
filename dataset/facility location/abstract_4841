The significant anisotropy in the arrival directions of the 69 events with
energy E> 55 EeV detected by Pierre Auger collaboration is located in the
20-degree region centered near Cen A. Not only the 2-point, but also the
3-point and 4-point autocorrelation functions are completely saturated by this
region. Besides there is an deficit of events in the direction of Virgo
cluster. If one assumes that the excess around Cen A is due to heavy nuclei
shifted from Virgo, one can explain 20-degree scale of this anomaly. Also
location of the highest energy event between the Cen A region and the Virgo
cluster supports this idea. Magnitude and direction of the magnetic field is
similar in this case to those expected for Galactic models. The existence of
nuclei sources in the sky opens the road for a self-consistent description of
Auger data.
