Over the past few years two of the largest and highest fidelity experiments
conceived have been approved for construction: Euclid is an ESA M-Class mission
that will map three-quarters of the extra galactic sky with Hubble Space
Telescope resolution optical and NIR imaging, and NIR spectroscopy, its
scientific aims (amongst others) are to create a map of the dark Universe and
to determine the nature of dark energy. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) has
similar scientific aims (and others) using radio wavelength observations. The
two experiments are synergistic in several respects, both through the
scientific objectives and through the control of systematic effects. SKA
Phase-1 and Euclid will be commissioned on similar timescales offering an
exciting opportunity to exploit synergies between these facilities.
