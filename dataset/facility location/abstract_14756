There is accumulating evidence that the faint end of the galaxy luminosity
function might be very different in different locations. The luminosity
function might be sharply rising in rich clusters and flat or declining in
regions of low density. If galaxies form according to the model of hierarchical
clustering then there should be many small halos compared to the number of big
halos. If this theory is valid then there must be a mechanism that eliminates
at least the visible component of galaxies in low density regions. A plausible
mechanism is photoionization of the intergalactic medium at a time before the
epoch of galaxy formation in low density regions but after the epoch of
formation for systems that ultimately end up in rich clusters. The dynamical
timescales are found to accommodate this hypothesis in a flat universe with
Omega_m < 0.4.
  If this idea has validity, then upon surveying a variety of environments it
is expected that a dichotomy will emerge. There should be a transition between
high density / high frequency of dwarfs to lower density / low frequency of
dwarfs. This transition should ultimately be understood by the matching of
three timing considerations: (i) the collapse timescale of the transition
density, (ii) the timescale of reionization, and (iii) the linkage given by the
cosmic expansion timescale as controlled by the dark matter and dark energy
content of the universe.
