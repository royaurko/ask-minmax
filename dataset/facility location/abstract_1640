Physics applications often involve large amounts of data and/or computing and
often require secure resource sharing across organizational boundaries, and are
thus not easily handled by today's Internet and Web infrastructures. Pamela (a
Payload Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics), is a
permanent magnet core facility with a variety of specialized detectors. It
allows the investigation of the cosmic radiation: origin and evolution of
matter in the galaxy, search for antimatter and dark matter of cosmological
significance, understanding of origin and acceleration of relativistic
particles in the galaxy. Pamela will be put in an elliptical orbit at an
altitude between 300 and 600 Km, on board of the Resurs DK1 Russian satellite
in the fall of the year 2003. The Napoli INFN Computing Center and the Pamela
Teams of the Universities of Rome, Trieste and Stockholm have performed several
network tests in order to make a comparison between Standard FTP and GridFTP
protocols.
