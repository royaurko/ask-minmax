We investigate quantitatively how the peak emission frequency of the overall
energy spectrum is at work in distinguishing RBL-like and XBL-like objects. We
employ the sample of Giommi et al. (1995) to study the distribution of BL
Lacertae objects with various locations of the cutoff of the overall energy
spectrum. We find that the sources with the cutoff located at lower frequency
are indeed sited in the RBL region of the $\alpha_{ro}-\alpha_{ox}$ plane,
while those with the cutoff located at higher frequency are distributed in the
XBL region. For a more quantitative study, we employ the BL Lacertae samples
presented by Sambruna et al. (1996), where, the peak emission frequency, $\nu
_p$, of each source is estimated by fitting the data with a parabolic function.
In the plot of $\alpha_{rx}-\log \nu_p$ we find that, in the four different
regions divided by the $\alpha_{rx}=0.75$ line and the $\log \nu_p=14.7$ line,
all the RBL-like objects are inside the upper left region, while most XBL-like
objects are within the lower right region. A few sources are located in the
lower left region. No sources are in the upper right region. This result is
rather quantitative. It provides an evidence supporting what Giommi et al.
(1995) suggested: RBL-like and XBL-like objects can be distinguished by the
difference of the peak emission frequency of the overall energy spectrum.
