On May 5, 2003 in the GRAN SASSO Underground Laboratory the first naked
high-purity Germanium detectors were installed successfully in liquid nitrogen
in the GENIUS-Test-Facility (GENIUS-TF). This is the first time ever that this
novel technique for extreme background reduction in searches for rare decays is
going to be tested under realistic background conditions.
