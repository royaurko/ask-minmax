We report the detection of a planetary companion around HIP 13044, a
metal-poor star on the red Horizontal Branch. The detection is based on radial
velocity observations with FEROS, a high-resolution spectrograph at the 2.2-m
MPG/ESO telescope, located at ESO La Silla observatory in Chile. The periodic
radial velocity variation of P = 16.2 days can be distinguished from the
periods of the stellar activity indicators. We computed a minimum planetary
mass of 1.25 MJup and an orbital semi-major axis of 0.116 AU for the planet.
This discovery is unique in three aspects: First, it is the first planet
detection around a star with a metallicity much lower than few percent of the
solar value; second, the planet host star resides in a stellar evolutionary
stage that is still unexplored in the exoplanet surveys; third, the star HIP
13044 belongs to one of the most significant stellar halo streams in the solar
neighborhood, implying an extragalactic origin of the planetary system HIP
13044 in a disrupted former satellite of the Milky Way.
