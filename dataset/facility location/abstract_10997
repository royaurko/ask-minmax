This paper concerns the inverse problem of retrieving a stationary potential
for the Schr\"odinger evolution equation in a bounded domain of RN with
Dirichlet data and discontinuous principal coefficient a(x) from a single
time-dependent Neumann boundary measurement. We consider that the discontinuity
of a is located on a simple closed hyper-surface called the interface, and a is
constant in each one of the interior and exterior domains with respect to this
interface. We prove uniqueness and lipschitz stability for this inverse problem
under certain convexity hypothesis on the geometry of the interior domain and
on the sign of the jump of a at the interface. The proof is based on a global
Carleman inequality for the Schr\"odinger equation with discontinuous
coefficients, result also interesting by itself.
