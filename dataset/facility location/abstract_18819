We report on absolute proper-motion measurements of an H2O maser source in
the NGC 281 West molecular cloud, which is located ~320 pc above the Galactic
plane and is associated with an HI loop extending from the Galactic plane. We
have conducted multi-epoch phase-referencing observations of the maser source
with VERA (VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry) over a monitoring period of 6
months since May 2006. We find that the H2O maser features in NGC 281 West are
systematically moving toward the southwest and further away from the Galactic
plane with a vertical velocity of ~20-30 km/s at its estimated distance of
2.2-3.5 kpc. Our new results provide the most direct evidence that the gas in
the NGC 281 region on the HI loop was blown out from the Galactic plane, most
likely in a superbubble driven by multiple or sequential supernova explosions
in the Galactic plane.
