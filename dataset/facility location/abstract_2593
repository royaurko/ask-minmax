Our knowledge of the dynamics and masses of galaxies in the Local Group has
long been limited by the fact that only line-of-sight velocities were
observationally accessible. This introduces significant degeneracies in
dynamical models, which can only be resolved by measuring also the velocity
components perpendicular to the line of sight. However, beyond the solar
neighborhood, the corresponding proper motions have generally been too small to
measure. This has changed dramatically over the past decade, especially due to
the angular resolution and stability available on the Hubble Space Telescope.
Proper motions can now be reliably measured throughout the Local Group, as
illustrated by, e.g., the work of the HSTPROMO collaboration. In this review, I
summarize the importance of proper motions for Local Group science, and I
describe the current and future observational approaches and facilities
available to measure proper motions. I highlight recent results on various
Milky Way populations (globular clusters, the bulge, the metal-poor halo,
hypervelocity stars, and tidal streams), dwarf satellite galaxies, the
Magellanic Clouds and the Andromeda System.
