We constructed a neutron calibration facility based on a 300-mCi Am-Be source
in conjunction with a search for weakly interacting massive particle candidates
for dark matter. The facility is used to study the response of CsI(Tl) crystals
to nuclear recoils induced by neutrons from the Am-Be source and comparing them
with the response to electron recoils produced by Compton scattering of 662-keV
$\gamma$-rays from a $^{137}$Cs source. The measured results on pulse shape
discrimination (PSD) between nuclear- and electron-recoil events are quantified
in terms of quality factors. A comparison with similar result from a neutron
reactor demonstrate the feasibility of performing calibrations of PSD
measurements using neutrons from a Am-Be source.
