The generated, prior to the Izmit Turkey large EQ, preseismic electric
signals were recorded in Greece by the VOL Earth's electric field monitoring
site. In order to explain their peculiar character and their generating
mechanism, a large scale piezoelectric mechanism was assumed that was initiated
in the Izmit seismogenic region long before the EQ occurrence time. The
theoretical analysis of the adopted physical model justifies the generation of
a number of specific electric signals that can be emitted from the focal area
before the rock formation failure. The processing of the registered by the VOL
monitoring site raw data revealed the presence of similar signals as the
expected theoretical ones. Therefore, it is concluded that long before the
Izmit EQ occurrence a large scale piezoelectric mechanism was initiated that
was modulated too by the tidally triggered lithospheric oscillation and
therefore generated the observed preseismic electric signals. The adopted
piezoelectric model provides critical information about the time of occurrence
of the seismogenic area rock formation failure and therefore the possibility
for a real short-term time prediction of a large EQ. The other two predictive
EQ parameters, location and magnitude, are discussed in the frame of electric
field triangulation and the Lithospheric Seismic Energy Flow Model (LSEFM).
