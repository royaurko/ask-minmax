We report the discovery of the optical/infra-red counterpart of the 12.3s
transient X-ray pulsar GS0834-43. We re-analysed archival ROSAT PSPC
observations of GS0834-43, obtaining two new refined positions, about 14" and
18" away from the previously published one, and a new spin period measurement.
Within the new error circles we found a relatively faint (V=20.1) early type
reddened star (V-R=2.24). The optical spectrum shows a strong Halpha emission
line. The IR observations of the field confirm the presence of an IR excess for
the Halpha-emitting star (K'=11.4, J-K'=1.94) which is likely surrounded by a
conspicuous circumstellar envelope. Spectroscopic and photometric data indicate
a B0-2 V-IIIe spectral-type star located at a distance of 3-5kpc and confirm
the Be-star/X-ray binary nature of GS0834-43.
