The np differential cross section below 350 MeV neutron laboratory energy is
studied using the energy-dependent Nijmegen partial-wave analysis PWA93. We
analyze in detail three experiments, performed at LAMPF, at TRIUMF, and at the
TSL facility in Uppsala. The issue of normalization of $np$ cross sections is
discussed, where we distinguish between measured and calculated normalizations.
This analysis leads to improved treatments of the LAMPF and TRIUMF data over
PWA93. It is shown that the LAMPF and TRIUMF data at Tlab = 212 MeV are in good
agreement with PWA93, that the LAMPF data at Tlab = 162 MeV is also in good
agreement with PWA93, but that the Uppsala data at 162 MeV is in strong
disagreement with PWA93. The reason for the disagreement is, almost certainly,
a systematic flaw in the slope of the Uppsala data.
