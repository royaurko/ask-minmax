Cloud Computing has emerged as a successful computing paradigm for
efficiently utilizing managed compute infrastructure such as high speed
rack-mounted servers, connected with high speed networking, and reliable
storage. Usually such infrastructure is dedicated, physically secured and has
reliable power and networking infrastructure. However, much of our idle compute
capacity is present in unmanaged infrastructure like idle desktops, lab
machines, physically distant server machines, and laptops. We present a scheme
to utilize this idle compute capacity on a best-effort basis and provide high
availability even in face of failure of individual components or facilities.
  We run virtual machines on the commodity infrastructure and present a cloud
interface to our end users. The primary challenge is to maintain availability
in the presence of node failures, network failures, and power failures. We run
multiple copies of a Virtual Machine (VM) redundantly on geographically
dispersed physical machines to achieve availability. If one of the running
copies of a VM fails, we seamlessly switchover to another running copy. We use
Virtual Machine Record/Replay capability to implement this redundancy and
switchover. In current progress, we have implemented VM Record/Replay for
uniprocessor machines over Linux/KVM and are currently working on VM
Record/Replay on shared-memory multiprocessor machines. We report initial
experimental results based on our implementation.
