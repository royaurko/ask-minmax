We examine the percolation model in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ by an approach involving
lattice animals, in which their relevant characteristic is
surface-area-to-volume ratio. Two critical exponents are introduced. The first
is related to the growth rate in size of the number of lattice animals up to
translation whose surface-area-to-volume ratio is marginally greater than
$1/p_c -1$. The second describes how unusually large clusters form in the
percolation model at parameter values slightly below $p_c$. Certain
inequalities on the pair of exponents cannot be satisfied, while others imply
the continuity of the percolation probability. The first exponent is related to
one of a more conventional nature, that of correlation size.
  In this paper, the central aspects of the approach are described, and the
proofs of the main results are presented. The report located at math.PR/0402026
gives complete proofs of all of the assertions.
