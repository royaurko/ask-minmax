Short lived $^{212,213,214}$Ra isotopes have been produced at the TRI$\mu$P
facility in inverse kinematics via the fusion-evaporation reaction
$^{206}$Pb+$^{12}$C at 8 MeV/u. Isotopes are separated from other reaction
products online using the TRI$\mu$P magnetic separator. The energetic radium
(Ra) isotopes at the exit of the separator were converted into low energy ions
with a thermal ionizer. Ra isotopes have been identified by observing their
$\alpha$ decay and life times.
