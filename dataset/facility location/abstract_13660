Representation of dielectric properties by impedance spectroscopy (IS) is
analyzed carefully in this paper. It is found that IS is not a good tool to
describe a uniform system because a pseudo relaxation peaks exists at low
frequency limit corresponding to direct current (DC) conductivity and two
relaxation peaks appears simultaneously corresponding to one relaxation process
for a high loss system with tand>1. However it is very convenient to describe a
multiple phase system with IS. When dielectric properties are shown by
Cole-Cole equation, only one Cole-Cole arc appears for one phase in IS,
therefore it is very easy to distinguish different phases from each other.
Especially, since pseudo relaxation exists at low frequency limit for each
phase, the location of a certain relaxation process can be deduced by IS
without any uncertainty. Furthermore, when dielectric properties are shown with
specific impedance spectroscopy (ISI), the information of microstructure can be
obtained conveniently. Based on the theoretical results above, dielectric
properties of CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) ceramics with giant dielectric constant (GDC)
are investigated. Microstructure of CCTO is obtained by dielectric spectrometer
and the origin of GDC is found to come from pseudo relaxation of grain.
