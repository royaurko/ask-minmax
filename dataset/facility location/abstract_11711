The random lasing (RL) emission of dyed vesicular polymeric films in
diffusive regime of light propagation was investigated under helium
temperature. It represents itself the coupling effect of stimulated emission
and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS). Due to the effect a set of Raman lines
reveal in RL spectrum. Distinguishing feature of the effect is the stimulated
emission promotes the Raman lines revealing. Intensity of Raman lines have
quadratic trend on pump intensity. Furthermore SRS in this condition has the
more structured spectrum than spontaneous Raman one. It makes enable detection
even the weak and close located spectral lines.
