We investigate how the dynamic polarization of the carbon atoms valence
electrons affects the spatial distributions of protons channeled in the (11, 9)
single-wall carbon nanotubes placed in vacuum and embedded in various
dielectric media. The initial proton speed is varied between 3 and 8 a.u.,
corresponding to the energies between 0.223 and 1.59 MeV, respectively, while
the nanotube length is varied between 0.1 and 0.8 $\mu$m. The spatial
distributions of channeled protons are generated using a computer simulation
method, which includes the numerical solving of the proton equations of motion
in the transverse plane. We show that the dynamic polarization effect can
strongly affect the rainbow maxima in the spatial distributions, so as to
increase the proton flux at the distances from the nanotube wall of the order
of a few tenths of a nanometer at the expense of the flux at the nanotube
center. While our findings are connected to the possible applications of
nanosized ion beams created with the nanotubes embedded in various dielectric
media for biomedical research and in materials modification, they also open the
prospects of applying ion channeling for detecting and locating the atoms and
molecules intercalated inside the nanotubes.
