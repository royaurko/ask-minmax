In this letter, we discuss the effect of slow real modes in
reaction-diffusion systems close to a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. The
spatio-temporal effects of the slow mode cannot be captured by traditional
descriptions in terms of a single complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE). We
show that the slow mode coupling to the CGLE, introduces a novel set of
finite-wavelength instabilities not present in the CGLE. For spiral waves,
these instabilities highly effect the location of regions for convective and
absolute instability. These new instability boundaries are consistent with
transitions to spatio-temporal chaos found by simulation of the corresponding
coupled amplitude equations.
