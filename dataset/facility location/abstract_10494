Detecting the antineutrinos emitted by the decay of radioactive elements in
the mantle and crust could provide a direct measurement of the total abundance
of uranium and thorium in the Earth. In calculating the antineutrino flux at
specific sites, the local geology of the crust and the background from the
world's nuclear power reactors are important considerations. Employing a global
crustal map, with type and thickness data, and using recent estimates of the
uranium and thorium distribution in the Earth, we calculate the antineutrino
event rate for two new neutrino detectors. We show that spectral features allow
terrestrial antineutrino events to be identified above reactor antineutrino
backgrounds and that the uranium and thorium contributions can be separately
determined.
