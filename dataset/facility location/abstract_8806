The results of observational studies on the vertical HI density distribution
and kinematics of the disks of spiral galaxies are reported and discussed.
Attention is drawn to the presence of HI emission, unknown before and here
referred to as the `beard', which has anomalous structure and kinematics,
different from the known cold HI disk. This component is extended and probably
located in the halo region, it is rotating more slowly than the disk and shows
radial inward motion. Its nature and origin -galactic fountain or infall of
primordial gas?- are still a puzzle.
