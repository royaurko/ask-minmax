Many modern production and measurement facilities incorporate multiphase
systems at low pressures. In this region of flows at small, non-zero Knudsen-
and low Mach numbers the classical mesoscopic Monte Carlo methods become
increasingly numerically costly. To increase the numerical efficiency of
simulations hybrid models are promising. In this contribution, we propose a
novel efficient simulation approach for the simulation of two phase flows with
a large concentration imbalance in a low pressure environment in the low
intermediate Knudsen regime. Our hybrid model comprises a lattice-Boltzmann
method corrected for the lower intermediate Kn regime proposed by Zhang et al.
for the simulation of an ambient flow field. A coupled event-driven
Monte-Carlo-style Boltzmann solver is employed to describe particles of a
second species of low concentration. In order to evaluate the model, standard
diffusivity and diffusion advection systems are considered.
