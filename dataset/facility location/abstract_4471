We investigated the electrostatic charging behavior of submillimeter-sized
dust particles located in Saturn's magnetosphere. The charging effects we
considered included electron/ion capture from the magnetospheric plasma,
electron/ion capture from the solar-wind plasma, the photoelectric effect from
solar radiation, and secondary electron emission from energetic electrons. In
our results, we show charging times and equilibrium potentials for particles
located in different regions of Saturn's magnetosphere. We find that charging
in Saturn's magnetosphere is not particularly sensitive to the dust particle's
material properties. The equipotential ranges from $\sim$-2 V at 3.5 R$_S$,
decreasing to $\sim$-5 V at 6 R$_S$, and then increasing to $\sim$-1.5 V at 10
R$_S$. The charging time for micron-sized particles is a few minutes, and for
0.01 micron-sized particles the charging time is 6 hours (or more). The latter
is a significant fraction of Saturn's rotation period.
