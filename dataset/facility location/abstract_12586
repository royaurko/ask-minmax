An integrated GPS-GSM system is proposed to track vehicles using Google Earth
application. The remote module has a GPS mounted on the moving vehicle to
identify its current position, and to be transferred by GSM with other
parameters acquired by the automobile's data port as an SMS to a recipient
station. The received GPS coordinates are filtered using a Kalman filter to
enhance the accuracy of measured position. After data processing, Google Earth
application is used to view the current location and status of each vehicle.
This goal of this system is to manage fleet, police automobiles distribution
and car theft cautions.
