In this paper, we propose a new scalar and shift transform invariant test
statistic for the high-dimensional two-sample location test. The expectation of
our test is exactly zero under the null hypothesis. And we allow the dimension
could be arbitrary large. Theoretical results and simulation comparison show
the good performance of our test.
