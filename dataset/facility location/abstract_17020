Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) involves the use of wireless technology to
replace copper to connect subscribers to the telephone network. It is a variant
of wireless broadband which provides an alternative in the so-called 'last
mile' connectivity between the subscriber and the fixed telecommunications
network. FWA could either be narrowband or broadband and it is predominantly
deployed using the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology. In
assessing the extent of development and deployment of FWA, the perspective of
the operators and users was elicited primarily through the use of
questionnaires. Issues like setup cost, tax, Government incentive, availability
of infrastructure and manpower applied to the operators while on the users'
part factors like quality of service, signal strength as well as call rate were
considered. The South western zone of Nigeria is regarded as one of the most
urbanized regions in the south of Sahara, this is not out of place considering
the fact that Lagos which is the nation's commercial nerve centre and a
mega-city is located within this region. The scope of this research covered
this very lively part of the country. The relationship between the parameters
or variables considered was established using an appropriate statistical
method: The Regression analysis. In terms of users' preference, Global System
of Mobile communication (GSM) was compared with FWA. Results were interpreted
and suitable conclusions were drawn to wrap up a quite revealing work.
