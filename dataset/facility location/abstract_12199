We locate a supersymmetry breaking hidden sector and supersymmetric standard
model on different lattice points of an orbifold moose. The hidden sector is
encoded in a set of current correlators and the effects of the current
correlators are mediated by the lattice site gauge groups with "lattice
hopping" functions and through the bifundamental matter that links the lattice
sites together. We show how the gaugino mass, scalar mass and Casimir energy of
the lattice can be computed for a general set of current correlators and then
give specific formulas when the hidden sector is specified to be a generalised
messenger sector coupled to a supersymmetry breaking spurion. The results
reproduce the effect of five dimensional gauge mediation from a purely four
dimensional construction.
