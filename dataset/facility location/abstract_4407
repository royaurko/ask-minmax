We have made angular broadening measurements in the satellite line of the OH
molecule at 1612 MHz of 8 OH/IR stars located near the Galactic Center with the
Very Large Array. Early observations with the Very Long Baseline Array had
revealed a region of pronounced scattering approximately centered on SgrA*.
These new observations show that the compact line emission from these stars is
scattered by an amount that is two to three times larger than had been
previously seen. Additionally, we measure non-circular scattering disks for
these objects, evidence that the electron density variations are distributed
anisotropically. The present data suggest that the enhanced turbulence is
located near the Galactic Center. However, we cannot completely rule out that
the scattering is caused by an unrelated region along the line of sight.
