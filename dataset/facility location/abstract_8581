We present evidence for a new morphologically defined form of small-scale
substructure in the Coma Cluster, which we call galaxy aggregates. These
aggregates are dominated by a central galaxy, which is on average three
magnitudes brighter than the smaller aggregate members nearly all of which lie
to one side of the central galaxy. We have found three such galaxy aggregates
dominated by the S0 galaxies RB 55, RB 60, and the star-bursting SBb, NGC 4858.
  RB 55 and RB 60 are both equi-distant between the two dominate D galaxies NGC
4874 and NGC 4889, while NGC 4858 is located next to the larger E0 galaxy NGC
4860. All three central galaxies have redshifts consistant with Coma Cluster
membership. We describe the spatial structures of these unique objects and
suggest several possible mechanisms to explain their origin. These include:
chance superpositions from background galaxies, interactions between other
galaxies and with the cluster gravitational potential, and ram pressure. We
conclude that the most probable scenario of creation is an interaction with the
cluster through its potential.
