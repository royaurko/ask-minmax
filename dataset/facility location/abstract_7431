The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), located in the Khomas
Highlands of Namibia, is an array of four imaging atmospheric-Cherenkov
telescopes designed to detect gamma-rays in the very-high-energy (VHE; E > 100
GeV) domain. It is an ideal instrument for surveying the Galactic plane in
search of new sources of VHE gamma-rays, due to its location in the Southern
Hemisphere, its excellent sensitivity, and its large field-of-view. The
H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey (GPS) began in 2004 and initial observations of
the Galactic plane resulted in the discovery of numerous VHE gamma-ray
emitters. This original H.E.S.S. GPS covered the inner Galaxy within +/- 30 deg
in longitude and +/- 3 deg in latitude. In the last four years, the
longitudinal extent of the survey has more than doubled, now including the
region l = 275 deg - 60 deg, and the exposure in the inner Galaxy has also been
significantly increased. These efforts have consequently led to the discovery
of many previously-unknown VHE gamma-ray sources with high statistical
significance. We report on the current status of this ongoing, extended
H.E.S.S. GPS, present the latest images of the survey region, and highlight the
most recent discoveries.
