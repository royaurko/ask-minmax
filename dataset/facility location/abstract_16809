Using the ACS on HST, we have surveyed the FUV and NUV populations in the
core region of M80. The CMD reveals large numbers of blue and extreme
horizontal branch stars and blue stragglers, as well as approx. 60 objects
lying in the region of the CMD where accreting and detached white dwarf
binaries are expected. Overall, the blue straggler stars are the most centrally
concentrated population, with their radial distribution suggesting a typical
blue straggler mass of about 1.2 Msun. However, counterintuitively, the faint
blue stragglers are significantly more centrally concentrated than the bright
ones and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test suggest only a 3.5% probability that both
faint and bright blue stragglers are drawn from the same distribution. This may
suggest that (some) blue stragglers get a kick during their formation. We have
also been able to identify the majority of the known X-ray sources in the core
with FUV bright stars. One of these FUV sources is a likely dwarf nova that was
in eruption at the time of the FUV observations. This object is located at a
position consistent with Nova 1860 AD, or T Scorpii. Based on its position,
X-ray and UV characteristics, this system is almost certainly the source of the
nova explosion. The radial distribution of the X-ray sources and of the
cataclysmic variable candidates in our sample suggest masses > 1 Msun.
