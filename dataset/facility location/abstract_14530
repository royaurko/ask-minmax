We present a new investigation of the Cloverleaf (z=2.558) based on the
combination of archival HST/WFPC2 data, recent IRAM CO(7-6) maps and wide field
CFHT/FOCAM images. The deepest WFPC2 observation shows a significant
overdensity of I ~ 23--25 galaxies around the Cloverleaf that we interpret as
the presence of a cluster of galaxies along the line of sight. The typical
magnitude, red color (R-I ~ 0.9) and small angular size of these galaxies
suggest that the cluster is very distant and could be associated with the
absorption systems observed in the spectra of the quasar spots. The Cloverleaf
is probably the result of the lensing effects of a system which includes a
single-galaxy and one of the most distant cluster of galaxies. We have modelled
the lens using altogether the WFPC2 data and the IRAM/CO(7-6) map, considereing
two cases: one in which the mass model is a galaxy and a dark halo at z=1.7,
and a second one in which the mass model is the combination of a cluster and an
individual galaxy located amid the Cloverleaf, both at z=1.7. The CO source is
found to form a ring-like structure orbiting the central engine at ~ 100km/s at
a radial distance of ~ 100pc, leading to a black-hole mass of ~ 10^9 M_solar.
The cluster component increases significantly the convergence of the lens and
this pulls down the requirement on the mass of the lensing galaxy by a factor
2. This may explain the mystery of the lensing galaxy not detected yet.
