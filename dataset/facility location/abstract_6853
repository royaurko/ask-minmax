A second order classical perturbation theory is developed and applied to
elastic atom corrugated surface scattering. The resulting theory accounts for
experimentally observed asymmetry in the final angular distributions. These
include qualitative features, such as reduction of the asymmetry with increased
incidence energy as well as asymmetry in the location of the rainbow peaks with
respect to the specular scattering angle. The theory is especially applicable
to "soft" corrugated potentials. Analytic expressions for the angular
distribution are derived for the exponential repulsive and Morse potential
models. The theory is implemented numerically to a simplified model of the
scattering of an Ar atom from a LiF(100) surface.
