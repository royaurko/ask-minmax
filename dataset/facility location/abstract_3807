This paper reports on the hyperfine-structure and radioactive-decay studies
of the neutron-deficient francium isotopes $^{202-206}$Fr performed with the
Collinear Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy (CRIS) experiment at the ISOLDE
facility, CERN. The high resolution innate to collinear laser spectroscopy is
combined with the high efficiency of ion detection to provide a
highly-sensitive technique to probe the hyperfine structure of exotic isotopes.
The technique of decay-assisted laser spectroscopy is presented, whereby the
isomeric ion beam is deflected to a decay spectroscopy station for alpha-decay
tagging of the hyperfine components. Here, we present the first
hyperfine-structure measurements of the neutron-deficient francium isotopes
$^{202-206}$Fr, in addition to the identification of the low-lying states of
$^{202,204}$Fr performed at the CRIS experiment.
