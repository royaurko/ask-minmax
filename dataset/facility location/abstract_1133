Within 5-10 years, submillimeter VLBI facilities will be hopefully able to
image the "shadow" of SgrA$^*$. When a black hole is surrounded by an optically
thin emitting medium, the boundary of the shadow corresponds to the apparent
photon capture sphere and only depends on the background metric. An accurate
determination of the shape of the shadow of SgrA$^*$ could constrain possible
deviations from the Kerr solution. In combination with other measurements,
these observations could test the Kerr black hole paradigm.
