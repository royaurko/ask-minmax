The list of 127 eclipsing stars in optical coincidence with star clusters
from the SMC is presented. It was prepared using the catalogs of eclipsing
systems and star clusters from the SMC based on observations collected during
the OGLE-II microlensing project.
  Location of 12 eclipsing stars in the color-magnitude diagram of clusters
allows to exclude their membership. Photometric data of 73 systems support
their membership. The remaining 42 objects were found in loose, faint clusters
and therefore no conclusive statement about their membership can be made. All
presented data are available from the OGLE archive.
