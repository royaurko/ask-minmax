Inclusive electron scattering off the deuteron has been measured to extract
the deuteron structure function F2 with the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer
(CLAS) at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The measurement
covers the entire resonance region from the quasi-elastic peak up to the
invariant mass of the final-state hadronic system W~2.7 GeV with four-momentum
transfers Q2 from 0.4 to 6 (GeV/c)^2. These data are complementary to previous
measurements of the proton structure function F2 and cover a similar
two-dimensional region of Q2 and Bjorken variable x. Determination of the
deuteron F2 over a large x interval including the quasi-elastic peak as a
function of Q2, together with the other world data, permit a direct evaluation
of the structure function moments for the first time. By fitting the Q2
evolution of these moments with an OPE-based twist expansion we have obtained a
separation of the leading twist and higher twist terms. The observed Q2
behaviour of the higher twist contribution suggests a partial cancellation of
different higher twists entering into the expansion with opposite signs. This
cancellation, found also in the proton moments, is a manifestation of the
"duality" phenomenon in the F2 structure function.
