The universal field equations introduced by the contributor and his collaborators,
which admit infinitely many inequivalent Lagrangian formulations are shown to
arise as consistency conditions for the existence of non-trivial solutions to
the quasi-linear equations, called equations of hydrodynamic type by Novikov ,
Dubrovin and others. The solutions in closed form are only implicit. A method
due to Stokes, which is in essence just Fourier Analysis is resurrected for
application to those equations. With the benefit of algebraic computation
facilities, this method, allows the general structure of power series solutions
to be conjectured.
