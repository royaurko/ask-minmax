We observed mid-infrared (7.5-22 mum) spectra of AGB stars in the globular
cluster 47 Tuc with the Spitzer telescope and find significant dust features of
various types. Comparison of the characteristics of the dust spectra with the
location of the stars in a logP-K-diagram shows that dust mineralogy and
position on the AGB are related. A 13 mum feature is seen in spectra of low
luminosity AGB stars. More luminous AGB stars show a broad feature at 11.5 mum.
The spectra of the most luminous stars are dominated by the amorphous silicate
bending vibration centered at 9.7 mum. For 47 Tuc AGB stars, we conclude that
early on the AGB dust consisting primarily of Mg-, Al- and Fe oxides is formed.
With further AGB evolution amorphous silicates become the dominant species.
