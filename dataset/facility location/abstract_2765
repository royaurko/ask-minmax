We provide a theoretical estimate of the thermoelectric current and voltage
over a Phenyldithiol molecule. We also show that the thermoelectric voltage is
(1) easy to analyze, (2) insensitive to the detailed coupling to the contacts,
(3) large enough to be measured and (4) give valuable information, which is not
readily accessible through other experiments, on the location of the Fermi
energy relative to the molecular levels. The location of the Fermi-energy is
poorly understood and controversial even though it is a central factor in
determining the nature of conduction (n- or p-type). We also note that the
thermoelectric voltage measured over Guanine molecules with an STM by Poler et
al., indicate conduction through the HOMO level, i.e., p-type conduction.
