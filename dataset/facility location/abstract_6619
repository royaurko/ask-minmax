The ATLAS detector is one of the two multi-purpose experiments located at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN and is expected to collect first collision
data in summer 2009. Due to the large top-quark production cross-section the
LHC will function as a top-quark factory allowing to measure top-quark
properties even at initial luminosities. We present some recently-performed
studies, focussing on measurements of the top pair and single top production
cross-sections with the first fb-1 of data. The potential for the measurement
of other top-quark properties like the mass will be also briefly discussed.
