A comparative study of amplitude zeros in $W\gamma$ and $WZ$ production in
hadronic collisions is presented. The Standard Model amplitude for $q_1 \bar
q_2 \rightarrow W^\pm Z $ at the Born-level is shown to exhibit an approximate
zero located at $\cos\theta = (g^{q_1}_{-} + g^{q_2}_{-}) / (g^{q_1}_{-} -
g^{q_2}_{-})$ at high energies, where the $g^{q_i}_{-}$ ($i=1,2$) are the
left-handed couplings of the $Z$-boson to quarks and $\theta$ is the center of
mass scattering angle of the $W$-boson. This approximate zero is similar to the
well-known radiation zero in $W\gamma$ production. Prospects to observe the
amplitude zeros using rapidity correlations between the final state particles
are explored.
