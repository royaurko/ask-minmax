The evolution of the particle background at an altitude of ~540 km during the
time interval between 1996 and 2007 is studied using the particle monitor of
the High Energy X-ray Timing Experiment on board NASA's Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer. A special emphasis of this study is the location and strength of the
South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). The size and strength of the SAA are
anti-correlated with the the 10.7 cm radio flux of the Sun, which leads the SAA
strength by ~1 year reflecting variations in solar heating of the upper
atmosphere. The location of the SAA is also found to drift westwards with an
average drift rate of about 0.3 deg/yr following the drift of the geomagnetic
field configuration. Superimposed to this drift rate are irregularities, where
the SAA suddenly moves eastwards and where furthermore the speed of the drift
changes. The most prominent of these irregularities is found in the second
quarter of 2003 and another event took place in 1999. We suggest that these
events are previously unrecognized manifestations of the geomagnetic jerks of
the Earth's magnetic field.
