A set of Maplev R.3 software routines, for plotting 2D/3D projections of
Poincar\'e surfaces-of-section of Hamiltonian dynamical systems, is presented.
The package consists of a plotting-command plus a set of facility-commands for
a quick setup of the Hamilton equations of motion, initial conditions for
numerical experiments, and for the zooming of plots.
