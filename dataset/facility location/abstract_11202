This work deals with the numerical solution of the Vlasov equation. This
equation gives a kinetic description of the evolution of a plasma, and is
coupled with Poisson's equation for the computation of the self-consistent
electric field. The coupled model is non linear. A new semi-Lagrangian method,
based on forward integration of the characteristics, is developed. The
distribution function is updated on an eulerian grid, and the pseudo-particles
located on the mesh's nodes follow the characteristics of the equation forward
for one time step, and are deposited on the 16 nearest nodes. This is an
explicit way of solving the Vlasov equation on a grid of the phase space, which
makes it easier to develop high order time schemes than the backward method.
