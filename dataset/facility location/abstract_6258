A monochromatic linear source of light is rotated with certain angular
frequency and when such light is analysed after reflection then a change of
frequency or wavelength may be observed depending on the location of the
observer. This change of frequency or wavelength is different from the
classical Doppler effect [1] or relativistic Doppler effect [2]. The reason
behind this shift in wavelength is that a certain time interval observed by an
observer in the rotating frame is different from that of a stationary observer.
