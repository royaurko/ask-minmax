We study multidimensional continuous opinion dynamics, where opinions are
nonnegative vectors which components sum up to one. Examples of such opinions
are budgets or other allocation vectors which display a distribution of a fixed
amount of ressource to n projects.
  We use the opinion dynamics models of Deffuant-Weisbuch and
Hegselmann-Krause, which both extend naturally to more dimensional opinions.
They both rely on bounded confidence of the agents and differ in their
communication regime. We show detailed simulation results regarding $n=2,...,8$
and the bound of confidence $\eps$. Number, location and size of opinion
clusters in the stabilized opinion profiles are of interest.
  Known differences of both models repeat under higher opinion dimensions:
Higher number of clusters and more minor clusters in the Deffuant-Weisbuch
model, meta-stable states in the Hegselmann-Krause model. But surprisingly,
higher dimensions lead to better chances for a vast majority consensus even for
lower bounds of confidence. On the other hand, the number of minority clusters
rises with n, too.
