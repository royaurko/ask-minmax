In a previous publication we have shown that the gauge theory of relativistic
3-Branes can be formulated in a conformally invariant way if the embedding
space is six-dimensional. The implementation of conformal invariance requires
the use of a modified measure, independent of the metric in the action. We here
generalize the theory to include conformal invariance breaking and a dynamical
scalar field with a non-trivial potential. The non conformal invariance
contribution can be interpreted as originating from a continious "non ideal
brane fluid" that exists between two singular branes. The scalar field
potential also breaks the conformal invariance. At singular brane locations,
conformal invariance is restored and the dynamics of the scalar field is frozen
at a certain fixed value of the scalar field which depends on an arbitrary
integration constant. Spontaneous Symmetry breaking can take place due to such
boundary condition without the need of invoking tachyonic mass terms for the
scalar field. In these Brane-world scenarios, zero 4-D cosmological constant is
achieved without the need of invoking a fine tuned cosmological constant in 6D.
Thus, no ``old'' cosmological constant problem appears. The use of a measure
independent of the metric is crucial for obtaining all of the above results.
