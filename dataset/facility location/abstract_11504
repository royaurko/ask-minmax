The nine millisecond pulsars (MSPs) that have now been detected by Fermi-LAT
are providing an excellent opportunity to probe the emission geometry of these
ancient compact objects. As they are radio-loud, one may use the relative phase
lags across wavebands to obtain constraints on the orientation, size, and
location of their radio and gamma-ray beams. We model the gamma-ray light
curves using geometric outer gap (OG) and two-pole caustic (TPC) models, in
addition to a pair-starved polar cap (PSPC) model which incorporates the full
General Relativistic E-field. We find that most MSP light curves are fit by OG
and TPC models, while PSPC is more appropriate for two others. The light curves
of the newest discovery, PSR J0034-0534, are best modeled using outer
magnetosphere OG / TPC models of limited extension for both radio and gamma-ray
beams. We model the radio emission of the other eight MSPs using a
fixed-altitude conal model at lower altitude. We lastly deduce values for
inclination and observer angles (alpha and zeta), as well as the flux
correction factor, in each case.
