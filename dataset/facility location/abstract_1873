The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) vacuum instrumentation and control
systems are being designed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL),
Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator
facility (TJNAF) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Each participating
lab is responsible for a different section of the machine: LBNL for the
Front-End section, LANL for the warm LINAC section, TJNAF for the cold LINAC
section and BNL for the Ring and transfer line sections. The vacuum
instrumentation and control systems are scheduled to be installed and be in
operation at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2004 or 2005. Although the
requirements vary for different sections of the machine, a collaborative effort
has been made to standardize vacuum instrumentation components and the global
control system interfaces. This paper summarizes the design of each sub-section
of vacuum instrumentation and control system and discusses SNS standards for
Ion Pump and Gauge controllers, Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) interfaces,
Ladder Logic programming and the SNS global control system interfaces.
