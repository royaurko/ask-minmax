We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3)
observations of the source and lens stars for planetary microlensing event
OGLE-2005-BLG-169, which confirm the relative proper motion prediction due to
the planetary light curve signal observed for this event. This (and the
companion Keck result) provide the first confirmation of a planetary
microlensing signal, for which the deviation was only 2%. The follow-up
observations determine the flux of the planetary host star in multiple
passbands and remove light curve model ambiguity caused by sparse sampling of
part of the light curve. This leads to a precise determination of the
properties of the OGLE-2005-BLG-169Lb planetary system. Combining the
constraints from the microlensing light curve with the photometry and
astrometry of the HST/WFC3 data, we find star and planet masses of M_* = 0.69+-
0.02 M_solar and m_p = 14.1 +- 0.9 M_earth. The planetary microlens system is
located toward the Galactic bulge at a distance of D_L = 4.1 +- 0.4 kpc, and
the projected star-planet separation is a_perp = 3.5 +- 0.3 AU, corresponding
to a semi-major axis of a = 4.0 (+2.2 -0.6) AU.
