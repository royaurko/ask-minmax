The pp -> pp gamma reaction has been measured at a beam energy of 310 MeV by
detecting both final protons in the PROMICE-WASA facility and identifying a
missing-mass peak. For those events where the pp excitation is less than 3 MeV,
the final diproton is almost purely in the 1S0 state and, under these
conditions, there is complete coverage in the photon c.m. angle theta_gamma.
The linear behaviour observed in cos^2(theta_gamma) shows that there is almost
no influence of an E2 multipole at this energy, though the E1 and M2 must be
rather similar in size.
