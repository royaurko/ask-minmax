We discuss the magnetic moments of the recently discovered exotic baryons
Theta(+) and Xi(--) and their multiplet partners in the framework of a naive
additive quark model. These baryons are set up as pentaquark states where four
quarks and a single antiquark are located in their ground state orbit. The
pentaquark states are classified as members of the flavor SU(3) octet and
antidecuplet with spin-parity J^P = (1/2)^- and (3/2)^-, where we determine the
magnetic moments of these pentaquark states.
