Beam-beam interactions and space-charge effects belong to the category of the
most long-standing issues in beam physics, and even today, after several
decades of very active exploration and development of counter-measures, they
still pose the most profound limitations on performance of accelerator
facilities. In this brief review we consider past experience in active
compensation of these effects and possible new schemes for further exploration
in near-future, in particular, within the framework of the electron-ion
collider R&D.
