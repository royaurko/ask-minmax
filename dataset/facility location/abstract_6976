Let $P_1,P_2,P_3$ be three given points in $\mathbf{R}^2$, and $P$ be an
arbitrary point in $\mathbf{R}^2$. The classical Fermat's problem to Torricelli
asks for the location of the point $P$ such that $|PP_1|+|PP_2|+|PP_3|$ is a
minimum. There exist several elegant geometrical solutions in the literature.In
this note, we consider finding the Fermat point by using methods in advanced
calculus. The main tools we use are the extreme value theorem,Fermat's theorem,
and the intermediate value theorem.
