The High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) Spectrometer on the Advanced
X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF) (scheduled for launch in August, 1998) will
provide a new tool for the study of absorption in the X-ray spectra of high
redshift quasars due to the material along the line of sight. In this paper we
try to explore the possibility of using AXAF HETG to detect resonance
absorption lines from the Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) clouds.
