An intelligent multisensor front end based on the ARM Cortex M3. It deduces a
driver's configuration, ascertains his ability to drive safely and contacts
near ones with location data for urgent disaster mitigation. Prevention
measures are undertaken through external display modules and provision for
being vehicle-powered through external voltage regulated supplies. The proof of
concept for this paper is an ALL INDIA THIRD PRIZE WINNER at the Texas
Instruments Analog Design Contest 2012-13 National Finals and this paper is due
for digital publication in IEEE Xplore. All documentation is property of Texas
