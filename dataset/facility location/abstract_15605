We present experimental data and their theoretical interpretation for the
decay rates of temperature fluctuations in a thin layer of a fluid heated from
below and confined between parallel horizontal plates. The measurements were
made with the mean temperature of the layer corresponding to the critical
isochore of sulfur hexafluoride above but near the critical point where
fluctuations are exceptionally strong. They cover a wide range of temperature
gradients below the onset of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, and span wave
numbers on both sides of the critical value for this onset. The decay rates
were determined from experimental shadowgraph images of the fluctuations at
several camera exposure times. We present a theoretical expression for an
exposure-time-dependent structure factor which is needed for the data analysis.
As the onset of convection is approached, the data reveal the critical
slowing-down associated with the bifurcation. Theoretical predictions for the
decay rates as a function of the wave number and temperature gradient are
presented and compared with the experimental data. Quantitative agreement is
obtained if allowance is made for some uncertainty in the small spacing between
the plates, and when an empirical estimate is employed for the influence of
symmetric deviations from the Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation which are to be
expected in a fluid with its density at the mean temperature located on the
critical isochore.
