We discuss the use of self-seeding schemes with wake monochromators to
produce TW power, fully coherent pulses for applications at the dedicated
bio-imaging bealine at the European X-ray FEL, a concept for an upgrade of the
facility beyond the baseline previously proposed by the contributors. We exploit the
asymmetric and symmetric Bragg and Laue reflections (sigma polarization) in
diamond crystal. Optimization of the bio-imaging beamline is performed with
extensive start-to-end simulations, which also take into account effects such
as the spatio-temporal coupling caused by the wake monochromator. The spatial
shift is maximal in the range for small Bragg angles. A geometry with Bragg
angles close to pi/2 would be a more advantageous option from this viewpoint,
albeit with decrease of the spectral tunability. We show that it will be
possible to cover the photon energy range from 3 keV to 13 keV by using four
different planes of the same crystal with one rotational degree of freedom.
