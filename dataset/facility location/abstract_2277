Neutrino Factory is a facility for future precision studies of neutrino
oscillations. A so called near detector is essential for reaching the aimed
precision of neutrino oscillation analysis. Main task of a near detector is to
measure the flux of the neutrino beam. The brilliant neutrino source provides
opportunity for precision studies of various neutrino interaction processes in
a near detector. We present design concept of a scintillating fiber tracker
capable of measuring the neutrino flux. The basic idea is to separate pure
leptonic neutrino-electron scattering from the overwhelming background of
neutrino-nucleon interactions. Monte Carlo simulation of the detector and
simple event reconstruction algorithms are presented. It is shown that proper
selection cuts increase signal to background ratio from ~ 10^{-4} to 30-50 %.
Two methods for extraction of signal events are developed.
