A low-power prototype of neutron amplifier, based on a 70 MeV, high current
proton cyclotron being installed at LNL for the SPES RIB facility, was recently
proposed within INFN-E project. This prototype uses a thick Beryllium converter
to produce a fast neutron spectrum feeding a sub-critical reactor core. To
complete the design of such facility the new measurement of neutron yield from
a thick Beryllium target was performed at LNS. This measurement used liquid
scintillator detectors to identify produced neutrons by Pulse Shape
Discrimination and Time of Flight technique to measure neutron energy in the
range 0.5-62 MeV. To extend the covered neutron energy range He3 detector was
used to measure neutrons below 0.5 MeV. The obtained yields were normalized to
the charge deposited by the proton beam on the metallic Beryllium target. These
techniques allowed to achieve a wide angular coverage from 0 to 150 degrees and
to explore almost complete neutron energy interval.
