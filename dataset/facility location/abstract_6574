In this letter, we reported the results of NMR study on LiFeAs single
crystals. We find a strong evidence of the low temperature spin fluctuations;
by changing sample preparation conditions, the system can be tuned toward an
spin-density-wave (SDW) quantum-critical point. The detection of an
interstitial Li(2) ion, possibly locating in the tetrahedral hole, suggests
that the off-stoichiometry and/or lattice defect can probably account for the
absence of the SDW ordering in LiFeAs. These facts show that LiFeAs is a
strongly correlated system and the superconductivity is likely originated from
the SDW fluctuations.
