This paper addresses the problem of estimating sparse channels in massive
MIMO-OFDM systems. Most wireless channels are sparse in nature with large delay
spread. In addition, these channels as observed by multiple antennas in a
neighborhood have approximately common support. The sparsity and common support
properties are attractive when it comes to the efficient estimation of large
number of channels in massive MIMO systems. Moreover, to avoid pilot
contamination and to achieve better spectral efficiency, it is important to use
a small number of pilots. We present a novel channel estimation approach which
utilizes the sparsity and common support properties to estimate sparse channels
and require a small number of pilots. Two algorithms based on this approach
have been developed which perform Bayesian estimates of sparse channels even
when the prior is non-Gaussian or unknown. Neighboring antennas share among
each other their beliefs about the locations of active channel taps to perform
estimation. The coordinated approach improves channel estimates and also
reduces the required number of pilots. Further improvement is achieved by the
data-aided version of the algorithm. Extensive simulation results are provided
to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.
