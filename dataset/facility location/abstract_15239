This paper presents L-band ISAAC and NAOS/CONICA (VLT) spectroscopic
observations of the IRS~3-IRS~13 Galactic Center region. The ISAAC data allowed
us to build the first spectroscopic data cube of the region in the L-band
domain corrected for the foreground extinction. Maps of the water ice and
hydrocarbon absorption line strength were then derived. These maps are
important diagnostics of the interstellar and circumstellar medium (resp. ISM
and CSM). They support our previous results that the absorption features are
most probably occuring in the local Galactic center medium and can be
associated with the individual sources. Moreover, turbulence seems to affect
the studied region of the minispiral which appears like a mixture of a dense
and diffuse medium. The Br alpha and Pf gamma emission line maps allowed us to
find three sources with broad lines corresponding to a FWHM deconvolved line
width of about 1100 km/s and moving towards us with a radial velocity of about
-300km/s. These sources are most probably new Wolf-Rayet type stars located in
projection to the north and west of IRS 3. Their derived radial velocities and
proper motions show that only two of them might belong to the two rotating
disks of young stars reported by Genzel et al. (2003) and Levin & Beloborodov
(2003)...
