X-ray evidence for ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) has been recently reported in a
number of local AGNs through the detection of blue-shifted Fe XXV/XXVI
absorption lines. We present the results of a comprehensive spectral analysis
of a large sample of 42 local Seyferts and 5 Broad-Line Radio Galaxies (BLRGs)
observed with XMM-Newton and Suzaku. We detect UFOs in >40% of the sources.
Their outflow velocities are in the range 0.03-0.3c, with a mean value of
~0.14c. The ionization is high, in the range logxi~3-6 erg s^{-1} cm, and also
the associated column densities are large, in the interval ~10^{22}-10^{24}
cm^{-2}. Overall, these results point to the presence of highly ionized and
massive outflowing material in the innermost regions of AGNs. Their variability
and location on sub-pc scales favor a direct association with accretion disk
winds/outflows. This also suggests that UFOs may potentially play a significant
role in the AGN cosmological feedback besides jets and their study can provide
important clues on the connection between accretion disks, winds and jets.
