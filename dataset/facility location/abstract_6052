We present a method for locating center vortices (``fluxons'') in thermalized
lattice gauge field configurations. We find evidence, in lattice Monte Carlo
simulations, that the asymptotic string tension of fundamental-representation
Wilson loops is due to fluctuations in the number of center vortices linking
those loops.
