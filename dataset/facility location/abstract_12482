We analyze general convergence properties of the Taylor expansion of
observables to finite chemical potential in the framework of an effective 2+1
flavor Polyakov-quark-meson model. To compute the required higher order
coefficients a novel technique based on algorithmic differentiation has been
developed. Results for thermodynamic observables as well as the phase structure
obtained through the series expansion up to 24th order are compared to the full
model solution at finite chemical potential. The available higher order
coefficients also allow for resummations, e.g. Pade series, which improve the
convergence behavior. In view of our results we discuss the prospects for
locating the QCD phase boundary and a possible critical endpoint with the
Taylor expansion method.
