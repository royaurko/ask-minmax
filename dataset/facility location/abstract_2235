The Galactic calibration of the period-luminosity (PL) relation for classical
Cepheids is examined using trigonometric, open cluster, and pulsation
parallaxes, which help establish independent versions of the relationship. The
calibration is important for the continued use of classical Cepheids in
constraining cosmological models (by refining estimates for H_0), for defining
zero-points for the SNe Ia and population II (Type II Cepheids/RR Lyrae
variables) distance scales, for clarifying properties of the Milky Way's spiral
structure, and for characterizing dust extinction affecting Cepheids in the
Milky Way and other galaxies. Described is a program to extend and refine the
Galactic Cepheid PL relation by obtaining UBVRIJHKs photometry and spectra for
stars in open clusters suspected of hosting classical Cepheids, using the the
facilities of the OAMM, DAO, AAVSO, and ARO.
