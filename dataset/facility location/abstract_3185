We have observed a stellar occultation of GSC5249-01240 by Saturn's north
polar region on November 20, 1995 from NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility
(IRTF). This is the first recorded occultation by the polar region of a giant
planet. The occulted region extends 88 km in vertical height and 660 km in
horizontal length, over a region from 82.5 to 85 degrees in planetocentric
latitude and from 20 to 30 degrees in planetocentric longitude. Based on
isothermal model fits to the light curve, we find an equivalent temperature of
130 \pm 10 K at a pressure level of 1.6 \pm 0.1 \mubar, which corresponds to a
half-light latitude of 83.2 \pm 0.2 degrees and longitude of 24.1 \pm 0.5
degrees. Using numerical inversion procedures, we have retrieved the
temperature profile of the occulted region, which suggests an increase in
temperature (with radius) of 14.5 K between 6 and 10 \mubar. We also find
temperature fluctuations of 1 to 5 K along the path probed by the occultation;
if the observed temperature gradients of these fluctuations apply to the
vertical direction only, then this region is super-adiabatic. More likely these
thermal gradients are due to a combination of diffractive scintillations and
horizontal temperature variations. Given that isothermal model fits and
numerical inversions cannot separate individual contributions to observed
temperature fluctuations, such as from vertical variations, horizontal
variations, and scintillations, this occultation requires a further study.
