We demonstrate a facile fabrication technique for graphene-based transparent
conductive films. Highly flat and uniform graphene films are obtained through
the incorporation of an efficient laser annealing technique with one-time drop
casting of high-concentration graphene ink. The resulting thin films are
uniform and exhibit a transparency of more than 85% at 550 nm and a sheet
resistance of about 30 k{\Omega}/sq. These values constitute an increase of 45%
in transparency, a reduction of surface roughness by a factor of four and a
decrease of 70% in sheet resistance compared to unannealed films.
