A time-of-flight system with a plastic scintillator coupled to
photomultipliers is developed for the external target facility (ETF). This
system can satisfy the requirement of an ultrahigh vacuum ($\sim 10^{-9}$
mbar), a high counting rate ($\sim 10^{6}$ particles per second) and a magnetic
field environment. In the beam test experiment, a total time resolution of 580
ps FWHM was obtained for the whole system, and nuclei with a mass of up to 80
could be identified using this system.
