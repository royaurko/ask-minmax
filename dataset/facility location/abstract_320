A new design for heavy-ion beam driven isentropic compression experiments is
suggested and analysed. The proposed setup utilises long stopping ranges and
the variable focal spot geometry of the high-energy uranium beams delivered at
the GSI Helmholtzzentrum f\"ur Schwerionenforschung and Facility for Antiproton
and Ion Research accelerator facilities in Darmstadt, Germany, to produce a
planar ramp loading of various samples. In such experiments, the predicted high
pressure amplitudes (\unit[$<10$]{Mbar}) and the predicted short timescales of
compression (\unit[$<10$]{ns}) will allow testing the time dependent material
deformation phenomena at unprecedented extreme conditions.
