NSVS 5222076, a thirteenth magnitude star in the Northern Sky Variability
Survey, was identified by Oaster as a possible new double-mode RR Lyrae star.
We confirm the double-mode nature of NSVS 5222076, supplementing the survey
data with new V band photometry. NSVS 5222076 has a fundamental mode period of
0.4940 day and a first overtone period of 0.3668 day. Its fundamental mode
light curve has an amplitude twice as large as that of the first overtone mode,
a ratio very rarely seen. Data from the literature are used to discuss the
location in the Petersen diagram of double-mode RR Lyrae stars having strong
fundamental mode pulsation. Such stars tend to occur toward the short period
end of the Petersen diagram, and NSVS 5222976 is no exception to this rule.
