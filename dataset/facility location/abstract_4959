Two-point correlators represented by either perturbative or non-perturbative
integral equations in Euclidean space are considered. In general, it is
difficult to determine the analytic structure of arbitrary correlators
analytically. When relying on numerical methods to evaluate the analytic
structure, exact predictions of, e.g., branch point locations (i.e., the
multi-particle threshold) provide a useful check. These branch point locations
can be derived by Cutkosky's cut rules. However, originally they were derived
in Minkowski space for propagators with real masses and are thus not directly
applicable in Euclidean space and for propagators of a more general form.
Following similar considerations that led Karplus et al., Landau and Cutkosky
more than 50 years ago to the mass summation formula that became known as
Cutkosky's cut rules, we show how the position of branch points can be derived
analytically in Euclidean space from propagators of very general form.
