Storage systems are essential building blocks for cloud computing
infrastructures. Although high performance storage servers are the ultimate
solution for cloud storage, the implementation of inexpensive storage system
remains an open issue. To address this problem, the efficient cloud storage
system is implemented with inexpensive and commodity computer nodes that are
organized into PC cluster based datacenter. Hadoop Distributed File System
(HDFS) is an open source cloud based storage platform and designed to be
deployed in low-cost hardware. PC Cluster based Cloud Storage System is
implemented with HDFS by enhancing replication management scheme. Data objects
are distributed and replicated in a cluster of commodity nodes located in the
cloud. This system provides optimum replica number as well as weighting and
balancing among the storage server nodes. The experimental results show that
storage can be balanced depending on the available disk space, expected
availability and failure probability of each node in PC cluster.
