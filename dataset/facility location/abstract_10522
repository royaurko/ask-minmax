The numerical solutions of nonlocal and local Boltzmann kinetic equations for
the simulation of peripheral and central heavy ion reactions are compared. The
experimental finding of enhancement of mid-rapidity matter shows the necessity
to include nonlocal corrections. While the in-medium cross section changes the
number of collisions and not the transferred energy, the nonlocal scenario
changes the energy transferred during collisions. The renormalisation of
quasiparticle energies by using the Pauli-rejected collisions leads to a
further enhancement of mid-rapidity matter distribution and is accompanied by a
dynamical softening of the equation of state.
  The simulation results are parameterised in terms of time dependent
thermodynamical variables in the Fermi liquid sense. This allows one to discuss
dynamical trajectories in phase space. A combination of thermodynamical
observables is constructed which locates instabilities and points of possible
phase transition under iso-nothing conditions. Two different mechanisms of
instability, a short time surface-dominated instability and later a
spinodal-dominated volume instability is found. The latter one occurs only if
the incident energies do not exceed significantly the Fermi energy and might be
attributed to spinodal decomposition.
