Electronic Raman scattering measurements have been performed on
$HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} $ single crystals in the superconducting
state. Pure electronic Raman spectra with no phonon structures hindering the
analysis of the electronic continuum have been obtained. As a consequence, the
spectra in the pure $B_{1g} $ and $B_{2g} $ symmetries are directly and
reliably analyzed and the pure $A_{1g} $ contribution can be easily identified.
Below the critical temperature $T_{c}, $ two electronic structures at $2\Delta
\sim 6.4 k_{B}T_{c} $ and $2\Delta \sim 9.4 $ $k_{B}T_{c} $ are clearly seen.
Both are observed simultaneously in pure $A_{1g} $ symmetry, the highest energy
one being located at the energy of the $B_{1g} $ maximum. These two maxima
disappear at $T_{c} $ and do not soften significantly as the temperature is
raised up to $T_{c}. $ The low energy frequency dependence of the $B_{1g} $
electronic response is strongly linear, for various excitation lines in the
476.5 to 647.1 nm range. Such experimental data cannot be reconciled with a
pure $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} $ symmetry. Instead, they strongly advocate in favor of
an anisotropic superconducting gap with two distinct gap maxima and of nodes
existing outside the [110] and [1,$\bar{1}$,0] directions in {\bf k}-space. We
discuss in detail the simplest order parameter compatible with our experimental
findings.
