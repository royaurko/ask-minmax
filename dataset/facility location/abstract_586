Penning trap mass measurements of short-lived nuclides have been performed
for the first time with highly-charged ions (HCI), using the TITAN facility at
TRIUMF. Compared to singly-charged ions, this provides an improvement in
experimental precision that scales with the charge state q. Neutron-deficient
Rb-isotopes have been charge bred in an electron beam ion trap to q = 8 - 12+
prior to injection into the Penning trap. In combination with the Ramsey
excitation scheme, this unique setup creating low energy, highly-charged ions
at a radioactive beam facility opens the door to unrivalled precision with
gains of 1-2 orders of magnitude. The method is particularly suited for
short-lived nuclides such as the superallowed {\beta} emitter 74Rb (T1/2 = 65
ms). The determination of its atomic mass and an improved QEC-value are
presented.
