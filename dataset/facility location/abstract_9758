Using the Anderson model for disordered systems the fluctuations in electron
spectra near the metal--insulator transition were numerically calculated for
lattices of sizes up to 28 x 28 x 28 sites. The results show a finite--size
scaling of both the level spacing distribution and the variance of number of
states in a given energy interval, that allows to locate the critical point and
to determine the critical exponent of the localization length.
