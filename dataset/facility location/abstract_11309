We investigate the thermodynamic properties including equation of state, the
trace anomaly, the sound velocity and the specific heat, as well as transport
properties like bulk viscosity in the Z(2) and O(4) models in the Hartree
approximation of Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism. We study these
properties in different cases, e.g. first order phase transition, second order
phase transition, crossover and the case without phase transition, and discuss
the correlation between the bulk viscosity and the thermodynamic properties of
the system. We find that the bulk viscosity over entropy density ratio exhibits
an upward cusp at the second order phase transition, and a sharp peak at the
1st order phase transition. However, this peak becomes smooth or disappears in
the case of crossover. This indicates that at RHIC, where there is no real
phase transition and the system experiences a crossover, the bulk viscosity
over entropy density might be small, and it will not affect too much on
hadronization. We also suggest that the bulk viscosity over entropy density
ratio is a better quantity than the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio
to locate the critical endpoint.
