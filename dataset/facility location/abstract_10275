We consider string inspired cosmology on a solitary $D3$-brane moving in the
background of a ring of branes located on a circle of radius $R$. The motion of
the $D3$-brane transverse to the plane of the ring gives rise to a radion field
which can be mapped to a massive non-BPS Born-Infeld type field with a cosh
potential. For certain bounds of the brane tension we find an inflationary
phase is possible, with the string scale relatively close to the Planck scale.
The relevant perturbations and spectral indices are all well within the
expected observational bounds. The evolution of the universe eventually comes
to be dominated by dark energy, which we show is a late time attractor of the
model. However we also find that the equation of state is time dependent, and
will lead to late time Quintessence.
