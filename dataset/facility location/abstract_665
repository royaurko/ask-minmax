In this paper, we address the dynamic Emergency Medical Service (EMS)
systems. A dynamic location model is presented that tries to locate and
relocate the ambulances. The proposed model controls the movements and
locations of ambulances in order to provide a better coverage of the demand
points under different fluctuation patterns that may happen during a given
period of time. Some numerical experiments have been carried out by using some
real-world data sets that have been collected through the French EMS system.
