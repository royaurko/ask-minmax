The imaging data assembled by the recently completed ESO Imaging Survey (EIS)
are reviewed and their scientific value briefly assessed. Among the various
applications, the imaging data has been used to build a large sample of
candidate distant clusters of galaxies in the Southern Hemisphere to be used
for follow-up observations with the VLT as well as other space and ground-based
facilities. Preliminary results from ongoing work to confirm these candidates
are reported and the future prospects discussed.
