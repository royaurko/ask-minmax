We continue the investigation of locally testable codes, i.e.,
error-correcting codes for whom membership of a given word in the code can be
tested probabilistically by examining it in very few locations. We give two
general results on local testability: First, motivated by the recently proposed
notion of {\em robust} probabilistically checkable proofs, we introduce the
notion of {\em robust} local testability of codes. We relate this notion to a
product of codes introduced by Tanner, and show a very simple composition lemma
for this notion. Next, we show that codes built by tensor products can be
tested robustly and somewhat locally, by applying a variant of a test and proof
technique introduced by Raz and Safra in the context of testing low-degree
multivariate polynomials (which are a special case of tensor codes).
  Combining these two results gives us a generic construction of codes of
inverse polynomial rate, that are testable with poly-logarithmically many
queries. We note these locally testable tensor codes can be obtained from {\em
any} linear error correcting code with good distance. Previous results on local
testability, albeit much stronger quantitatively, rely heavily on algebraic
properties of the underlying codes.
