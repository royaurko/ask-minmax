I report the discovery of a prominent broad and asymmetrical feature near 6.4
keV in the Seyfert 1 MCG-02-14-009 (z=0.028) with XMM-Newton/EPIC. The present
short X-ray observation (PN net exposure time ~5 ks) is the first one above 2
keV for MCG-02-14-009. The feature can be explained by either a relativistic
iron line around either a Schwarzschild (non-rotating) or a Kerr (rotating)
black hole. If the feature is a relativistic iron line around a Schwarzschild
black hole, the line energy is 6.51 (+0.21,-0.12) keV with an equivalent width
of 631 (+259,-243) eV and that the inclination angle of the accretion disc
should be less than 43 degrees. A relativistically blurred photoionized disc
model gives a very good spectral fit over the broad band 0.2-12keV energy
range. The spectrum is reflection dominated and this would indicate that the
primary source in MCG-02-14-009 is located very close to the black hole, where
gravitational light bending effect is important (about 3-4 Rg), and that the
black hole may rapidly rotate.
