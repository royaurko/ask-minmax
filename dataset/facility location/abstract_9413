We present spectroscopic abundance analyses of three main-sequence B stars in
the young Large Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC 2004. All three targets have
projected rotational velocities around 130 km/s. Techniques are presented that
allow the derivation of stellar parameters and chemical abundances in spite of
these high v sin i values. Together with previous analyses of stars in this
cluster, we find no evidence among the main-sequence stars for effects due to
rotational mixing up to v sin i around 130 km/s. Unless the equatorial
rotational velocities are significantly larger than the v sin i values, this
finding is probably in line with theoretical expectations. NGC 2004/B30, a star
of uncertain evolutionary status located in the Blue Hertzsprung Gap, clearly
shows signs of mixing in its atmosphere. To verify the effects due to
rotational mixing will therefore require homogeneous analysis of statistically
significant samples of low-metallicity main-sequence B stars over a wide range
of rotational velocities.
