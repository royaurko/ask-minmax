In this paper, we propose a novel optimal power allocation method that
features a power limit function and is able to ensure more users reach the
desired Quality-of-Service (QoS). In our model we use sigmoidal-like utility
functions to represent the probability of successful reception of packets at
user equipment (UE)s. Given that each UE has a different channel quality and
different location from base station (BS), it has different CQI and modulation.
For each CQI zone, we evaluate the power threshold which is required to achieve
the minimum QoS for each UE and show that the higher CQI the lower power
threshold is. We present a resource allocation algorithm that gives limited
resources to UEs who have already reached their pre-specified minimum QoS, and
provides more possible resources to UEs who can not reach it. We also compare
this algorithm with the optimal power allocation algorithm in [1] to show the
enhancement.
