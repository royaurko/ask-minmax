Mathematical models and computer algorithms are developed to calculate
dynamic stress concentration and fracture wave propagation in a reinforced
composite sheet. The composite consists of a regular system alternating
extensible fibers and pliable adhesive layers. In computer simulations, we
derive difference algorithms preventing or minimizing the parasite distortions
caused by the mesh dispersion and obtain precise numerical solutions in the
plane fracture problem of a pre-stretched sheet along the fibers. Interactive
effects of microscale dynamic deformation and multiple damage in fibers and
adhesive are studied. Two engineering models of the composite are considered:
the first assumes that adhesive can be represented by inertionless bonds of
constant stiffness, while in the second one an adhesive is described by
inertial medium perceived shear stresses. Comparison of results allows the
evaluation of facilities of models in wave and fracture patterns analysis.
