We investigate the linear growth and vertical structure of the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) in weakly ionised, stratified accretion
discs. The magnetic field is initially vertical and dust grains are assumed to
have settled towards the midplane, so charges are carried by electrons and ions
only. Solutions are obtained at representative radial locations from the
central protostar for different choices of the initial magnetic field strength,
sources of ionisation, and disc surface density.
  The MRI is active over a wide range of magnetic field strengths and fluid
conditions in low conductivity discs. For the minimum-mass solar nebula model,
incorporating cosmic ray ionisation, perturbations grow at 1 AU for B < 8 G.
For a significant subset of these strengths (0.2 - 5 G), the growth rate is of
order the ideal MHD rate (0.75 Omega). Similarly, when cosmic rays are assumed
to be excluded from the disc by the winds emitted by the magnetically active
protostar, unstable modes grow at this radius for B less than about 2 G.
  This study shows that, despite the low magnetic coupling, the magnetic field
is dynamically important for a large range of fluid conditions and field
strengths in protostellar discs. Hall diffusion largely determines the
structure and growth rate of these perturbations for all studied radii. At
radii of order 1 AU, in particular, it is crucial to incorporate the full
conductivity tensor in studies of the dynamics of astrophysical discs.
