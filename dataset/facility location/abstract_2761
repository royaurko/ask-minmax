Formation of clusters of interlayer interstitial carbon atoms in graphite is
studied by means of molecular dynamics simulation. It is shown that the
deformation potential is attractive for interstitials located in one interlayer
region and repulsive for interstitials located in different interlayer regions.
As a result, relatively small interstitial clusters are formed which are
arranged in a checkerboard-like order.
