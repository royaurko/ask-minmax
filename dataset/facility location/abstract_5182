Linear polymers adsorbing on a wall can be modelled by half-space
self-avoiding walks adsorbing on a line in the square lattice, or on a surface
in the cubic lattice. In this paper a numerical approach based on the GAS
algorithm is used to approximately enumerate states in the partition function
of this model. The data are used to approximate the free energy in the model,
from which estimates of the location of the critical point and crossover
exponents are made. The critical point is found to be located at
\begin{equation} a_c^+ = \cases{ 1.779 \pm 0.003, & in the square lattice; \\
1.306 \pm 0.007, & in the cubic lattice. } \end{equation} These results are
then used to estimate the crossover exponent $\phi$ association with the
adsorption transition, giving \begin{equation} \phi = \cases{ 0.496 \pm 0.009,
& in two dimensions; \\ 0.505 \pm 0.006, & in three dimensions. }\end{equation}
In addition, the scaling of thermodynamic quantities are examined using the
numerical data. These include the scaling of metric quantities, and the
partition and generating function. In all cases results and numerical values of
exponents were obtained which are consistent with estimates in the literature.
