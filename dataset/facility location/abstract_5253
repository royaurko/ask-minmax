The electron-target-asymmetries A_parallel and A_perpendicular with target
spin parallel and perpendicular to the momentum transfer q were measured for
both the two-- and three-body breakup of 3He in the 3He(e,e'p)-reaction.
Polarized electrons were scattered off polarized 3He in the quasielastic regime
in parallel kinematics with the scattered electron and the knocked-out proton
detected using the Three-Spectrometer-Facility at MAMI. The results are
compared to Faddeev calculations which take into account Final State
Interactions as well as Meson Exchange Currents. The experiment confirms the
prediction of a large effect of Final State Interactions in the asymmetry of
the three-body breakup and of an almost negligible one for the two-body
breakup.
