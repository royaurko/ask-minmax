This paper introduces a method of region-of-interest (ROI) reconstruction
from truncated 3D X-ray projections, consisting of a wavelet-based regularized
iterative reconstruction procedure that, under appropriate conditions,
converges within the ROI to an exact or highly accurate solution. ROI
tomography is motivated by the goal to reduce the overall radiation exposure
when primarily the reconstruction of a specified region rather than the entire
object is required. Our approach assumes that only the 3D truncated X-ray
projections, i.e., the projection data restricted to the image of the ROI, are
known and does not assume any previous knowledge about the density function,
except for standard assumptions about integrability and regularity needed to
ensure that forward and backward transforms are well defined. We provide
rigorous theoretical justification for the convergence of our regularized
reconstruction algorithm in the continuous setting and prove the existence of a
critical radius of a spherical ROI that ensures the convergence of the
algorithm. Theoretical results are validated numerically using simulated
acquisition and truncation of projection data for various acquisition
geometries and ROI sizes and locations. We provide a numerical analysis of the
ROI reconstruction stability as a function of the ROI size, showing that our
algorithm converges also for ROI sizes which are rather small with respect to
the support of the density function.
