We present the results obtained with the new Laue lens prototype built in the
LARIX facility in the Physics Department of University of Ferrara. Following
the results of the first prototype presented at the SPIE conference in
Marseille, and also thanks to the methods adopted for improving the prototype
(SPIE conference in San Diego, Ferrari et al. 2009) here we present the results
of the new prototype with improved performances in terms of point spread
function (PSF) and spectral response.
