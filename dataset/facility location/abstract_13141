In this paper we present a novel technique for micro-seismic localization
using a group sparse penalization that is robust to the focal mechanism of the
source and requires only a velocity model of the stratigraphy rather than a
full Green's function model of the earth's response. In this technique we
construct a set of perfect delta detector responses, one for each detector in
the array, to a seismic event at a given location and impose a group sparsity
across the array. This scheme is independent of the moment tensor and exploits
the time compactness of the incident seismic signal. Furthermore we present a
method for improving the inversion of the moment tensor and Green's function
when the geometry of seismic array is limited. In particular we demonstrate
that both Tikhonov regularization and truncated SVD can improve the recovery of
the moment tensor and be robust to noise. We evaluate our algorithm on
synthetic data and present error bounds for both estimation of the moment
tensor as well as localization. Furthermore we discuss the estimated moment
tensor accuracy as a function of both array geometry and fault orientation.
