The silicate carbon star V778 Cyg is a source of 22 GHz water maser emission
which was recently resolved by MERLIN. Observations revealed an elongated
S-like structure along which the velocities of the maser features show a linear
dependence on the impact parameter. This is consistent with a doubly-warped m=2
disc observed edge-on. Water masers and silicate dust emission (detected by
IRAS and ISO) have a common origin in O-rich material and are likely to be
co-located in the disc. We propose a detailed self-consistent model of a masing
gas-dust disc around a companion to the carbon star in a binary system, which
allows us to estimate the companion mass of 1.7 +- 0.1 M_sun, the disc radius
of 40 +-3 AU and the distance between companions of about 80 AU. Using a
dust-gas coupling model for water masing, we calculate the maser power
self-consistently, accounting for both the gas and the dust energy balances.
Comparing the simulation results with the observational data, we deduce the
main physical parameters of the masing disc, such as the gas and dust
temperatures and their densities. We also present an analysis of the stability
of the disc.
