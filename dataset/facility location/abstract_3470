The $B(E2;0^+\to2^+)$ value in $^{68}$Ni has been measured using Coulomb
excitation at safe energies. The $^{68}$Ni radioactive beam was
post-accelerated at the ISOLDE facility (CERN) to 2.9 MeV/u. The emitted
$\gamma$ rays were detected by the MINIBALL detector array. A kinematic
particle reconstruction was performed in order to increase the measured c.m.
angular range of the excitation cross section. The obtained value of
2.8$^{+1.2}_{-1.0}$ 10$^2$ e$^2$fm$^4$ is in good agreement with the value
measured at intermediate energy Coulomb excitation, confirming the low
$0^+\to2^+$ transition probability.
