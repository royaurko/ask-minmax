Jets and outflows are thought to be an integral part of accretion phenomena
and are associated with a large variety of objects. In these systems, the
interaction of magnetic fields with an accretion disk and/or a magnetized
central object is thought to be responsible for the acceleration and
collimation of plasma into jets and wider angle flows. In this paper we present
three-dimensional MHD simulations of magnetically driven, radiatively cooled
laboratory jets that are produced on the MAGPIE experimental facility. The
general outflow structure comprises an expanding magnetic cavity which is
collimated by the pressure of an extended plasma background medium, and a
magnetically confined jet which develops within the magnetic cavity. Although
this structure is intrinsically transient and instabilities in the jet and
disruption of the magnetic cavity ultimately lead to its break-up, a well
collimated, knotty jet still emerges from the system; such clumpy morphology is
reminiscent of that observed in many astrophysical jets. The possible
introduction in the experiments of angular momentum and axial magnetic field
will also be discussed.
