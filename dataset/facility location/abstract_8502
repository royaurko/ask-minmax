We present the data from an extensive, moderately deep (b_J = 19.5)
spectroscopic survey of $\sim 600$ galaxies within four regions of sky located
near the South Galactic Pole. About 75% of the measured galaxies are in a 3deg
x 1.5deg region dominated by the rich cluster Klemola 44 (Abell 4038). The
other three smaller areas cover about 1 square degree each. Here we discuss in
detail the observing and data reduction strategies, the completeness and errors
on the measured redshifts. The data collected are being used for: (1) a study
of the large--scale redshift distribution of the galaxies in each field, and
(2) a thorough dynamical investigation of Klemola 44. Results from these
analyses will be presented in forthcoming papers.
