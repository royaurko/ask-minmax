The recent binary microlensing event toward the Small Magellanic Cloud
MACHO-98-SMC-1 was alerted by the MACHO collaboration and monitored by many
microlensing experiments for its complete coverage of the second caustic
crossing. The purpose of this global monitoring campaign was to determine the
relative proper motion $|\vec\mu|$ of the lensing object with respect to the
source star that may be indicative of the location of the lensing object. (``Is
it a Galactic halo object or not, that is the question.") The estimated value
$|\vec\mu| \approx 1.3 km/(s \kpc)$ indicates that the binarylensing object
belongs to the stellar population of the SMC. We discuss the implication of
this binary event for the halo dark matter.
