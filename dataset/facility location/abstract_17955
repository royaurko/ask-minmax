High-resolution (0.5 arcsec) CO(2-1) observations performed with the Atacama
Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array have been used to trace the kinematics of
the molecular gas in the Seyfert 2 galaxy{IC~5063}. Although one of the most
radio-loud Seyfert galaxy, IC~5063 is a relatively weak radio source (P_1.4GHz
= 3 x 10^23 W Hz^-1). The data reveal that the kinematics of the gas is very
complex. A fast outflow of molecular gas extends along the entire radio jet (~
1 kpc), with the highest outflow velocities about 0.5 kpc from the nucleus, at
the location of the brighter hot-spot in the W lobe. All the observed
characteristics can be described by a scenario of a radio plasma jet expanding
into a clumpy medium, interacting directly with the clouds and inflating a
cocoon that drives a lateral outflow into the interstellar medium. This
suggests that most of the observed cold molecular outflow is due to fast
cooling of the gas after the passage of a shock and that it is the end product
of the cooling process.
