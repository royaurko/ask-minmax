The 119-126Sn nuclei have been produced as fission fragments in two reactions
induced by heavy ions: 12C+238U at 90 MeV bombarding energy, 18O+208Pb at 85
MeV. Their level schemes have been built from gamma rays detected using the
Euroball array. High-spin states located above the long-lived isomeric states
of the even- and odd-A 120-126Sn nuclei have been identified. Moreover isomeric
states lying around 4.5 MeV have been established in 120,122,124,126Sn from the
delayed coincidences between the fission fragment detector SAPhIR and the
Euroball array. The states located above 3-MeV excitation energy are ascribed
to several broken pairs of neutrons occupying the nu h11/2 orbit. The maximum
value of angular momentum available in such a high-j shell, i.e. for
mid-occupation and the breaking of the three neutron pairs, has been
identified. This process is observed for the first time in spherical nuclei.
