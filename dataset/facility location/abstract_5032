We introduce in this paper a new CP-based approach to support errors location
in a program for which a counter-example is available, i.e. an instantiation of
the input variables that violates the post-condition. To provide helpful
information for error location, we generate a constraint system for the paths
of the CFG (Control Flow Graph) for which at most k conditional statements may
be erroneous. Then, we calculate Minimal Correction Sets (MCS) of bounded size
for each of these paths. The removal of one of these sets of constraints yields
a maximal satisfiable subset, in other words, a maximal subset of constraints
satisfying the post condition. We extend the algorithm proposed by Liffiton and
Sakallah \cite{LiS08} to handle programs with numerical statements more
efficiently. We present preliminary experimental results that are quite
encouraging.
