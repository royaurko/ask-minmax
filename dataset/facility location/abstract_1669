A personal selection is made of some of the hot topics debated at this
conference, including examples of using our knowledge of QCD to make
electroweak measurements, structure functions at low x in the light of the
corrections to the leading BFKL behaviour recently calculated, diffraction, the
existence of one or more Pomerons and whether it/they may have a well-defined
structure function, some issues in hadronic final states and polarized
structure functions, and the interesting events at large Q^2 and x and with
isolated leptons and missing transverse energy. Finally, some of the prospects
for future deep-inelastic scattering facilities are reviewed, and the
interested community is encouraged to organize itself to advocate their
approval.
