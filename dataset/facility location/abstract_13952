We investigated the acoustic radiation force (ARF) acting on a cylindrical
brass particle near an acoustically soft plate patterned with a periodic deep
grating. The existence of a negative ARF by which the particle can be pulled
towards the sound source is confirmed. In addition, the bandwidth for negative
ARF in this soft-plate system is found to be considerably broader than in the
stiff-plate systems typically used in previous studies. It is further
demonstrated by field distribution analysis that the negative ARF is caused by
the gradient force induced by the gradient vortex velocity field near the
surface, which stems from the collective resonance excitation of the
antisymmetric coupling of Scholte surface waves in the thin plate. The effects
of particle location and size on the ARF were also investigated in detail. The
negative ARF has potential use in applications requiring particle manipulation
using acoustic waves.
