We present models of giant planet migration in evolving protoplanetary discs.
We show that disc clearing by EUV photoevaporation can have a strong effect on
the distribution of giant planet semi-major axes. During disc clearing planet
migration is slowed or accelerated in the region where photoevaporation opens a
gap in the disc, resulting in "deserts" where few giant planets are found and
corresponding "pile-ups" at smaller and larger radii. However, the precise
locations and sizes of these features are strong functions of the efficiency of
planetary accretion, and therefore also strongly dependent on planet mass. We
suggest that photoevaporative disc clearing may be responsible for the pile-up
of ~Jupiter-mass planets at ~1AU seen in exoplanet surveys, and show that
observations of the distribution of exoplanet semi-major axes can be used to
test models of both planet migration and disc clearing.
