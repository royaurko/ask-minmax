We demonstrate a simple technique to transfer CVD-grown graphene from copper
and platinum substrates using a soak-and-peel delamination technique utilizing
only hot deionized water. The lack of chemical etchants results in cleaner CVD
graphene films minimizing unintentional doping, as confirmed by Raman and
electrical measurements. The process allows the reuse of substrates and hence
can enable the use of oriented substrates for growth of higher quality
graphene, and is an inherently inexpensive and scalable process for large-area
production.
