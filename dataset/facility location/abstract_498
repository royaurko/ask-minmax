This lecture presents an overview of the status of the investigation of the
properties of the quark-gluon plasma using relativistic heavy ion collisions at
the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
It focuses on the insights that have been obtained by the comparison between
experimental data from both facilities and theoretical calculations.
