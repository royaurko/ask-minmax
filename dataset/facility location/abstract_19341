Based on the experience we have gained so far, as independent reviewers of
Radioengineering journal, we thought that may be proved useful to publicly
share with the interested contributor, especially the young one, some practical
implementations of our ideas for the interactive representation of data using
3D/4D movement and animation, in an attempt to motivate and support her/him in
the development of similar dynamic presentations, when s/he is looking for a
way to locate the stronger aspects of her/his research results in order to
prepare a clear, most appropriate for publication, static presentation figure.
For this purpose, we selected to demonstrate a number of presentations, from
the simplest to the most complicated, concerning well-known antenna issues with
rather hard to imagine details, as it happens perhaps in cases involving
Spherical Coordinates and Polarization, which we created to enrich the very
first ever made Virtual Laboratories of Antennas, that we distribute over the
Open Internet through our website Virtual Antennas. These presentations were
developed in a general way, without using antenna simulators, to handle output
text and image data from third-party CAS Computer Algebra Systems, such as the
Mathematica commercial software we use or the Maxima FLOSS we track its
evolution.
