Young brown dwarfs and directly-imaged exoplanets have enticingly similar
photometric and spectroscopic characteristics, indicating that their cool, low
gravity atmospheres should be studied in concert. Similarities between the
peculiar shaped H band, near and mid-IR photometry as well as location on color
magnitude diagrams provide important clues about how to extract physical
properties of planets from current brown dwarf observations. In this proceeding
we discuss systems newly assigned to 10-150 Myr nearby moving groups, highlight
the diversity of this uniform age-calibrated brown dwarf sample, and reflect on
their implication for understanding current and future planetary data.
