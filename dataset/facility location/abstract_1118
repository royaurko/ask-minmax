We present a novel approach to handle ring artifacts correction in compressed
sensing tomographic reconstruction. The correction is part of the
reconstruction process, which differs from classical sinogram pre-processing
and image post-processing techniques. The principle of compressed sensing
tomographic reconstruction is presented. Then, we show that the ring artifacts
correction can be integrated in the reconstruction problem formalism. We
provide numerical results for both simulated and real data. This technique is
included in the PyHST2 code which is used at the European Synchrotron Radiation
Facility for tomographic reconstruction.
