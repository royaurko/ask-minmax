We report the discovery of a large-scale coherent filamentary structure of
Lyman alpha emitters in a redshift space at z=3.1. We carried out spectroscopic
observations to map the three dimensional structure of the belt-like feature of
the Lyman alpha emitters discovered by our previous narrow-band imaging
observations centered on the protocluster at z=3.1. The feature was found to
consist of at least three physical filaments connecting with each other. The
result is in qualitative agreement with the prediction of the 'biased'
galaxy-formation theories that galaxies preferentially formed in large-scale
filamentary or sheet-like mass overdensities in the early Universe. We also
found that the two known giant Lyman alpha emission-line nebulae showing high
star-formation activities are located near the intersection of these filaments,
which presumably evolves into a massive cluster of galaxies in the local
Universe. This may suggest that massive galaxy formation occurs at the
characteristic place in the surrounding large-scale structure at high redshift.
