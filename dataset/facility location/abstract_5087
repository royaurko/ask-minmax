In order to understand the main observational characteristics of the Galactic
X-ray binary Cygnus X-3, we propose a radiation model in which high-energy
electrons accelerated in the dissipation zone of a jet produce the non-thermal
broadband emissions. Broadband spectral energy distributions are computed to
confront with the AGILE and\emph{ Fermi} LAT data together with the multi-band
data, during soft X-ray spectral states. By fitting observations at different
locations of the jet, we find that the emission region is rather compact and
should be located at the distance of about one orbital radius. Our results can
explain the current multi-frequency observations and also predict the TeV band
emission. The model could be tested by a polarization measurement at IR band,
and/or by a correlation study between the GeV and TeV bands once very
high-energy observations are available.
