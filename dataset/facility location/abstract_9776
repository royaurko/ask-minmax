To determine the superconducting gap function of a borocarbide superconductor
YNi_2B_2C, the c-axis thermal conductivity kappa_zz was measured in a magnetic
field rotated in various directions relative to the crystal axes. The angular
variation of kappa_zz in H rotated within the ab-plane shows a peculiar
fourfold oscillation with narrow cusps. The amplitude of this fourfold
oscillation becomes very small when H is rotated conically around the c-axis
with a tilt angle of 45 degrees. Based on these results, we provide the first
compelling evidence that the gap function of YNi_2B_2C has POINT NODES, which
are located along the [100] and [010]-directions. This unprecedented gap
structure challenges the current view on the pairing mechanism and on the
unusual superconducting properties of borocarbide superconductors.
