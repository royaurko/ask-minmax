The paper presents the results of a study of unique plate with images of
Srubna burial of tumuli group Popov Yar-2 (Ukraine) and plate of Srubna burial
of tumulus field Tavriya-1 (Russia). A distinctive feature of the images is the
orderliness and symmetry of the composition, as well as the location of
elliptical cupped depressions. With the help of mathematical and astronomical
methods we prove in this paper that the plates with the images are the ancient
sundials. At the Popov Yar-2 plate located two sundials, which worked at the
same time: the analemmatic sundial and the horizontal sundial with two gnomons
and the linear scale. At the Tavriya-1 plate located analemmatic sundial. On
the basis of the reconstruction of the linear parameters of the gnomon of both
Popov Yar-2 plate sundials and given the scale value of horizontal sundial, in
the article that the potential indirect impact protoscientific knowledge of
ancient Egypt to the Srubna population in the Northern Black Sea coast.
