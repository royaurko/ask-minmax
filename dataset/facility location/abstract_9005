We present echelle spectrograph observations in NaD, at resolutions of
6.2-8.5 km/s, for 11 stars located in the line-of-sight to the M15 intermediate
velocity cloud, which has a radial velocity of 70 km/s. This cloud is a part of
IVC Complex gp. The targets range in magnitude from V=13.3-14.8. Seven of the
observed stars are in the M15 globular cluster, the remaining four being field
stars. Column density ratios of log(N cm^-2)=11.8-12.5 are derived. Combining
the current sightlines with previously-existing data, we find the NaD/HI ratio
in the IVC varies by upto a factor of 25. One cluster star, M15 ZNG-1, was also
observed in Calcium. We find N(CaI)/N(CaII)<0.03 and NaI/CaII=0.25, similar to
values seen in the local ISM. Finally, we detect tentative evidence for IV
absorption in KI towards 3 cluster stars.
