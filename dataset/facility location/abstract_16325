We present broadband (gamma-ray, X-ray, near-infrared, optical, and radio)
observations of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) 090709A and its afterglow in an
effort to ascertain the origin of this high-energy transient. Previous analyses
suggested that GRB 090709A exhibited quasi-periodic oscillations with a period
of 8.06 s, a trait unknown in long-duration GRBs but typical of flares from
soft gamma-ray repeaters. When properly accounting for the underlying shape of
the power-density spectrum of GRB 090709A, we find no conclusive (> 3 sigma)
evidence for the reported periodicity. In conjunction with the location of the
transient (far from the Galactic plane and absent any nearby host galaxy in the
local universe) and the evidence for extinction in excess of the Galactic
value, we consider a magnetar origin relatively unlikely. A long-duration GRB,
however, can account for the majority of the observed properties of this
source. GRB 090709A is distinguished from other long-duration GRBs primarily by
the large amount of obscuration from its host galaxy (A_K,obs >~ 2 mag).
