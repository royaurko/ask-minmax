Beam-excited higher order modes (HOM) in 3.9GHz accelerating cavities are
planned to be used for beam position monitoring at the European XFEL. The
selected HOMs are located around 5440MHz, with a bandwidth of 100MHz and
9060MHz, with a bandwidth of 50MHz. A downconverter electronics, built for
tests at FLASH, converts the HOMs to an intermediate frequency of 70MHz. The
MTCA (Micro Telecommunications Computing Architecture) standard will be used
for the XFEL. Thus it is important to have a performance study of the
downconverter test-electronics using the MTCA digitizer card SIS8300. In the
digitizer the IF frequency of 70MHz is undersampled with a clock frequency of
108MS/s. The paper presents the performance of the digitizer together with the
test-electronics. A comparison with a 216MS/s VME (Versa Module Eurocard)
digitizer is made.
