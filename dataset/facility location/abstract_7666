We have studied the wisps to the north-west of the Crab pulsar as part of a
multi-wavelength campaign in the visible and in X-rays. Optical observations
were obtained using the Nordic Optical Telescope in La Palma and X-ray
observations were made with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The observing
campaign took place from 2010 October until 2012 September. About once per year
we observe wisps forming and peeling off from (or near) the region commonly
associated with the termination shock of the pulsar wind. We find that the
exact locations of the northwestern wisps in the optical and in X-rays are
similar but not coincident, with X-ray wisps preferentially located closer to
the pulsar. This suggests that the optical and X-ray wisps are not produced by
the same particle distribution. Our measurements and their implications are
interpreted in terms of a Doppler-boosted ring model that has its origin in
magne- tohydrodynamic (MHD) modelling. While the Doppler boosting factors
inferred from the X-ray wisps are consistent with current MHD simulations of
pulsar wind nebulae (PWN), the optical boosting factors are not, and typically
exceed values from MHD simulations by about a factor of 3.
