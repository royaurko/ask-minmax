On the basis of our calculation we deduce that the particular electronic
structure of cuprate superconductors confines Cooper pairs to be firstly formed
in the antinodal region which is far from the Fermi surface, and these pairs
are incoherent and result in the pseudogap state. With the change of doping or
temperature, some pairs are formed in the nodal region which locates the Fermi
surface, and these pairs are coherent and lead to superconductivity. Thus the
coexistence of the pseudogap and the superconducting gap is explained when the
two kinds of gaps are not all on the Fermi surface. It is also shown that the
symmetry of the pseudogap and the superconducting gap are determined by the
electronic structure, and non-s wave symmetry gap favors the high-temperature
superconductivity. Why the high-temperature superconductivity occurs in the
metal region near the Mott metal-insulator transition is also explained.
