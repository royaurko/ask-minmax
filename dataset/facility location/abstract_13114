We developed a 12-liter volume neutron detector filled with the liquid
scintillator EJ301 that measures neutrons in an underground laboratory where
dark matter and neutrino experiments are located. The detector target is a
cylindrical volume coated on the inside with reflective paint (95%
reflectivity) that significantly increases the detector's light collection. We
demonstrate several calibration techniques using point sources and cosmic-ray
muons for energies up to 20 MeV for this large liquid scintillation detector.
Neutron-gamma separation using pulse shape discrimination with a few MeV
neutrons to hundreds of MeV neutrons is shown for the first time using a large
liquid scintillator.
