We show how one can systematically construct vacuum solutions to Einstein
field equations with $D-2$ commuting Killing vectors in $D>4$ dimensions. The
construction uses Einstein-scalar field seed solutions in 4 dimensions and is
performed both for the case when all the Killing directions are spacelike, as
well as when one of the Killing vectors is timelike. The later case corresponds
to generalizations of stationary axially symmetric solutions to higher
dimensions. Some examples representing generalizations of known higher
dimensional stationary solutions are discussed in terms of their rod structure
and horizon locations and deformations.
