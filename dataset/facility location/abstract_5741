Chu et al (2001; ApJ, 533, L69) report that they find the diffuse X-ray
emission from the Cat's Eye Nebula, NGC 6543, to be inconsistent with nebular
abundances but consistent with abundances expected for the stellar wind
although the location of the emission and the temperature they derive for the
X-ray emitting region of NGC 6543 require that a significant fraction of the
X-ray emitting material be nebular. A recent, refined, determination by
Bernard-Salus et al (personal communication) of nebular abundances in NGC 6543
incorporating infrared, optical, and ultraviolet observations provides a
resolution of this apparent anomaly.
