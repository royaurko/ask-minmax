We study collective decision-making in a model of human groups, with network
interactions, performing two alternative choice tasks. We focus on the
speed-accuracy tradeoff, i.e., the tradeoff between a quick decision and a
reliable decision, for individuals in the network. We model the evidence
aggregation process across the network using a coupled drift diffusion model
(DDM) and consider the free response paradigm in which individuals take their
time to make the decision. We develop reduced DDMs as decoupled approximations
to the coupled DDM and characterize their efficiency. We determine high
probability bounds on the error rate and the expected decision time for the
reduced DDM. We show the effect of the decision-maker's location in the network
on their decision-making performance under several threshold selection
criteria. Finally, we extend the coupled DDM to the coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
model for decision-making in two alternative choice tasks with recency effects,
and to the coupled race model for decision-making in multiple alternative
choice tasks.
