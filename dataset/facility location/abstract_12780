We present a simple mechanism to produce vortices at any desired spatial
locations in harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) with
multicomponent spin states coupled to external transverse and axial magnetic
fields. The vortices appear at the spatial points where the spin-transverse
field interaction vanishes and, depending on the multipolar magnetic field
order, the vortices can acquire different predictable topological charges. We
explicitly demonstrate our findings, both numerically and analytically, by
analyzing a 2D BEC via the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for atomic systems with
either two or three internal states. We further show that, by an spontaneous
symmetry breaking mechanism, vortices can appear in any spin component, unless
symmetry is externally broken at the outset by an axial field. We suggest that
this scenario may be tested using an ultracold gas of $^{87}$Rb occupying all
three $F = 1$ states in an optical trap.
