We present results from 3.6 cm observations of the quasar pair 1038+528 A and
B, made in 1995 using the VLBA together with the Effelsberg 100m telescope. We
describe the use of a phase-referencing technique to measure the astrometric
separation between the quasars. We also introduce a new data analysis method
-"hybrid double mapping"- which preserves the relative astrometric information
in a single VLBI hybrid map for close source pairs. We combine our measurements
with those from three previous epochs, the earliest in 1981. Our new
observations confirm the evolution within the structure of quasar B, previously
proposed to explain the measured change in the relative separation of the pair.
Our upper bound for any systematic proper motion between the mass centres of
quasars A and B is 10 micro-arcsec/year. This is set by the limited precision
in defining the reference points in the quasars at different epochs and by
possible instabilities of the source "core" locations. A separate analysis
enables us to put more stringent upper limits to any core motions along the two
source axes.
