We present L' and J-band high-contrast observations of HD169142, obtained
with the VLT/NACO AGPM vector vortex coronagraph and the Gemini Planet Imager,
respectively. A source located at 0".156+/-0".032 north of the host star
(PA=7.4+/-11.3 degrees) appears in the final reduced L' image. At the distance
of the star (~145 pc), this angular separation corresponds to a physical
separation of 22.7+/-4.7 AU, locating the source within the recently resolved
inner cavity of the transition disk. The source has a brightness of
L'=12.2+/-0.5 mag, whereas it is not detected in the J band (J>13.8 mag). If
its L' brightness arose solely from the photosphere of a companion and given
the J-L' color constraints, it would correspond to a 28-32 MJupiter object at
the age of the star, according to the COND models. Ongoing accretion activity
of the star suggests, however, that gas is left in the inner disk cavity from
which the companion could also be accreting. In this case the object could be
lower in mass and its luminosity enhanced by the accretion process and by a
circumplanetary disk. A lower mass object is more consistent with the observed
cavity width. Finally, the observations enable us to place an upper limit on
the L'-band flux of a second companion candidate orbiting in the disk annular
gap at ~50 AU, as suggested by millimeter observations. If the second companion
is also confirmed, HD169142 might be forming a planetary system, with at least
two companions opening gaps and possibly interacting with each other.
