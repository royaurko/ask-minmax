The snow line, in Hayashi's (1981) model, is where the temperature of a black
body that absorbed direct sunlight and re-radiated as much as it absorbed,
would be 170~K. It is usually assumed that the cores of the giant planets,
e.g., Jupiter, form beyond the snow line. Since Hayashi, there have been a
series of more detailed models of the absorption by dust of the stellar
radiation, and of accretional heating, which alter the location of the snow
line. We have attempted a "self-consistent" model of a T Tauri disk in the
sense that we used dust properties and calculated surface temperatures that
matched observed disks. We then calculated the midplane temperature for those
disks, with no accretional heating or with small (<10^-8) accretion rates. Our
models bring the snow line in to the neighbourhood of 1 AU; not far enough to
explain the close planetary companions to other stars, but much closer than in
recent starting lines for orbit migration scenarios.
