We have identified 317 stars included in the Hipparcos astrometric catalogue
which have parallaxes measured to a precision of better than 15%, and whose
location in the (M_V, (B-V)_T) diagram implies a metallicity comparable to or
less than that of the intermediate-abundance globular cluster, M5. We have
undertaken an extensive literature search to locate Stromgren, Johnson/Cousins
and Walraven photometry for over 120 stars. In addition, we present new UBVRI
photometry of 201 of these candidate halo stars, together with similar data for
a further 14 known metal-poor subdwarfs. Those observations provide the first
extensive dataset of RI photometry of metal-poor, main-sequence stars with
well-determined trigonometric parallaxes. Finally, we have obtained
intermediate-resolution optical spectroscopy of 175 stars. We are able to
estimate abundances for 270 stars. The overwhelming majority have near-solar
abundance, with their inclusion in the present sample stemming from errors in
the colours listed in the Hipparcos catalogue. Only 44 stars show consistent
evidence of abundances below [Fe/H]= -1.0. Nine are additions to the small
sample of metal-poor subdwarfs with accurate photometry. We consider briefly
the implication of these results for cluster main-sequence fitting.
