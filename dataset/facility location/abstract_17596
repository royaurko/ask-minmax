We have performed a photoemission spectroscopy (PES) study of CeM2Al10 (M =
Fe, Ru, and Os) to directly observe the electronic structure involved in the
unusual magnetic ordering. Soft X-ray resonant (SXR) PES provides spectroscopic
evidence of the hybridization between conduction and Ce 4f electrons (c-f
hybridization) and the order of the hybridization strength (Ru < Os < Fe).
High-resolution (HR) PES of CeRu2Al10 and CeOs2Al10, as compared with that of
CeFe2Al10, identifies two structures that can be ascribed to structures induced
by the c-f hybridization and the antiferromagnetic ordering, respectively.
Although the c-f hybridization-induced structure is a depletion of the spectral
intensity (pseudogap) around the Fermi level (EF) with an energy scale of 20-30
meV, the structure related to the antiferromagnetic ordering is observed as a
shoulder at approximately 10-11 meV within the pseudogap. The energies of the
shoulder structures of CeRu2Al10 and CeOs2Al10 are approximately half of the
optical gap (20 meV), indicating that EF is located at the midpoint of the gap.
