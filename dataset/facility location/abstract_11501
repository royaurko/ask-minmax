The All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) data, covering nearly 70% of the whole
sky south of declination +28 deg, were recently used to discover about 300 Beta
Cephei stars brighter than V~11.5 mag. As this means a nearly fourfold increase
in the number of known stars of this type, new possibilities in studying these
pulsators open up, including statistical work. The homogeneity of the ASAS
survey allows us to study their distribution in the local Galaxy. We discuss
this distribution in the context of the location of nearby spiral arms. In
addition, we show pulsational (periods, amplitudes) properties of the whole
sample of known Beta Cephei stars. Some objects interesting from the point of
view of asteroseismology are also indicated.
