The pion- and photon induced reactions for the final states $\gamma N$, $\pi
N$, $2\pi N$, $\eta N$, and $\omega N$ are studied within a coupled-channel
effective Lagrangian approach in the energy region from the pion threshold up
to 2 GeV. To investigate the role of the nucleon resonances in the different
reactions we include all known states with spin-$\foh$,-$\fth$, and -$\ffh$ and
masses below 2 GeV. We find a strong contribution from the $D_{15}(1675)$
resonance to the $\pi N \to \omega N$ reaction. While the $F_{15}(1680)$ state
only slightly influences the $\omega $ meson production in the $\pi N$
scattering its role is enhanced in the $\omega$ photoproduction due to the
large electromagnetic coupling of this resonance. We predict the beam asymmetry
$\Sigma_X$ to be a negative in the $\gamma p \to \omega p$ reaction near to the
threshold. Above the 1.85 GeV the asymmetry is found to change its sign and
becomes positive at forward directions. The presented findings can be
experimentally tested at GRAAL, CLAS, and CB-ELSA facilities.
