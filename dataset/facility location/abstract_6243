The mass and isotope dependence of limiting temperatures for hot nuclei are
investigated. The predicted mass dependence of limiting temperatures is in good
agreement with data derived from the caloric curve data. The predicted isotope
distribution of limiting temperatures appears to be a parabolic shape and its
centroid is not located at the isotope on the $\beta$-stability line(T=0) but
at neutron-rich side. Our study shows that the mass and isotope dependence of
limiting temperatures depend on the interaction and the form of surface tension
and its isopin dependence sensitively.
