Position of the ice line in a circumbinary disc is determined using a
simplified and illustrative model. Main sources of the heat in the energy
balance of the disc, i.e. heating by the turbulence, irradiation by the
components of the binary and the tidal heating are considered. Our goal is to
clarify role of the tidal heating in the position of the ice line. When viscous
heating and irradiation of the binary are considered, ice line lies interior to
the inner radius of the disc in most of the binaries represented by our
parameter survey. But tidal heating significantly extends position of the ice
line to a larger radius, so that a smaller fraction of the circumbinaries'
population may have ice lines interior to the inner radius of the disc.
