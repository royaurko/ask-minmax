Using improved mean field and strong coupling expansions we re-analyse the
bulk phase diagram of the fundamental-adjoint action of the SU(2) Lattice Gauge
Theory. We find that the qualitative features of the bulk phase diagram are
robust and unchanged by the inclusion of higher order terms. On the other hand,
some of the quantitative features, such as the location of the endpoint of the
line of bulk phase transitions, seem to be strongly dependent on the higher
terms of the strong coupling expansion.
