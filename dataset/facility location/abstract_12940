We consider the gapped graphene superlattice (SL) constructed in accordance
with the Fibonacci rule. Quasi-periodic modulation is due to the difference in
the values of the energy gap in different SL elements. It is shown that the
effective splitting of the allowed bands and thereby forming a series of gaps
is realized under the normal incidence of electrons on the SL as well as under
oblique incidence. Energy spectra reveal periodical character on the whole
energy scale. The splitting of allowed bands is subjected to the inflation
Fibonacci rule. The gap associated with the new Dirac point is formed in every
Fibonacci generation. The location of this gap is robust against the change in
the SL period but at the same time it is sensitive to the ratio of barrier and
well widths; also it is weakly dependent on values of the mass term in the
Hamiltonian.
