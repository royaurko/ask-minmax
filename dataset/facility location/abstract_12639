A leading candidate source of detectable gravitational waves is the inspiral
and merger of pairs of stellar-mass compact objects. The advanced LIGO and
advanced Virgo detectors will allow scientists to detect inspiral signals from
more massive systems and at earlier times in the detector band, than with first
generation detectors. The signal from a coalescence of two neutron stars is
expected to stay in the sensitive band of advanced detectors for several
minutes, thus allowing detection before the final coalescence of the system. In
this work, the prospects of detecting inspiral signals prior to coalescence,
and the possibility to derive a suitable sky area for source locations are
investigated. As a large fraction of the signal is accumulated in the last ~10
seconds prior to coalescence, bandwidth and timing accuracy are largely accrued
in the very last moments prior to coalescence. We use Monte Carlo techniques to
estimate the accuracy of sky localization through networks of ground-based
interferometers such as aLIGO and aVirgo. With the addition of the Japanese
KAGRA detector, it is shown that the detection and triangulation before
coalescence may be feasible.
