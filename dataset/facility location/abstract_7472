We present new results from our search for Giant H\,{\sc ii} Regions in
galaxies visible from the southern hemisphere. In this work we study two
galaxies: NGC\,7479 and NGC\,6070. Using high-resolution spectra, obtained with
different instruments at Las Campanas Observatory, we are able to resolve the
emission-line profile widths and determine the intrinsic velocity dispersion of
the ionised gas. We detect profile widths corresponding to supersonic velocity
dispersions in the six observed H\,{\sc ii} regions. We find that all of them
show at least two distinct kinematical components: a relatively narrow feature
(between ~11 and ~22\kms) and a broader (between ~31 and ~77\kms) component.
Two of the regions show a complex narrow profile in all ion lines, which can be
further split into two components with different radial velocities. Whereas the
wing broadening of the overall profile can be fitted with a low-intensity broad
component for almost all profiles, in one region it was better reproduced by
two separate shell-like wings. We have analysed the impact that the presence of
multiple components has on the location of the H{\sc ii} regions in the
$\log(L) - \log(\sigma)$ plane. Although the overall distribution confirms the
presence of a regression, the precise location of the regions in the plane is
strongly dependent on the components derived from the profile fitting.
