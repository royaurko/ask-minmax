We used the UVES spectrograph (VLT-UT2 telescope) to obtain high-resolution
spectra of 6 stars hosting transiting planets, namely for OGLE-TR-10, 56, 111,
113, 132 and TrES-1. The spectra are now used to derive and discuss the
chemical abundances for C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni,
Cu and Zn. Abundances were derived in LTE, using 1-D plane-parallel Kurucz
model atmospheres. For S, Zn and Cu we used a spectral synthesis procedure,
while for the remaining cases the abundances were derived from measurements of
line-equivalent widths. The resulting abundances are compared with those found
for stars in the solar neighborhood. Distances and galactic coordinates are
estimated for the stars. We conclude that besides being particularly
metal-rich, with small possible exceptions OGLE-TR-10, 56, 111, 113, 132 and
TrES-1 are chemically undistinguishable from the field (thin disk) stars
regarding their [X/Fe] abundances. This is particularly relevant for the most
distant of the targets, located at up to ~2 Kpc from the Sun. We also did not
find any correlation between the abundances and the condensation temperature of
the elements, an evidence that strong accretion of planetary-like material,
tentatively connected to planetary migration, did not occur.
