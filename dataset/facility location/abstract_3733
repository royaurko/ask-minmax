Resonances just above the proton threshold in 30S affect the 29P(p,gamma)30S
reaction under astrophysical conditions. The (p,gamma)-reaction rate is
currently determined indirectly and depends on the properties of the relevant
resonances. We present here a method for finding the ratio between the proton
and gamma partial widths of resonances in 30S. The widths are determined from
the beta-2p and beta-p-gamma decay of 31Ar, which is produced at the ISOLDE
facility at the European research organization CERN. Experimental limits on the
ratio between the proton and gamma partial widths for astrophysical relevant
levels in 30S have been found for the first time. A level at 4688(5) keV is
identified in the gamma spectrum, and an upper limit on the proton to gamma
width of 0.26 (95 % C.L.) is found. In the two-proton spectrum two levels at
5227(3) keV and 5847(4) keV are identified. These levels are previously seen to
gamma decay and upper limits on the gamma to proton width of 0.5 and 9,
respectively, (95 % C.L.) are found, where the latter differs from previous
calculations.
