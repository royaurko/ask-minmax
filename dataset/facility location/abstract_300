New developments concerning the extension of the Feynman diagram analyzer
DIANA are presented. We discuss new graphics facilities, different approaches
to automation of momenta distribution and parallel processing facilities.
Furthermore applications to $t\bar t$ production and Bhabha scattering are
shortly discussed.
