By examining the locations of central black holes in two elliptical galaxies,
M32 and M87, we derive constraints on the violation of the strong equivalence
principle for purely gravitational objects, i.e. black holes, of less than
eight percent, $|\eta_N|<0.08$ from M32. The constraints from M87 are
substantially weaker but could improve dramatically with better astrometry.
