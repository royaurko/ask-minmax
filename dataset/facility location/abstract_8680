New polarimetric observations of the Crab pulsar at frequencies between 1.4
and 8.4 GHz are presented. Additional pulse components discovered in earlier
observations (Moffett & Hankins 1996, astro-ph/9604163) are found to have high
levels of linear polarization, even at 8.4 GHz. No abrupt sweeps in position
angle are found within pulse components; however, the position angle and
rotational phase of the interpulse do change dramatically between 1.4 and 4.9
GHz. The multi-frequency profile morphology and polarization properties
indicate a non-standard origin of the emission. Several emission geometries are
discussed, but the one favored locates sites of emission both near the pulsar
surface and in the outer magnetosphere.
