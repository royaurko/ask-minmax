We present results from an XMM-Newton observation of the head-tail radio
galaxy IC 310 located in the southwest region of the Perseus cluster. The
spectrum is well-fitted by an absorbed power-law model with a photon index of
$2.50 \pm 0.02$ with no significant absorption excess. The X-ray image shows a
point-like emission at IC 310 without any signs of a structure correlated with
the radio halo tail. The temperature of the intracluster medium surrounding IC
310 declines as a function of distance from the cluster center, from $ kT \sim
6$ keV in the northeast corner of the field of view to about 3 keV in the
southwest region. Although we do not find any sharp edges in the surface
brightness profile, a brightness excess over a smooth $\beta$ model by about
20% is seen. The temperature also rises by about 10% in the same region. This
indicates that the IC 310 region is a subcluster probably infalling into the
Perseus cluster, and the gas in front of IC 310 towards the Perseus cluster is
likely to be compressed by the large-scale motion, which supports the view that
the IC 310 system is undergoing a merger.
