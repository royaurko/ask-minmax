The crosstalk noise model for noise constrained interconnects optimization is
presented for RC interconnects. The proposed model has simple closed-form
expressions, which is capable of predicting the noise amplitude and the noise
pulse width of an RC interconnect as well as coupling locations (near-driver
and near-receiver) on victim net. This paper also presents a crosstalk noise
model for both identical and non identical coupled
resistance-inductance-capacitance (RLC) interconnects, which is developed based
on a decoupling technique exhibiting an average error of 6.8% as compared to
SPICE. The crosstalk noise model, together with a proposed concept of effective
mutual inductance, is applied to evaluate the effectiveness of the shielding
technique.
