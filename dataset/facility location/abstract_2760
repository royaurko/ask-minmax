In this paper we discuss the electronic kinetic energy in the ground state of
the Holstein Hamiltonian in one space dimension using the Global-Local
variational method together with perturbation theory at weak and strong
coupling. The electronic kinetic energy is detailed over a broad region of the
polaron parameter space, and is analyzed to accurately determine the location
of the self-trapping transition. The self-trapping line so determined separates
the small polaron regime from the large polaron regime, constituting a polaron
phase diagram.
