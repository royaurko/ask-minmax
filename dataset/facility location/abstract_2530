We discuss how dynamical dark energy universes with exotic singularities may
be distinguished from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model on the basis of their
redshift drift signal, for which measurements both in the acceleration phase
and in the deep matter era will be provided by forthcoming astrophysical
facilities. Two specific classes of exotic singularity models are studied:
sudden future singularity models and finite scale factor singularity models. In
each class we identify the models which can mimic $\Lambda$CDM and play the
role of dark energy as well as models for which redshift drift signals are
significantly different from $\Lambda$CDM and the test can differentiate
between them.
