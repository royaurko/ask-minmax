Associative memory Hamiltonian structure prediction potentials are not overly
rugged, thereby suggesting their landscapes are like those of actual proteins.
In the present contribution we show how basin-hopping global optimization can
identify low-lying minima for the corresponding mildly frustrated energy
landscapes. For small systems the basin-hopping algorithm succeeds in locating
both lower minima and conformations closer to the experimental structure than
does molecular dynamics with simulated annealing. For large systems the
efficiency of basin-hopping decreases for our initial implementation, where the
steps consist of random perturbations to the Cartesian coordinates. We
implemented umbrella sampling using basin-hopping to further confirm when the
global minima are reached. We have also improved the energy surface by
employing bioinformatic techniques for reducing the roughness or variance of
the energy surface. Finally, the basin-hopping calculations have guided
improvements in the excluded volume of the Hamiltonian, producing better
structures. These results suggest a novel and transferable optimization scheme
for future energy function development.
