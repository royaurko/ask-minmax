We describe quenched spectroscopy in SU(2) gauge theory using smoothed gauge
field configurations. We investigate the properties of quarks moving in
instanton background field configurations, where the sizes and locations of the
instantons are taken from simulations of the full gauge theory. By themselves,
these multi-instanton configurations do not confine quarks, but they induce
chiral symmetry breaking.
