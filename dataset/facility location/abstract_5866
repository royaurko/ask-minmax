Spin wave excitations were measured in the ferromagnetic phase of
Nd$_{1/2}$Sr$_{1/2}$MnO$_{3}$ by neutron scattering. This compound is located
in proximity to the A-type antiferromagnetic state, and it shows a clear
anisotropy and anomalous softening of the spin wave excitations. The softening
in the ferromagnetic phase is induced by the orbital ordering.
