We address the interactions between optical solitons in the system with
longitudinally varying nonlocality degree and nonlinearity strength. We
consider a physical model describing light propagation in nematic liquid
crystals featuring a strongly nonlocal nonlinear response. We reveal that the
variation of the nonlocality and nonlinearity along the propagation direction
can substantially enhance or weaken the interaction between out-of-phase
solitons. This phenomenon manifests itself as a slowdown or acceleration of the
soliton collision dynamics in one-dimensional geometries or of the soliton
spiraling rate in bulk media. Therefore, one finds that by engineering the
nonlocality and nonlinearity variation rate one can control the output soliton
location.
