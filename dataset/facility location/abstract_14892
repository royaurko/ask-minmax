A plethora of models of the universe have been proposed in recent years
claiming that the present universe is accelerating, being driven by some
hypothetical source with negative pressure collectively known as {\it dark
energy} which though do not appear to resemble any known form of matter tested
in the laboratory. These models are motivated by the high redshift supernovae
Ia observations. Though low density models, without dark energy, also appear to
fit the SN Ia data reasonably well, however, they are ruled out by the CMB
observations.
  In this paper, we present a warped brane model with an additional surface
term of brane curvature scalar in the action. This results in shifting the {\it
dynamical curvature} of the model from its {\it geometrical} counterpart, which
creates profound consequences. Even for \Lambda=0, the low energy decelerating
model successfully explains the observed locations of the peaks in the angular
power spectrum of CMB. This model also fits the high redshift supernovae Ia
observations, taken together with the recently observed SN 1997ff at z~1.7,
very well. Additionally, it also fits the data on the angular size and redshift
of the compact radio sources very well.
