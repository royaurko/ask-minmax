In this paper we report the identification of two new Galactic O2 If*/WN6
stars (WR20aa and WR20c), in the outskirt of the massive young stellar cluster
Westerlund 2. The morphological similarity between the near-infrared spectra of
the new stars with that of WR20a and WR21a (two of the most massive binaries
known to date) is remarkable, indicating that probably they are also very
massive stars. New optical spectroscopic observations of WR20aa suggest an
intermediate O2 If*/WN6 spectral type. Based on a mosaic made from the 3.6
microns Spitzer IRAC images of the region including part of the RCW49 complex,
we studied the spatial location of the new emission line stars, finding that
WR20aa and WR20c are well displaced from the centre of Westerlund 2, being
placed at ~ 36 pc (15.7 arcmin) and ~ 58 pc (25.0 arcmin) respectively, for an
assumed heliocentric distance of 8 kpc. Also very remarkably, a radius vector
connecting both stars would intercept the Westerlund 2 cluster exactly at the
place where its stellar density reaches a maximum. We consequently postulate a
scenario in which WR20aa and WR20c had a common origin somewhere in the cluster
core, being ejected from their birthplace by dynamical interacion with some
other very massive objects, perhaps during some earlier stage of the cluster
evolution.
