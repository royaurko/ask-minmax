We report the results of a systematic survey for 95 GHz class I methanol
masers towards a new sample of 192 massive young stellar object (MYSO)
candidates associated with ongoing outflows (known as extended green objects or
EGOs) identified from the Spitzer GLIMPSE survey. The observations were made
with the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) Mopra 22-m radio
telescope and resulted in the detection of 105 new 95 GHz class I methanol
masers. For 92 of the sources our observations provide the first identification
of a class I maser transition associated with these objects (i.e. they are new
class I methanol maser sources). Our survey proves that there is indeed a high
detection rate (55%) of class I methanol masers towards EGOs. Comparison of the
GLIMPSE point sources associated with EGOs with and without class I methanol
maser detections shows they have similar mid-IR colors, with the majority
meeting the color selection criteria -0.6<[5.8]-[8.0]<1.4 and
0.5<[3.6]-[4.5]<4.0. Investigations of the IRAC and MIPS 24 um colors and the
associated millimeter dust clump properties (mass and density) of the EGOs for
the sub-samples based on which class of methanol masers they are associated
with suggests that the stellar mass range associated with class I methanol
masers extends to lower masses than for class II methanol masers, or
alternatively class I methanol masers may be associated with more than one
evolutionary phase during the formation of a high-mass star.
