We report on the results of two epochs of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)
observations of the 22 GHz water masers toward IRAS 19190+1102. The water maser
emission from this object shows two main arc-shaped formations perpendicular to
their NE-SW separation axis. The arcs are separated by ~280 mas in position,
and are expanding outwards at an angular rate of 2.35 mas/yr. We detect maser
emission at velocities between -53.3 km/s to +78.0 km/s and there is a distinct
velocity pattern where the NE masers are blueshifted and the SW masers are
redshifted. The outflow has a three-dimensional outflow velocity of 99.8 km/s
and a dynamical age of about 59 yr. A group of blueshifted masers not located
along the arcs shows a change in velocity of more than 35 km/s between epochs,
and may be indicative of the formation of a new lobe. These observations show
that IRAS 19190+1102 is a member of the class of "water fountain"'
pre-planetary nebulae displaying bipolar structure
