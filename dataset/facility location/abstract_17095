We investigate the magnetic field dependence of the physical properties of
f^2-configuration systems with a crystalline-electric field (CEF) singlet
ground state, which gives rise to a non- Fermi liquid (NFL) fixed point due to
the competition between the Kondo-Yosida singlet and CEF singlet states. On the
basis of the numerical renormalization group method, we find that the magnetic
field breaks this NFL fixed point via two mechanisms: one causing the
polarization of f-electrons and the other giving the "channel" anisotropy.
These two mechanisms induce a difference in the magnetic field dependence of
the characteristic temperature T_F^{*}(H), the crossover temperature from NFL
to Fermi-liquid behavior. While the polarization of f-electrons gives
T_F^{*}(H) \propto H^x (x\sim2.0), the "channel" anisotropy gives the
H-independent T_F^{*}(H). These two mechanisms cross over continuously at
approximately the crossover magnetic field H_c, where an anomalous H-dependence
of T_F^{*}(H) appears. Such T_F^{*}(H) well reproduces the NFL behaviors
observed in Th_{1-x}U_xRu_2Si_2. We also find that the H-dependence of the
resistivity and the magnetic susceptibility are in good agreement with the
experimental results of this material. These results suggest that the NFL
behaviors observed in Th_{1-x}U_xRu_2Si_2 can be understood if this material is
located in the CEF singlet side near the critical phase boundary between the
two singlet states.
