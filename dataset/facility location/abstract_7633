An ad hoc network with a finite spatial extent and number of nodes or mobiles
is analyzed. The mobile locations may be drawn from any spatial distribution,
and interference-avoidance protocols or protection against physical collisions
among the mobiles may be modeled by placing an exclusion zone around each
radio. The channel model accounts for the path loss, Nakagami fading, and
shadowing of each received signal. The Nakagami m-parameter can vary among the
mobiles, taking any positive value for each of the interference signals and any
positive integer value for the desired signal. The analysis is governed by a
new exact expression for the outage probability, defined to be the probability
that the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) drops below a threshold,
and is conditioned on the network geometry and shadowing factors, which have
dynamics over much slower timescales than the fading. By averaging over many
network and shadowing realizations, the average outage probability and
transmission capacity are computed. Using the analysis, many aspects of the
network performance are illuminated. For example, one can determine the
influence of the choice of spreading factors, the effect of the receiver
location within the finite network region, and the impact of both the fading
parameters and the attenuation power laws.
