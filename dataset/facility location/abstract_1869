The ISAC polarized beam facility uses a Ti:Sapphire laser for producing
spin-polarized beams of short-lived radioactive isotopes, initially 7Li. The
laser power and spectral content must be tightly controlled and monitored. The
control system to accomplish this task uses techniques that combine operator
interface, data reduction, and closed loop automation. The laser stabilization
application uses input data acquired from a spectrum analyzer, in the form of a
waveform array repetitively acquired from a GPIB-interfaced oscilloscope. A
Labview based operator interface allows the selection of features from within
the waveform, which are then used as the basis for closed loop control, in
concert with the existing EPICS control system software and related hardware.
Part of the challenge stems from using input data which are subject to human
interpretation and require distillation into a hard numeric format suitable for
use in a control system.
