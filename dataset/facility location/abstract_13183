The representation of the knowledge needed by a robot to perform complex
tasks is restricted by the limitations of perception. One possible way of
overcoming this situation and designing "knowledgeable" robots is to rely on
the interaction with the user. We propose a multi-modal interaction framework
that allows to effectively acquire knowledge about the environment where the
robot operates. In particular, in this paper we present a rich representation
framework that can be automatically built from the metric map annotated with
the indications provided by the user. Such a representation, allows then the
robot to ground complex referential expressions for motion commands and to
devise topological navigation plans to achieve the target locations.
