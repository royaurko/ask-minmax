The magnetic field - temperature (B - T) phase diagram of the Mn0.9Co0.1P
single crystal is studied in the vicinity of the Lifshitz point by means of
isothermal magnetocaloric coefficient (Mt) and AC susceptibility measurements.
Results confirm previously reported shape of the B - T phase diagram and
locations of characteristic temperatures and fields. At the Curie temperature
(Tc) the critical exponent w, which describes a singularity of Mt as a function
of magnetic field (Mt \propto B^-w), is estimated for B parallel to the easy
axis to be equal to w \approx 0.35. Below Tc an evidence of a new enigmatic
phase, reported already for pure MnP, is found in susceptibility data also for
Mn0.9Co0.1P. However, the range of existence of this phase is significantly
larger here, than in MnP. At the Lifshitz point there is observed a sharp peak
in the imaginary part of the magnetic susceptibility. A phenomenological theory
is introduced to describe the field dependence of the critical lines from the
disordered phase (paramagnetic) to ordered phases (ferromagnetic and
modulated). The temperature and field dependences of the magnetocaloric
coefficient and susceptibility are also calculated within the same framework.
