The distribution and kinematics of neutral hydrogen have been studied in a
wide area around the supernova remnant W28. A 2.5 x 2.5 arcdeg field centered
at l = 6.5 arcdeg, b = 0 arcdeg was surveyed using the Parkes 64-m radio
telescope (HPBW 14.7 arcmin at lambda 21 cm). Even though W28 is located in a
complex zone of the Galactic plane, we have found different HI features which
are evidence of the interaction between W28 and its surrounding gas.
