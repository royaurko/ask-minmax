The advent of smartphones in recent years has changed the wireless landscape.
Smartphones have become a platform for online user interface to cloud
databases. Cloud databases may provide a large set of user-private and
sensitive data (i.e., objects), while smartphone users (i.e., subjects) provide
location-sensitive information. Secure and private services in wireless
accessing to cloud databases have been discussed actively for the past recent
years. However, the previous techniques are unsatisfactory for dynamism of
moving subjects' wireless accesses. In this paper, we propose a novel technique
to dynamically generate virtual private databases (VPD) for each access by
taking subjects' location and time information into account. The contribution
of this paper includes a privacy-preserving access control mechanism for
dynamism of wireless access.
