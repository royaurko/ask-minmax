The neutral hydrogen and the ionized helium absorption in the spectra of
quasars are unique probes of structure in the early universe. We present
Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer observations of the line of sight to the
quasar HE2347-4342 in the 1000-1187 A band at a resolving power of 15,000. We
resolve the He II Ly alpha absorption as a discrete forest of absorption lines
in the redshift range 2.3 to 2.7. About 50 percent of these features have H I
counterparts with column densities log N(HI) > 12.3 that account for most of
the observed opacity in He II Ly alpha. The He II to H I column density ratio
ranges from 1 to >1000 with an average of ~80. Ratios of <100 are consistent
with photoionization of the absorbing gas by a hard ionizing spectrum resulting
from the integrated light of quasars, but ratios of >100 in many locations
indicate additional contributions from starburst galaxies or heavily filtered
quasar radiation. The presence of He II Ly alpha absorbers with no H I
counterparts indicates that structure is present even in low-density regions,
consistent with theoretical predictions of structure formation through
gravitational instability.
