The six species heavy ion beam was accumulated with the help of electron
cooling in the main ring of Cooler Storage Ring of Heavy Ion Research Facility
in Lanzhou(HIRFL-CSR), the ion beam accumulation dependence on the parameters
of cooler was investigated experimentally. The 400MeV/u 12C6+ and 200MeV/u
129Xe54+ was stored and cooled in the experimental ring CSRe, the cooling force
was measured in different condition.
