The Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) is one of the two instruments onboard the
ESA PLANCK satellite foreseen to be launched in 2007. The LFI will image the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies and the polarization in four
different bands, with an unprecedented combination of sky coverage, calibration
accuracy, control of systematic errors, and sensitivity. LFI is coupled to the
PLANCK Telescope by an array of 23 high performance dual profiled corrugated
feed horns. The dual reflector off axis-design of the 1.5 meter projected
aperture telescope is the most advanced optical design ever conceived for
accommodating large multi-beam and multi-frequency focal plane units. The
location and the design of the feed horns, for both instruments, have been
optimised in order to maintain good beam symmetry, even far from the optical
axis, and an excellent straylight rejection. In this paper we describe the LFI
instrument with emphasis on its optical performance and coupling with the
PLANCK telescope.
