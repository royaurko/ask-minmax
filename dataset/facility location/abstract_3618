In the last two decades a number of nuclear structure and astrophysics
experiments were performed at heavy-ion storage rings employing unique
experimental conditions offered by such machines. Furthermore, building on the
experience gained at the two facilities presently in operation, several new
storage ring projects were launched worldwide. This contribution is intended to
provide a brief review of the fast growing field of nuclear structure and
astrophysics research at storage rings.
