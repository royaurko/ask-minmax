This paper presents the development of a new software in order to manage
objects, robots and mannequins in using the possibilities given by the haptic
feedback of the Phantom desktop devices. The haptic device provides 6
positional degree of freedom sensing but three degrees force feedback. This
software called eM-Virtual Desktop is integrated in the Tecnomatix's solution
called eM-Workplace. The eM-Workplace provides powerful solutions for planning
and designing of complex assembly facilities, lines and workplaces. In the
digital mockup context, the haptic interfaces can be used to reduce the
development cycle of products. Three different loops are used to manage the
graphic, the collision detection and the haptic feedback according to theirs
own frequencies. The developed software is currently tested in industrial
context by a European automotive constructor.
