We show strong evidence for the absence of a finite-temperature spin glass
transition for the random-bond Ising model on self-dual lattices. The analysis
is performed by an application of duality relations, which enables us to derive
a precise but approximate location of the multicritical point on the Nishimori
line. This method can be systematically improved to presumably give the exact
result asymptotically. The duality analysis, in conjunction with the
relationship between the multicritical point and the spin glass transition
point for the symmetric distribution function of randomness, leads to the
conclusion of the absence of a finite-temperature spin glass transition for the
case of symmetric distribution. The result is applicable to the random bond
Ising model with $\pm J$ or Gaussian distribution and the Potts gauge glass on
the square, triangular and hexagonal lattices as well as the random three-body
Ising model on the triangular and the Union-Jack lattices and the four
dimensional random plaquette gauge model. This conclusion is exact provided
that the replica method is valid and the asymptotic limit of the duality
analysis yields the exact location of the multicritical point
