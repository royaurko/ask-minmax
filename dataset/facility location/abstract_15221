In 2004, we established a Japan-Taiwan-China collaboration for GRB study in
the East-Asian region. This serves as a valuable addition to the world-wide
optical and infrared follow-up network, because the East-Asia region would
otherwise be blank. We have been carrying out imaging and spectroscopic
follow-up observations at Lulin (Taiwan), Kiso (Japan), WIDGET (Japan) and
Xinglong (China). From Xinglong and Kiso, we can locate candidates and obtain
early time spectra for afterglows. While WIDGET provides early time
observations before the burst, the high-time resolution for multi-band light
curves can be obtained at Lulin. With the data from these sites, we can obtain
detailed information about the light curve and redshift of GRBs, which are
important to understand the mechanism of the afterglows. Up to March 2005, ten
follow-up observations have been provided by this East-Asia cooperation. Two
optical afterglows were detected, GRB 040924 and GRB 041006. The results of the
two detected afterglows are reported in this article.
