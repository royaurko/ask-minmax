The present paper provides the details omitted from the more concise study
"On the zeros of Eisenstein series for $\Gamma_0^* (5)$ and $\Gamma_0^* (7)$."
  We locate almost all of the zeros of the Eisenstein series associated with
the Fricke groups of level 5 and 7 in their fundamental domains by applying and
extending the method of F. K. C. Rankin and H. P. F. Swinnerton-Dyer (1970). We
also use the arguments of some terms of the Eisenstein series in order to
improve existing error bounds.
