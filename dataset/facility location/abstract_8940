A tomographic method is described that makes it possible to follow the
propagation of shock waves across the photosphere of long-period variable
stars. The method relies on the correlation of the observed spectrum with
numerical masks probing layers of different atmospheric depths. The formation
depth of spectral lines is derived from synthetic spectra of non-variable red
giant stars. When applied to Mira stars around maximum light, the tomographic
masks reveal that the deepest photospheric layers are generally characterized
by blueshifted absorption lines (attesting their upward motion), whereas the
uppermost layers generally exhibit redshifted absorption lines (indicating
their infalling motion). Double absorption lines are found in intermediate
layers, where the shock front is located. At later phases, the shock front is
seen moving towards upper layers, until it leaves the photosphere.
