This paper discusses a vision based health monitoring system which would be
very easy in use and deployment. Elder and sick people who are not able to talk
or walk they are dependent on other human beings for their daily needs and need
continuous monitoring. The developed system provides facility to the sick or
elder person to describe his or her need to their caretaker in lingual
description by showing particular hand gesture with the developed system. This
system uses fingertip detection technique for gesture extraction and artificial
neural network for gesture classification and recognition. The system is able
to work in different light conditions and can be connected to different devices
to announce users need on a distant location.
