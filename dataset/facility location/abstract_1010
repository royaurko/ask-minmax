We estimate CP violation for several experimental facilities studying
neutrino oscillations. We also estimate the probability of $\nu_{\mu}$ to
$\nu_{e}$ conversion, using values of the parameter $\theta_{13}$ within the
known limits, in order to suggest new experiments to measure CP violation for
neutrinos moving in matter.
