We report theoretical and numerical evaluations of the phase diagram for a
model of patchy particles. Specifically we study hard-spheres whose surface is
decorated by a small number f of identical sites ("sticky spots'') interacting
via a short-range square-well attraction. We theoretically evaluate, solving
the Wertheim theory, the location of the critical point and the gas-liquid
coexistence line for several values of f and compare them to results of Gibbs
and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations. We study both ordered and
disordered arrangements of the sites on the hard-sphere surface and confirm
that patchiness has a strong effect on the phase diagram: the gas-liquid
coexistence region in the temperature-density plane is significantly reduced as
f decreases. We also theoretically evaluate the locus of specific heat maxima
and the percolation line.
