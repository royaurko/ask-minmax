Taking into account the drivers' state is a major challenge for designing new
advanced driver assistance systems. In this paper we present a driver
assistance system strongly coupled to the user. DAARIA 1 stands for Driver
Assistance by Augmented Reality for Intelligent Automobile. It is an augmented
reality interface powered by several sensors. The detection has two goals: one
is the position of obstacles and the quantification of the danger represented
by them. The other is the driver's behavior. A suitable visualization metaphor
allows the driver to perceive at any time the location of the relevant hazards
while keeping his eyes on the road. First results show that our method could be
applied to a vehicle but also to aerospace, fluvial or maritime navigation.
