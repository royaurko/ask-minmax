The mysterious high galactic latitude cometary globule CG12 has been observed
with the ACIS detector on board the Chandra X-ray Observatory. We detect 128
X-ray sources; half are likely young stars formed within the globule's head.
This new population of >50 T-Tauri stars and one new embedded protostar is far
larger than the previously reported few intermediate-mass and two protostellar
members of the cloud. Most of the newly discovered stars have masses 0.2-0.7Mo,
and 9-15% have K-band excesses from inner protoplanetary disks. X-ray
properties provide an independent distance estimate consistent with CG12's
unusual location >200pc above the Galactic plane. The star formation efficiency
in CG12 appears to be 15-35%, far above that seen in other triggered molecular
globules. The median photometric age found for the T-Tauri population is ~4Myr
with a large spread of <1-20Myr and ongoing star formation in the molecular
cores. The stellar age and spatial distributions are inconsistent with a simple
radiation driven implosion (RDI) model, and suggest either that CG12 is an
atypically large shocked globule, or it has been subject to several distinct
episodes of triggering and ablation. We report a previously unnoticed group of
B-type stars northwest of CG12 which may be the remnants of an OB association
which produced multiple supernova explosions that could have shocked and
ablated the cloud over a 15-30Myr period. HD120958 (B3e), the most luminous
member of the group, may be currently driving an RDI shock into the CG12 cloud.
