We have found the u -r color versus g -i color gradient space can be used for
highly successful morphology classification of galaxies in the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey. In this space galaxies form early and late type branches
well-separated from each other. The location of galaxies along the branches
reflects the degree and locality of star formation activity, and monotonically
corresponds to the sequence of morphological subclasses. When the concentration
index is used together, the completeness and reliability of classification
reaches about 91% for a training set of SDSS galaxies brighter than r~15.9. At
faintest magnitudes (r~17.5) of the SDSS spectroscopic sample, the performance
still remains at about 88%. The new classification scheme will help us find
accurate relations of galaxy morphology with spatial and temporal environments,
and help one understand the origin of morphology of galaxies.
