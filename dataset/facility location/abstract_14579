We present a comprehensive set of mock 2dF and SDSS galaxy redshift surveys
constructed from a set of large, high-resolution cosmological N-body
simulations. The radial selection functions and geometrical limits of the
catalogues mimic those of the genuine surveys. The catalogues span a wide range
of cosmologies, including both open and flat universes. In all the models the
galaxy distributions are biased so as to approximately reproduce the observed
galaxy correlation function on scales of 1--10 Mpc/h In some cases models with
a variety of different biasing prescriptions are included. All the mock
catalogues are publically available at
http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/~cole/mocks/main.html . We expect these catalogues to
be a valuable aid in the development of the new algorithms and statistics that
will be used to analyse the 2dF and SDSS surveys when they are completed in the
next few years. Mock catalogues of the PSCZ survey of IRAS galaxies are also
available at the same WWW location.
