An electron-proton/ion collider facility (eRHIC) is under consideration at
Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Such a new facility will require the
design and construction of a new optimized detector profiting from the world's
first ep collider facility HERA at DESY. The detailed design is closely coupled
to the design of the interaction region and thus to the machine development
work in general. Implications and constraints on the ep(A) interaction-region
design will be discussed.
