We study a coupling flow of pure QCD gauge system by using the Monte Carlo
Renormalization Group method. A rough location of the renormalized trajectory
in two coupling space is obtained. Also we compare 4 different actions;
(a)standard Wilson, (b)Symanzik's, (c)Iwasaki's and (d)QCDTARO's. The
rotational symmetry is restored better as an action gets close to the
renormalized trajectory.
