We propose a prescription to constrain the chiral effective model approach to
the QCD phase diagram using the thermal Statistical Model, which is a
description consistent with the experimental data at the freeze-out. In the
transition region where thermal quantities of hadrons blow up, deconfined
quarks and gluons should smoothly take over the degrees of freedom from hadrons
in the Statistical Model. We use the Polyakov-loop coupled Nambu--Jona-Lasinio
(PNJL) model as an effective description in the quark side. We require that the
validity regions of these descriptions should have an overlap on the phase
diagram, which constrains model uncertainty. Our results favor a phase diagram
with the chiral phase transition located at slightly higher temperature than
deconfinement.
