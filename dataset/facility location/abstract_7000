The resonant slow light structures created along a thin-walled optical
capillary by nanoscale deformation of its surface can perform comprehensive
simultaneous detection and manipulation of microfluidic components. This
concept is illustrated with a model of a 0.5 millimeter long 5 nm high
triangular bottle resonator created at a 50 micron radius silica capillary
containing floating microparticles. The developed theory shows that the
microparticle positions can be determined from the bottle resonator spectrum.
In addition, the microparticles can be driven and simultaneously positioned at
predetermined locations by the localized electromagnetic field created by the
optimized superposition of eigenstates of this resonator, thus, exhibiting a
multicomponent near field optical tweezers.
