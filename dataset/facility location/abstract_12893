Magnetorotational turbulence and magnetically driven disc winds are often
considered as separate processes. However, realistic astrophysical discs are
expected to be subject to both effects, although possibly at different times
and locations. We investigate here the potential link between these two
phenomena using a mixed numerical and analytical approach. We show in
particular that large-scale MRI modes which dominate strongly magnetised discs
(plasma beta~10) naturally produce magnetically driven outflows in the
nonlinear regime. We show that these outflows share many similarities with
local and global disc wind solutions found in the literature. We also
investigate the 3D stability of these outflows and show that they are unstable
on dynamical timescales. The implications of these results for the transition
between a jet-emitting disc and a standard "viscous" disc are discussed.
