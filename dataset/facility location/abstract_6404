Simulation of 'hybrid' superconductors of 3d-, 4d- and 5d-transition elements
consisting of two different superconducting fragments located between
positively charged ions planes - B'O2 oxide planes and B2C2 intermetallic
layers - has been performed on the basis of the structure of Sr2Mn3As2O2
(A2(B2C2)(B'O2)). The oxide planes are similar to those of CuO2 in
high-temperature superconducting cuprates while the intermetallic layers - to
those of Ni2B2 in low-temperature superconducting borocarbides RNi2B2C and
Fe2As2 layers in high-temperature superconducting oxypnictides RFeAsO1-xFx.
