The assumption that black hole accretion disks possess an untorqued inner
boundary, the so-called zero torque boundary condition, has been employed by
models of black hole disks for many years. However, recent theoretical and
observational work suggests that magnetic forces may appreciably torque the
inner disk. This raises the question of the effect that a time-changing
magnetic torque may have on the evolution of such a disk. In particular, we
explore the suggestion that the ``Deep Minimum State'' of the Seyfert galaxy
MCG--6-30-15 can be identified as a sporadic inner disk torquing event. This
suggestion is motivated by detailed analyses of changes in the profile of the
broad fluorescence iron line in XMM-Newton spectra. We find that the response
of such a disk to a torquing event has two phases; an initial damming of the
accretion flow together with a partial draining of the disk interior to the
torque location, followed by a replenishment of the inner disk as the system
achieves a new (torqued) steady-state. If the Deep Minimum State of
MCG--6-30-15 is indeed due to a sporadic torquing event, we show that the
fraction of the dissipated energy going into X-rays must be smaller in the
torqued state. We propose one such scenario in which Compton cooling of the
disk corona by ``returning radiation'' accompanying a central-torquing event
suppresses the 0.5-10 keV X-ray flux coming from all but the innermost regions
of the disk.
