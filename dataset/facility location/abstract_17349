Following two years of complete occultation of both stars by its opaque
circumbinary ring, the binary T Tauri star KH 15D has abruptly brightened again
during apastron phases, reaching I = 15 mag. Here, we show that the brightening
is accompanied by a change in spectral class from K6/K7 (the spectral class of
star A) to ~K1, and a bluing of the system in V-I by about 0.3 mag. A radial
velocity measurement confirms that, at apastron, we are now seeing direct light
from star B, which is more luminous and of earlier spectral class than star A.
Evidently, the trailing edge of the occulting screen has just become tangent to
one anse of star B's projected orbit. This confirms a prediction of the
precession models, supports the view that the tilted ring is self-gravitating,
and ushers in a new era of the system's evolution that should be accompanied by
the same kind of dramatic phenomena observed from 1995-2009. It also promotes
KH 15D from a single-lined to a double-lined eclipsing binary, greatly
enhancing its value for testing pre-main sequence models. The results of our
study strengthen the case for truncation of the outer ring at around 4 AU by a
sub-stellar object such as an extremely young giant planet. The system is
currently at an optimal configuration for detecting the putative planet and we
urge expedient follow-up observations.
