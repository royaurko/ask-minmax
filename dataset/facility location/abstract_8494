We report the serendipitous discovery of a large HI cloud with an associated
HI mass of $6(\pm1.5)\times 10^9 h^{-2}$ M$_\odot$ and a heliocentric velocity
8800 \kms, located near the periphery of the cluster of galaxies Abell 2634.
Its velocity field appears to be very quiescent, as no gradients in the peak
velocity are seen over its extent of 143$ h^{-1}$ by 103$ h^{-1}$ kpc. The
distribution of gas is poorly resolved spatially, and it is thus difficult at
this time to ascertain the nature of the cloud. At least two relatively small,
actively star--forming galaxies appear to be embedded in the HI gas, which may
(a) be an extended gaseous envelope surrounding one or both galaxies, (b) have
been spread over a large region by a severe episode of tidal disruption or (c)
have been affected by the ram pressure resulting from its motion through the
intracluster gas of A2634.
