We report on the design, construction, commissioning, and performance of a
threshold gas \v{C}erenkov counter in an open configuration, which operates in
a high luminosity environment and produces a high photo-electron yield. Part of
a unique open geometry detector package known as the Big Electron Telescope
Array, this \v{C}erenkov counter served to identify scattered electrons and
reject produced pions in an inclusive scattering experiment known as the Spin
Asymmetries of the Nucleon Experiment E07-003 at the Thomas Jefferson National
Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) also known as Jefferson Lab. The experiment
consisted of a measurement of double spin asymmetries $A_{\parallel}$ and
$A_{\perp}$ of a polarized electron beam impinging on a polarized ammonia
target. The \v{C}erenkov counter's performance is characterised by a yield of
about 20 photoelectrons per electron or positron track. Thanks to this large
number of photoelectrons per track, the \v{C}erenkov counter had enough
resolution to identify electron-positron pairs from the conversion of photons
resulting mainly from $\pi^0$ decays.
