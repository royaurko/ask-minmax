We quantitatively describe the competition between the thermal fluctuations
and the disorder using the Ginzburg -- Landau approach. Flux line lattice in
type II superconductors undergoes a transition into three "disordered" phases:
vortex liquid (not pinned), homogeneous vortex glass (pinned) and crystalline
Bragg glass (pinned) due to both thermal fluctuations and random quenched
disorder. We show that disordered Ginzburg -- Landau model (valid not very far
from H_{c2}) in which only the coefficient of a term quadratic in order
parameter psi is random first considered by Dorsey, Fisher and Huang leads to a
state with nonzero Edwards -- Anderson order parameter, but this state is still
replica symmetric. However when the coefficient of the quartic term psi^4 in GL
free energy also has a random component, replica symmetry breaking effects
appear. The location of the glass transition line in 3D materials is determined
and compared to experiments. The line is clearly different from both the
melting line and the second peak line describing the translational and
rotational symmetry breaking at high and low temperatures respectively. The
phase diagram is therefore separated by two lines into four phases mentioned
above.
