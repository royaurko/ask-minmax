We have performed deep, wide-field imaging on a ~0.4 deg^2 field in the
Pleiades (Melotte 22). The selected field was not yet target of a deep search
for low mass stars and brown dwarfs. Our limiting magnitudes are R ~ 22mag and
I ~ 20mag, sufficient to detect brown dwarf candidates down to 40MJ. We found
197 objects, whose location in the (I, R - I) color magnitude diagram is
consistent with the age and the distance of the Pleiades. Using CTK R and I as
well as JHK photometry from our data and the 2MASS survey we were able to
identify 7 new brown dwarf candidates. We present our data reduction technique,
which enables us to resample, calibrate, and co-add many images by just two
steps. We estimate the interstellar extinction and the spectral type from our
optical and the NIR data using a two-dimensional chi^22 fitting.
