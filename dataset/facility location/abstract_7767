Optical alignment and testing of the Integrated Science Instrument Module of
the James Webb Space Telescope is underway. We describe the Optical Telescope
Element Simulator used to feed the science instruments with point images of
precisely known location and chief ray pointing, at appropriate wavelengths and
flux levels, in vacuum and at operating temperature. The simulator's
capabilities include a number of devices for in situ monitoring of source flux,
wavefront error, pupil illumination, image position and chief ray angle. Taken
together, these functions become a fascinating example of how the first order
properties and constructs of an optical design (coordinate systems, image
surface and pupil location) acquire measurable meaning in a real system. We
illustrate these functions with experimental data, and describe the ray tracing
system used to provide both pointing control during operation and analysis
support subsequently. Prescription management takes the form of optimization
and fitting. Our core tools employ a matrix/vector ray tracing model which
proves broadly useful in optical engineering problems. We spell out its
mathematical basis, and illustrate its use in ray tracing plane mirror systems
relevant to optical metrology such as a pentaprism and corner cube.
