The search for neutrinoless double-beta decay (0{\nu}{\beta}{\beta}) requires
extremely low background and a good understanding of their sources and their
influence on the rate in the region of parameter space relevant to the
0{\nu}{\beta}{\beta} signal. We report on studies of various {\beta}- and
{\gamma}-backgrounds in the liquid- xenon-based EXO-200 0{\nu}{\beta}{\beta}
experiment. With this work we try to better understand the location and
strength of specific background sources and compare the conclusions to
radioassay results taken before and during detector construction. Finally, we
discuss the implications of these studies for EXO-200 as well as for the
next-generation, tonne-scale nEXO detector.
