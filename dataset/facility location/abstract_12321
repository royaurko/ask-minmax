We report an external cavity diode laser (ECDL), using a diode whose front
facet is not antireflection (AR) coated, that has a mode-hop-free (MHF) tuning
range greater than 135 GHz. We achieved this using a short external cavity and
by simultaneously tuning the internal and external modes of the laser. We find
that the precise location of the pivot point of the grating in our laser is
less critical than commonly believed. The general applicability of the method,
combined with the compact portable mechanical and electronic design, makes it
well suited for both research and industrial applications.
