We present spectroscopic measurements of the 23 new candidate members of the
TW Hydrae Association from Makarov & Fabricius (2000). Based on Halpha and Li
6708 A strengths together with location on a color-magnitude diagram for
Hipparcos TWA candidates, we found only three possible new members (TYC
7760-0835-1, TYC 8238-1462-1, and TYC 8234-2856-1) in addition to the already
known member, TWA 19. This eliminated most of the candidates more distant than
100 pc. Three Tycho stars, almost certainly members of the Lower Centaurus Crux
association, are the most distant members of the TWA. A claim of isotropic
expansion of TWA has to be re-evaluated based on our new results. Generally,
one cannot identify new members of a diffuse nearby stellar group based solely
on kinematic data. To eliminate interlopers with similar kinematics,
spectroscopic verification is essential.
