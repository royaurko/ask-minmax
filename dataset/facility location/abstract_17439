We study the three dimensional SU(2)-symmetric noncompact CP1 model, with two
charged matter fields coupled minimally to a noncompact Abelian gauge-field.
The phase diagram and the nature of the phase transitions in this model have
attracted much interest after it was proposed to describe an unusual continuous
transition associated with deconfinement of spinons. Previously, it has been
demonstrated for various two-component gauge theories that weakly first-order
transitions may appear as continuous ones of a new universality class in
simulations of relatively large, but finite systems. We have performed
Monte-Carlo calculations on substantially larger systems sizes than those in
previous works. We find that in some area of the phase diagram where at finite
sizes one gets signatures consistent with a single first-order transition, in
fact there is a sequence of two phase transitions with an O(3) paired phase
sandwiched in between. We report (i) a new estimate for the location of a
bicritical point and (ii) the first resolution of bimodal distributions in
energy histograms at relatively low coupling strengths. We perform a flowgram
analysis of the direct transition line with rescaling of the linear system size
in order to obtain a data collapse. The data collapses up to coupling constants
where we find bimodal distributions in energy histograms.
