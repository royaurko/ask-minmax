The internal gravity waves of low frequency which are emitted at the base of
the solar convection zone are able to extract angular momentum from the
radiative interior. We evaluate this transport with some simplifying
assumptions: we ignore the Coriolis force, approximate the spectrum of
turbulent convection by the Kolmogorov law, and couple this turbulence to the
internal waves through their pressure fluctuations, following Press (1981) and
Garcia Lopez & Spruit (1991). The local frequency of an internal wave varies
with depth in a differentially rotating star, and it can vanish at some
location, thus leading to enhanced damping (Goldreich & Nicholson 1989). It is
this dissipation mechanism only that we take into account in the exchange of
momentum between waves and stellar rotation. The flux of angular momentum is
then an implicit function of depth, involving the local rotation rate and an
integral representing the cumulative effect of radiative dissipation. We find
that the efficiency of this transport process is rather high: it operates on a
timescale of 10^7 years, and is probably responsible for the flat rotation
profile which has been detected through helioseismology.
