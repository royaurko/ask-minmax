We report the detection of 15 X-ray bursts with RXTE and Swift observations
of the peculiar X-ray binary Circinus X-1 during its May 2010 X-ray
re-brightening. These are the first X-ray bursts observed from the source after
the initial discovery by Tennant and collaborators, twenty-five years ago. By
studying their spectral evolution, we firmly identify nine of the bursts as
type I (thermonuclear) X-ray bursts. We obtain an arcsecond location of the
bursts that confirms once and for all the identification of Cir X-1 as a type I
X-ray burst source, and therefore as a low magnetic field accreting neutron
star. The first five bursts observed by RXTE are weak and show approximately
symmetric light curves, without detectable signs of cooling along the burst
decay. We discuss their possible nature. Finally, we explore a scenario to
explain why Cir X-1 shows thermonuclear bursts now but not in the past, when it
was extensively observed and accreting at a similar rate.
