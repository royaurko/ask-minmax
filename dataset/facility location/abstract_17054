We present broad band photometry and photometric redshifts for 187611 sources
located in ~0.5deg^2 in the Lockman Hole area. The catalog includes 389 X-ray
detected sources identified with the very deep XMM-Newton observations
available for an area of 0.2 deg^2. The source detection was performed on the
Rc, z' and B band images and the available photometry is spanning from the far
ultraviolet to the mid infrared, reaching in the best case scenario 21 bands.
Astrometry corrections and photometric cross-calibrations over the entire
dataset allowed the computation of accurate photometric redshifts. Special
treatment is undertaken for the X-ray sources, the majority of which is active
galactic nuclei. Comparing the photometric redshifts to the available
spectroscopic redshifts we achieve for normal galaxies an accuracy of
\sigma_{\Delta z/(1+z)}=0.036, with 12.7% outliers, while for the X-ray
detected sources the accuracy is \sigma_{\Delta z/(1+z)}=0.069, with 18.3%
outliers, where the outliers are defined as sources with
|z_{phot}-z_{spec}|>0.15 (1+z_{spec})}. These results are a significant
improvement over the previously available photometric redshifts for normal
galaxies in the Lockman Hole, while it is the first time that photometric
redshifts are computed and made public for AGN for this field.
