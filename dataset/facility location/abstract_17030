The mechanically oscillating, due to tidal forces, lithosperic plate
activates, because of its high content in quartzite, the generation of a
piezoelectric field. Due to the same mechanical oscillation the lithosphere is
generally at a state of an oscillating stress load. Therefore, large EQs which
occur at the peaks of the stress load must coincide with the peaks of the
generated piezoelectric potential. In this work a physical mechanism is
postulated that accounts for the latter hypothesis. The postulated model is
statistically tested by comparing the time of occurrence of 280 large EQs
(Ms>5.0R) which occurred during the period from 2003 to 2011, to the same
period of time Earth's electric field registered at ATH (Athens) and PYR
(Pyrgos) monitoring sites located in Greece. The comparison has been made for
the oscillating component of T = 1 day and for both the E - W and N - S
directions. The statistical results indicate that the postulated model does not
behave randomly. Instead, it represents a smooth normal distribution which
peaks on the zero deviation in time between the time of occurrence of the large
EQs and the amplitude peaks of the Earth's oscillating electric field.
Therefore, the proposed physical model is an acceptable one and can be used for
the finer refinement of the prediction of the occurrence time of a large EQ
within a day's time period.
