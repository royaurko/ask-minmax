We apply adaptive sensing techniques to the problem of locating sparse
metallic scatterers using high-resolution, frequency modulated continuous wave
W-band RADAR. Using a single detector, a frequency stepped source, and a
lateral translation stage, inverse synthetic aperture RADAR reconstruction
techniques are used to search for one or two wire scatterers within a specified
range, while an adaptive algorithm determined successive sampling locations.
The two-dimensional location of each scatterer is thereby identified with
sub-wavelength accuracy in as few as 1/4 the number of lateral steps required
for a simple raster scan. The implications of applying this approach to more
complex scattering geometries are explored in light of the various assumptions
made.
