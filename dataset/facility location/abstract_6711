In this paper, we propose a procedure that given an integer reset timed
automaton (IRTA) ${\cal A}$, produces a language equivalent deterministic one
clock IRTA ${\cal B}$ whose size is at most doubly exponential in the size of
${\cal A}$. We prove that this bound on the number of locations is tight.
Further, if integer resets are used in stopwatch automata, a subclass of
stopwatch automata which is closed under all boolean operations and for which
reachability is decidable is obtained.
