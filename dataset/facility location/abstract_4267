A class of nonlinear Schroedinger equations with critical
power-nonlinearities and potentials exhibiting multiple anisotropic inverse
square singularities is investigated. Conditions on strength, location, and
orientation of singularities are given for the minimum of the associated
Rayleigh quotient to be achieved, both in the whole $\R^N$ and in bounded
domains.
