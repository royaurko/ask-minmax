One of the important microlensing applications to stellar atmospheres is the
study of spots on stellar surface provided by the high resolution of
caustic-crossing binary-lens events. In this paper, we investigate the
characteristics of spot-induced perturbations in microlensing light curves and
explain the physical background of the characteristics. We explore the
variation of the spot-induced perturbations depending on various parameters
characterizing the spot and investigate how well these parameters can be
retrieved from observations in high-cadence future lensing surveys. From this,
we find that although it would not be easy to precisely constrain the shape and
the surface brightness contrast, the size and location of the spot on the
stellar surface can be fairly well constrained from the analysis of lensing
light curves.
