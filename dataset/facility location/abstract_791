We report the results of the working group on ``Pion (Kaon) and Sigma
Polarizabilities''. Interesting possibilities to measure these polarizabilities
include the radiative pion photoproduction in the MAMI experiment at Mainz, as
well as at the GRAAL facility (actually the latter is being considered for an
experimental determination of the pion polarizabilities here for the first
time), the experimental plans on Primakoff effect at FNAL, and the measurements
at the Frascati $\Phi$-factory DA$\Phi$NE.
