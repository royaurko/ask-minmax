The nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 7213 has been imaged in H-alpha and HI with the
CTIO 1.5 m telescope and with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA),
respectively. Optically NGC 7213 looks undisturbed and relatively featureless
but the continuum-subtracted H-alpha image shows a 19 kpc long filament located
approximately 18.6 kpc from the nucleus. The H-alpha filament could be neutral
gas photo-ionized by the active nucleus, as has been suggested for the Seyfert
galaxy NGC 5252, or shock-ionized by a jet interacting with the surrounding HI,
as has been suggested for the radio galaxy PKS 2240-41. The HI map reveals NGC
7213 to be a highly disturbed system suggesting a past merging event.
