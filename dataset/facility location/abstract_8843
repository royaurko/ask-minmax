Multi-object spectroscopic observations of blue supergiants in NGC 3621, a
spiral galaxy at a distance of 6.7 Mpc, carried out with the ESO VLT and FORS
are presented. We demonstrate the feasibility of quantitative stellar
spectroscopy at distances approaching a ten-fold increase over previous
investigations by determining chemical composition, stellar parameters,
reddening, extinction and wind properties of one of our targets, a supergiant
of spectral type A1 Ia located in the outskirts of NGC 3621. The metallicity
(determined from iron group elements) is reduced by a factor of two relative to
the sun in qualitative agreement with results from previous abundance studies
based on H II region oxygen emission lines. Reddening and extinction are E(B-V)
= 0.12 and Av = 0.37, respectively, mostly caused by the galactic foreground.
Comparing stellar wind momentum and absolute V magnitude with galactic and M31
counterparts we confirm the potential of the wind momentum-luminosity
relationship as an alternative tool to estimate extragalactic distances.
