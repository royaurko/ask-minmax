We have identified counterparts to two submillimeter (submm) sources, SMM
J09429+4659 and SMM J09431+4700, seen through the core of the z=0.41 cluster
Abell 851. We employ deep 1.4-GHz observations and the far-infrared/radio
correlation to refine the submm positions and then optical and near-infrared
imaging to locate their counterparts. We identify an extremely red counterpart
to SMM J09429+4659, while GMOS spectroscopy with Gemini-North shows that the
R=23.8 radio source identified with SMM J09431+4700 is a hyperluminous infrared
galaxy (L_FIR~1.5x10^13 L_sun) at z=3.35, the highest spectroscopic redshift so
far for a galaxy discovered in the submm. The emission line properties of this
galaxy are characteristic of a narrow-line Seyfert-1, although the lack of
detected X-ray emission in a deep XMM-Newton observation suggests that the bulk
of the luminosity of this galaxy is derived from massive star formation. We
suggest that active nuclei, and the outflows they engender, may be an important
part of the evolution of the brightest submm galaxies at high redshifts.
