By means of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group technique, we accurately
determine the zero-temperature phase diagram of the one-dimensional extended
Bose Hubbard model with on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions. We analyze
the scaling of the charge and of the neutral ground-state energy gaps, as well
as of various order parameters. In this way we come to an accurate location of
the boundaries between the superfluid and the insulating phases. In this last
region we are able to distinguish between the conventional Mott insulating and
density-wave phases, and the Haldane Insulator phase displaying long-range
string ordering, as originally predicted by E.G. Dalla Torre, E. Berg and E.
Altman in Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 260401 (2006).
