We report the discovery of a planetary system from observation of the
high-magnification microlensing event OGLE-2012-BLG-0026. The lensing light
curve exhibits a complex central perturbation with multiple features. We find
that the perturbation was produced by two planets located near the Einstein
ring of the planet host star. We identify 4 possible solutions resulting from
the well-known close/wide degeneracy. By measuring both the lens parallax and
the Einstein radius, we estimate the physical parameters of the planetary
system. According to the best-fit model, the two planet masses are ~0.11
M_Jupiter and 0.68 M_Jupiter and they are orbiting a G-type main sequence star
with a mass ~0.82 M_Sun. The projected separations of the individual planets
are beyond the snow line in all four solutions, being ~3.8 AU and 4.6 AU in the
best-fit solution. The deprojected separations are both individually larger and
possibly reversed in order. This is the second multi-planet system with both
planets beyond the snow line discovered by microlensing. This is the only such
a system (other than the Solar System) with measured planet masses without
sin(i) degeneracy. The planetary system is located at a distance 4.1 kpc from
the Earth toward the Galactic center. It is very likely that extra light from
stars other than the lensed star comes from the lens itself. If this is
correct, it will be possible to obtain detailed information about the
planet-host star from follow-up observation.
