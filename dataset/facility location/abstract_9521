We present a quantitative comparison between the Horizontal Branch morphology
in the core of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr) and in a wide
field sampling a portion of its tidal stream (Sgr Stream), located tens of kpc
away from the center of the parent galaxy. We find that the Blue Horizontal
Branch (BHB) stars in that part of the Stream are five times more abundant than
in the Sgr core, relative to Red Clump stars. The difference in the ratio of
BHB to RC stars between the two fields is significant at the 4.8 sigma level.
This indicates that the old and metal-poor population of Sgr was preferentially
stripped from the galaxy in past peri-Galactic passages with respect to the
intermediate-age metal rich population that presently dominates the bound core
of Sgr, probably due to a strong radial gradient that was settled within the
galaxy before its disruption. The technique adopted in the present study allows
to trace population gradients along the whole extension of the Stream.
