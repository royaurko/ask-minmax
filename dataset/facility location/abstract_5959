Magnetoresistance measurements on the magnetic semiconductor (In,Mn)Sb
suggest that magnetic scattering in this material is dominated by isolated
Mn$^{2+}$ ions located outside the ferromagnetically-ordered regions when the
system is below $T_{c}$. A model is proposed, based on the $p$-$d$ exchange
between spin-polarized charge carriers and localized Mn$^{2+}$ ions, which
accounts for the observed behavior both below and above the ferromagnetic phase
transition. The suggested picture is further verified by high-pressure
experiments, in which the degree of magnetic interaction can be varied in a
controlled way.
