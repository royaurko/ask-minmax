Motivated by the discovery of superconductivity in F-doped LaFeAsO, we
investigated the magnetic fluctuations in a related compound Fe(Se1-xTex)0.92
(x = 0.75, 1) using neutron scattering techniques. Non-superconducting FeTe0.92
shows antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering with the ordering vector |Q| = 0.97 A-1
(Q = (0.5,0,0.5)) at TN ~ 70 K and a structural transition between tetragonal
and monoclinic phases. In the AF monoclinic phase, the low-energy spectral
weight is suppressed, indicating a possible gap formation. On the other hand,
in the paramagnetic tetragonal phase, we observed a pronounced magnetic
fluctuation around at |Q| ~ 0.92 A-1, which is slightly smaller than the
commensurate value. In Fe(Se0.25Te0.75)0.92, which does not show magnetic
ordering and shows superconductivity at Tc ~ 8 K, we observed that a magnetic
fluctuation is located at |Q| ~ 0.9 A-1 at low energies and shifts to a higher
value of |Q| ~ 1.2 A-1 at higher energies. The latter value is close to a
reciprocal lattice vector Q = (0.5,0.5,0.5) or (0.5,0.5,0), where the AF
fluctuations are observed in other FeAs-based materials. The existence of this
common characteristic in different Fe-based superconductors suggests that the
AF fluctuations may play a important role in superconductivity.
