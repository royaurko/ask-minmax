As Lyman-alpha photons are scattered by neutral hydrogen, a change with
redshift in the Lyman-alpha equivalent width distribution of distant galaxies
offers a promising probe of the degree of ionization in the intergalactic
medium and hence when cosmic reionization ended. This simple test is
complicated by the fact that Lyman-alpha emission can also be affected by the
evolving astrophysical details of the host galaxies. In the first paper in this
series, we demonstrated both a luminosity and redshift dependent trend in the
fraction of Lyman-alpha emitters seen within color-selected Lyman-break
galaxies (LBGs) over the range 3<z<6; lower luminosity galaxies and those at
higher redshift show an increased likelihood of strong emission. Here we
present the results from much deeper 12.5 hour exposures with the Keck DEIMOS
spectrograph focused primarily on LBGs at z~6 which enable us to confirm the
redshift dependence of line emission more robustly and to higher redshift than
was hitherto possible. We find 54+/-11% of faint z~6 LBGs show strong (W_0>25
A) emission, an increase of 1.6x from a similar sample observed at z~4. With a
total sample of 74 z~6 LBGs, we determine the luminosity-dependent Lyman-alpha
equivalent width distribution. Assuming continuity in these trends to the new
population of z~7 sources located with the Hubble WFC3/IR camera, we predict
that unless the neutral fraction rises in the intervening 200 Myr, the success
rate for spectroscopic confirmation using Lyman-alpha emission should be high.
