Using angle-resolved photoemission, we have investigated the development of
the electronic structure and the Fermi level pinnning in Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$As
with Mn concentrations in the range 1--6%. We find that the Mn-induced changes
in the valence-band spectra depend strongly on the Mn concentration, suggesting
that the interaction between the Mn ions is more complex than assumed in
earlier studies. The relative position of the Fermi level is also found to be
concentration-dependent. In particular we find that for concentrations around
3.5--5% it is located very close to the valence-band maximum, which is in the
range where metallic conductivity has been reported in earlier studies. For
concentration outside this range, larger as well as smaller, the Fermi level is
found to be pinned at about 0.15 eV higher energy.
