Coherent Lambda pi- production on Pb of 600 GeV Sigma- hyperons has been
studied with the SELEX facility at Fermilab. Using the Primakoff formalism, we
set a 90% CL upper limit on the radiative decay width Gamma [Sigma(1385)- -->
Sigma- gamma] < 9.5 keV, and estimate the cross section for gamma Sigma- -->
Lambda pi- at sqrt(s) = 1.385 GeV to be 56+/-16 mkb.
