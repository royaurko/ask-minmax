We report on the discovery of a fourth component in the HD 221356 star
system, previously known to be formed by an F8V, slightly metal-poor primary
([Fe/H]=-0.26), and a distant M8V+L3V pair. In our ongoing common proper motion
search based on VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS) and 2MASS catalogues, we have
detected a faint (J=13.76+/-0.04 mag) co-moving companion of the F8 star
located at angular separation of 12.13+/-0.18 arcsec (position angle of
221.8+/-1.7), corresponding to a projected distance of ~312 AU at 26 pc.
Near-infrared spectroscopy of the new companion, covering the 1.5-2.4 micron
wavelength range with a resolving power of R~600, indicates an L1+/-1 spectral
type. Using evolutionary models the mass of the new companion is estimated at
~0.08 solar masses, which places the object close to the stellar-substellar
borderline. This multiple system provides an interesting example of objects
with masses slightly above and below the hydrogen burning mass limit. The low
mass companions of HD 221356 have slightly bluer colours than field dwarfs with
similar spectral type, which is likely a consequence of the sub-solar
metallicity of the system.
