Our discovery of two new satellites of Pluto, designated S/2005 P 1 and
S/2005 P 2 (henceforth, P1 and P2), combined with the constraints on the
absence of more distant satellites of Pluto, reveal that Pluto and its moons
comprise an unusual, highly compact, quadruple system. The two newly discovered
satellites of Pluto have masses that are very small compared to both Pluto and
Charon, creating a striking planet-satellite system architecture. These facts
naturally raise the question of how this puzzling satellite system came to be.
Here we show that P1 and P2's proximity to Pluto and Charon, along with their
apparent locations in high-order mean-motion resonances, likely result from
their being constructed from Plutonian collisional ejecta. We argue that
variable optical depth dust-ice rings form sporadically in the Pluto system,
and that rich satellite systems may be found, perhaps frequently, around other
large Kuiper Belt objects.
