The MACRO detector is located in the Gran Sasso Laboratory. MACRO's
overburden varies from 3150 to 7000 hg/cm^2. A transition radiation detector
(TRD) has been added to the MACRO detector in order to measure the residual
energy of muons entering MACRO, i.e. the energy they have after passing through
the Gran Sasso's rock overburden. The TRD consists of three identical modules
with a total horizontal area of 36 m^2. The results presented here are referred
to single and double events in MACRO with one muon crossing one of the TRD
modules. Our data show that double muons are more energetic than single ones,
as predicted by the interaction models of primary cosmic rays with the
atmosphere.
