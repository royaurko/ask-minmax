The structural and elastic properties of diamond nanocomposites and
ultrananocrystalline diamond films (UNCD) are investigated using both empirical
potentials and tight binding schemes. We find that both materials are extremely
hard, but their superb diamondlike properties are limited by their sp^2
component. In diamond composites, the sp^2 atoms are found in the matrix and
far from the interface with the inclusion, and they are responsible for the
softening of the material. In UNCD, the sp^2 atoms are located in the grain
boundaries. They offer relaxation mechanisms which relieve the strain but, on
the other hand, impose deformations that lead to softening. The higher the sp^2
component the less rigid these materials are.
