We present an analysis of mock spectral observation of warm-hot intergalactic
medium (WHIM) using a constrained simulation of the local universe. The
simulated map of oxygen emission lines from local WHIM reproduces well the
observed structures traced by galaxies in the real local universe. We further
attempt to perform mock observations of outer parts of simulated Coma cluster
and A3627 adopting the expected performance of DIOS (Diffuse Intergalactic
Oxygen Surveyor), which is proposed as a dedicated soft X-ray mission to search
for cosmic missing baryons. We find that WHIMs surrounding nearby clusters are
detectable with a typical exposure time of a day, and thus constitute realistic
and promising targets for DIOS. We also find that an X-ray emitting clump in
front of Coma cluster, recently reported in the XMM-Newton observation, has a
counterpart in the simulated local universe, and its observed spectrum can be
well reproduced in the simulated local universe if the gas temperature is set
to the observationally estimated value.
