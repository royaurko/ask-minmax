A Suzaku X-ray observation of NGC 4051 taken during 2005 Nov reveals line
emission at 5.44 keV in the rest-frame of the galaxy which does not have an
obvious origin in known rest-frame atomic transitions. The improvement to the
fit statistic when this line is accounted for establishes its reality at >99.9%
confidence: we have also verified that the line is detected in the three XIS
units independently. Comparison between the data and Monte Carlo simulations
shows that the probability of the line being a statistical fluctuation is p <
3.3 x 10^-4. Consideration of three independent line detections in Suzaku data
taken at different epochs yields a probability p< 3 x 10^-11 and thus
conclusively demonstrates that it cannot be a statistical fluctuation in the
data. The new line and a strong component of Fe Ka emission from neutral
material are prominent when the source flux is low, during 2005. Spectra from
2008 show evidence for a line consistent with having the same flux and energy
as that observed during 2005, but inconsistent with having a constant
equivalent width against the observed continuum. The stability of the line flux
and energy suggests that it may not arise in transient hotspots, as has been
suggested for similar lines in other sources, but could arise from a special
location in the reprocessor, such as the inner edge of the accretion disk.
Alternatively, the line energy may be explained by spallation of Fe into Cr, as
discussed in a companion paper.
