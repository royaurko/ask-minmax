I investigate numerically the phase transitions of two-component
generalizations of binary spreading processes in one dimension. In these models
pair annihilation: AA->0, BB->0, explicit particle diffusion and binary pair
production processes compete with each other. Several versions with spatially
different productions have been explored and shown that for the cases: 2A->3A,
2B->3B and 2A->2AB, 2B->2BA a phase transition occurs at zero production rate
($\sigma=0$), that belongs to the class of N-component, asymmetric branching
and annihilating random walks, characterized by the order parameter exponent
$\beta=2$. In the model with particle production: AB->ABA, BA-> BAB a phase
transition point can be located at $\sigma_c=0.3253$ that belongs to the class
of the one-component binary spreading processes.
