We investigate the star formation history and chemical evolution of low
surface brightness (LSB) disk galaxies by modelling their observed
spectro-photometric and chemical properties using a galactic chemical and
photometric evolution model incorporating a detailed metallicity depen dent set
of stellar input data. For a large fraction of the LSB galaxies in our sample,
observed properties are best explained by models incorporating an exponentially
decreasing global star formation rate (SFR) ending at a present-day gas
fraction (M_{gas}/(M_{gas}+M_{stars}) = 0.5 for a galaxy age of 14 Gyr. For
some galaxies small amplitude star formation bursts are required to explain the
contribution of the young (5-50 Myr old) stellar population to the galaxy
integrated luminosity. This suggests that star formation has proceeded in a
stochastic manner.
  The presence of an old stellar population in many late-type LSB galaxies
suggests that LSB galaxies roughly follow the same evolutionary history as HSB
galaxies, except at a much lower rate. In particular, our results imply that
LSB galaxies do not form late, nor have a delayed onset of star formation, but
simply evolve slowly.
