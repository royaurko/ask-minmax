For 117 clusters of galaxies, we explore the detectability of intracluster
dust grains by current and future infrared facilities, taking into account both
collisional heating and sputtering of grains by ambient plasma. If the dust
grains are injected into the intergalactic space with the amount and size
comparable to the Galactic values, the dust-to-gas ratio is typically $10^{-6}$
and the mean dust temperature is $\sim 30$ K near the cluster center. The
predicted infrared intensities lie marginally above the detection thresholds
for Spitzer Space Telescope, ASTRO-F, Herschel and SPICA missions. For some
nearby clusters such as Perseus, A3571, A2319, A3112 and A2204, good detections
of intracluster dust signal are expected in the 70 $\mu$m band. Given rather
tight constraints on the dust temperature from observed electron density and
temperature, the dust mass can be inferred directly from the infrared
observations. Further constraints on the size distribution will be obtained
once multi-band data are available. They will definitely provide a powerful
probe of the dust injection processes and dust-gas interactions in the
intergalactic space.
