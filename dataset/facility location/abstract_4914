Consider a dynamical system given by a planar differential equation, which
exhibits an unstable periodic orbit surrounding a stable periodic orbit. It is
known that under random perturbations, the distribution of locations where the
system's first exit from the interior of the unstable orbit occurs, typically
displays the phenomenon of cycling: The distribution of first-exit locations is
translated along the unstable periodic orbit proportionally to the logarithm of
the noise intensity as the noise intensity goes to zero. We show that for a
large class of such systems, the cycling profile is given, up to a
model-dependent change of coordinates, by a universal function given by a
periodicised Gumbel distribution. Our techniques combine action-functional or
large-deviation results with properties of random Poincar\'e maps described by
continuous-space discrete-time Markov chains.
