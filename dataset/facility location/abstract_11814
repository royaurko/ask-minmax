The MAGIC telescopes are two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes located
on the canary island of La Palma. They provide the lowest energy threshold
among existing instruments of the kind, reaching down to 50 GeV in standard
trigger mode. This allows us to close the energy gap between satellite-bourne
and ground-based gamma-ray observations for strong enough sources. During the
first five years of monoscopic observations, many interesting results could
thus be achieved. With the second MAGIC telescope, which started operation in
2009, the sensitivity could be improved by stereoscopic imaging, and 5 new
detections could already be reported in 2010. We present the status of the
MAGIC telescopes in 2010 and review the latest results obtained in mono- and
stereoscopic mode. This includes, among others, the detection of the head-tail
galaxy IC 310, a new multiwavelength study of Mrk 501, an updated lightcurve of
the Crab Pulsar.
