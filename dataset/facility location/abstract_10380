We give a proof of the recently proposed formula for the dyon spectrum in CHL
string theories by mapping it to a configuration of D1 and D5-branes and
Kaluza-Klein monopole. We also give a prescription for computing the degeneracy
as a systematic expansion in inverse powers of charges. The computation can be
formulated as a problem of extremizing a duality invariant statistical entropy
function whose value at the extremum gives the logarithm of the degeneracy.
During this analysis we also determine the locations of the zeroes and poles of
the Siegel modular forms whose inverse give the dyon partition function in the
CHL models.
