The calculation of D-wave charmonium prodution rates in B meson deacys under
the NRQCD factorization formalism is presented. We find that inclusion of the
color-octet contributions permits us to detect the D-wave charmonium states in
B decays at present experimental facilities. The same amount signals of 2^{--}
D-wave state as that of \psi' could be observed at LEP and CESR. We also
predict the relative production rates for four D-wave states are
\delta^c:\delta^c_1: \delta^c_2:\delta^c_3=2.5:3:5:7, where \delta^c,
\delta^c_1, \delta^c_2, \delta^c_3 represent respectively the 2^{-+}, 1^{--},
2^{--}, 3^{--} states.
