The MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR is an array of natural and enriched high purity
germanium detectors that will search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay of
76-Ge and perform a search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs)
with masses below 10 GeV. As part of the MAJORANA research and development
efforts, we have deployed a modified, low-background broad energy germanium
detector at the Kimballton Underground Research Facility. With its sub-keV
energy threshold, this detector is sensitive to potential non-Standard Model
physics, including interactions with WIMPs. We discuss the backgrounds present
in the WIMP region of interest and explore the impact of slow surface event
contamination when searching for a WIMP signal.
