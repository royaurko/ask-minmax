We report on the discovery of a high velocity B star, HD 69686. We estimate
its space velocity, distance, surface temperature, gravity, and age. With these
data, we are able to reconstruct the trajectory of the star and to trace it
back to its birthplace. We use evolutionary tracks for single stars to estimate
that HD 69686 was born 73 Myr ago in the outer part of our Galaxy ($r \sim 12$
kpc) at a position well below the Galactic plane ($z \sim -1.8$ kpc), a very
unusual birthplace for a B star. Along the star's projected path in the sky, we
also find about 12 other stars having similar proper motions, and their
photometry data suggest that they are located at the same distance as HD 69686
and probably have the same age. We speculate on the origin of this group by
star formation in a high velocity cloud or as a Galactic merger fragment.
