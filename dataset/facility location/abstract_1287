We calculate the limiting behavior of relative Renyi entropy when the first
probability distribution is close to the second one in a non-regular
location-shift family which is generated by a probability distribution whose
support is an interval or a half-line. This limit can be regarded as a
generalization of Fisher information, and plays an important role in large
deviation theory.
