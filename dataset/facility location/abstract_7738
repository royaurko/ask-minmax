Resistors from mobile phones, usually located near the human body, are
considered as individual dosimeters of ionizing radiation in emergency
situations. The resistors contain Al2O3, which is optically stimulated
luminescence (OSL) material sensitive to ionizing radiation. This work is
focused on determination of dose homogeneity within a mobile phones which was
carried out by OSL measurements of resistors placed in different parts inside
the mobile phone. Separate, commercially available resistors, similar in the
shape and size to the resistors from circuit board of the studied mobile phone,
were situated in different locations inside it. The irradiations were performed
in uniform 60Co and 137Cs radiation fields, with the mobile phones connected
and not connected to the cellular network. The dose decrease of 9% was measured
for original resistors situated between layer of copper-clad laminate and
battery, in comparison to the dose at the front of the phone. The resistors
showed the lower signal when the mobile phone was connected to the cellular
network, due to higher temperature inside the housing. The profile of fading
was investigated within 3 month period for resistors irradiated with 1 Gy of
gamma rays to estimate of the fading coefficient.
