The overall framework for the study of solar convection and oscillations is
the spherically symmetric component of solar structure. I discuss those
properties of the solar interior which depend on convection and other possible
hydrodynamical motion and the increasingly detailed information about the
structure which is provided by helioseismic data. The most basic dependence of
solar models on convection is the calibration to fix the solar radius. The
dominant causes for differences in oscillation frequencies between the Sun and
solar models seem to be located near the top of the convection zone. However,
there is also evidence for possible weak mixing below the convection zone and
perhaps in the solar core. The former, at least, might be induced by
penetration of convective motion into the stable layers below.
