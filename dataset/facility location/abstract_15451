We investigate matter-enhanced Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW)
active-sterile neutrino conversion in the $\nu_e \rightleftharpoons \nu_s$
channel in the collapse of the iron core of a pre-supernova star. For values of
sterile neutrino rest mass $m_s$ and vacuum mixing angle $\theta$
(specifically, $0.5 {\rm keV}< m_s<10 {\rm keV}$ and $\sin^22\theta>
5\times{10}^{-12}$) which include those required for viable sterile neutrino
dark matter, our one-zone in-fall phase collapse calculations show a
significant reduction in core lepton fraction. This would result in a smaller
homologous core and therefore a smaller initial shock energy, disfavoring
successful shock re-heating and the prospects for an explosion. However, these
calculations also suggest that the MSW resonance energy can exhibit a minimum
located between the center and surface of the core. In turn, this suggests a
post-core-bounce mechanism to enhance neutrino transport and neutrino
luminosities at the core surface and thereby augment shock re-heating: (1)
scattering-induced or coherent MSW $\nu_e\to\nu_s$ conversion occurs deep in
the core, at the first MSW resonance, where $\nu_e$ energies are large ($\sim
150$ MeV); (2) the high energy $\nu_s$ stream outward at near light speed; (3)
they deposit their energy when they encounter the second MSW resonance
$\nu_s\to\nu_e$ just below the proto-neutron star surface.
