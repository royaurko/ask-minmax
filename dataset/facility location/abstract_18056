We report the discovery of an extrasolar planet, KMT-2015-1b, that was
detected using the microlensing technique. The planetary lensing event was
observed by KMTNet survey that has commenced in 2015. With dense coverage by
using network of globally distributed telescopes equipped with very wide-field
cameras, the short planetary signal is clearly detected and precisely
characterized. We find that KMT-2015-1b is a giant planet orbiting a low-mass
M-dwarf host star. The planet has a mass about twice that of Jupiter and it is
located beyond the snow line of the host star. With the improvement of existing
surveys and the advent of new surveys, future microlensing planet samples will
include planets not only in greatly increased number but also in a wide
spectrum of hosts and planets, helping us to have a better and comprehensive
understanding about the formation and evolution of planets.
