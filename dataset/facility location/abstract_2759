A nonuniform system is considered consisting of two phases with different
densities of particles. At each given time the distribution of the phases in
space is chaotic: each phase filling a set of regions with random shapes and
locations. A chaotic diffusion process intermixes these regions by varying
their shapes and locations in a random way. To investigate the statistical
properties of such a system, it is exemplified by a lattice-gas model.
Conditions are analysed when this chaotic lattice-gas model can become
thermodynamically more stable than the usual model describing a pure one-phase
system.
