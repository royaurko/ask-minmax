In this study, by developing a theory of a mixture model and EM algorithm for
string data on the basis of a probability theory on a set of strings developed
in our previous studies, we address the problem of clustering string data in an
unsupervised manner. We first construct a parametric distribution on a set of
strings in the motif of the Laplace distribution on a set of real numbers and
reveal its basic properties. This Laplace-like distribution has two parameters
one of which is a string that represents the location of the distribution and
another is positive real number that represents the dispersion. It is difficult
to explicitly write maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters because one
parameter is a string. We construct estimators that almost surely converge to
the maximum likelihood estimators as the number of observed strings increases
and demonstrate that the estimators strongly consistently estimate the
parameters. After that, we compose an iteration algorithm for estimating
parameters of the mixture model of the Laplace-like distributions and
demonstrate that the algorithm almost surely converges to the EM algorithm for
the Laplace-like mixture and strongly consistently estimates its parameters as
the numbers of observed strings and of iterations increase. We finally derive a
procedure for unsupervised string clustering from the Laplace-like mixture that
is asymptotically optimal in the sense that the posterior probability of making
correct classifications is maximized.
