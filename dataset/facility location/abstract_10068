We have evaluated the centrifugal force acting on a fluid element and the
ellipticity of the fluid configuration, which is slowly rotating, using the
Hartle-Thorne solution for different equations of state. The centrifugal force
shows a maximum in every case, whereas the reversal in sign could be seen in
only one case, and the system becomes unstable in other cases. The ellipticity
as calculated from the usual definition shows maxima, whereas the definition
obtained from the equilibration of the inertial forces, shows a negative
behaviour, indicating that the system is prolate and not oblate. This prolate
shape of the configuration is similar to the one earlier found by Pfister and
Braun for a rotating shell of matter, using the correct centrifugal force
expression for the interior. The location of the centrifugal maxima gets
farther away from the Schwarzschild radius as the equation of state gets
softer.
