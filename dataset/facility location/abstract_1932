In explosive stellar environments like supernovae, the temperatures are high
enough for the production of heavy neutron-deficient nuclei, the socalled
p-nuclei. Up to now, the knowledge of the reaction rates of p-nuclei is based
on theoretical parameterizations using statistical model calculations. At the
bremsstrahlung facility of the superconducting electron accelerator ELBE of FZ
Dresden-Rossendorf, we aim to measure the photodisintegration rates of heavy
nuclei experimentally. Photoactivation measurements on the astrophysically
relevant p-nuclei 92Mo and 144Sm have been performed with bremsstrahlung
end-point energies from 10.0 to 16.5 MeV. First experiments on the short-lived
decays following the reaction 144Sm(gamma,n) are carried out using a pneumatic
delivery system for rapid transport of activated samples. The activation yields
are compared with calculations using cross sections from recent Hauser-Feshbach
models.
