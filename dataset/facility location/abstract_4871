We present results on the reconstructed image resolution of a position
sensitive radiation instrument (COCAE) based on extensive simulation studies.
The reconstructed image resolution has been investigated in a wide range of
incident photon energies emitted by point-like sources located at different
source-to-detector distances on and off the detector's symmetry axis. The
ability of the detector to distinguish multiple radioactive sources observed
simultaneously is investigating by simulating point-like sources of different
energies located on and off the detector's symmetry axis and at different
positions
