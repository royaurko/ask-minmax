Applying to graphene oxides, molecular theory of graphene is based on the
oxide molecular origin when it is considered as a final product in the
succession of a graphene molecule polyderivatives related to a particular
oxidation reaction. The graphene oxide structure is created in due course of
calculations following the algorithms that take into account the graphene
molecules natural radicalization, correlation of odd electrons, an extremely
strong influence of structure on properties, a sharp response of the molecule
behavior on small action of external factors. Taking together, the theory
facilities has allowed for getting a clear, transparent and understandable
explanation of hot points of the graphene oxide chemistry and suggesting
reliable models of both chemically produced and chemically reduced graphene
oxides.
