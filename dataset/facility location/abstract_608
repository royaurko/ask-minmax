This white paper summarizes the scientific opportunities for utilization of
the upgraded 12 GeV Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) and
associated experimental equipment at Jefferson Lab. It is based on the 52
proposals recommended for approval by the Jefferson Lab Program Advisory
Committee.The upgraded facility will enable a new experimental program with
substantial discovery potential to address important topics in nuclear,
hadronic, and electroweak physics.
