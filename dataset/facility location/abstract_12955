This work considers the secure and reliable information transmission in
two-hop relay wireless networks without the information of both eavesdropper
channels and locations. While the previous work on this problem mainly studied
infinite networks and their asymptotic behavior and scaling law results, this
papers focuses on a more practical network with finite number of system nodes
and explores the corresponding exact results on the number of eavesdroppers the
network can tolerant to ensure a desired secrecy and reliability. For achieving
secure and reliable information transmission in a finite network, two
transmission protocols are considered in this paper, one adopts an optimal but
complex relay selection process with less load balance capacity while the other
adopts a random but simple relay selection process with good load balance
capacity. Theoretical analysis is further provided to determine the exact and
maximum number of independent and also uniformly distributed eavesdroppers one
network can tolerate to satisfy a specified requirement in terms of the maximum
secrecy outage probability and maximum transmission outage probability allowed.
