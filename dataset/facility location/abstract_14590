Recent analysis of the SSRS2 data based on cell-counts and two-point
correlation function has shown that very luminous galaxies are much more
strongly clustered than fainter galaxies. In fact, the amplitude of the
correlation function of very luminous galaxies ($L > L^*$) asymptotically
approaches that of $R \ge 0$ clusters. In this paper we investigate the
properties of the most luminous galaxies, with blue absolute magnitude $M_B \le
-21$. We find that: 1) the population mix is comparable to that in other ranges
of absolute magnitudes; 2) only a small fraction are located in bona fide
clusters; 3) the bright galaxy-cluster cross-correlation function is
significantly higher on large scales than that measured for fainter galaxies;
4) the correlation length of galaxies brighter than \MB $ \sim -20.0$,
expressed as a function of the mean interparticle distance, appears to follow
the universal dimensionless correlation function found for clusters and radio
galaxies; 5) a large fraction of the bright galaxies are in interacting pairs,
others show evidence for tidal distortions, while some appear to be surrounded
by faint satellite galaxies. We conclude that very luminous optical galaxies
differ from the normal population of galaxies both in the clustering and other
respects. We speculate that this population is highly biased tracers of mass,
being associated to dark halos with masses more comparable to clusters than
typical loose groups.
