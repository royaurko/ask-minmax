The VLA Galactic Plane Survey (VGPS) of the first Galactic quadrant was
searched for HI emission with velocities well above the maximum velocity
allowed by Galactic rotation. A sample of 17 small fast-moving clouds was
identified. The distribution of the ensemble of clouds in longitude and
velocity indicates that the clouds are part of the Galactic disk, despite their
large forbidden velocity. The median angular diameter of the clouds detected in
the VGPS is 3.4 arcminutes. These clouds would not be noticed in previous low
resolution surveys because of strong beam dilution. Assuming each cloud is
located at the tangent point, a median cloud has a diameter of 10 pc, HI mass
of 60 M_sun, and a velocity more than 25 km/s beyond the local terminal
velocity derived from 12CO observations. Three clouds in the sample have a
velocity between 50 and 60 km/s in excess of the local terminal velocity. The
longitude distribution of the sample peaks near l = 30 degrees, while the
latitude distribution of the clouds is nearly flat. The observed longitude and
latitude distributions are compared with simulated distributions taking into
account the selection criteria of the cloud search. It is found that the number
of clouds declines with distance from the Galactic center, with an exponential
scale length 2.8 - 8 kpc at the 99% confidence level. We find a lower limit to
the scale height of the clouds of 180 pc (HWHM), but the true value is likely
significantly higher.
