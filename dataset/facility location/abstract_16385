We analyze radio continuum and line observations from the archives of the
Very Large Array, as well as X-ray observations from the \emph{Chandra} archive
of the region of massive star formation W75N. Five radio continuum sources are
detected: VLA 1, VLA 2, VLA 3, Bc, and VLA 4. VLA 3 appears to be a radio jet;
we detect J=1-0, v=0 SiO emission towards it, probably tracing the inner parts
of a molecular outflow. The radio continuum source Bc, previously believed to
be tracing an independent star, is found to exhibit important changes in total
flux density, morphology, and position. These results suggest that source Bc is
actually a radio Herbig-Haro object, one of the brightest known, powered by the
VLA~3 jet source. VLA 4 is a new radio continuum component, located a few
arcsec to the south of the group of previously known radio sources. Strong and
broad (1,1) and (2,2) ammonia emission is detected from the region containing
the radio sources VLA~1, VLA~2, and VLA~3. Finally, the 2-10 keV emission seen
in the \emph{Chandra}/ACIS image shows two regions that could be the
termination shocks of the outflows from the multiple sources observed in W75N.
