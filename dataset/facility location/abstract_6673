The problem of knowing who knows what is multi-faceted. Knowledge and
expertise lie on a spectrum and one's expertise in one topic area may have
little bearing on one's knowledge in a disparate topic area. In addition, we
continue to learn new things over time. Each of us see but a sliver of our
acquaintances' and co-workers' areas of expertise. By making explicit and
visible many individual perceptions of cognitive contributority, this work shows
that a group can know what its members know about in a relatively efficient and
inexpensive manner.
