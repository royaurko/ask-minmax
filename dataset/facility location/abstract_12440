While there has been much work examining the affects of social network
structure on innovation adoption, models to date have lacked important features
such as meta-populations reflecting real geography or influence from mass media
forces. In this article, we show these are features crucial to producing more
accurate predictions of a social contagion and technology adoption at the city
level. Using data from the adoption of the popular micro-blogging platform,
Twitter, we present a model of adoption on a network that places friendships in
real geographic space and exposes individuals to mass media influence. We show
that homopholy both amongst individuals with similar propensities to adopt a
technology and geographic location are critical to reproduce features of real
spatiotemporal adoption. Furthermore, we estimate that mass media was
responsible for increasing Twitter's user base two to four fold. To reflect
this strength, we extend traditional contagion models to include an endogenous
mass media agent that responds to those adopting an innovation as well as
influencing agents to adopt themselves.
