Proper interpretation and understanding of astronomical data requires good
knowledge of the data acquisition process. The increase in remote observing,
queue observing, and the availability of large archived data products risk
insulating astronomers from the telescope, potentially reducing their
familiarity with the observational techniques crucial in understanding the
data. Learning fundamental observing techniques can be done in at least three
ways: 1) College and university operated observing facilities, 2) Student
involvement in national facilities through competitive proposals, 3) Programs
at national facilities to increase upper-level undergraduate and graduate
student exposure to telescopes. We encourage both national organizations and
universities to include programs and funding aimed at supporting hands-on
experience with telescopes through the three methods mentioned.
