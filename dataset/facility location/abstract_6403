The kinematical quantities derived from the velocity field of a nongeodesic
congruence are studied. We found the shear tensor components are finite in time
but diverge at the event horizon of the spacetime located at $\rho = 0$. The
surface gravity on the horizon is just the proper acceleration of the uniformly
expanding distribution of observers, in spherical Rindler coordinates. The
Raychaudhuri equation is fulfilled for the congruence of particles worldlines.
