For 2442 galaxies of the catalog, compiled based on the NED, SDSS, and CATS
survey data with redshifts z, > 0.3 we conducted an analysis of the amplitude
of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in the
points, corresponding to the direction to these objects. To this end, we used
the ILC map from the WMAP mission seven-year data release. We have estimated
the dipole component of the background and tested the hypothesis of Kashlinsky
on the existence of a "dark bulk flow", determined for the estimated dipole
component of the CMB WMAP by the value of the CMB anisotropy in the direction
to the clusters of galaxies. We show that the amplitude of this dipole T max =
0.012mK is located within the {\sigma} interval, estimated by Monte Carlo
simulations for the Gaussian fluctuations of the CMB signal in the {\Lambda}CDM
model. The low amplitude of the dipole indicates that it is impossible to
confirm this hypothesis from the WMAP data. In addition, we studied the
statistics of the fluctuation amplitude of the microwave signal in the
direction to radio galaxies. A weakening of the absolute value of the mean
signal in the corresponding fields was discovered.
