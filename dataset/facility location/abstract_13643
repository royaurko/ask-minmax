As mechanical devices in the nano/micro length scale are increasingly
employed, it is crucial to understand nanoscale friction and wear especially at
technically relevant sliding velocities. Accordingly, a novel technique has
been developed for Friction Coefficient Mapping (FCM), leveraging recent
advances in high speed AFM. The technique efficiently acquires friction versus
force curves based on a sequence of images at a single location, each with
incrementally lower loads. As a result, true maps of the coefficient of
friction can be uniquely calculated for heterogeneous surfaces. These
parameters are determined at a scan velocity as fast as 2 mm/s for
microfabricated SiO2 mesas and Au coated pits, yielding results that are
identical to traditional speed measurements despite being ~1000 times faster.
To demonstrate the upper limit of sliding velocity for the custom setup, the
friction properties of mica are reported from 200 {\mu}m/sec up to 2 cm/sec.
While FCM is applicable to any AFM and scanning speed, quantitative
nanotribology investigations of heterogeneous sliding or rolling components are
therefore uniquely possible, even at realistic velocities for devices such as
MEMS, biological implants, or data storage systems.
