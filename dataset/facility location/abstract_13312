We present the method of multiplexed imaging designed for astronomical
observations of large sky areas in the IR, visible and UV frequencies. Our
method relies on the sparse nature of astronomical observations. The method
consists of an optical system that directs light from different locations on
the focal plane of a telescope onto the same detector area and an algorithm
that reconstructs the original wide-field image. In this way we can use a
physically small detector to cover a wide field of view. We test our
reconstruction algorithm using public space telescope data. Our tests
demonstrate the reliability and power of the multiplexed imaging method. Using
our method it will be possible to increase the sky area covered with space
telescopes by 1-3 orders of magnitude, depending on the specific scientific
goal and optical parameters. This method can significantly increase the volume
of astronomical surveys, including search programs for exoplanets and
transients using space and ground instruments.
