We present results from a study of the eclipsing, colliding-wind binary V444
Cyg that uses a combination of X-ray and optical spectropolarimetric methods to
describe the 3-D nature of the shock and wind structure within the system. We
have created the most complete X-ray light curve of V444 Cyg to date using 40
ksec of new data from Swift, and 200 ksec of new and archived XMM-Newton
observations. In addition, we have characterized the intrinsic, polarimetric
phase-dependent behavior of the strongest optical emission lines using data
obtained with the University of Wisconsin's Half-Wave Spectropolarimeter. We
have detected evidence of the Coriolis distortion of the wind-wind collision in
the X-ray regime, which manifests itself through asymmetric behavior around the
eclipses in the system's X-ray light curves. The large opening angle of the
X-ray emitting region, as well as its location (i.e. the WN wind does not
collide with the O star, but rather its wind) are evidence of radiative
braking/inhibition occurring within the system. Additionally, the polarimetric
results show evidence of the cavity the wind-wind collision region carves out
of the Wolf-Rayet star's wind.
