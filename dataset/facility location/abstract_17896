Aims. We track the time evolution of planet traps and snowlines in a
viscously evolving protoplanetary disk using an opacity table that accounts for
the composition of the dust material.
  Methods. We coupled a dynamical and thermodynamical disk model with a
temperature-dependent opacity table (that accounts for the sublimation of the
main dust components) to investigate the formation and evolution of snowlines
and planet traps during the first million years of disk evolution.
  Results. Starting from a minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN), we find that the
disk mid-plane temperature profile shows several plateaux (0.1-1 AU wide) at
the different sublimation temperatures of the species that make up the dust.
For water ice, the correspond- ing plateau can be larger than 1 AU, which means
that this is a snow "region" rather than a snow "line". As a consequence, the
surface density of solids in the snow region may increase gradually, not
abruptly. Several planet traps and desert regions appear naturally as a result
of abrupt local changes in the temperature and density profiles over the disk
lifetime. These structures are mostly located at the edges of the temperature
plateaux (surrounding the dust sublimation lines) and at the heat-transition
barrier where the disk stellar heating and viscous heating are of the same
magnitude (around 10 AU after 1 Myr).
  Conclusions. Several traps are identified: although a few appear to be
transient, most of them slowly migrate along with the heat- transition barrier
or the dust sublimation lines. These planet traps may temporarily favor the
growth of planetary cores.
