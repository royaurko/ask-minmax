Fairall 51 is a polar-scattered Seyfert 1 galaxy, a type of active galaxies
believed to represent a bridge between unobscured type-1 and obscured type-2
objects. Fairall 51 has shown complex and variable X-ray absorption but only
little is known about its origin. In our research, we observed Fairall 51 with
the X-ray satellite Suzaku in order to constrain a characteristic time-scale of
its variability. We performed timing and spectral analysis of four observations
separated by 1.5, 2 and 5.5 day intervals. We found that the 0.5-50 keV
broadband X-ray spectra are dominated by a primary power-law emission (with the
photon index ~ 2). This emission is affected by at least three absorbers with
different ionisations (log(xi) ~ 1-4). The spectrum is further shaped by a
reprocessed emission, possibly coming from two regions -- the accretion disc
and a more distant scattering region. The accretion disc emission is smeared by
the relativistic effects, from which we measured the spin of the black hole as
a ~ 0.8 (+-0.2). We found that most of the spectral variability can be
attributed to the least ionised absorber whose column density changed by a
factor of two between the first (highest-flux) and the last (lowest-flux)
observation. A week-long scale of the variability indicates that the absorber
is located at the distance ~ 0.05 pc from the centre, i.e., in the Broad Line
Region.
