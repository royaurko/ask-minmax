It has been suggested that type II radio bursts are due to energetic
electrons accelerated at coronal shocks. Radio observations, however, have poor
or no spatial resolutions to pinpoint the exact acceleration locations of these
electrons. In this paper, we discuss a promising approach to infer the electron
acceleration location by combining radio and white light observations. The key
assumption is to relate specific morphological features (e.g. spectral bumps)
of the dynamic spectra of type II radio bursts, to imaging features (e.g. CME
going into a streamer) along the CME (and its driven shock) propagation. In
this study, we examine the CME-streamer interaction for the solar eruption
dated on 2003 November 1. The presence of spectral bump in the relevant type II
radio burst is identified, which is interpreted as a natural result of the
shock-radio emitting region entering the dense streamer structure. The study is
useful for further determinations of the location of type II radio burst and
the associated electron acceleration by CME-driven shock.
