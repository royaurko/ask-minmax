A {\em relativistic positioning system} consists in a set of four clocks
broadcasting their respective proper time by means of light signals. Among
them, the more important ones are the {\em auto-located positioning systems,}
in which every clock broadcasts not only its proper time but also the proper
times that it receives from the other three. At this level, no reference to any
exterior system (the Earth surface, for example) and no synchronization are
needed. The current status of the theory of relativistic positioning systems is
sketched.
