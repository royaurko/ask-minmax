Neutrino accompanied double beta-decay of Ge-76 can populate the ground state
and the excited states of Se-76. While the decay to the ground state has been
observed with a half-life of 1.74 +0.18 -0.16 10^21 years, decays to the
excited states have not yet been observed. Nuclear matrix elements depend on
details of the nuclear transitions. A measurement of the half-life of the
transition considered here could help to reduce the uncertainties of the
calculations of the nuclear matrix element for the neutrinoless double beta
decay of Ge-76. This parameter relates the half-life of the process to the
effective Majorana neutrino mass. The results of a feasibility study to detect
the neutrino accompanied double beta-decay of Ge-76 to the excited states of
Se-76 are presented in this paper. Segmented germanium detectors were assumed
in this study. Such detectors, enriched in Ge-76 to a level of about 86%, will
be deployed in the GERDA experiment located at the INFN Gran Sasso National
Laboratory, Italy. It is shown that the decay of Ge-76 to the 1122 keV 0+ level
of Se-76 can be observed in GERDA provided that the half-life of the process is
in the range favoured by the present calculations which is 7.5 10^21 y to 3.1
10^23 y.
