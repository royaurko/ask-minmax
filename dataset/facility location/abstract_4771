We report the results of a successful 7 hour 1.4 GHz VLBI experiment using
two new stations, ASKAP-29 located in Western Australia and WARK12M located on
the North Island of New Zealand. This was the first geodetic VLBI observing
session with the participation of these new stations. We have determined the
positions of ASKAP-29 and WARK12M. Random errors on position estimates are
150-200 mm for the vertical component and 40-50 mm for the horizontal
component. Systematic errors caused by the unmodeled ionosphere path delay may
reach 1.3 m for the vertical component.
