The X-ray-rich GRB030528 was detected by the HETE satellite and its
localization was rapidly disseminated. However, early optical observations
failed to detect a counterpart source. In a 2-epoch ToO observation with
Chandra, we discovered a fading X-ray source likely counterpart to GRB030528.
The source brightness was typical of X-ray afterglows observed at similar
epochs. Other observers detected an IR source at a location consistent with the
X-ray source. The X-ray spectrum is not consistent with a large absorbing
column.
