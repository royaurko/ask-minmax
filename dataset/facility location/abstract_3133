Four binary objects and one triplet have been revealed in the young stellar
cluster located in the vicinity of IRAS 05137+3919 source on a distance 4.4 kpc
with the use of statistic analysis (2PCF, Poisson statistic). They are
including the pair of AeBe stars. The percentage of the multiple systems in the
cluster is mf = 5 and cp = 10.It should be noticed, that the use of the
different databases, namely 2MASS and GPS UKIDSS, which are differ by both
photometric limit and resolution, do not affect the value of these parameters.
The mass of the multiple systems' components are located in the range from 1 to
8 Msol and log P (rotation period in years) - from 4.4 to 4.7. The median value
of the mass ratio of the components is q = 0.73. The percentage of the multiple
systems and their parameters in this cluster is resembling with the data
obtained in the other star forming regions (ONC, Perseus, U Sco A), in which
the value of mf and cp parameters are comparable with the results obtained for
field's stellar objects.
