In this work we present preliminary results concerning the properties of
about 50 clusters and associations located in a densely populated region at the
Southern edge of the supershell LMC~4. The ages of the clusters and
associations are derived. The cluster formation rate peaks at about 10-20 Myr
ago corresponding to the age of the formation of LMC~4. Objects younger than 10
Myr are located close to CO clouds, indicating a possible trigger of the recent
star formation by the interaction of the supershell with the interstellar
medium.
  Isophotal analysis has been done for 50% of the clusters. A large number of
objects present isophotal distortions commonly interpreted as sign of
interaction. Cluster multiplets are coeval within 20 Myr, suggesting a common
origin. This indicates that clusters possibly form in large groups. Our
findings are in agreement with the unified view of multi-scale star formation,
where a size-duration correlation is expected.
