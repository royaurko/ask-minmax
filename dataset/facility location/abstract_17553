Autonomous robot networks are an effective tool for monitoring large-scale
environmental fields. This paper proposes distributed control strategies for
localizing the source of a noisy signal, which could represent a physical
quantity of interest such as magnetic force, heat, radio signal, or chemical
concentration. We develop algorithms specific to two scenarios: one in which
the sensors have a precise model of the signal formation process and one in
which a signal model is not available. In the model-free scenario, a team of
sensors is used to follow a stochastic gradient of the signal field. Our
approach is distributed, robust to deformations in the group geometry, does not
necessitate global localization, and is guaranteed to lead the sensors to a
neighborhood of a local maximum of the field. In the model-based scenario, the
sensors follow the stochastic gradient of the mutual information between their
expected measurements and the location of the source in a distributed manner.
The performance is demonstrated in simulation using a robot sensor network to
localize the source of a wireless radio signal.
