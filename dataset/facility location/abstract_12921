Observatories constructed solely for photometric monitoring make it possible
to understand the temporal nature of objects over time scales that historically
have been difficult to achieve. We report on one such observatory, the Remote
Observatory for Variable Object Research (ROVOR) which was constructed to
enable both long-term and rapid cadence observations of brighter objects. ROVOR
is an 0.4m optical telescope located in central Utah and commissioned for
scientific observations in 2008. Principle research has been monitoring
blazars, x-ray binaries, AGN, and an occasional gamma-ray burst afterglow. We
describe the observatory, the control system, and its unique roof.
