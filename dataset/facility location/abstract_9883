The gap function in unconventional superconductors may vanish at points or
lines in momentum space, permitting electronic excitations, termed nodal
quasiparticles, to exist at temperatures well below the superconducting
transition. In the vortex phase, the presence of nodal quasiparticles should be
directly observable through the variation of the heat capacity with the angle
between a magnetic field and the location of the zeroes of the gap. The heat
capacity of candidate non-magnetic unconventional superconductors Lu(Y)Ni2B2C
were found to exhibit fourfold oscillations with field angle, the first such
observation. The observed angular variations are in quantitative agreement with
theory, confirming that quasiparticles are created via Doppler shifts at nodes
along <100>. Anomalous disorder effects have been also observed in the
field-angle dependent heat capacity C_{p}(\alpha). In a slightly disordered
sample, anomalous secondary minima along <110> appeared for \mu_{0}H > 1 T,
leading to an eightfold pattern. The coexistence of an anisotropic
superconducting gap and nonlocal effects is shown to drive the anomalous
behavior. These results demonstrate that field-angle-dependent heat capacity
can be a powerful tool in probing the momentum-space gap structure in
unconventional superconductors such as high T_{c} cuprates, heavy fermions,
borocarbides, etc.
