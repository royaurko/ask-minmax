A planar near-field magnetoinductive lens operating in the microwave range is
presented. The proposed device consists of two parallel planar arrays of
metallic broadside coupled (BC-) split ring resonators (SRRs), or BC-SRRs.
Power coming from a point-like source located in front of the lens is focused
into a receiver located in free space behind the device. This focus is clearly
removed from the back side of the lens, and has a size which is an order of
magnitude smaller than the free space wavelength of the incoming radiation. The
imaging properties of the device mainly relies on the excitation of
magnetoinductive surface waves on the BC-SRR arrays. By simply scaling the
BC-SRRs size, as well as the arrays periodicity, the frequency of operation of
the device can be tuned over a wide frequency range. Thus the proposed design
is potentially useful for many applications ranging from megahertzs to
terahertzs.
