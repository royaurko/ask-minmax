Backward scattering of antiprotons by bare uranium is studied theoretically
for antiproton energies within the interval 100 eV -- 1 keV. A marked maximum
of the differential cross section in the backward direction (Coulomb glory) at
some energies of the incident particle is revealed. The effect is due to the
screening properties of the vacuum polarization potential and can be regarded
as a manifestation of the vacuum polarization in non-relativistic collisions of
heavy particles. Experimental observation can become feasible with new
facilities for antiproton and ion research at GSI.
