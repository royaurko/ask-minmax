A puzzling feature of the {\it Chandra}--detected quasar jets is that their
X-ray emission decreases faster along the jet than their radio emission,
resulting to an outward increasing radio to X-ray ratio. In some sources this
behavior is so extreme that the radio emission peak is located clearly
downstream of that of the X-rays. This is a rather unanticipated behavior given
that the inverse
 Compton nature of the X-rays and the synchrotron radio emission are attributed
to roughly the same electrons of the jet's non-thermal electron distribution.
In this note we show that this morphological behavior can result from the
gradual deceleration of a relativistic flow and that the offsets in peak
emission at different wavelengths carry the imprint of this deceleration. This
notion is consistent with another recent finding, namely that the jets feeding
the terminal hot spots of powerful radio galaxies and quasars are still
relativistic with Lorentz factors $\Gamma \sim 2-3$. The picture of the
kinematics of powerful jets emerging from these considerations is that they
remain relativistic as they gradually decelerate from Kpc scales to the hot
spots, where, in a final collision with the intergalactic medium, they
slow-down rapidly to the subrelativistic velocities of the hot spot advance
speed.
