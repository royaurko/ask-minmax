The ab-initio phase diagram of dense hydrogen is very sensitive to errors in
the treatment of electronic correlation. Recently, it has been shown that the
choice of the density functional has a large effect on the predicted location
of both the liquid-liquid phase transition and the solid insulator-to-metal
transition in dense hydrogen. To identify the most accurate functional for
dense hydrogen applications, we systematically benchmark some of the most
commonly used functionals using Quantum Monte Carlo. By considering several
measures of functional accuracy, we conclude that the van der Waals and hybrid
functionals significantly out perform LDA and PBE. We support these conclusions
by analyzing the impact of functional choice on structural optimization in the
molecular solid, and on the location of the liquid-liquid phase transition.
