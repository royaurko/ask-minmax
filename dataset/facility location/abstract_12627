The Habitable Zone Gallery (www.hzgallery.org) is a new service to the
exoplanet community which provides Habitable Zone (HZ) information for each of
the exoplanetary systems with known planetary orbital parameters. The service
includes a sortable table with information on the percentage of orbital phase
spent within the HZ, planetary effective temperatures, and other basic
planetary properties. In addition to the table, we also plot the period and
eccentricity of the planets with respect to their time spent in the HZ. The
service includes a gallery of known systems which plot the orbits and the
location of the HZ with respect to those orbits. Also provided are animations
which aid in orbit visualization and provide the changing effective temperature
for those planets in eccentric orbits. Here we describe the science motivation,
the under-lying calculations, and the structure of the web site.
