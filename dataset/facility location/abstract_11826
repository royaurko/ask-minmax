We study trajectories of d-dimensional Brownian Motion in Poissonian
potential up to the hitting time of a distant hyper-plane. Our Poissonian
potential V can be associated to a field of traps whose centers location is
given by a Poisson Point process and whose radii are IID distributed with a
common distribution that has unbounded support; it has the particularity of
having long-range correlation. We focus on the case where the law of the trap
radii has power-law decay and prove that superdiffusivity hold under certain
condition, and get a lower bound on the volume exponent. Results differ quite
much with the one that have been obtained for the model with traps of bounded
radii by W\"uhtrich: the superdiffusivity phenomenon is enhanced by the
presence of correlation.
