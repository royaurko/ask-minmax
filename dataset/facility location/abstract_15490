The recently discovered extended TeV source HESS J1834-087 is associated with
both a diffuse X-ray enhancement and a molecular cloud, projected at the center
of an old radio supernova remnant G23.3-0.3 (SNR W41). New HI observations from
the VLA Galactic Plane Survey (VGPS) show unambiguous structures associated
with W41 in the radial velocity range of 53 to 63 km/s, so we obtain for W41 a
distance of 4+-0.2 kpc. A new higher sensitivity VGPS continuum image of W41 at
1420 MHz shows faint emission in its eastern part not detected by previous
observations, so we give a new angular size of 36'x30' in b-l direction
(average radius of 19 pc). We estimate for W41 a Sedov age of ~10e5 yr. New
XMM-Newton observation reveals diffuse X-ray emission within the HESS source
and suggests an association between the X-ray and Gamma-ray emission. The
high-resolution ^{13}CO images of W41 further reveal a giant molecular cloud
(GMC) located at the center of W41, likely associated with W41 in the the
radial velocity range of 61 to 66 km/s. Altogether, the new observations can be
interpreted as providing the first evidence that an old SNR encounters a GMC to
emit TeV gamma-rays in the cloud material.
