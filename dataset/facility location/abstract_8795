We describe multi-wavelength (8--20 micron), diffraction-limited,
mid-infrared images of the OMC-1 cloud core in Orion, covering an approximately
two arcminute area around the Trapezium and BN/KL regions. We have detected
mid-infrared emission at the locations of a subset of the previously identified
proplyds in the Orion Nebula along with two new infrared sources. The Ney-Allen
nebula surrounding the OB star theta 1 Ori d exhibits a ring or toroidal
structure at the longest wavelengths. The BN/KL complex appears as an extended,
butterfly-shaped structure with significant bipolar symmetry which is
bifurcated by a dust lane at the longer wavelengths. The infrared sources IRc3,
4, and 5 give the appearance of a ring-like structure with a possible jet-like
protrusion from its center along a line from IRc2. Derived color temperature
and dust opacity maps suggest that IRc3, 4, and 5 may not be self-luminous
objects.
