The Extreme Ultraviolet wavelength range was one of the final windows to be
opened up to astronomy. Nevertheless, it provides very important diagnostic
tools for a range of astronomical objects, although the opacity of the
interstellar medium restricts the majority of observations to sources in our
own galaxy. This review gives a historical overview of EUV astronomy, describes
current instrumental capabilities and examines the prospects for future
facilities on small and medium-class satellite platforms.
