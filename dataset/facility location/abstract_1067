The neutrino induced hyperon production processes $\bar{\nu}_{e/\mu} + p \to
e^+/\mu^+ + \pi + \Lambda/\Sigma$ may provide a unique clean place for studying
low energy $\pi\Lambda/\Sigma$ interaction and hyperon resonances below $KN$
threshold. The production rates for some neutrino induced hyperon production
processes are estimated with theoretical models. Suggestions are made for the
study of hyperon production from neutrino-nucleon reaction at present and
future neutrino facilities.
