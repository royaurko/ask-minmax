Due to an excellent mass resolution and a large amount of available data, the
CDF experiment, located at the Tevatron proton-antiproton accelerator, allows
the precise measurement of spectroscopic properties, like mass and decay width,
of a variety of states. This was exploited to examine the first orbital
excitations of the Lambdac baryon, the resonances Lambdac(2595) and
Lambdac(2625), in the decay channel Lambdac+ pi+ pi-, as well as the Lambdac
spin excitations Sigmac(2455) and Sigmac(2520) in its decays to Lambdac+ pi-
and Lambdac+ pi+ final states in a data sample corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 5.2 invfb. We present measurements of the mass differences with
respect to the Lambdac and the decay widths of these states, using
significantly higher statistics than previous experiments.
