We propose a refinement of the Betti numbers of a compact ANR in the presence
of a continuous function worked out in collaboration with Stefan Haller. The
refinement consists of finite configurations of points with specified
multiplicity located in the complex plane of cardinality (counted with
multiplicity) the Betti numbers, equivalently of monic polynomials with complex
coefficients of degree the Betti numbers of the space A number of properties
are discussed (Theorems 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3) as well as the realization of each
such configurations as dimensions of mutually orthogonal subspaces of the
homology vector spaces, when equipped with a Hilbert space structure, indexed
by the points of the configuration.
