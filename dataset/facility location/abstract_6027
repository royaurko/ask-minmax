We show that the absence of equilibrium states of two uncharged spinning
particles located on the symmetry axis, revealed in an approximate approach
recently employed by Bonnor, can be explained by a non-general character of his
approximation scheme which lacks an important arbitrary parameter representing
a strut. The absence of this parameter introduces an artificial restriction on
the particles' angular momenta, making it impossible to find a physical
solution to the balance equations.
