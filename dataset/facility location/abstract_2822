We classify the most common local forms of smooth maps from a smooth manifold
L to the plane. The word "local" can refer to locations in the source L, but
also to locations in the target. The first point of view leads us to a
classification of certain germs of maps, which we review here although it is
very well known. The second point of view leads us to a classification of
certain multigerms of maps.
