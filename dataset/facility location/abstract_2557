Critical Infrastructures (CIs), such as smart power grids, transport systems,
and financial infrastructures, are more and more vulnerable to cyber threats,
due to the adoption of commodity computing facilities. Despite the use of
several monitoring tools, recent attacks have proven that current defensive
mechanisms for CIs are not effective enough against most advanced threats. In
this paper we explore the idea of a framework leveraging multiple data sources
to improve protection capabilities of CIs. Challenges and opportunities are
discussed along three main research directions: i) use of distinct and
heterogeneous data sources, ii) monitoring with adaptive granularity, and iii)
attack modeling and runtime combination of multiple data analysis techniques.
