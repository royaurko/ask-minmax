Lithium abundances and rotation, determined for 120 subgiant stars in Lebre
et al. (1999) are analyzed. To this purpose, the evolutionary status of the
sample as well as the individual masses have been determined using the
HIPPARCOS trigonometric parallax measurements to locate very precisely our
sample stars in the HR diagram. We look at the distributions of A(Li) and Vsini
with mass when stars evolve from the main sequence to the subgiant branch. For
most of the stars in our sample we find good agreement with the dilution
predictions. However, the more massive cool stars with upper limits of Li
abundances show a significant discrepancy with the theoretical predictions,
even if the Non-LTE effects are taken into account. For the rotation behaviour,
our analysis confirms that low mass stars leave the main sequence with a low
rotational rate, while more massive stars are slowed down only when reaching
the subgiant branch. We also checked the connection between the observed
rotation behaviour and the magnetic braking due to the deepening of the
convective envelope. Our results shed new light on the lithium and rotation
discontinuities in the evolved phase.
