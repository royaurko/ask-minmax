We analyze in detail, beyond the usual scaling hypothesis, the finite-size
convergence of static quantities toward the thermodynamic limit. In this way we
are able to obtain sequences of pseudo-critical points which display a faster
convergence rate as compared to currently used methods. The approaches are
valid in any spatial dimension and for any value of the dynamic exponent. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods both analytically on the basis of
the one dimensional XY model, and numerically considering c = 1 transitions
occurring in non integrable spin models. In particular, we show that these
general methods are able to locate precisely the onset of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition making only use of ground-state
properties on relatively small systems.
