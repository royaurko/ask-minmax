Pheromones are a chemical substance produced and released by ants as means of
communication. In this work we present the minimum amount of pheromones
necessary and sufficient for a colony of ants (identical mobile agents) to
deterministically find a food source (treasure), assuming that each ant has the
computational capabilities of either a Finite State Machine (FSM) or a Turing
Machine (TM). In addition, we provide pheromone-based foraging algorithms
capable of handling fail-stop faults.
  In more detail, we consider the case where $k$ identical ants, initially
located at the center (nest) of an infinite two-dimensional grid and
communicate only through pheromones, perform a collaborative search for an
adversarially hidden treasure placed at an unknown distance $D$. We begin by
proving a tight lower bound of $\Omega(D)$ on the amount of pheromones required
by any number of FSM based ants to complete the search, and continue to reduce
the lower bound to $\Omega(k)$ for the stronger ants modeled as TM. We provide
algorithms which match the aforementioned lower bounds, and still terminate in
optimal $\mathcal{O}(D + D^2 / k)$ time, under both the synchronous and
asynchronous models. Furthermore, we consider a more realistic setting, where
an unknown number $f < k$ of ants may fail-stop at any time; we provide
fault-tolerant FSM algorithms (synchronous and asynchronous), that terminate in
$\mathcal{O}(D + D^2/(k-f) + Df)$ rounds and emit no more than the same
asymptotic minimum number of $\mathcal{O}(D)$ pheromones overall.
