Traditionally, HENP computing facilities have been open facilities that are
accessed in many different ways by users that are both internal and external to
the facility. However, the need to protect the facility from cybersecurity
threats has made it difficult to maintain the openness of the facility to
off-site and on-site users.
  In this paper, we discuss the strategy we have used and the architecture we
have developed and deployed to increase the security the US ATLAS and RHIC
Computing Facilities, while trying to maintain the openness and accessibility
that our user community has come to expect. Included in this discussion are the
tools that we have used and the operational experience we have had with the
deployed architecture.
