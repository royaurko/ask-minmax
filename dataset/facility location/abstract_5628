In this paper we investigate the hot end of the HB, presenting evolutionary
constraints concerning the CM diagram location and the gravity of hot HB stars.
According to the adopted evolutionary scenario, we predict an upper limit for
HB temperatures of about logTe = 4.45, remarkably cooler than previous
estimates. We find that such a theoretical prescription appears in good
agreement with available observational data concerning both stellar
temperatures and gravities.
