It is proposed that radiation belts similar to the ones in the planetary
magnetosphere can exist for a pulsar with a relatively long period and a strong
magnetic field. In the belts located in the closed field line region near the
light cylinder relativistic pairs are trapped and maintained at a density
substantially higher than the local Goldreich-Julian corotation density. The
trapped plasma can be supplied and replenished by either direct injection of
relativistic pairs from acceleration of externally-supplied particles in a
dormant outer gap or in situ ionization of the accreted neutral material in the
trapping region. The radiation belts can be disrupted by waves that are excited
in the region as the result of plasma instabilities or emitted from the surface
due to starquakes or stellar oscillations. The disruption can cause an
intermittent particle precipitation toward the star producing radio bursts. It
is suggested that such bursts may be seen as rotating radio transients (RRATs).
