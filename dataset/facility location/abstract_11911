The cat-eyes steady state solution in the framework of hydrodynamics
describing an infinite row of identical vortices is extended to the
magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium equation with incompressible flow of arbitrary
direction. The extended solution covers a variety of equilibria including one-
and two-dimensional generalized force-free and Harris-sheet configurations
which are preferable from those usually employed as initial states in
reconnection studies. Although the vortex shape is not affected by the magnetic
field, the flow in conjunction with the equilibrium nonlinearity has a strong
impact on isobaric surfaces by forming pressure islands located within the
cat-eyes vortices. More importantly, a magnetic-field-aligned flow of
experimental fusion relevance and the flow shear have significant stabilizing
effects in the region of pressure islands. The stable region is enhanced by an
external axial ("toroidal") magnetic field.
