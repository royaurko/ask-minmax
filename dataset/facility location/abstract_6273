To increase the energy of Particle Accelarators to reach the requirements of
the Linear Collider or of the Super KEK-B factory, new accelerating structures
with a higher accelerating gradient need to be developped. These accelerating
structures are often affected by high power breakdowns. Knowing the exact
location where these breakdowns occured helps to redesign the structure and
improve its performances. This can be done with acoustic sensors.
