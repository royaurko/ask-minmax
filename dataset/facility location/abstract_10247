The absolute neutrino masses are obtained in terms of the atmospheric and
solar mass-squared differences within the framework of low energy phenomenology
by suggestion of a quantitative analogy between the hierarchies of the neutrino
and charged lepton mass ratios. It points to a quasi-degenerate three neutrino
mass pattern with the neutrino mass scale likely located in the range 0.1 --
0.3 eV, and best-fit value m = 0.18 -- 0.20 eV. Restrictions on the neutrino
mass scale from the WMAP data are considered. Possible indirect evidence in
favor of quasi-degenerate neutrino masses is noted.
