We present a study of the dynamical evolution of Ultraluminous Infrared
Galaxies (ULIRGs), merging galaxies of infrared luminosity >10^12 L_sun. During
our Very Large Telescope large program, we have obtained ISAAC near-infrared,
high-resolution spectra of 54 ULIRGs (at several merger phases) and 12 local
Palomar-Green QSOs to investigate whether ULIRGs go through a QSO phase during
their evolution. One possible evolutionary scenario is that after nuclear
coalescence, the black hole radiates close to Eddington to produce QSO
luminosities. The mean stellar velocity dispersion that we measure from our
spectra is similar (~160 km/s) for 30 post-coalescence ULIRGs and 7 IR-bright
QSOs. The black holes in both populations have masses of order 10^7-10^8 M_sun
(calculated from the relation to the host dispersion) and accrete at rates >0.5
Eddington. Placing ULIRGs and IR-bright QSOs on the fundamental plane of
early-type galaxies shows that they are located on a similar region (that of
moderate-mass ellipticals), in contrast to giant ellipticals and radio-loud
QSOs. While this preliminary comparison of the ULIRG and QSO host kinematical
properties indicates that (some) ULIRGs may undergo a QSO phase in their
evolutionary history before they settle down as ellipticals, further data on
non-IR excess QSOs are necessary to test this scenario.
