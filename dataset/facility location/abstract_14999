The Wide-field X-ray Monitor (WXM) is one of the scientific instruments
carried on the High Energy Transient Explorer 2 (HETE-2) satellite launched on
2000 October 9. HETE-2 is an international mission consisting of a small
satellite dedicated to provide broad-band observations and accurate
localizations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). A unique feature of this mission is
its capability to determine and transmit GRB coordinates in almost real-time
through the burst alert network. The WXM consists of three elements: four
identical Xe-filled one-dimensional position-sensitive proportional counters,
two sets of one-dimensional coded apertures, and the main electronics. The WXM
counters are sensitive to X-rays between 2 keV and 25 keV within a
field-of-view of about 1.5 sr, with a total detector area of about 350 cm$^2$.
The in-flight triggering and localization capability can produce a real-time
GRB location of several to 30 arcmin accuracy, with a limiting sensitivity of
$10^{-7}$ erg cm$^{-2}$. In this report, the details of the mechanical
structure, electronics, on-board software, ground and in-flight calibration,
and in-flight performance of the WXM are discussed.
