The nuclear structure of 67Co has been investigated through 67Fe beta-decay.
The 67Fe isotopes were produced at the LISOL facility in proton-induced fission
of 238U and selected using resonant laser ionization combined with mass
separation. The application of a new correlation technique unambiguously
revealed a 496(33) ms isomeric state in 67Co at an unexpected low energy of 492
keV. A 67Co level scheme has been deduced. Proposed spin and parities suggest a
spherical (7/2-) 67Co ground state and a deformed first excited (1/2-) state at
492 keV, interpreted as a proton 1p-2h prolate intruder state.
