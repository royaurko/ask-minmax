Overlap fermions are particularly well suited to study the finite temperature
dynamics of the chiral symmetry restoration transition of QCD, which might be
just an analytic crossover. Using gauge field configurations on a 24^3x10
lattice with N_f=2 flavours of dynamical Wilson-clover quarks generated by the
DIK collaboration, we compute the lowest 50 eigenmodes of the overlap Dirac
operator and try to locate the transition by fermionic means. We analyse the
spectral density, local chirality and localisation properties of the low-lying
modes and illustrate the changing topological and (anti-) selfdual structure of
the underlying gauge fields across the transition.
