We investigate the scaling relations between the X-ray and the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (SZE) properties of clusters of galaxies, using data
taken during 2007 by the Y.T. Lee Array for Microwave Background Anisotropy
(AMiBA) at 94 GHz for the six clusters A1689, A1995, A2142, A2163, A2261, and
A2390. The scaling relations relate the integrated Compton-y parameter Y_{2500}
to the X-ray derived gas temperature T_{e}, total mass M_{2500}, and bolometric
luminosity L_X within r_{2500}. Our results for the power-law index and
normalization are both consistent with the self-similar model and other studies
in the literature except for the Y_{2500}-L_X relation, for which a physical
explanation is given though further investigation may be still needed. Our
results not only provide confidence for the AMiBA project but also support our
understanding of galaxy clusters.
