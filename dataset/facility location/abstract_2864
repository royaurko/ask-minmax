We consider a Brownian particle in a harmonic trap. The location of the trap
is modulated according to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We investigate the
fluctuation of the work done by the modulated trap on the Brownian particle in
a given time interval in the steady state. We compute the large deviation as
well as the complete asymptotic form of the probability density function of the
work done. The theoretical asymptotic forms of the probability density function
are in very good agreement with the numerics. We also discuss the validity of
the fluctuation theorem for this system.
