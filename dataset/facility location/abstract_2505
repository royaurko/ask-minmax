Neutron total cross sections of $^{197}$Au and $^\text{nat}$Ta have been
measured at the nELBE photoneutron source in the energy range from 0.1 - 10 MeV
with a statistical uncertainty of up to 2 % and a total systematic uncertainty
of 1 %. This facility is optimized for the fast neutron energy range and
combines an excellent time structure of the neutron pulses (electron bunch
width 5 ps) with a short flight path of 7 m. Because of the low instantaneous
neutron flux transmission measurements of neutron total cross sections are
possible, that exhibit very different beam and background conditions than found
at other neutron sources.
