In this paper we present a methodology to address the problem of brain tissue
deformation referred to as 'brain-shift'. This deformation occurs throughout a
neurosurgery intervention and strongly alters the accuracy of the
neuronavigation systems used to date in clinical routine which rely solely on
pre-operative patient imaging to locate the surgical target, such as a tumour
or a functional area. After a general description of the framework of our
intra-operative image-guided system, we describe a procedure to generate
patient specific finite element meshes of the brain and propose a biomechanical
model which can take into account tissue deformations and surgical procedures
that modify the brain structure, like tumour or tissue resection.
