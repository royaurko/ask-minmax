The penumbra is ideally suited to challenge our understanding of
magnetohydrodynamics. The energy transport takes place as magnetoconvection in
inclined magnetic fields under the effect of strong radiative cooling at the
surface. The relevant processes happen at small spatial scales. In this
contribution we describe and elaborate on these small-scale inhomogeneities of
a sunspot penumbra. We describe the penumbral properties inferred from imaging,
spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric data, and discuss the question of how
these observations can be understood in terms of proposed models and
theoretical concepts.
