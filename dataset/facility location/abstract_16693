First experimental evidence of the population of the first 2- state in 16C
above the neutron threshold is obtained by neutron knockout from 17C on a
hydrogen target. The invariant mass method combined with in-beam gamma-ray
detection is used to locate the state at 5.45(1) MeV. Comparison of its
populating cross section and parallel momentum distribution with a Glauber
model calculation utilizing the shell-model spectroscopic factor confirms the
core-neutron removal nature of this state. Additionally, a previously known
unbound state at 6.11 MeV and a new state at 6.28(2) MeV are observed. The
position of the first 2- state, which belongs to a member of the lowest-lying
p-sd cross shell transition, is reasonably well described by the shell-model
calculation using the WBT interaction.
