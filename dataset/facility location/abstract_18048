We study the geodesic motion of massive and massless test particles in the
background of equally spinning Myers-Perry-AdS black holes in five dimensions.
By adopting a coordinate system that makes manifest the cohomogeneity-1
property of these spacetimes, the equations of motion simplify considerably.
This allows us to easily separate the radial motion from the angular part and
to obtain solutions for angular trajectories in a compact closed form. For the
radial motion we focus our attention on spherical orbits. In particular, we
determine the timelike innermost stable spherical orbits (ISSOs) for these
asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes, as well as the location of null
spherical orbits. We find that the ISSO dives below the ergosurface for black
holes rotating close to extremality and merges with the event horizon exactly
at extremality, in analogy with the four-dimensional Kerr case. For
sufficiently massive black holes in AdS there exists a spin parameter range in
which the background spacetime is stable against superradiance and the ISSO
lies inside the ergoregion. Our results for massless geodesics show that there
are no stable spherical null orbits outside the horizon, but there exist such
orbits inside the horizon, as well as around over-extremal spacetimes, i.e.,
naked singularities. We also discuss how these orbits deform from the static to
the rotating case.
