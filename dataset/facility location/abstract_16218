Galactic Ring Survey (GRS) of 13 CO (1-0) emission covers Galactic longitudes
18 deg < l < 55.7 deg and Galactic latitudes |b| <= 1 deg. Using the SEQUOIA
array on the FCRAO 14m telescope, the GRS fully sampled the 13 CO Galactic
emission (46 arcsec angular resolution on a 22 arcsec grid) and achieved a
spectral resolution of 0.21 km/s. Because the GRS uses 13 CO, an optically thin
tracer, rather than 12 CO, an optically thick tracer, the GRS allows a much
better determination of column density and also a cleaner separation of
velocity components along a line of sight. With this homogeneous, fully-sampled
survey of 13 CO, emission, we have identified 829 molecular clouds and 6124
clumps throughout the inner Galaxy using the CLUMPFIND algorithm. Here we
present details of the catalog and a preliminary analysis of the properties of
the molecular clouds and their clumps. Moreover, we compare clouds inside and
outside of the 5 kpc ring and find that clouds within the ring typically have
warmer temperatures, higher column densities, larger areas, and more clumps
compared to clouds located outside the ring. This is expected if these clouds
are actively forming stars. This catalog provides a useful tool for the study
of molecular clouds and their embedded young stellar objects.
