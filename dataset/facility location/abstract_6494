It is shown that the local density of states (LDOS), measured in an Scanning
Tunneling Microscopy (STM) experiment, at a single tip position contains
oscillations as a function of Energy, due to quasiparticle interference, which
is related to the positions of nearby scatterers. We propose a method of STM
data analysis based on this idea, which can be used to locate the scatterers.
In the case of a superconductor, the method can potentially distinguish the
nature of the scattering by a particular impurity.
