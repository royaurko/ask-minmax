We report the discovery of new pre-main sequence (PMS) stars in the Lagoon
Nebula (M8) at a distance of 1.25 kpc, based on intermediate resolution spectra
obtained with the Boller & Chivens spectrograph at the 6.5-m Magellan I
telescope (Las Campanas Observatory, Chile). According to the spectral types,
the presence of emission lines and the lithium 6708A absorption line, we are
able to identify 27 classical T Tauri stars, 7 weak-lined T Tauri stars and 3
PMS emission objects with spectral type G, which we include in a separated
stellar class denominated "PMS Fe/Ge class". Using near-infrared photometry
either from 2MASS or from our own previous work we derive effective
temperatures and luminosities for these stars and locate them in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, in order to estimate their masses and ages. We
find that almost all of our sample stars are younger than 3 10^6 years and span
over a range of masses between 0.8 and 2.5 Msun. A cross-correlation between
our spectroscopic data and the X-ray sources detected with the Chandra ACIS
instrument is also presented.
