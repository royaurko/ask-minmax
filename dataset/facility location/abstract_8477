We extract the resonant orbits from an N-body bar that is a good
representation of the Milky Way, using the method recently introduced by Molloy
et al. (2015). By decomposing the bar into its constituent orbit families, we
show that they are intimately connected to the boxy-peanut shape of the
density. We highlight the imprint due solely to resonant orbits on the
kinematic landscape towards the Galactic centre. The resonant orbits are shown
to have distinct kinematic features and may be used to explain the cold
velocity peak seen in the APOGEE commissioning data (Nidever at al., 2012). We
show that high velocity peaks are a natural consequence of the motions of stars
in the 2:1 orbit family and that stars on other higher order resonances can
contribute to the peaks. The locations of the peaks vary with bar angle and,
with the tacit assumption that the observed peaks are due to the 2:1 family, we
find that the locations of the high velocity peaks correspond to bar angles in
the range 10 < theta_bar < 25 (deg). However, some important questions about
the nature of the peaks remain, such as their apparent absence in other surveys
of the Bulge and the deviations from symmetry between equivalent fields in the
north and south. We show that the absence of a peak in surveys at higher
latitudes is likely due to the combination of a less prominent peak and a lower
number density of bar supporting orbits at these latitudes.
