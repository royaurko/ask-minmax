We present a radio survey of X-ray sources in the Large and Small Magellanic
clouds with the Australia Telescope Compact Array at 6.3 and 3.5 cm.
Specifically, we have observed the fields of five LMC and two SMC supersoft
X-ray sources, the X-ray binaries LMC X-1, X-2, X-3 & X-4, the X-ray transient
Nova SMC 1992, and the soft gamma-ray repeater SGR 0525-66. None of the targets
are detected as point sources at their catalogued positions. In particular, the
proposed supersoft jet source RXJ 0513-69 is not detected, placing constraints
on its radio luminosity compared to Galactic jet sources. Limits on emission
from the black hole candidate systems LMC X-1 and X-3 are consistent with the
radio behaviour of persistent Galactic black hole X-ray binaries, and a
previous possible radio detection of LMC X-1 is found to almost certainly be
due to nearby field sources. The SNR N49 in the field of SGR 0525-66 is mapped
at higher resolution than previously, but there is still no evidence for any
enhanced emission or disruption of the SNR at the location of the X-ray source.
