The TerraServer stores aerial, satellite, and topographic images of the earth
in a SQL database available via the Internet. It is the world's largest online
atlas, combining five terabytes of image data from the United States Geological
Survey (USGS) and SPIN-2. This report describes the system-redesign based on
our experience over the last year. It also reports usage and operations results
over the last year -- over 2 billion web hits and over 20 Terabytes of imagry
served over the Internet. Internet browsers provide intuitive spatial and text
interfaces to the data. Users need no special hardware, software, or knowledge
to locate and browse imagery. This paper describes how terabytes of "Internet
unfriendly" geo-spatial images were scrubbed and edited into hundreds of
millions of "Internet friendly" image tiles and loaded into a SQL data
warehouse. Microsoft TerraServer demonstrates that general-purpose relational
database technology can manage large scale image repositories, and shows that
web browsers can be a good geospatial image presentation system.
