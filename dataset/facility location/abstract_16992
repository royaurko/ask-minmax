We consider here the recently proposed closed form formula in terms of the
Meijer G-functions for the probability density functions $g_\alpha(x)$ of
one-sided L\'evy stable distributions with rational index $\alpha=l/k$, with
$0<\alpha<1$. Since one-sided L\'evy and Mittag-Leffler distributions are known
to be related, this formula could also be useful for calculating the
probability density functions $\rho_\alpha(x)$ of the latter. We show, however,
that the formula is computationally inviable for fractions with large
denominators, being unpractical even for some modest values of $l$ and $k$. We
present a fast and accurate numerical scheme, based on an early integral
representation due to Mikusinski, for the evaluation of $g_\alpha(x)$ and
$\rho_\alpha(x)$, their cumulative distribution function and their derivatives
for any real index $\alpha\in (0,1)$. As an application, we explore some
properties of these probability density functions. In particular, we determine
the location and value of their maxima as functions of the index $\alpha$. We
show that $\alpha \approx 0.567$ and $\alpha \approx 0.605$ correspond,
respectively, to the one-sided L\'evy and Mittag-Leffler distributions with
shortest maxima. We close by discussing how our results can elucidate some
recently described dynamical behavior of intermittent systems.
