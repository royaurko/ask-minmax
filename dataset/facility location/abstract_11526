We perform molecular dynamics simulations of a model glass-forming liquid to
measure the size of kinetic heterogeneities, using a dynamic susceptibility
$\chi_{\rm ss}(a, t)$ that quantifies the number of particles whose dynamics
are correlated on the length scale $a$ and time scale $t$. By measuring
$\chi_{\rm ss}(a, t)$ as a function of both $a$ and $t$, we locate local maxima
$\chi^\star$ at distances $a^\star$ and times $t^\star$. Near the dynamical
glass transition, we find two types of maxima, both correlated with crossovers
in the dynamical behavior: a smaller maximum corresponding to the crossover
from ballistic to sub-diffusive motion, and a larger maximum corresponding to
the crossover from sub-diffusive to diffusive motion. Our results indicate that
kinetic heterogeneities are not necessarily signatures of an impending glass or
jamming transition.
