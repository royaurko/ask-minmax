During five years of Chandra observations, we have identified seven X-ray
transients located within 23 pc of Sgr A*. These sources each vary in
luminosity by more than a factor of 10, and have peak X-ray luminosities
greater than 5e33 erg/s, which strongly suggests that they are accreting black
holes or neutron stars. The peak luminosities of the transients are
intermediate between those typically considered outburst and quiescence for
X-ray binaries. Remarkably four of these transients lie within only 1 pc of Sgr
A*. This implies that, compared to the numbers of similar systems located
between 1 and 23 pc, transients are over-abundant by a factor of 20 per unit
stellar mass within 1 pc of Sgr A*. It is likely that the excess transient
X-ray sources are low-mass X-ray binaries that were produced, as in the cores
of globular clusters, by three-body interactions between binary star systems
and either black holes or neutron stars that have been concentrated in the
central parsec through dynamical friction. Alternatively, they could be
high-mass X-ray binaries that formed among the young stars that are present in
the central parsec.
