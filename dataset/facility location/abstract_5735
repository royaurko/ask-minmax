I present the latest results from a search for hot molecular cores at
mid-infrared wavelengths from the largest optical telescopes available at the
present time. Three well-observed hot molecular cores were imaged, G29.96-0.02,
G19.61-0.23, and G34.26+0.15. Even though mid-infrared sources have been
claimed to be detected previously at the hot molecular core locations of both
G19.61-0.23 and G34.26+0.15, only the hot molecular core in G29.96-0.02
resulted in a detection. New upper limits on mid-infrared emission are given
for the hot molecular cores that were not detected.
