We study two classes of static uniform black string solutions in a
(4+1)-dimensional SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills model. These configurations possess
a regular event horizon and corresponds in a 4-dimensional picture to axially
symmetric black hole solutions in an Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs-U(1)-dilaton
theory. In this approach, one set of solutions possesses a nonzero magnetic
charge, while the other solutions represent black holes located in between a
monopole-antimonopole pair. A detailed analysis of the solutions' properties is
presented, the domain of existence of the black strings being determined. New
four dimensional solutions are found by boosting the five dimensional
configurations. We also present an argument for the non-existence of finite
mass hyperspherically symmetric black holes in SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills
theory.
