The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) is a joint project between
astronomical organizations in Europe, USA and Japan. ALMA will consist of at
least 64 12-meter antennas operating in the millimeter and sub-millimeter
wavelength range, with baselines up to 10 km. It will be located at an altitude
above 5000m in the Chilean Atacama desert[1]. The ALMA Common Software (ACS)
provides a software infrastructure common to all partners and consists of a
documented collection of common patterns in control systems and of components,
which implement those patterns. The heart of ACS is an object model of
controlled devices, called Distributed Objects (DOs), implemented as CORBA
network objects. Components such as antenna mount, power supply, etc. are
defined by means of DOs. A code generator creates Java Bean components for each
DO. Programmers can write Java client applications by connecting those Beans
with data-manipulation and visualization Beans using commercial visual
development tools or programmatically. ACS is based on the experience
accumulated with similar projects in the astronomical and particle accelerator
contexts, reusing and extending concepts and components. Although designed for
ALMA, ACS has the potential for being used in other new control systems and
other distributed software projects, since it implements proven design patterns
using state of the art, stable and reliable technology.
