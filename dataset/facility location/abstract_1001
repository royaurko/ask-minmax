Using multi-epoch JHK photometry obtained with the 1.4-m Japanese-South
African Infrared Survey Facility at Sutherland we have identified large numbers
of AGB variables in NGC 6822. This paper uses 30 large amplitude variables,
with periods ranging from about 200 to 900 days, to provide a new calibration
of the period-luminosity relation.
