The lack of reliable cluster samples at intermediate and high redshift has
motivated many optical/infrared and X-ray cluster searches. The motivation of
such searches is well justified: the abundance of massive collapsed regions
gives a direct constraint on Omega(matter). Alternatively, the
Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) offers a robust method for the detection of
clusters which is, almost, independent of redshift. In this paper we comment on
the possibility of mapping the SZE at high resolution in the millimeter regime
using the Large Millimeter Telescope/Gran Telescopio Milimetrico (LMT/GTM) and
the bolometer array BOLOCAM. The construction of the LMT/GTM facility is
underway atop Cerro La Negra (latitude=18deg 59min; height=4600 m) in Mexico.
