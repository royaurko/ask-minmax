WWW has a scale-free structure where novel information is often difficult to
locate. Moreover, Intelligent agents easily get trapped in this structure. Here
a novel method is put forth, which turns these traps into information
repositories, supplies: We populated an Internet environment with intelligent
news foragers. Foraging has its associated cost whereas foragers are rewarded
if they detect not yet discovered novel information. The intelligent news
foragers crawl by using the estimated long-term cumulated reward, and also have
a finite sized memory: the list of most promising supplies. Foragers form an
artificial life community: the most successful ones are allowed to multiply,
while unsuccessful ones die out. The specific property of this community is
that there is no direct communication amongst foragers but the centralized
rewarding system. Still, fast division of work is achieved.
