The International AGN Watch has monitored a number of radio-quiet and
radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei - the most luminous objects in the universe.
We present a review of the main observational results from the continuum
monitoring campaigns, concentrating on those which aim to quantify the
simultaneous ultraviolet to X-ray variability characteristics. These data
provide strong constraints on the proposed continuum emission mechanisms. The
AGN Watch campaigns have made extensive use of a wide variety of both ground-
and space-based multi-waveband observational facilities, and we stress that
long-term simultaneous access to the entire electromagnetic spectrum is
essential if further progress is to be made.
