If space is indistinguishable from the extension of a physical body, as is
Descartes's conception, then transformations of space become transformations of
physical bodies. Every point of space then has properties of physical bodies in
some suitable non-singular sense of average over the space. Every point of
space is then thinkable as a non-singular point particle possessing such
(averaged) physical properties. Then, the location of such a point particle is,
relative to another (similar) point particle, {\em indeterminate} over the
extension of the physical body. Further, transformations of the space may
``move'' such a point particle in relation to another such point particle.
These notions then provide a non-probabilistic explanation of Heisenberg's
indeterminacy relations.
