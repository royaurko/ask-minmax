We do parametric calculations to elucidate multi-terminal electron transport
properties through a molecular system where a single phenalenyl molecule is
attached to semi-infinite one-dimensional metallic leads. A formalism based on
the Green's function technique is used for the calculations while the model is
described by tight-binding Hamiltonian. We explore the transport properties in
terms of conductance, reflection probability as well as current-voltage
characteristic. The most significant feature we articulate is that all these
characteristics are very sensitive to the locations where the leads are
connected and also the molecule-to-lead coupling strengths. The presence of
other leads also has a remarkable effect on these transport properties. We
study these phenomena for two-, three- and four-terminal molecular systems. Our
numerical study may be utilized in designing tailor-made molecular electronic
devices.
