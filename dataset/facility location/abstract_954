Experimental program for the study of dense cold matter is proposed. Droplets
of such a matter are expected to be created in light ion collisions at the
initial energy range of future facilities FAIR and NICA with extremely small
but measurable cross section. Meson (or photon) production at high $p_t$ and
central rapidity region (double cumulative processes domain) is proposed as
possible effective trigger (selection criteria) for such study.
