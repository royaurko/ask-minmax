Several interesting features of coset models "without fixed points" are
easily understood via Chern-Simons theory. In this paper we derive explicit
formulae for the handle-squashing operator in these cosets. These operators are
fixed, linear combinations of the irreducible representations of the coset. As
a simple application of these curious formulae, we compute the traces of all
genus-one operators for several common cosets. (1 Figure, at end in
