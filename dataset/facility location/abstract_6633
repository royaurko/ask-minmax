Earlier investigations showed local minima in the monopole-antimonopole
potential in U(1) gauge theory on the lattice. In this paper we localize
monopoles of Monte-Carlo configurations. A statistical analysis of localization
measurements gives us the probability density which we compare with the
potential found in [1]. We find the monopoles mainly located either in the
center of three-dimensional cubes or on the interface between two cubes. This
agrees with the position of minima and maxima of the monopole-antimonopole
potential.
