The neutron capture cross section of Bi209 has been measured at the CERN n
TOF facility by employing the pulse-height-weighting technique. Improvements
over previous measurements are mainly because of an optimized detection system,
which led to a practically negligible neutron sensitivity. Additional
experimental sources of systematic error, such as the electronic threshold in
the detectors, summing of gamma-rays, internal electron conversion, and the
isomeric state in bismuth, have been taken into account. Gamma-ray absorption
effects inside the sample have been corrected by employing a nonpolynomial
weighting function. Because Bi209 is the last stable isotope in the reaction
path of the stellar s-process, the Maxwellian averaged capture cross section is
important for the recycling of the reaction flow by alpha-decays. In the
relevant stellar range of thermal energies between kT=5 and 8 keV our new
capture rate is about 16% higher than the presently accepted value used for
nucleosynthesis calculations. At this low temperature an important part of the
heavy Pb-Bi isotopes are supposed to be synthesized by the s-process in the He
shells of low mass, thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars. With the
improved set of cross sections we obtain an s-process fraction of 19(3)% of the
solar bismuth abundance, resulting in an r-process residual of 81(3)%. The
present (n,gamma) cross-section measurement is also of relevance for the design
of accelerator driven systems based on a liquid metal Pb/Bi spallation target.
