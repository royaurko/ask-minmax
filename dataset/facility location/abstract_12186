We present the results of a wide-field survey using the 1.2-m Samuel Oschin
Telescope at Palomar Observatory. This survey was designed to find the most
distant members of the Kuiper belt and beyond. We searched ~12,000 deg2 down to
a mean limiting magnitude of 21.3 in R. A total number of 52 KBOs and Centaurs
have been detected, 25 of which were discovered in this survey. Except for the
re-detection of Sedna, no additional Sedna-like bodies with perihelia greater
than 45 AU were detected despite sensitivity out to distances of 1000 AU. We
discuss the implications for a distant Sedna- like population beyond the Kuiper
belt, focusing on the constraints we can place on the embedded stellar cluster
environment the early Sun may be have been born in, where the location and
distribution of Sedna-like orbits sculpted by multiple stellar encounters is
indicative of the birth cluster size. We also report our observed latitude
distribution and implications for the size of the plutino population.
