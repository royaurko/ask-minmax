We discuss new, high sensitivity HI observations of the spiral galaxy NGC2403
which show extended emission at anomalous velocities with respect to the `cold'
disk. This `anomalous' gas component (~1/10 of the total HI mass) is probably
located in the region of the halo and rotates more slowly (~20-50 km/s) than
the gas in the disk. Moreover, it shows a distortion in the velocity field that
we interpret as a large-scale radial motion (10-20 km/s inflow) towards the
centre of the galaxy. The most likely explanation for its origin and kinematics
seems to be that of a galactic fountain. There is, however, a significant part
of the anomalous gas which seems to be moving contrary to rotation and is
difficult to understand in such a picture. These anomalous gas complexes
discovered in NGC 2403 may be analogous to the High Velocity Clouds of our
Galaxy. They may be rather common in spiral galaxies and not have been detected
yet for lack of sensitivity.
