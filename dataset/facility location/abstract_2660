The role played by baryonic resonances in the production of final states
containing strangeness for proton-proton reactions at 3.5 GeV measured by HADES
is discussed by means of several very different measurements. First the
associate production of $\Delta$ resonances accompanying final states with
strange hadrons is presented, then the role of interferences among N$^*$
resonances, as measured by HADES for the first time, is summarised. Last but
not least the role played by heavy resonances, with a mass larger than $2$
GeV/c$^2$ in the production of strange and non-strange hadrons is discussed.
Experimental evidence for the presence of a $\Delta(2000)^{++}$ are presented
and hypotheses are discussed employing the contribution of similar objects to
populate the excesses measured by HADES for the $\Xi$ in A+A and p+A collisions
and in the dilepton sector for A+A collisions. This extensive set of results
helps to better understand the dynamic underlaying particle production in
elementary reactions and sets a more solid basis for the understanding of heavy
ion collisions at the same energies and even higher as planned at the FAIR
facility.
