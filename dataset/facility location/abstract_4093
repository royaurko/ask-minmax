We discuss observations of chromospheric evaporation for a complex flare that
occurred on 9 March 2012 near 03:30 UT obtained from the Extreme-ultraviolet
Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on the Hinode spacecraft. This was a multiple event
with a strong energy input that reached the M1.8 class when observed by EIS.
EIS obtained a full-CCD spectrum of the flare. Chromospheric evaporation
characterized by 150-200 km/s upflows was observed in multiple locations in
multi-million degree spectral lines of flare ions such as Fe XXII, Fe XXIII,
and Fe XXIV, with simultaneous 20-60 km/s upflows in million degree coronal
lines from ions such as Fe XII - Fe XVI. The behavior of cooler, transition
region ions such as O VI, Fe VIII, He II, and Fe X is more complex, but upflows
were also observed in Fe VIII and Fe X lines. At a point close to strong energy
input in space and time, the flare ions Fe XXII, Fe XXIII, and Fe XXIV reveal
an isothermal source with a temperature close to 14 MK and no strong
blueshifted components. At this location there is a strong downflow in cooler
active region lines from ions such as Fe XIII and Fe XIV. We speculate that
this downflow may be evidence of the downward shock produced by reconnection in
the current sheet seen in MHD simulations. A sunquake also occurred near this
location.
