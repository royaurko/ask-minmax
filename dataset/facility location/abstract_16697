We introduce a Bayesian model for estimating the distribution of ambulance
travel times on each road segment in a city, using Global Positioning System
(GPS) data. Due to sparseness and error in the GPS data, the exact ambulance
paths and travel times on each road segment are unknown. We simultaneously
estimate the paths, travel times, and parameters of each road segment travel
time distribution using Bayesian data augmentation. To draw ambulance path
samples, we use a novel reversible jump Metropolis-Hastings step. We also
introduce two simpler estimation methods based on GPS speed data. We compare
these methods to a recently published travel time estimation method, using
simulated data and data from Toronto EMS. In both cases, out-of-sample point
and interval estimates of ambulance trip times from the Bayesian method
outperform estimates from the alternative methods. We also construct
probability-of-coverage maps for ambulances. The Bayesian method gives more
realistic maps than the recently published method. Finally, path estimates from
the Bayesian method interpolate well between sparsely recorded GPS readings and
are robust to GPS location errors.
