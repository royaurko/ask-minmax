This paper describes the Maryland-Magellan Tunable Filter (MMTF) on the
Magellan-Baade 6.5-meter telescope. MMTF is based on a 150-mm clear aperture
Fabry-Perot (FP) etalon that operates in low orders and provides transmission
bandpass and central wavelength adjustable from ~5 to ~15 A and from ~5000 to
over ~9200 A, respectively. It is installed in the Inamori Magellan Areal
Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS) and delivers an image quality of ~0.5" over a
field of view of 27' in diameter (monochromatic over ~10'). This versatile and
easy-to-operate instrument has been used over the past three years for a wide
variety of projects. This paper first reviews the basic principles of FP
tunable filters, then provides a detailed description of the hardware and
software associated with MMTF and the techniques developed to observe with this
instrument and reduce the data. The main lessons learned in the course of the
commissioning and implementation of MMTF are highlighted next, before
concluding with a brief outlook on the future of MMTF and of similar facilities
which are soon coming on line.
