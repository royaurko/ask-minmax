Super-Earths with orbital periods less than 100 days are extremely abundant
around Sun-like stars. It is unlikely that these planets formed at their
current locations. Rather, they likely formed at large distances from the star
and subsequently migrated inward. Here we use N-body simulations to study the
effect of super-Earths on the accretion of rocky planets. In our simulations,
one or more super-Earths migrates inward through a disk of planetary embryos
and planetesimals embedded in a gaseous disk. We tested a wide range of
migration speeds and configurations. Fast-migrating super-Earths ($\tau_{mig}
\sim$0.01-0.1 Myr) only have a modest effect on the protoplanetary embryos and
planetesimals. Sufficient material survives to form rocky, Earth-like planets
on orbits exterior to the super-Earths'. In contrast, slowly migrating
super-Earths shepherd rocky material interior to their orbits and strongly
deplete the terrestrial planet-forming zone. In this situation any Earth-sized
planets in the habitable zone are extremely volatile-rich and are therefore
probably not Earth-like.
