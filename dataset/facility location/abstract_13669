Recent advances in statistical theory, together with advances in the
computational power of computers, provide alternative methods to do
mass-univariate hypothesis testing in which a large number of univariate tests,
can be properly used to compare MEEG data at a large number of time-frequency
points and scalp locations. One of the major problematic aspects of this kind
of mass-univariate analysis is due to high number of accomplished hypothesis
tests. Hence procedures that remove or alleviate the increased probability of
false discoveries are crucial for this type of analysis. Here, I propose a new
method for mass-univariate analysis of MEEG data based on cross-validation
scheme. In this method, I suggest a hierarchical classification procedure under
k-fold cross-validation to detect which sensors at which time-bin and which
frequency-bin contributes in discriminating between two different stimuli or
tasks. To achieve this goal, a new feature extraction method based on the
discrete cosine transform (DCT) employed to get maximum advantage of all three
data dimensions. Employing cross-validation and hierarchy architecture
alongside the DCT feature space makes this method more reliable and at the same
time enough sensitive to detect the narrow effects in brain activities.
