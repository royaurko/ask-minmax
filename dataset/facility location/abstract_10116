We introduce horizon pretracking as a method for analysing numerically
generated spacetimes of merging black holes. Pretracking consists of following
certain modified constant expansion surfaces during a simulation before a
common apparent horizon has formed. The tracked surfaces exist at all times,
and are defined so as to include the common apparent horizon if it exists. The
method provides a way for finding this common apparent horizon in an efficient
and reliable manner at the earliest possible time. We can distinguish inner and
outer horizons by examining the distortion of the surface. Properties of the
pretracking surface such as its expansion, location, shape, area, and angular
momentum can also be used to predict when a common apparent horizon will
appear, and its characteristics. The latter could also be used to feed back
into the simulation by adapting e.g. boundary or gauge conditions even before
the common apparent horizon has formed.
