The fourth part of the OGLE-III Catalog of Variable Stars presents 91 995
long-period variables (LPVs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This sample
consists of 79 200 OGLE Small Amplitude Red Giants (OSARGs), 11 128 semiregular
variables (SRVs) and 1667 Mira stars. The catalog data include basic
photometric and astrometric properties of these stars, long-term multi-epoch VI
photometry and finding charts.
  We describe the methods used for the identification and classification of
LPVs. The distribution of I-band amplitudes for carbon-rich stars shows two
maxima, corresponding to Miras and SRVs. Such a distinction between Miras and
SRVs is not obvious for oxygen-rich stars. We notice additional
period-luminosity sequence located between Wood's sequences C and C' and
populated by SRVs.
