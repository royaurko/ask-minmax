Modern earthwork compaction rollers collect location and compaction
information as they traverse a compaction site. These data are indirectly
observed through non-linear measurement operators, inherently multivariate with
complex correlation structures, and collected in huge quantities. The nature of
such data was investigated at a large, atypically compacted test bed in
Florida, USA. Exploratory analysis of this data through detrending and
empirical semivariogram estimation is performed. A second analysis using a
sequential, spatial backfitting algorithm is used to investigate the importance
of driving direction of the roller.
