Wireless sensor networks consist of sensor nodes with limited computational
and communication capabilities. This paper deals with mobile sensors which are
divided into clusters based on their physical locations. Efficient ways of key
distribution among the sensors and inter and intra cluster communications are
examined. The security of the entire network is considered through efficient
key management by taking into consideration the network's power capabilities.
