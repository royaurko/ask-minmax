Understanding how spatial configurations of economic activity emerge is
important when formulating spatial planning and economic policy. Not only
micro-simulation and agent-based model such as UrbanSim, ILUMAS and SIMFIRMS,
but also Simon's model of hierarchical concentration have widely applied, for
this purpose. These models, however, have limitations with respect to
simulating structural changes in spatial economic systems and the impact of
proximity. The present paper proposes a model of firm development that is based
on behavioural rules such as growth, closure, spin-off and relocation. An
important aspect of the model is that locational preferences of firms are based
on agglomeration advantages, accessibility of markets and congestion, allowing
for a proper description of concentration and deconcentration tendencies. By
comparing the outcomes of the proposed model with real world data, we will
calibrate the parameters and assess how well the model predicts existing
spatial configurations and decide. The model is implemented as an agent-based
simulation model describing firm development in the Netherlands in 21
industrial sectors from 1950 to 2004.
