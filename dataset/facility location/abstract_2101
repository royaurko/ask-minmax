Nowadays we believe that a typical galaxy contains about $10^7$ stellar-mass
black holes and a single super-massive black hole at its center. According to
general relativity, these objects are characterized solely by their mass $M$
and by their spin parameter $a_*$. A fundamental limit for a black hole in
general relativity is the Kerr bound $|a_*| \le 1$, but the accretion process
can spin it up to $a_* \approx 0.998$. If a compact object is not a black hole,
the Kerr bound does not hold and in this letter I provide some evidences
suggesting that the accretion process could spin the body up to $a_* > 1$.
While this fact should be negligible for stellar-mass objects, some of the
super-massive objects at the center of galaxies may actually be super-spinning
bodies exceeding the Kerr bound. Such a possibility can be tested by
gravitational wave detectors like LISA or by sub-millimeter very long baseline
interferometry facilities.
