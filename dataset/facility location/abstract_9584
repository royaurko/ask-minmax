The generation of solar non-axisymmetric magnetic fields is studied based on
a linear alpha2-Omega dynamo model in a rotating spherical frame. The model
consists of a solar-like differential rotation, a magnetic diffusivity varied
with depth, and three types of alpha-effects with different locations, i.e. the
tachocline, the whole convective zone and the sub-surface. Some comparisons of
the critical alpha-values of axisymmetric m=0 and longitude-dependent modes
m=1,2,3 are presented to show the roles of the magnetic diffusivity in the
problem of modes selection. With the changing of diffusivity intensity for the
given solar differential rotation system, the dominant mode possibly changes
likewise and the stronger the diffusivity is, the easier the non-axisymmetric
modes are excited. The influence of the diffusivity and differential rotation
on the configurations of the dominant modes are also presented.
