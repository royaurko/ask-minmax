We present diffraction-limited near-IR images in J, H and K of the nucleus of
NGC 1068, obtained with the Adaptive Optics system {Pueo} at CFHT. The achieved
resolution (0.12") reveals several components, particularly prominent on the
[J-K] image: a) an unresolved, conspicuous core (size < 9 pc); b) an elongated
structure at P.A. ~102 deg, beginning to show up at radius ~ 15 pc; c) a
S-shaped structure with radial extent ~ 20 pc, including a bar-like central
elongation at P.A. ~ 15 deg and two short spiral arms. The K core is at the
location of the putative central engine (radio source S1) : the core is likely
the emission from the hot inner walls of the dust/molecular torus. The
extremely red colors of the central 0.2", [J-K]=7.0, [H-K]=3.8, lead to an
extinction Av > 25. The elongated structure at P.A.~ 102 deg may trace the
presence of cooler dust within and around the torus. This interpretation is
supported by two facts : a) the elongated structure is perpendicular to the
local radio jet originating at S1; b) its direction follows exactly that of the
disk of ionized gas recently found with the VLBA. The S-shaped feature suggests
an extremely compact barred spiral structure, that would be the innermost of a
series of nested spiral structures, as predicted by simulations. This is
supported by the inner stellar distribution - deduced from the J image - which
clearly follows an exponential disk with a 19 pc scale-length, precisely that
expected from the rotation of a bar.
