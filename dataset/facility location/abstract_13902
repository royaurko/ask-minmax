Petschek-type time-dependent reconnection (TDR) and quasi-stationary
reconnection (QSR) models are considered to understand reconnection outflow
structures and the features of the associated locally generated turbulence in
the solar wind. We show that the outflow structures, such as discontinuites,
Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) unstable flux tubes or continuous space filling flows
cannot be distinguished from one-point WIND measurements. In both models the
reconnection outflows can generate more or less spatially extended turbulent
boundary layers (TBDs). The structure of an unique extended reconnection
outflow is investigated in detail. The analysis of spectral scalings and break
locations show that reconnection outflows can control the local field and
plasma conditions which may play in favor of one or another turbulent
dissipation mechanisms with their characteristic scales and wavenumbers.
