A solid-state laser system that produces a 1MHz pulse train of 800 pulses
with 18 mJ per pulse at the wavelength of 263.5 nm has been developed to meet
the requirements of the TESLA Test Facility (TTF) at Fermilab and in operation
since 1998.[1,2] Besides the production of high charges, high brightness
electron beams, the need for high bunch charge stability requires that each
laser pulse in the pulse train must have the same energy, and the energy per
laser pulse should not vary significantly from shot to shot. This motivates the
stability analysis of the laser system for the TTF photoinjector.
