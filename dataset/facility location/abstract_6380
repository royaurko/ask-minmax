We investigate the local energy decay of solutions of the Dirac equation in
the non-extreme Kerr-Newman metric. First, we write the Dirac equation as a
Cauchy problem and define the Dirac operator. It is shown that the Dirac
operator is selfadjoint in a suitable Hilbert space. With the RAGE theorem, we
show that for each particle its energy located in any compact region outside of
the event horizon of the Kerr-Newman black hole decays in the time mean.
