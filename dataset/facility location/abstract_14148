The rise of smart applications has drawn interest to logical reasoning over
data streams. Recently, different query languages and stream
processing/reasoning engines were proposed in different communities. However,
due to a lack of theoretical foundations, the expressivity and semantics of
these diverse approaches are given only informally. Towards clear
specifications and means for analytic study, a formal framework is needed to
define their semantics in precise terms. To this end, we present a first step
towards an ideal semantics that allows for exact descriptions and comparisons
of stream reasoning systems.
