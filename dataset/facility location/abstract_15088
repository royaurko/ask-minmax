We present Chandra observations of the cool cluster A168, for which previous
X-ray imaging and optical studies indicated a merger of two subclusters nearly
in the plane of the sky. We derive a temperature map for A168, which shows that
the merger has proceeded beyond the core passage and is near subcluster
turnaround. It also reveals an unusual feature -- the gas core of one of the
subclusters forms a tongue-like structure extending ahead (in the direction of
motion) of the subcluster center. The coolest cluster gas is found in a
crescent-shaped region at the tip of this tongue, and forms a cold front in
pressure equilibrium with the external gas. In contrast with this feature's
forward location, previously observed merger cold fronts (e.g., A3667,
1E0657--56) lagged behind their host subclusters, as expected in the presense
of ram pressure. We propose that A168 illustrates a much later stage in the
evolution of a cold front, when its host subcluster approaches the apocenter of
the merger orbit where the ram pressure on its gas drops sharply. As a result,
a large chunk of the subcluster gas ``slingshots'' past the dark matter center,
becomes unbound from the subcluster and expands adiabatically, as seen in some
recent hydrodynamic simulations.
