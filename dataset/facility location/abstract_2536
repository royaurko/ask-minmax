A Verbal Autopsy is the record of an interview about the circumstances of an
uncertified death. In developing countries, if a death occurs away from health
facilities, a field-worker interviews a relative of the deceased about the
circumstances of the death; this Verbal Autopsy can be reviewed off-site. We
report on a comparative study of the processes involved in Text Classification
applied to classifying Cause of Death: feature value representation; machine
learning classification algorithms; and feature reduction strategies in order
to identify the suitable approaches applicable to the classification of Verbal
Autopsy text. We demonstrate that normalised term frequency and the standard
TFiDF achieve comparable performance across a number of classifiers. The
results also show Support Vector Machine is superior to other classification
algorithms employed in this research. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of employing a "locally-semi-supervised" feature reduction strategy in order to
increase performance accuracy.
