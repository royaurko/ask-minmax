We have made 12CO 2-1 and 1-0 maps of eleven molecular outflows associated
with intermediate to high-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) in order to
establish whether the correlations between outflow parameters and source
bolometric luminosity hold in the high-mass regime. It is important to consider
the effects of Malmquist-type biases when looking at high-mass YSOs, as they
are generally much more distant than their low mass counterparts. We therefore
chose only objects located at ~2kpc. We find that the relations show much more
scatter than is seen in similar studies of low-mass YSOs. We also find that the
mass-spectrum is significantly steeper in high-mass outflows, indicating a
larger mass-fraction at lower velocities, a low collimation factor (~1-2) and
no Hubble-like relationship.
