We study propagation of TM- and TE-polarized light in two-dimensional arrays
of silver nanorods of various diameters in a gelatin background. We calculate
the transmittance, reflectance and absorption of arranged and disordered
nanorod arrays and compare the exact numerical results with the predictions of
the Maxwell-Garnett effective-medium theory. We show that interactions between
nanorods, multipole contributions and formations of photonic gaps affect
strongly the transmittance spectra that cannot be accounted for in terms of the
conventional effective-medium theory. We also demonstrate and explain the
degradation of the transmittance in arrays with randomly located rods as well
as weak influence of their fluctuating diameter. For TM modes we outline the
importance of skin-effect, which causes the full reflection of the incoming
light. We then illustrate the possibility of using periodic arrays of nanorods
as high-quality polarizers.
