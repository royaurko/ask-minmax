The MAKET zero-power heavy water reactor has been used at ITEP to measure the
fission characteristics of the Np, Pu, Am, and Cm isotopes in the
0.52NaF+0.48ZrF_4 melt-filled salt blanket micromodel. The 237Np(n,f),
238Pu(n,f), 239Pu(n,f), 240Pu(n,f), 241Pu(n,f), 242m^Am(n,f), 243Cm(n,f),
245Cm(n,f), 247Cm(n,f), 238U(n,f), 238U(n,g), 235U(n,f) fission reaction rates
have been measured. The neutron spectrum in the isotope irradiation locations
was monitored by measuring the rates of the (235U(n,f), 238U(n,g), 55Mn(n,g),
63Cu(n,g), 176Lu(n,g), 197Au(n,g), 115In(n,n'), 27Al(n,4He), and 64Zn(n,p))
reactions whose cross sections have been commonly accepted. The measured
functionals are compared with the respective results of MCNP code simulation
obtained using the ENDF/B6 and JENDL3.2 neutron databases.
