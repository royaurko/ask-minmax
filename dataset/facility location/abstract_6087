In the exact propagator for finite temperature gluons the location of the
transverse and longitudinal poles in the gluon propagator are unknown functions
of wave vector: $\omega_{T}(k)$ and $\omega_{L}(k)$. The residues of the poles,
also unknown, fix the normalization of the one gluon vector potential and thus
of the field strength. The naive energy density
$\pol{E}\cdot\pol{D}+\pol{B}\cdot\pol{H}$ is not correct because of dispersion.
By keeping the modulations due to the source currents the energy density is
shown to be $\omega_{T}/V$ and $\omega_{L}/V$ regardless of the functional form
of $\omega_{T}(k)$ and $\omega_{L}(k)$. The momentum density is $k/V$. The
resulting energy-momentum tensor is not symmetric.
