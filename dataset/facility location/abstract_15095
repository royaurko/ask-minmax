We have observed continuum emission at lambda = 850 microns over ~4 square
degrees of the Ophiuchus star-forming cloud using SCUBA on the JCMT, producing
a submillimetre continuum map twenty times larger than previous Ophiuchus
surveys. Our sensitivity is 40 mJ/beam, a factor of ~2 less sensitive than
earlier maps. Using an automated identification algorithm, we detect 100
candidate objects. Only two new objects are detected outside the boundary of
previous maps, despite the much wider area surveyed. We compare the
submillimetre continuum map with a map of visual extinction across the
Ophiuchus cloud derived using a combination of 2MASS and R-band data. The total
mass in submillimetre objects is ~ 50 Msun compared with ~ 2000 Msun in
observed cloud mass estimated from the extinction. The submillimetre objects
represent only 2.5% of the cloud mass. A clear association is seen between the
locations of detected submillimetre objects and high visual extinction, with no
objects detected at A_V<7 magnitudes. Using the extinction map, we estimate
pressures within the cloud from P/k ~2x10^5 cm^-3 K in the less-extincted
regions to P/k ~2x10^6 cm^-3 K at the cloud centre. Given our sensitivities,
cold (T_d ~15K) clumps supported by thermal pressure, had they existed, should
have been detected throughout the majority of the map. Such objects may not be
present at low A_V because they may form only where A_V > 15, by some mechanism
(e.g., loss of non-thermal support).
