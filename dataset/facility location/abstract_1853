A program to design a high brilliance electron source suitable for a short
wavelength Linac-based FEL is presented. The goal of the project is to develop
a multi-cell integrated photoinjector capable of delivering 1 nC bunches with
emittance below 1 mm mrad. This will be the first step toward a possible
development of a IV generation light source test facility based on the existing
Trieste Linac. For this purpose a common program between Sincrotrone Trieste
and INFN-Milano has been undertaken. Here a brief description of the program
and the first results of the RF Gun electromagnetic structure with the beam
dynamics on the ELETTRA Linac are presented.
