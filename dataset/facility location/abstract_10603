For the purpose of laser wakefield acceleration, it turned out that also the
injection of electron bunches longer than a plasma wavelength can generate
accelerated femtosecond bunches with relatively low energy spread. This is of
high interest because such injecting bunches can be provided, e.g., by
state-of-the-art photo cathode RF guns. Here we point out that when an e-bunch
is injected in the wakefield it is important to take into account the
ponderomotive scattering of the injecting bunch by the laser pulse in the
vacuum region located in front of the plasma. At low energies of the injected
bunch this scattering results in a significant drop of the collection
efficiency. Larger collection efficiency can by reached with lower intensity
laser pulses and relatively high injection energies. We also estimate the
minimum trapping energy for the injected electrons and the length of the
trapped bunch.
