A well-designed control system facilitates the functions of machine
operation, maintenance and development. In addition, the overall effectiveness
of the control system can be greatly enhanced by providing reliable mechanisms
for coordination and communication, ensuring that these functions work in
concert. For good operability, the information presented to operators should be
consistent, easy to understand and customizable. A maintainable system is
segmented appropriately, allowing a broken element to be quickly identified and
repaired while leaving the balance of the system available. In a research and
development environment, the control system must meet the frequently changing
requirements of a variety of customers. This means the system must be flexible
enough to allow for ongoing modifications with minimal disruptions to
operations. Beyond the hardware and software elements of the control system,
appropriate workflow processes must be in place to maximize system uptime and
allow people to work efficiently. Processes that provide automatic electronic
communication ensure that information is not lost and reaches its destination
in a timely fashion. This paper discusses how these control system design and
quality issues have been applied at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator
Facility.
