Analysis of comprehensive monitoring of 34 gamma-ray bright quasars, BL Lac
objects, and radio galaxies reveals a close connection between events in the
millimeter-wave emission imaged with the VLBA at 43 GHz and flares at gamma-ray
and lower frequencies. Roughly 2/3 of the flares are coincident with the
appearance of a new superluminal knot and/or a flare in the millimeter-wave
"core'" located parsecs from the central engine. This presents a theoretical
challenge to explain how the gamma-ray flux can often be variable on intra-day
time-scales. Possible answers to this include very narrow opening angles of the
jet, small volume filling factors of the highest energy electrons, chaotic
magnetic fields, and turbulent velocity fields relative to the mean jet flow.
