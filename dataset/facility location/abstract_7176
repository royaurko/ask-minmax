Observations are presented showing the doublet CIV 1550 absorption lines
superimposed on the CIV emission in the radio galaxy 0943-242. Within the
errors, the redshift of the absorption system that has a column density of
N_CIV = 10^{14.5 +- 0.1} cm-2 coincides with that of the deep Ly-alpha
absorption trough observed by Rottgering et al. (1995). The gas seen in
absorption has a resolved spatial extent of at least 13 kpc (the size of the
extended emission line region). We first model the absorption and emission gas
as co-spatial components with the same metallicity and degree of excitation.
Using the information provided by the emission and absorption line ratios of
CIV and Ly-alpha, we find that the observed quantities are incompatible with
photoionization or collisional ionization of cloudlets with uniform properties.
We therefore reject the possibility that the absorption and emission phases are
co-spatial and favour the explanation that the absorption gas has low
metallicity and is located further away from the host galaxy (than the emission
line gas). The estimated low metallicity for the absorption gas in 0943-242 (Z
\~ 1% solar) and its proposed location -outer halo outside the radio cocoon-
suggest that its existence preceeds the observed AGN phase and is a vestige of
the initial starburst at the onset of formation of the parent galaxy.
