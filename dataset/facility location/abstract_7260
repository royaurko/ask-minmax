We present three different optical and near-infrared (NIR) data sets for
evolved stars in the Galactic Globular Cluster Omega Cen The comparison between
observations and homogeneous sets of stellar isochrones and Zero-Age Horizontal
Branches provides two reasonable fits. Both of them suggest that the so-called
anomalous branch has a metal-intermediate chemical composition (-1.1 < [Fe/H] <
-0.8) and is located ~500 pc beyond the bulk of Omega Cen stars. These findings
are mainly supported by the shape of the subgiant branch in four different
color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). The most plausible fit requires a higher
reddening, E(B-V)=0.155 vs. 0.12, and suggests that the anomalous branch is
coeval, within empirical and theoretical uncertainties, to the bulk of Omega
Cen stellar populations. This result is supported by the identification of a
sample of faint horizontal branch stars that might be connected with the
anomalous branch. Circumstantial empirical evidence seems to suggest that the
stars in this branch form a clump of stars located beyond the cluster.
