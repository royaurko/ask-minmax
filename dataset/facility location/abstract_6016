The Hawking radiation of Dirac particles in a charged Vaidya - de Sitter
black hole is investigated by using the method of generalized tortoise
coordinate transformation. It is shown that the Hawking radiation of Dirac
particles does not exist for $P_1, Q_2$ components, but for $P_2, Q_1$
components it does. Both the location and the temperature of the event horizon
change with time. The thermal radiation spectrum of Dirac particles is the same
as that of Klein-Gordon particles.
