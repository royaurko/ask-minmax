We present the results of new radio interferometer HI line observations for
the merging galaxy pair NGC 4038/9 (`The Antennae'), obtained using the
Australia Telescope Compact Array. The results improve substantially on those
of van der Hulst (1979) and show in detail the two merging galactic disks and
the two tidal tails produced by their interaction. The small edge-on spiral
dwarf galaxy ESO 572-G045 is also seen near the tip of the southern tail, but
distinct from it. It shows no signs of tidal interaction. The northern tidal
tail of the Antennae shows no HI connection to the disks and has an extension
towards the west. The southern tidal tail is continuous, with a prominent HI
concentration at its tip, roughly at the location of the tidal dwarf galaxy
observed optically by Mirabel, Dottori & Lutz (1992). Clear velocity structure
is seen along the tidal tails and in the galactic disks. Radio continuum images
at 20-cm and 13-cm are also presented, showing the disks in detail.
