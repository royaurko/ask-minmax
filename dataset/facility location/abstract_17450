Recent observations from NASA's Kepler mission detected the first planets in
circumbinary orbits. The question we try to answer is where these planets
formed in the circumbinary disk and how far inside they migrated to reach their
present location. We investigate the first and more delicate phase of planet
formation when planetesimals accumulate to form planetary embryos. We use the
hydrodynamical code FARGO to study the evolution of the disk and of a test
population of planetesimals embedded in it. With this hybrid
hydrodynamical--N--body code we can properly account for the gas drag force on
the planetesimals and for the gravitational force of the disk on them. The
numerical simulations show that the gravity of the eccentric disk on the
planetesimal swarm excites their eccentricities to values much larger than
those induced by the binary perturbations only within 10 AU from the stars.
Moreover, the disk gravity prevents a full alignment of the planetesimal
pericenters. Both these effects lead to large impact velocities, beyond the
critical value for erosion. Planetesimals accumulation in circumbinary disks
appears to be prevented close to the stellar pair by the gravitational
perturbations of the circumbinary disk. The observed planets possibly formed in
the outer regions of the disk and then migrated inside by tidal interaction
with the disk.
