The paper describes the effect of generation of electron and ion fluxes in a
gas discharge, which offers, in particular, to the emergence of "blue jets" and
"elves", observed during thunderstorms. An experimental facility modeling these
phenomena is described. A possibility of generation of strong-current fluxes of
electrons and ions in a straightline gas electric discharge is demonstrated.
