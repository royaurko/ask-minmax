We study the properties of warm absorbers in several active galaxies (AGN)
and present new candidates, using ROSAT X-ray observations. Several aspects of
the characteristics of warm absorbers are discussed, constraints on the density
and location of the ionized material are provided; the impact of the presence
of the warm gas on other observable spectral regions is investigated,
particularly with respect to the possibility of a warm-absorber origin of one
of the known high-ionization emission-line region in AGN; the possibility of
dust mixed with the warm material is critically assessed; and the thermal
stability of the ionized gas is examined. Based on the properties of known warm
absorbers, we then address the question of where else ionized absorbers might
play a role in determining the traits of a class of objects or individual
peculiar objects. In this context, the possibility to produce the steep soft
X-ray spectra of narrow-line Seyfert-1 galaxies by warm absorption is explored,
as compared to the alternative of an accretion-produced soft excess. The
potentiality of explaining the strong spectral variability in RXJ0134-42 and
the drastic flux variability in NGC 5905 via warm absorption is scrutinized.
