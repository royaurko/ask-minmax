On 13 June 2010, an eruptive event occurred near the solar limb. It included
a small filament eruption and the onset of a relatively narrow coronal mass
ejection (CME) surrounded by an extreme ultraviolet wave front recorded by the
Solar Dynamics Observatory's (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) at high
cadence. The ejection was accompanied by a GOES M1.0 soft X-ray flare and a
Type-II radio burst; high-resolution dynamic spectra of the latter were
obtained by the ARTEMIS IV radio spectrograph. The combined observations
enabled a study of the evolution of the ejecta and the EUV wavefront and its
relationship with the coronal shock manifesting itself as metric Type-II burst.
By introducing a novel technique, which deduces a proxy of the EUV compression
ratio from AIA imaging data and compares it with the compression ratio deduced
from the band-split of the Type-II metric radio burst, we are able to infer the
potential source locations of the radio emission of the shock on that AIA
images. Our results indicate that the expansion of the CME ejecta is the source
for both EUV and radio shock emissions. Early in the CME expansion phase, the
Type-II burst seems to originate in the sheath region between the EUV bubble
and the EUV shock front in both radial and lateral directions. This suggests
that both the nose and the flanks of the expanding bubble could have driven the
shock.
