The effect of the wind on the sustain of extreme water waves is investigated
experimentally and numerically. A series of experiments conducted in the Large
Air-Sea Interactions Facility (LASIF) showed that a wind blowing over a
strongly nonlinear short wave group due to the linear focusing of a modulated
wave train may increase the life time of the extreme wave event. The expriments
suggested that the air flow separation that occurs on the leeward side of the
steep crests may sustain longer the maximum of modulation of the
focusing-defocusing cycle. Based on a Boundary-Integral Equation Method and a
pressure distribution over the steep crests given by the Jeffreys'sheltering
theory, similar numerical simulations have confirmed the experimental results
