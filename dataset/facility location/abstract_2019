A combination of observation, theory, modeling, and laboratory plasma
experiments provides a multifaceted approach to develop a much greater
understanding of how magnetic fields arise in galactic settings and how these
magnetic fields mediate important processes that affect the dynamics,
distribution, and composition of galactic plasmas. An important emphasis below
is the opportunity to connect laboratory experiments to astrophysics. This
approach is especially compelling for the galactic neighborhood, where the
distribution and character of magnetic fields can be observed with greater
detail than what is possible elsewhere in the universe. The ability to produce
laboratory plasmas with unparalleled accessibility permits an even greater
level of detail to be assessed and exposed. Theory and modeling provide
fundamental ways to understand important processes, and they act as the bridge
to connect experimental validation to astronomical observations. In many cases
the studies that utilize this approach can make use of existing laboratory
facilities, resulting in a cost that is quite small compared to the cost of
measurements in dedicated space missions.
