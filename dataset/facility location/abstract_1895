The paper describes the SPHINX facility which includes a wide-aperture
magnetic spectrometer with scintillation counters and hodoscopes, proportional
chambers and drift tubes, multichannel electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters,
a guard system, a RICH velocity spectrometer and a hodoscopical threshold
Cherenkov detector for the identification of charged secondary particles. The
SPHINX spectrometer, in its last modification, had the possibility to record
3000-4000 trigger events per an accelerator burst. The spectrometer was used
during the last decade in experiments with the 70GeV proton beam of the IHEP
accelerator U-70.
