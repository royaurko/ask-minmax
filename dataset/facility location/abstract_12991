The purpose of our research deals with the description of a methodology for
the definition of specific weather sequences and their influence on the energy
needs of HVAC system. We'll apply the method on the tropical Reunion Island.
The methodological approach based on a detailed analysis of weather sequences
leads to a classification of climatic situations that can be applied to the
site. These sequences have been used to simulate buildings and air handling
systems thanks to a thermal simulation code, CODYRUN. Results bring to the
light how necessary it is to have coherent meteorological data for this kind of
simulation.
