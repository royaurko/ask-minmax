We propose a new idea to test a class of loop-induced neutrino mass
mechanisms by searching for lepton number violating charged current processes
with incident of a neutrino beam. The expected rates of these processes are
estimated based on some theoretical assumptions. They turn out to be sizable so
that detection of such processes could be possible at near detectors in future
highly intense neutrino-beam facilities.
