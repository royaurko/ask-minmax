Wideband analog signals push contemporary analog-to-digital conversion
systems to their performance limits. In many applications, however, sampling at
the Nyquist rate is inefficient because the signals of interest contain only a
small number of significant frequencies relative to the bandlimit, although the
locations of the frequencies may not be known a priori. For this type of sparse
signal, other sampling strategies are possible. This paper describes a new type
of data acquisition system, called a random demodulator, that is constructed
from robust, readily available components. Let K denote the total number of
frequencies in the signal, and let W denote its bandlimit in Hz. Simulations
suggest that the random demodulator requires just O(K log(W/K)) samples per
second to stably reconstruct the signal. This sampling rate is exponentially
lower than the Nyquist rate of W Hz. In contrast with Nyquist sampling, one
must use nonlinear methods, such as convex programming, to recover the signal
from the samples taken by the random demodulator. This paper provides a
detailed theoretical analysis of the system's performance that supports the
empirical observations.
