In this work, we reveal the structure of global news coverage of disasters
and its determinants by using a large-scale news coverage dataset collected by
the GDELT (Global Data on Events, Location, and Tone) project that monitors
news media in over 100 languages from the whole world. Significant variables in
our hierarchical (mixed-effect) regression model, such as the number of
population, the political stability, the damage, and more, are well aligned
with a series of previous research. Yet, strong regionalism we found in news
geography highlights the necessity of the comprehensive dataset for the study
of global news coverage.
