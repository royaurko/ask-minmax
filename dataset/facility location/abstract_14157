Einstein Telescope (ET) is a planned third generation gravitational waves
detector located in Europe. Its design will be different from currently build
interferometers, because ET will consist of three interferometers rotated by a
60 deg with respect to each other in one plane. One of the biggest challenges
for ET will be to determine sky position and distance to observed sources. If
an object is observed in a few interferometers simultaneously one can estimate
the position using traingulation from time delays, but so far there are no
plans for a network of third generation detectors. Another possibility to deal
with that problem is by using multimessenger approach, because redshift and sky
position could be recovered from electromagnetic observations. In this paper we
present a novel method of estimating distance and position in the sky of
merging binaries. While our procedure is not as accurate as the multimessenger
method, it can be applied to all observations, not just the ones with
electromagnetic counterparts. We have shown that it is possible to
significantly improve distance estimates using the measurements of the signal
to noise ratio from all three interferometers .
