Due to its location and climate, Antarctica offers unique conditions for
long-period observations across a broad wavelength regime, where important
diagnostic lines for molecules and ions can be found, that are essential to
understand the chemical properties of the interstellar medium. In addition to
the natural benefits of the site, new technologies, resulting from
astrophotonics, may allow miniaturised instruments, that are easier to
winterise and advanced filters to further reduce the background in the
infrared.
