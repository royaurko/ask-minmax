South Africa has played a leading role in radio astronomy in Africa with the
Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO). It continues to make
strides with the current seven-dish MeerKAT precursor array (KAT-7), leading to
the 64-dish MeerKAT and the giant Square Kilometer Array (SKA), which will be
used for transformational radio astronomy research. Ghana, an African partner
to the SKA, has been mentored by South Africa over the past six years and will
soon emerge in the field of radio astronomy. The country will soon have a
science-quality 32m dish converted from a redundant satellite communication
antenna. Initially, it will be fitted with 5 GHz and 6.7 GHz receivers to be
followed later by a 1.4 - 1.7 GHz receiver. The telescope is being designed for
use as a single dish observatory and for participation in the developing
African Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Network (AVN) and the European
VLBI Network. Ghana is earmarked to host a remote station during a possible SKA
Phase 2. The location of the country on 5 degree north of the Equator gives it
the distinct advantage of viewing the entire plane of the Milky Way galaxy and
nearly the whole sky. In this article, we present the case of Ghana in the
radio astronomy scene and the science/technology that will soon be carried out
by engineers and astronomers.
