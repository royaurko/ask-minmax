As computing technology becomes more pervasive, personal devices such as the
PDA, cell-phone, and notebook should use context to determine how to act.
Location is one form of context that can be used in many ways. We present a
multiple-device system that collects and clusters GPS data into significant
locations. These locations are then used to determine travel times and a
probabilistic model of the user's schedule, which is used to intelligently
alert the user. We evaluate our system and suggest how it should be integrated
with a variety of applications.
