Measurements of heavy quark production at a possible future $ep$ facility,
THERA, would provide valuable information on the structure of the photon. QCD
cross-section predictions are made at LO for both charm and beauty production
and their sensitivity to current parametrisations of the photon parton
densities is investigated.
