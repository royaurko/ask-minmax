In this work we study the properties of hadronic molecules in the heavy-quark
sector. These have become increasingly important since from the beginning of
this century a large number of states have been measured that for different
reasons do not fit the predictions of simple quark models. In particular we
discuss two candidates in the open charm sector, $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and
$D_{s1}(2460)$, and two candidates in the bottomonium sector, $Z_b(10610)$ and
$Z_b(10650)$. Theorists have proposed different explanations for these states
including tetraquarks, hybrids, hadro-quarkonia and, subject of this work,
hadronic molecules. The study of these new states promises to provide insights
in an important field of modern physics, the formation of matter by the strong
force. Hadronic molecules are bound systems of hadrons in the same way two
nucleons form the deuteron. For this the molecular states need to be located
close to $S$-wave thresholds of their constituents. The dynamics of their
constituents will have a significant impact on the molecules which allows us to
make predictions that are unique features of the molecular assignment.
