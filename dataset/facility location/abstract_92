Borexino is a large unsegmented calorimeter featuring 300 tons of liquid
scintillator, contained in a 8.5 meter nylon vessel, viewed by 2200 PMTs. The
main goal of Borexino is the study, in real time, of low energy solar
neutrinos, and in particular, the monoenergetic neutrinos coming from $^7Be$,
which is one of the missing links on the solar neutrino problem. The
achievement of high radiopurity level, in the order of $10^{-16} g/g$ of U/Th
equivalent, necessary to the detection of the low energy component of the solar
neutrino flux, was proved in the Borexino prototype: the Counting Test
Facility. The detector is located underground in the Laboratori Nazionali del
Gran Sasso in the center of Italy at 3500 meter water equivalent depth. In this
paper the science and technology of Borexino are reviewed and its main
capabilities are presented.
