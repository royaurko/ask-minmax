We present first results of an experiment to combine data from Keck aperture
masking and the Infrared-Optical Telescope Array (IOTA) to image the
circumstellar environments of evolved stars with ~20 milliarcsecond resolution.
The unique combination of excellent Fourier coverage at short baselines and
high-quality long-baseline fringe data allows us to determine the location and
clumpiness of the inner-most hot dust in the envelopes, and to measure the
diameters of the underlying stars themselves. We find evidence for large-scale
inhomogeneities in some dust shells and also significant deviations from
uniform brightness for the photospheres of the most evolved M-stars. Deviations
from spherically-symmetric mass loss in the red supergiant NML Cyg could be
related to recent evidence for dynamically-important magnetic fields and/or
stellar rotation. We point out that dust shell asymmetries, like those observed
here, can qualitatively explain the difficulty recent workers have had in
simultaneously fitting the broad-band spectral energy distributions and
high-resolution spatial information, without invoking unusual dust properties
or multiple distinct shells (from hypothetical ``superwinds''). This paper is
the first to combine optical interferometry data from multiple facilities for
imaging, and we discuss the challenges and potential for the future of this
method, given current calibration and software limitations.
