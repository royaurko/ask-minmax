The Solar system beyond Neptune is believed to house a population of small
primordial bodies left over from the planet formation process. The region up to
heliocentric distance $\sim 50 AU$ (a.k.a. the Kuiper Belt) may be the source
of the observed short period comets. In this region, the phase space structure
near orbital resonances with Neptune is of special interest for the long term
stability of orbits. There is reason to believe that a significant fraction
(perhaps most) of the Kuiper Belt objects reside preferentially in these
resonance locations. This paper describes the dynamics of small objects near
the major orbital resonances with Neptune. Estimates of the widths of stable
resonance zones as well as the properties of resonant orbits are obtained from
the circular, planar restricted three-body model. Although this model does not
contain the full complexity of the long term orbital dynamics of Kuiper Belt
objects subject to the full N-body perturbations of all the planets, it does
provide a baseline for the phase space structure and properties of resonant
orbits in the trans-Neptunian Solar system.
