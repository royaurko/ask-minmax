The paper reports on the first observation of doubly-magic Nickel-48 in an
experimental at the SISSI/LISE3 facility of GANIL. Four Nickel-48 isotopes were
identified. In addition, roughly 100 Nickel-49, 50 Iron-45, and 290 Chromium-42
isotopes were observed. This opens the possibility to search for two-proton
emission from these nuclei.
