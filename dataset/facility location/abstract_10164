This letter reports results from the MINOS experiment based on its initial
exposure to neutrinos from the Fermilab NuMI beam. The rate and energy spectra
of charged current muon neutrino interactions are compared in two detectors
located along the beam axis at distances of 1 km and 735 km. With 1.27 x
10^{20} 120 GeV protons incident on the NuMI target, 215 events with energies
below 30 GeV are observed at the Far Detector, compared to an expectation of
336 \pm 14.4 events. The data are consistent with muon neutrino disappearance
via oscillation with |\Delta m^2_{23}| = 2.74^{+0.44}_{-0.26} x 10^{-3}
eV^2/c^4 and sin^2(2\theta_{23}) > 0.87 (at 60% C.L.).
