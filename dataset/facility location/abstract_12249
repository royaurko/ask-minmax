The South Pole Acoustic Test Setup (SPATS) consists of four strings
instrumented with seven acoustic sensors and transmitters each, which are
deployed in the upper 500 m of the IceCube holes. Since end of August 2008
SPATS is operating in transient mode, where three sensor channels of each
string, located at three different depth levels, are used for triggered data
taking within the 10 to 100 kHz frequency range. This allows to reconstruct the
position of the source of acoustic signals in the antarctic ice with high
precision. Acoustic signals from re-freezing IceCube holes are identified. All
detected acoustic events seen are associated to sources caused by human
activities at the South Pole. Further, the sensitive volume for neutrino
interactions outside the IceCube instrumented area has been determined by
simulation and a flux limit for high energy neutrinos was derived.
