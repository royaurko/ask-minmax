The splitting of a single optical vortex into four separate ones in a
singular beam is theoretically and experimentally described for the propagation
of light obliquely through a uniaxial crystal. Also we found the condition
under which the new-born vortices in each four individual beams propagate
independently without dislocation reactions and have different locations in all
beams for any crystal lengths.
