The system RX J0806.3+1527 (HM Cnc) is a pulsating X-ray source with 100 per
cent modulation on a period of 321.5 s (5.4 min). This period reflects the
orbital motion of a close binary consisting of two interacting white dwarfs.
Here we present a series of simultaneous X-ray (0.2-10 keV) and
near-ultraviolet (2600 angstrom and 1928 angstrom) observations that were
carried out with the Swift satellite. In the near-ultraviolet, the counterpart
of RX J0806.3+1527 was detected at flux densities consistent with a blackbody
with temperature 27E+3 K. We found that the emission at 2600 angstrom is
modulated at the 321.5-s period with the peak ahead of the X-ray one by 0.28
cycles and is coincident within 0.05 cycles with the optical. This phase-shift
measurement confirms that the X-ray hot spot (located on the primary white
dwarf) is at about 80-100 degrees from the direction that connects the two
white dwarfs. Albeit at lower significance, the 321.5-s signature is present
also in the 1928-angstrom data; at this wavelength, however, the pulse peak is
better aligned with that observed at X-rays. We use the constraints on the
source luminosity and the geometry of the emitting regions to discuss the
merits and limits of the main models for RX J0806.3+1527.
