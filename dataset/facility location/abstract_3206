Current submillimetre surveys are hindered in their ability to reveal
detailed information on the epoch of galaxy formation and the evolutionary
history of a high-redshift starburst galaxy population. The difficulties are
due to the small primary apertures (D < 15 m) of existing submillimetre
telescopes and the limited sensitivities of their first generation of bolometer
cameras. This situation is changing rapidly due to a variety of powerful new
ground-based, airborne and satellite FIR to millimetre wavelength facilities.
Improving our understanding of the luminosity and clustering evolution provides
the motivation for conducting cosmological submillimetre and millimetre
surveys. It is therefore important that we quantify the limitations of the
future surveys and the significance of the results that can be drawn from them.
In this paper we present simulated surveys which are made as realistic as
possible in order to address some key issues confronting existing and
forthcoming surveys. We discuss the results from simulations with a range of
wavelengths (200 um - 1.1 mm), spatial resolutions (6 arcsec - 27 arcsec) and
flux densities (0.01-310 mJy). We address how the measured source-counts could
be affected by resolution and confusion, by the survey sensitivity and noise,
and by the sampling variance due to clustering and shot-noise.
