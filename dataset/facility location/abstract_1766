We report on a new measurement of the 14N(p,g)15O capture cross section at
E_p = 140 to 400 keV using the 400 kV LUNA accelerator facility. The
uncertainties have been reduced with respect to previous measurements and their
analysis. We have analyzed the data using the R-matrix method and we find that
the ground state transition accounts for about 15 % of the total S-factor. The
main contribution to the S-factor is given by the transition to the 6.79 MeV
state. We find a total S(0) = 1.7+/-0.2 keV b.
