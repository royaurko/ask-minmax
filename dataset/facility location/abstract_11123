A transmission screen with subwavelength slots is described which can focus
electromagnetic radiation to a two-dimensional subwavelength spot. Unlike
negative-refractive-index focusing implementations, this "meta-screen" does not
suffer from image degradation when losses are introduced and is easily scalable
from microwave to Terahertz frequencies and beyond. The slotted geometry is
designed using a theory of shifted beams to determine the necessary weighting
factors for each slot element, which are then converted to appropriate slot
dimensions. The screen was designed using a pair of rotated orthogonal focusing
axes to produce a spot on a focal plane located 0.25 \lambda away. Full-wave
simulations are corroborated by experimental measurements at 10 GHz reporting a
full-width half-maximum beam width of 0.27 \lambda along the x-axis and 0.38
\lambda along the z-axis.
