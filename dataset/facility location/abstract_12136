We study the effect in geometrically frustrated antiferromagnets of weak,
random variations in the strength of exchange interactions. Without disorder
the simplest classical models for these systems have macroscopically degenerate
ground states, and this degeneracy may prevent ordering at any temperature.
Weak exchange randomness favours a small subset of these ground states and
induces a spin-glass transition at an ordering temperature determined by the
amplitude of modulations in interaction strength. We use the replica approach
to formulate a theory for this transition, showing that it falls into the same
universality class as conventional spin-glass transitions. In addition, we show
that a model with a low concentration of defect bonds can be mapped onto a
system of randomly located pseudospins that have dipolar effective
interactions. We also present detailed results from Monte Carlo simulations of
the classical Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice with weak
randomness in nearest neighbour exchange.
