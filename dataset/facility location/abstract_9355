We present 5, 8, and 15 GHz total intensity and polarimetric observations of
the radio source PKS 2322-123 taken with the Very Large Array (VLA). This small
(11 kpc) source is located at the center of the cooling-core cluster Abell
2597. The inner X-ray structure, the radio morphology, and the steep spectral
index (alpha = -1.8) in the lobes, all suggest that the radio emission is
confined by the ambient X-ray gas. We detect a small region of polarized flux
in the southern lobe and are able to calculate a Faraday rotation measure (RM)
of 3620 rad/m/m over this region. Based on these observations and Chandra X-ray
data we suggest that the southern lobe has been deflected from its original
southwestern orientation to the south and into our line-of-sight. Using the
observed RMs and our calculated electron density profiles, and assuming both a
uniform and tangled magnetic field topology, we estimate a lower limit of the
line-of-sight cluster magnetic field, B = 2.1 microgauss.
