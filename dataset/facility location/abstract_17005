Using the outer gap model, we investigate the emission region for the
multi-wavelength light curve from energetic pulsars. We assume that gamma-ray
and non-thermal X-ray photons are emitted from a particle acceleration region
in the outer magnetosphere, and UV/optical photons originate above that region.
We assume that gamma-rays are radiated only by outwardly moving particles,
whereas the other photons are produced by particles moving inward and outward.
We parameterize the altitude of the emission region as the deviation from the
rotating dipole in vacuum and determine it from the observed multi-wavelength
pulse profile using the observationally constrained magnetic dipole inclination
angle and viewing angle of the pulsars. We find that the outer gap model can
explain the multi-wavelength pulse behavior by a simple distribution of
emissivity, and discuss the possibility of further improvement. From
observational fitting, we also find a general tendency for the altitude of the
gamma-ray emission region to depend on the inclination angle. In particular,
the emission region for low inclination angle is required to be located in very
low altitude, which corresponds to the inner region within the last-open field
line of rotating dipole in vacuum. This model suggests a modification of
statistics about observed gamma-ray pulsars. Number of the sources with low
inclination and viewing angles increases compared with previous estimate.
