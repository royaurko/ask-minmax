A simple and novel method to fabricate and miniaturize surface and
sub-surface micro-structures and micro-patterns in glassy carbon is proposed
and demonstrated. An aqueous resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) sol is employed for
micro-molding of the master-pattern to be replicated, followed by controlled
drying and pyrolysis of the gel to reproduce an isotropically shrunk replica in
carbon. The miniaturized version of the master-pattern thus replicated in
carbon is about one order of magnitude smaller than original master by
repeating three times the above cycle of molding and drying. The
micro-fabrication method proposed will greatly enhance the toolbox for a facile
fabrication of a variety of Carbon-MEMS and C-microfluidic devices.
