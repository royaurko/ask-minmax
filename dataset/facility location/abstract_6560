We calculate the location and stability of the L_4 and L_5 Lagrange
equilibrium points in the circular restricted three-body problem as the binary
system evolves via gravitational radiation losses. Relative to the purely
Newtonian case, we find that the L_4 equilibrium point moves towards the
secondary mass and becomes slightly less stable, while the L_5 point moves away
from the secondary and gains in stability. We discuss a number of astrophysical
applications of these results, in particular as a mechanism for producing
electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational-wave signals.
