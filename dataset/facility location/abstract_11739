We build a model for the density and integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) profile of
supervoid and supercluster structures. Our model assumes that fluctuations
evolve linearly from an initial Gaussian random field. We find these
assumptions capable of describing N-body simulations and simulated ISW maps
remarkably well on large scales. We construct an ISW map based on locations of
superstructures identified previously in the SDSS Luminous Red Galaxy sample. A
matched filter analysis of the cosmic microwave background confirms a signal at
the $3.2-\sigma$ confidence level and estimates the radius of the underlying
structures to be $55 \pm 28 ~h^{-1}$Mpc. The amplitude of the signal, however,
is $2-\sigma$ higher than $\Lambda$CDM predictions.
