For OFDMA systems, we find a rough but easily computed upper bound for the
probability of loosing communications by insufficient number of sub-channels on
downlink. We consider as random the positions of receiving users in the system
as well as the number of sub-channels dedicated to each one. We use recent
results of the theory of point processes which reduce our calculations to the
first and second moments of the total required number of sub-carriers.
