If at cosmological distances, a small fraction of gamma-ray bursts should be
multiply imaged by intervening galaxies or clusters, resulting in the
appearance of two very similar bursts from the same location with a relative
time delay of hours to a year. We show that microlensing by individual stars in
the lensing galaxy can smear out the light curves of the multiply imaged bursts
on millisecond time scales. Therefore, in deciding whether two bursts are
similar enough to qualify as multiple images, one must look at time scales
longer than a few tens of milliseconds, since shorter time scales are possibly
rendered dissimilar by microlensing.
