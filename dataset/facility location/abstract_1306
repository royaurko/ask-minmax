We have found a bar of shocked molecular hydrogen (H2) towards the OH(1720
MHz) maser located at the projected intersection of supernova remnant (SNR)
G359.1-0.5 and the nonthermal radio filament, known as the Snake. The H2 bar is
well aligned with the SNR shell and almost perpendicular to the Snake. The
OH(1720 MHz) maser is located inside the sharp western edge of the H2 emission,
which is consistent with the scenario in which the SNR drives a shock into a
molecular cloud at that location. The spectral-line profiles of 12CO, HCO+ and
CS towards the maser show broad-line absorption, which is absent in the 13CO
spectra and most probably originates from the pre-shock gas. A density gradient
is present across the region and is consistent with the passage of the SNR
shock while the H2 filament is located at the boundary between the pre--shocked
and post-shock regions.
