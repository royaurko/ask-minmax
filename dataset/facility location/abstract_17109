ZEPLIN-III is a two-phase xenon direct dark matter experiment located at the
Boulby Mine (UK). After its first science run in 2008 it was upgraded with: an
array of low background photomultipliers, a new anti-coincidence detector
system with plastic scintillator and an improved calibration system. After 319
days of data taking the second science run ended in May 2011. In this paper we
describe the instrument performance with emphasis on the position and energy
reconstruction algorithm and summarise the final science results.
