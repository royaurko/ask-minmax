A Chandra image of the central 100 kpc of the Abell 2597 cluster of galaxies
shows bright, irregular, X-ray emission within the central dominant cluster
galaxy (CDG), and two low surface brightness cavities located 30 kpc from the
CDG's nucleus. Unlike the cavities commonly seen in other clusters, Abell
2597's ``ghost'' cavities are not coincident with the bright central radio
source. Instead, they appear to be associated with faint, extended radio
emission seen in a deep VLA radio map. We interpret the ghost cavities as
buoyantly-rising relics of a radio outburst that occurred between 50--100 Myr
ago. The demography of cavities in the few clusters studied thus far shows that
galactic radio sources experience recurrent outbursts on a $\sim 100$ Myr
timescale. Over the lifetime of a cluster, ghost cavities emerging from CDGs
deposit $\gae 10^{59-61}$ erg of energy into the intracluster medium. If a
significant fraction of this energy is deposited as magnetic field, it would
account for the high field strengths in the cooling flow regions of clusters.
The similarity between the central cooling time of the keV gas and the radio
cycling timescale suggests that feedback between cooling gas and the radio
source may be retarding or quenching the cooling flow.
