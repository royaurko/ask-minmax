A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph where edges can connect any
number of vertices. In this paper, we extend the study of locating-dominating
sets to hypergraphs. Along with some basic results, sharp bounds for the
location-domination number of hypergraphs in general and exact values with
specified conditions are investigated. Moreover, locating-dominating sets in
some specific hypergraphs are found.
