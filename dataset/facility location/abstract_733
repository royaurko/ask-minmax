I review the potential for observing cosmic reionization using the HI 21cm
line of neutral hydrogren. Studies include observations of the evolution of
large scale structure of the IGM (density, excitation temperature, and neutral
fraction), through HI 21cm emission, as well as observations of small to
intermediate scale structure through absorption toward the first discrete radio
sources. I summarize predictions for the HI signals, then consider capabilities
of facilities being built, or planned, to detect these signals. I also discuss
the significant observational challenges.
