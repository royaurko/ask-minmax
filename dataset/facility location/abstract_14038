Empowered by today's rich tools for media generation and distribution, and
the convenient Internet access, crowdsourced streaming generalizes the
single-source streaming paradigm by including massive contributors for a video
channel. It calls a joint optimization along the path from crowdsourcers,
through streaming servers, to the end-users to minimize the overall latency.
The dynamics of the video sources, together with the globalized request demands
and the high computation demand from each sourcer, make crowdsourced live
streaming challenging even with powerful support from modern cloud computing.
In this paper, we present a generic framework that facilitates a cost-effective
cloud service for crowdsourced live streaming. Through adaptively leasing, the
cloud servers can be provisioned in a fine granularity to accommodate
geo-distributed video crowdsourcers. We present an optimal solution to deal
with service migration among cloud instances of diverse lease prices. It also
addresses the location impact to the streaming quality. To understand the
performance of the proposed strategies in the realworld, we have built a
prototype system running over the planetlab and the Amazon/Microsoft Cloud. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that the effectiveness of our solution in
terms of deployment cost and streaming quality.
