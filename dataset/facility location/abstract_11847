We have measured the binding energy of $^7$Li Feshbach molecules deep into
the non-universal regime by associating free atoms in a Bose-Einstein
condensate by modulating the magnetic field. We extract the scattering length
from these measurements, correcting for non-universal short-range effects using
several different methods. We find that field-dependent effective range
corrections agree well with the data.
  With this more precise determination of the scattering length vs. field we
reanalyze our previous data on the location of atom loss features produced by
the Efimov effect \cite{PollackSci09} and investigate effective range
corrections to universal theory.
