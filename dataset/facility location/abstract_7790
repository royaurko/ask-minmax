The optimal control of a "blind" pursuer searching for an evader moving on a
road network and heading at a known speed toward a set of goal vertices is
considered. To aid the "blind" pursuer, certain roads in the network have been
instrumented with Unattended Ground Sensors (UGSs) that detect the evader's
passage. When the pursuer arrives at an instrumented node, the UGS therein
informs the pursuer if and when the evader visited the node. The pursuer's
motion is not restricted to the road network. In addition, the pursuer can
choose to wait/loiter for an arbitrary time at any UGS location/node. At time
0, the evader passes by an entry node on his way towards one of the exit nodes.
The pursuer also arrives at this entry node after some delay and is thus
informed about the presence of the intruder/evader in the network, whereupon
the chase is on - the pursuer is tasked with capturing the evader. Because the
pursuer is "blind", capture entails the pursuer and evader being collocated at
an UGS location. If this happens, the UGS is triggered and this information is
instantaneously relayed to the pursuer, thereby enabling capture. On the other
hand, if the evader reaches one of the exit nodes without being captured, he is
deemed to have escaped. We provide an algorithm that computes the maximum
initial delay at the entry node for which capture is guaranteed. The algorithm
also returns the corresponding optimal pursuit policy.
