Spatial co-location patterns are the subsets of Boolean spatial features
whose instances are often located in close geographic proximity. Co-location
rules can be identified by spatial statistics or data mining approaches. In
data mining method, Association rule-based approaches can be used which are
further divided into transaction-based approaches and distance-based
approaches. Transaction-based approaches focus on defining transactions over
space so that an Apriori algorithm can be used. The natural notion of
transactions is absent in spatial data sets which are embedded in continuous
geographic space. A new distance -based approach is developed to mine
co-location patterns from spatial data by using the concept of proximity
neighborhood. A new interest measure, a participation index, is used for
spatial co-location patterns as it possesses an anti-monotone property. An
algorithm to discover co-location patterns are designed which generates
candidate locations and their table instances. Finally the co-location rules
are generated to identify the patterns.
