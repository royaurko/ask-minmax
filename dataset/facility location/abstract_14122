Precisely and accurately locating point objects is a long-standing common
thread in science. Super-resolved imaging of single molecules has
revolutionized our view of quasi-static nanostructures $\it{in-vivo}$. A
wide-field approach based on localizing individual fluorophores has emerged as
a versatile method to surpass the standard resolution limit. In those
techniques, the super-resolution is realized by sparse photoactivation and
localization together with the statistical analysis based on point spread
functions. Nevertheless, the slow temporal resolution of super-resolved imaging
severely restricts the utility to the study of live-cell phenomena. Clearly, a
major breakthrough to observe fast, nanoscale dynamics needs to be made. Here
we present a super-resolved imaging method that achieves the theoretical-limit
time resolution. By invoking information theory, we can achieve the robust
localization of overlapped light emitters at an order of magnitude faster speed
than the conventional super-resolution microscopy. Our method thus provides a
general way to uncover hidden structures below the diffraction limit and should
have a wide range of applications in all disciplines of science and technology.
