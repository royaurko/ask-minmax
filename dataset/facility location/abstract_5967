We explore the metastability effects across the order-disorder transition
pertaining to the peak effect phenomenonon in critical current density ($J_c$)
via the first and the third harmonic ac susceptibility measurements in the
weakly pinned single crystals of $2H$-$NbSe_2$. An analysis of our data
suggests that an imprint of the limiting (spinodal) temperature above which
$J_c$ is path independent can be conveniently located in the third harmonic
data ($\chi_{3\omega}^{\prime}$).
