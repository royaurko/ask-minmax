The location determination in obstructed area can be very challenging
especially if Global Positioning System are blocked. Users will find it
difficult to navigate directly on-site in such condition, especially indoor car
park lot or obstructed environment. Sometimes, it needs to combine with other
sensors and positioning methods in order to determine the location with more
intelligent, reliable and ubiquity. By using ubiquitous positioning in mobile
navigation system, it is a promising ubiquitous location technique in a mobile
phone since as it is a familiar personal electronic device for many people.
However, as research on ubiquitous positioning systems goes beyond basic
methods there is an increasing need for better comparison of proposed
ubiquitous positioning systems. System developers are also lacking of good
frameworks for understanding different options during building ubiquitous
positioning systems. This paper proposes taxonomy to address both of these
problems. The proposed taxonomy has been constructed from a literature study of
papers and articles on positioning estimation that can be used to determine
location everywhere on mobile navigation system. For researchers the taxonomy
can also be used as an aid for scoping out future research in the area of
ubiquitous positioning.
