The TRB hardware module is a multi-purpose Trigger and Readout Board with
on-board DAQ functionality developed for the upgrade of the HADES experiment.
It contains a single computer chip (Etrax) running Linux as a well as a 100
Mbit/s Ethernet interface. It has been orginally designed to work as a
128-channel Time to Digital Converter based on the HPTDC chip from CERN. The
new version contains a 2 Gbit/s optical link and an interface connector (15
Gbit/s) in order to realize an add-on card concept which makes the hardware
very flexible. Moreover, an FPGA chip (Xilinx, Virtex 4 LX 40) and a TigerSharc
DSP provide new computing resources which can be used to run on-line analysis
algorithms. The TRB is proposed as a prototype for new modules for the planned
detector systems PANDA and CBM at the future FAIR facility at GSI-Darmstadt.
