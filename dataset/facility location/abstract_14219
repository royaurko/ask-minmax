In this work, we present, for the first time, a numerical study of the
Bondi-Hoyle accretion with density gradients in the fully relativistic regime.
In this context, we consider accretion onto a Kerr Black Hole (BH) of a
supersonic ideal gas, which has density gradients perpendicular to the relative
motion. The set of parameters of interest in this study are the Mach number, M,
the spin of the BH, a, and the density-gradient parameter of the gas, {\rho} .
We show that, unlike in the Newtonian case, all the studied cases, especially
those with density gradient, approach a stationary flow pattern. To illustrate
that the system reaches steady state we calculate the mass and angular momentum
accretion rates on a spherical surface located almost at the event horizon. In
the particular case of M = 1, {\rho} = 0.5 and BH spin a = 0.5, we observe a
disk-like configuration surrounding the BH. Finally, we present the gas
morphology and some of its properties.
