An approximate microscopic model is proposed for the explanation of the
electric signal dU = k_B dT/(2e) observed by A.S. Rybalko in He II in the
experiments with standing half-wave of second sound. The model is based on the
idea, due to Gutlyanskii, of the one-directional polarization of He-4 atoms
located at the electrode surface. The calculated parameters of the electric
signal are in approximate agreement with the experimental ones. It is also
predicted that a standing half-wave of first sound should induce a variable
signal with amplitude dU ~ dp/(en) ~ 3*10^{-5} dp*V/atm at the electrode. It is
shown also that the dependence of the polarizability of helium on temperature,
A(T), can be explained if the tidal polarization of atoms is taken into
account. A possibility of the existence of the "dry" friction in He II at
temperatures T < 0.5-1 K is discussed.
