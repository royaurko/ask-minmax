We formulate the problem of probabilistic predictions of global failure in
the simplest possible model based on site percolation and on one of the
simplest model of time-dependent rupture, a hierarchical fiber bundle model. We
show that conditioning the predictions on the knowledge of the current degree
of damage (occupancy density $p$ or number and size of cracks) and on some
information on the largest cluster improves significantly the prediction
accuracy, in particular by allowing to identify those realizations which have
anomalously low or large clusters (cracks). We quantify the prediction gains
using two measures, the relative specific information gain (which is the
variation of entropy obtained by adding new information) and the
root-mean-square of the prediction errors over a large ensemble of
realizations. The bulk of our simulations have been obtained with the
two-dimensional site percolation model on a lattice of size $L \times L=20
\times 20$ and hold true for other lattice sizes. For the hierarchical fiber
bundle model, conditioning the measures of damage on the information of the
location and size of the largest crack extends significantly the critical
region and the prediction skills. These examples illustrate how on-going damage
can be used as a revelation of both the realization-dependent pre-existing
heterogeneity and the damage scenario undertaken by each specific sample.
