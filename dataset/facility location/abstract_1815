We present numerical results for the dissociation cross sections of
ground-state, orbitally- and radially-excited charmonia in collisions with
light mesons. Our results are derived using the nonrelativistic quark model, so
all parameters are determined by fits to the experimental meson spectrum.
Examples of dissociation into both exclusive and inclusive final states are
considered. The dissociation cross sections of several C=(+) charmonia may be
of considerable importance for the study of heavy ion collisions, since these
states are expected to be produced more copiously than the J/psi. The relative
importance of the productions of ground-state and orbitally-excited charmed
mesons in a pion-charmonium collision is demonstrated through the $\sqrt
{s}$-dependent charmonium dissociation cross sections.
