The purpose of the work is to make an overview on the results obtained
through the studies on martian plasmas created by inductively coupled plasma
torches (ICP). As the main advantage of the ICP torch is the absence of
electrode compared to the others various test facilities, the radiative
properties of this kind of plasmas are of interest to propose test cases in
order to validate radiation models. ICP torches can work under various
operating conditions in terms of pressure, enthalpy or flow. As a consequence,
the studied plasma can be either at thermodynamical equilibrium or out of
equilibrium, without problems of stability in time. The presentation concerns
only the plasmas formed with a martian like CO2-N2 mixture and all the
parameters of test facilities will be precised. The following paper corresponds
to the first step of a global paper which will be proposed later and it reports
only the oral presentation which has been done during the third International
Workshop of RHTG.
