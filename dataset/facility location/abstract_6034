We consider here the third order curvature invariant
$I=R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma;\delta}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma;\delta}$ in static spacetimes
${\cal M}=R\times\Sigma$ for which $\Sigma$ is conformally flat. We evaluate
explicitly the invariant for the $N$-dimensional Majumdar-Papapetrou multi
black-holes solution, confirming that $I$ does indeed vanish on the event
horizons of such black-holes. Our calculations show, however, that solely the
vanishing of $I$ is not sufficient to locate an event horizon in
non-spherically symmetric spacetimes. We discuss also some tidal effects
associated to the invariant $I$.
