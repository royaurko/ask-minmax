In order to examine whether or not high-ionization nuclear emission-line
regions (HINERs) in narrow-line regions of active galactic nuclei are dusty, we
focus on two high-ionization forbidden emission lines, [Fe VII]6087 and [Ne
V]3426. We perform photoionization model calculations to investigate possible
dependences of the flux ratio of [Fe VII]6087/[Ne V]3426 on various gas
properties, in order to investigate how useful this flux ratio to explore the
dust abundances in HINERs. Based on our photoionization model calculations, we
show that the observed range of the flux ratio of [Fe VII]6087/[Ne V]3426 is
consistent with the dust-free models while that is hard to be explained by the
dusty models. This suggests that iron is not depleted at HINERs, which implies
that the HINERs are not dusty. This results is consistent with the idea that
the HINERs are located closer than the dust-sublimation radius (i.e., inner
radius of dusty tori) and thus can be hidden by dusty tori when seen from a
edge-on view toward the tori, which has been also suggested by the AGN-type
dependence of the visibility of high-ionization emission lines.
