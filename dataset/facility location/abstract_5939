Feshbach resonances in lithium-6 were experimentally studied and
theoretically analyzed. In addition to two previously known s-wave resonances,
we found three p-wave resonances. Four of these resonances are narrow and yield
a precise value of the singlet scattering length, but do not allow us to
accurately predict the location of the broad resonance near 83 mT. Its position
was previously measured in a molecule-dissociation experiment for which we,
here, discuss systematic shifts.
