We investigate the variability of the continuum and broad lines in QSO
spectra (particularly in the H$\beta$ line and continuum at $\lambda$ 5100 \AA
) caused by microlensing of a diffuse massive structure (like an open star
cluster). We modeled the continuum and line emitting region and simulate a
lensing event by a star cluster located in an intervening galaxy. Such a type
of microlensing event can have a significant influence on magnification and
centroid shift of the broad lines and continuum source. We explore
relationships between the continuum and broad line flux variability during the
microlensing event.
