We present the current status of the SuperWASP project, a Wide Angle Search
for Planets. SuperWASP consists of up to 8 individual cameras using ultra-wide
field lenses backed by high-quality passively cooled CCDs. Each camera covers
7.8 x 7.8 sq degrees of sky, for nearly 500 sq degrees of sky coverage.
SuperWASP I, located in LaPalma, is currently operational with 5 cameras and is
conducting a photometric survey of a large numbers of stars in the magnitude
range ~7 to 15. The collaboration has developed a custom-built reduction
pipeline and aims to achieve better than 1 percent photometric precision. The
pipeline will also produce well sampled light curves for all the stars in each
field which will be used to detect: planetary transits, optical transients, and
track Near-Earth Objects. Status of current observations, and expected rates of
extrasolar planetary detections will be presented. The consortium members,
institutions, and further details can be found on the web site at:
