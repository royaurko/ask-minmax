We report the first observation of the charge symmetry breaking d + d -> 4He
+ pi0 reaction near threshold at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility.
Kinematic reconstruction permitted the separation of 4He + pi0 events from
double radiative capture 4He + gamma + gamma events. We measured total cross
sections for neutron pion production of 12.7 +- 2.2 pb at 228.5 MeV and 15.1 +-
3.1 pb at 231.8 MeV. The uncertainty is dominated by statistical errors.
