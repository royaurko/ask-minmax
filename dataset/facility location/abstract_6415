We show that three dimensional cubes of any size can be tiled with trominoes
and, when necessary, one or two singletons in any positions. Cubes of side
length a multiple of three can always be tiled with trominoes (known), cubes of
side length congruent to 1 mod 3 can always be tiled with an arbitrary single
cube and trominoes, and cubes of side length congruent to 2 mod 3 can always be
tiled with two single cubes in arbitrary locations and trominoes.
