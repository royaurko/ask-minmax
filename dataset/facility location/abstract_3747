The magnetic monopole was postulated in 1931 by Dirac to explain electric
charge quantisation. Searches for pair-produced monopoles are performed at
accelerator facilities whenever a new energy regime is made available. In
addition, monopoles with masses too high to be accessible at colliders would
still have been produced in the early Universe and such relics can be searched
for either in flight or trapped in matter. Here we discuss recent results and
future prospects for direct monopole detection at the LHC and in bulk matter
searches, with emphasis on the complementarity between the various techniques.
Significant improvements of the results from the ATLAS experiment are expected
with the development of new triggers. Dedicated LHC experiments will allow to
probe wider ranges of monopole charges and masses: the MoEDAL experiment using
both nuclear-track detectors and absorbing arrays, and searches for trapped
monopoles in accelerator material. Finally, it is highlighted how the first
search for monopoles trapped in polar volcanic rocks allows to set new
constraints on the abundance of monopoles bound to matter in the Earth's
interior and by extension in the primary material that formed the Solar System.
