We present a grid of photoionization models for the emission from
photoevaporative interfaces between the ionized gas and molecular cloud in
blister HII regions. For the density profiles of the emitting gas in the
models, we use a general power law form calculated for photoionized,
photoevaporative flows by Bertoldi (1989). We find that the spatial emission
line profiles are dependent on the incident flux, the shape of the ionizing
continuum and the elemental abundances. In particular, we find that the peak
emissivity of the [SII] and [NII] lines are more sensitive to the elemental
abundances than are the total line intensities. The diagnostics obtained from
the grid of models can be used in conjunction with high spatial resolution data
to infer the properties of ionized interfaces in blister HII regions. As an
example, we consider a location at the tip of an ``elephant trunk'' structure
in M16 (the Eagle Nebula) and show how narrow band HST-WFPC2 images constrain
the HII region properties. We present a photoionization model that explains the
ionization structure and emission from the interface seen in these high spatial
resolution data.
