Coravel observations of 103 F5-K0 stars in the Praesepe cluster yielded 24
spectroscopic binaries (3 are non-members), and 20 orbits were determined, with
periods from 4 to 7400 days. Based on a complete sample in the colour range
0.40 < B-V < 0.80 (80 stars, including KW 244 = TX Cnc), the companion star
fraction CSF = 0.45. The percentage of spectroscopic binaries with P < 1000d is
20% (16/80). The combined photometric and spectroscopic analysis showed that 12
among 18 single-lined spectroscopic binaries are located within the "single"
star sequence in the (V,B-V) diagram and cannot be detected by the photometric
analysis in the UBV system. In addition, seven photometrically analysed
binaries were not detected with the radial velocity observations, but are
confirmed members. The number of single:binary:triple stars is 47:30:3.
