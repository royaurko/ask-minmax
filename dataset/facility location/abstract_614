Fermilab is planning the construction of a prototype front end of the Project
X linac. The Project X Injector Experiment (PXIE) is expected to accelerate 1
mA cw H- beam up to 30 MeV. Some of the major goals of the project are to test
a cw RFQ and H- source, a broadband bunch-by-bunch beam chopper and a
low-energy superconducting linac. The successful characterization and operation
of such an accelerator places stringent requirements on beam line diagnostics.
These crucial beam measurements include bunch currents, beam orbit, beam phase,
bunch length, transverse profile and emittance, beam halo and tails, as well as
the extinction performance of the broadband chopper. This paper presents PXIE
beam measurement requirements and instrumentation development plans. Also
presented are plans to test many of these instruments at the Fermilab High
Intensity Neutrino Source (HINS) beam facility. Since HINS is already an
operational accelerator, utilizing HINS for instrumentation testing allows for
quicker development of the required PXIE diagnostics.
