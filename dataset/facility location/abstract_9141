This paper presents a list of suggested stars for radial velocity
measurements. We explain here in brief the research project for which the
radial velocity of the "slow movers" i.e. small proper motion stars are
necessary. Basing on this study we prepared a list of 1100 stellar targets with
very accurate positions, proper motions and trigonometric parallaxes but
without radial velocity measurements. Distributions of stellar brightnesses and
spectral types among these stars are presented as well as its "most wanted"
subset. We announce the begin of the radial velocity measurements to be
conducted with our new echelle spectrograph just put into operation and offer
some coordination for observations of targets that cannot be reached from our
location.
