We use dynamic light scattering and computer simulations to study equilibrium
dynamics and dynamic heterogeneity in concentrated suspensions of colloidal
hard spheres. Our study covers an unprecedented density range and spans seven
decades in structural relaxation time, $\ta$, including equilibrium easurements
above $\phi_{\rm c}$, the location of the glass transition deduced from fitting
our data to mode-coupling theory. Instead of falling out of equilibrium, the
system remains ergodic above $\phi_{\rm c}$ and enters a new dynamical regime
where $\ta$ increases with a functional form that was not anticipated by
previous experiments, while the amplitude of dynamic heterogeneity grows slower
than a power law with $\ta$, as found in molecular glass-formers close to the
glass transition.
