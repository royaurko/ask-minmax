Within the t-J model, the optical and transport properties of the doped
two-leg ladder antiferromagnet are studied based on the fermion-spin theory. It
is shown that the optical and transport properties of the doped two-leg ladder
antiferromagnet are mainly governed by the holon scattering. The low energy
peak in the optical conductivity is located at a finite energy, while the
resistivity exhibits a crossover from the high temperature metallic-like
behavior to the low temperature insulating-like behavior, which are consistent
with the experiments.
