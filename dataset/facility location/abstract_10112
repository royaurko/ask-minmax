We present a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique for detecting gravitational
radiation from a neutron star in laser interferometer data. The algorithm can
estimate up to six unknown parameters of the target, including the rotation
frequency and frequency derivative, using reparametrization, delayed rejection
and simulated annealing. We highlight how a simple extension of the method,
distributed over multiple computer processors, will allow for a search over a
narrow frequency band. The ultimate goal of this research is to search for
sources at a known locations, but uncertain spin parameters, such as may be
found in SN1987A.
