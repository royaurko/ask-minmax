This paper describes the algorithms, features and implementation of PyDEC, a
Python library for computations related to the discretization of exterior
calculus. PyDEC facilitates inquiry into both physical problems on manifolds as
well as purely topological problems on abstract complexes. We describe
efficient algorithms for constructing the operators and objects that arise in
discrete exterior calculus, lowest order finite element exterior calculus and
in related topological problems. Our algorithms are formulated in terms of
high-level matrix operations which extend to arbitrary dimension. As a result,
our implementations map well to the facilities of numerical libraries such as
NumPy and SciPy. The availability of such libraries makes Python suitable for
prototyping numerical methods. We demonstrate how PyDEC is used to solve
physical and topological problems through several concise examples.
