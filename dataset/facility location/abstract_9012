Radio images of maser spots in the infrared source GL2789, connected with the
young stellar object V645 Cyg, have been obtained as a result of the radio
interferometric observations of H2O maser at 22 GHz and methanol maser at 6.7
GHz, with the VLBI arrays VLBA and EVN. It was shown that the position of the
masers coincide with the optical object within 0.2''. The maser spots are
located along the line North-South, and their position and radial velocity can
be described by a model of the Keplerian disk with a maximum radius of 40 AU
for H2O maser and 800 AU for methanol maser. The H2O and methanol maser spots
have not been resolved, and lower limits of the brightness temperature is
2x10^{13} K and 1.4x10^9 K, respectively. A model of the maser was suggested in
which the maser emission is generated in extended water and methanol envelopes
of icy planets orbiting the young star.
