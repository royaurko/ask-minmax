Classical Cepheid stars have been considered since more than a century as
reliable tools to estimate distances in the universe thanks to their
Period-Luminosity (P-L) relationship. Moreover, they are also powerful
astrophysical laboratories, providing fundamental clues for studying the
pulsation and evolution of intermediate-mass stars. When in binary systems, we
can investigate the age and evolution of the Cepheid, estimate the mass and
distance, and constrain theoretical models. However, most of the companions are
located too close to the Cepheid (1-40 mas) to be spatially resolved with a
10-meter class telescope. The only way to spatially resolve such systems is to
use long-baseline interferometry. Recently, we have started a unique and
long-term interferometric program that aims at detecting and characterizing
physical parameters of the Cepheid companions, with as main objectives the
determination of accurate masses and geometric distances.
