Self-enrichment processes occurring in the early stages of a globular cluster
lifetime are generally invoked to explain the observed CNONaMgAl abundance
anticorrelations within individual Galactic globulars.We have tested, with
fully consistent stellar evolution calculations, if theoretical isochrones for
stars born with the observed abundance anticorrelations satisfy the
observational evidence that objects with different degrees of these anomalies
lie on essentially identical sequences in the Color-Magnitude-Diagram (CMD). To
this purpose, we have computed for the first time low-mass stellar models and
isochrones with an initial metal mixture that includes the extreme values of
the observed abundance anticorrelations, and varying initial He mass fractions.
Comparisons with 'normal' alpha-enhanced isochrones and suitable Monte Carlo
simulations that include photometric errors show that a significant broadening
of the CMD sequences occurs only if the helium enhancement is extremely large
(in this study, when Y=0.35) in the stars showing anomalous abundances. Stellar
luminosity functions up to the Red Giant Branch tip are also very weakly
affected, apart from - depending on the He content of the polluting material -
the Red Giant Branch bump region. We also study the distribution of stars along
the Zero Age Horizontal Branch, and derive general constraints on the relative
location of objects with and without abundance anomalies along the observed
horizontal branches of globular clusters.
