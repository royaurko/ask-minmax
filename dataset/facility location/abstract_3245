XMM-Newton observations of the starburst galaxy NGC 1511 reveal the presence
of a previously unknown extended hot gaseous phase of its ISM, which partly
extends out of the disk plane. The emission distribution is asymmetric, being
brightest in the eastern half of the galaxy, where also radio continuum
observations suggest the highest level of star formation. Spectral analysis of
the integral 0.2-12 keV X-ray emission from NGC 1511 indicates a complex
emission composition. A model comprising a power law plus thermal plasma
component, both absorbed by foreground gas, cannot explain all details of the
observed spectrum, requiring a third spectral component to be added. This
component can be a second thermal plasma, but other spectral models can be
fitted as well. Its X-ray properties characterize NGC 1511 as a starburst
galaxy. The X-ray-to-infrared luminosity ratio is consistent with this result.
Together with the X-ray data, XMM-Newton obtained UV images of NGC 1511,
tracing massive stars heating the ambient gas, which is then seen in H\alpha
emission. UV, H\alpha and near-infrared imagery suggest that NGC 1511 is
disturbed, most likely by its two small companions, NGC 1511a and NGC 1511b.
