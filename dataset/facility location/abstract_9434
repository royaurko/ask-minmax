Galaxies are not distributed randomly throughout space but are instead
arranged in an intricate "cosmic web" of filaments and walls surrounding
bubble-like voids. There is still no compelling observational evidence of a
link between the structure of the cosmic web and how galaxies form within it.
However, such a connection is expected on the basis of our understanding of the
origin of galaxy angular momentum: disk galaxies should be highly inclined
relative to the plane defined by the large-scale structure surrounding them.
Using the two largest galaxy redshift surveys currently in existence (2dFGRS
and SDSS) we show at the 99.7% confident level that these alignments do indeed
exist: spiral galaxies located on the shells of the largest cosmic voids have
rotation axes that lie preferentially on the void surface.
