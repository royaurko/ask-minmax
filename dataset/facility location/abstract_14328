The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory, located 4100 m above
sea level near Sierra Negra (19$^\circ$ N) in Mexico, is sensitive to gamma
rays and cosmic rays at TeV energies. The arrival direction distribution of
cosmic rays at these energies shows significant anisotropy on several angular
scales, with a relative intensity ranging between 10$^{-3}$ and 10$^{-4}$. We
present the results of a study of cosmic-ray anisotropy based on more than 86
billion cosmic-ray air showers recorded with HAWC since June 2013. The HAWC
cosmic-ray sky map, which has a median energy of 2 TeV, exhibits several
regions of significantly enhanced cosmic-ray flux. We present the energy
dependence of the anisotropy and the cosmic-ray spectrum in the regions of
significant excess.
