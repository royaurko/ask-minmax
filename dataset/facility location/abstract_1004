Electron Ion Collider is a future high energy facility for studies of the
structure of the nucleon. Three-dimensional parton structure is one of the main
goals of EIC. In momentum space Transverse Momentum Dependent Distributions
(TMDs) are the key ingredients to map such a structure. At leading twist spin
structure of spin-1/2 hadron can be described by 8 TMDs. Experimentally these
functions can be studied in polarised SIDIS experiments. We discuss Sivers
distribution function that describes distribution of unpolarised quarks in a
transversely polarised nucleon and transversity that measures distribution of
transversely polarised quarks in a transversely polarised nucleon.
