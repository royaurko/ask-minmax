The black-hole/accretion-disk paradigm for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is
now reasonably secure, but there are still important unresolved issues, some of
which will require the capabilities of an 8 to 10-m class UV/optical
space-based telescope. Imaging spectroscopy with a diffraction-limited large
telescope will be required to measure AGN black-hole masses from stellar
dynamics for direct comparison with reverberation mapping-based masses. High
spectral resolution in the UV is required to determine the mass and kinetic
energy of the outflows observed in the absorption spectra of AGNs and to
understand the energetics of the accretion process. As with ground-based
astronomy, however, effective use of a large UV/optical space telescope
requires complementary smaller facility instruments; a meter-class UV
spectroscopic telescope, for example, can fit into a Medium Explorer budget.
