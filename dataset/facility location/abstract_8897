We present the first Chandra results of the giant molecular cloud Sagittarius
B2 (Sgr B2), located about 100 pc away from the Galactic center. Diffuse X-rays
are clearly separated from one-and-a-half dozen resolved point sources. The
X-ray spectrum exhibits pronounced iron K-shell transition lines at 6.40 keV (K
alpha) and 7.06 keV (K beta), deep iron K-edge at 7.11 keV and large
photo-electric absorption at low energy. The absorption-corrected X-ray
luminosity is \sim 1 times 10^{35} erg s^{-1}, two orders of magnitude larger
than the integrated luminosity of all the resolved point sources. The diffuse
X-rays come mainly from the south-west half of the cloud with a concave-shape
pointing to the Galactic center direction. These results strongly support the
ASCA model that Sgr B2 is irradiated by an X-ray source at the Galactic center
side.
