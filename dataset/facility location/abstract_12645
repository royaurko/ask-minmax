An anisotropic cosmic fluid with radial heat flux which sources a time
dependent Rindler-like geometry is investigated. Even though its energy density
$\rho$ is positive, the radial and transversal pressures are negative and the
strong energy condition is not satisfied. The congruence of "static" observers
is not geodesic and the heat flux is oriented outward. We computed the
Misner-Sharp energy associated with the Rindler-type metric embedded in a
spatially flat FLRW universe and found that the Weyl energy is vanishing thanks
to the conformally flat form of the spacetime. The null geodesic expansions are
computed and one finds that only one of the two apparent horizons is located
inside the event horizon. The properties of the Rindler-like geometry embedded
in the conformally-flat de Sitter spacetime are investigated.
