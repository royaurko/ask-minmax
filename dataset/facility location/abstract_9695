We report numerical results for the phase diagram in the density-disorder
plane of a hard sphere system in the presence of quenched, random, pinning
disorder. Local minima of a discretized version of the Ramakrishnan-Yussouff
free energy functional are located numerically and their relative stability is
studied as a function of the density and the strength of disorder. Regions in
the phase diagram corresponding to liquid, glassy and nearly crystalline states
are mapped out, and the nature of the transitions is determined. The liquid to
glass transition changes from first to second order as the strength of the
disorder is increased. For weak disorder, the system undergoes a first order
crystallization transition as the density is increased. Beyond a critical value
of the disorder strength, this transition is replaced by a continuous glass
transition. Our numerical results are compared with those of analytical work on
the same system. Implications of our results for the field-temperature phase
diagram of type-II superconductors are discussed.
