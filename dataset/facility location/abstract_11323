Inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) now a widely used technique for studying the
dynamics of electrons in condensed matter. We previously posed a solution to
the phase problem for IXS [P. Abbamonte, et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 92},
237401 (2004)], that allows explicit reconstruction of the density propagator
of a system. The propagator represents, physically, the response of the system
to an idealized, point perturbation, so provides direct, real-time images of
electron motion with attosecond time resolution and $\AA$-scale spatial
resolution. Here we show that the images generated by our procedure, as it was
originally posed, are spatial averages over all source locations. Within an
idealized, atomic-like model, we show that in most cases a simple relationship
to the complete, un-averaged response can still be determined. We illustrate
this concept for recent IXS measurements of single crystal graphite.
