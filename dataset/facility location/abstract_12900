Period doubling bifurcation in buck converters is studied by using the
harmonic balance method. A simple dynamic model of a buck converter in
continuous conduction mode under voltage mode or current mode control is
derived. This model consists of the feedback connection of a linear system and
a nonlinear one. An exact harmonic balance analysis is used to obtain a
necessary and sufficient condition for a period doubling bifurcation to occur.
If such a bifurcation occurs, the analysis also provides information on its
exact location. Using the condition for bifurcation, a feedforward control is
designed to eliminate the period doubling bifurcation. This results in a wider
range of allowed source voltage, and also in improved line regulation.
