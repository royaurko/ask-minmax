We present near-infrared magnitudes for all white dwarfs (selected from the
catalog of McCook & Sion) contained in the 2 Micron All Sky Survey Second
Incremental Data Release(2MASS 2IDR). We show that the near-IR color-color
diagram is an effective means of identifying candidate binary stars containing
a WD and a low mass main sequence star. The loci of single WDs and WD + red
dwarf binaries occupy distinct regions of the near-IR color-color diagram. We
recovered all known unresolved WD + red dwarf binaries located in the 2IDR sky
coverage, and also identified as many new candidate binaries (47 new candidates
out of 95 total). Using observational near-IR data for WDs and M-L dwarfs, we
have compared a sample of simulated WD + red dwarf binaries with our 2MASS
data. The colors of the simulated binaries are dominated by the low mass
companion through the late-M to early-L spectral types. As the spectral type of
the companion becomes progressively later, however, the colors of unresolved
binaries become progressively bluer. Binaries containing the lowest mass
companions will be difficult to distinguish from single WDs solely on the basis
of their near-IR colors.
