In white-light coronagraph images, cool prominence material is sometimes
observed as bright patches in the core of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). If, as
generally assumed, this emission is caused by Thomson-scattered light from the
solar surface, it should be strongly polarised tangentially to the solar limb.
However, the observations of a CME made with the SECCHI/STEREO coronagraphs on
31 August 2007 show that the emission from these bright core patches is
exceptionally low polarised. We used the polarisation ratio method of Moran and
Davila (2004) to localise the barycentre of the CME cloud. By analysing the
data from both STEREO spacecraft we could resolve the plane-of-the-sky
ambiguity this method usually suffers from. Stereoscopic triangulation was used
to independently localise the low-polarisation patch relative to the cloud. We
demonstrated for the first time that the bright core material is located close
to the centre of the CME cloud. We show that the major part of the CME core
emission, more than 85% in our case, is H$\alpha$ radiation and only a small
fraction is Thomson-scattered light. Recent calculations also imply that the
plasma density in the patch is 8 10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$ or more compared to 2.6
10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$ for the Thomson-scattering CME environment surrounding the
core material.
