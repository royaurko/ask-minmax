This paper presents a new approach for the automatic license plate
recognition, which includes the SIFT algorithm in step to locate the plate in
the input image. In this new approach, besides the comparison of the features
obtained with the SIFT algorithm, the correspondence between the spatial
orientations and the positioning associated with the keypoints is also
observed. Afterwards, an algorithm is used for the character recognition of the
plates, very fast, which makes it possible its application in real time. The
results obtained with the proposed approach presented very good success rates,
so much for locating the characters in the input image, as for their
recognition.
