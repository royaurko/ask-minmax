In a previous paper, we showed that the traditional form of the charged
C-metric can be transformed, by a change of coordinates, into one with an
explicitly factorizable structure function. This new form of the C-metric has
the advantage that its properties become much simpler to analyze. In this
paper, we propose an analogous new form for the rotating charged C-metric, with
structure function G(\xi)=(1-\xi^2)(1+r_{+}A\xi)(1+r_{-}A\xi), where r_\pm are
the usual locations of the horizons in the Kerr-Newman black hole. Unlike the
non-rotating case, this new form is not related to the traditional one by a
coordinate transformation. We show that the physical distinction between these
two forms of the rotating C-metric lies in the nature of the conical
singularities causing the black holes to accelerate apart: the new form is free
of torsion singularities and therefore does not contain any closed timelike
curves. We claim that this new form should be considered the natural
generalization of the C-metric with rotation.
