(Abridged) We performed a deep infrared imaging survey of 63 embedded young
stellar objects (YSOs) located in the Taurus and Ophiuchus clouds to search for
companions. The sample includes Class I and flat infrared spectrum protostellar
objects. We find 17 companions physically bound to 15 YSOs with angular
separations in the range 0.8-10" (110-1400 AU) and derive a companion star
fraction of 23+/-9 % and 29+/-7 % for embedded YSOs in Taurus and Ophiuchus,
respectively. In spite of different properties of the clouds and especially of
the prestellar cores, the fraction of wide companions, 27+/-6 % for the
combined sample, is identical in the two star-forming regions. This suggests
that the frequency and properties of wide multiple protostellar systems are not
very sensitive to specific initial conditions. Comparing the companion star
fraction of the youngest YSOs still surrounded by extended envelopes to that of
more evolved YSOs, we find evidence for a possible evolution of the fraction of
wide multiple systems, which seems to decrease by a factor of about 2 on a
timescale of about 10^5 yr. Somewhat contrary to model predictions, we do not
find evidence for a sub-clustering of embedded sources at this stage on a scale
of a few 100 AU that could be related to the formation of small-N protostellar
clusters. Possible interpretations for this discrepancy are discussed.
