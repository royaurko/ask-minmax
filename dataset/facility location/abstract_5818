In a recent Physical Review Letter, Oreg and Finkel'stein (OF) have
calculated the electron density of states (DOS) for tunneling into a repulsive
Luttinger liquid close to the location of an impurity. The result of their
calculation is a DOS which is enhanced with respect to the pure system, and
moreover diverging for not too strong repulsion. In this Comment we intend to
show that OF's calculation suffers from a subtle flaw which, being corrected,
results into a DOS not only vanishing at zero frequency but in fact suppressed
in comparison with the DOS of a pure Luttinger liquid.
