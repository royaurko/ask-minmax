Although a decade of microlensing searches towards the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC) has detected 13-25 possible microlensing events, the nature and the
location of the lenses, being either halo machos or LMC stars, remains a
subject of debate. The star-star lensing models generically predict the
existence of a small population (more than about 5 percent of stars with a
spatial and kinematic distribution different from the thin, young disc of the
LMC. Here we present the results of a large spectroscopic survey of the LMC,
consisting of more than 1300 radial velocities measured accurately with the 2dF
instrument. In this large sample, no evidence is found for any extraneous
population over the expected LMC and Galactic components. Any additional,
kinematically distint, population can only be present at less than the 1
percent level. We discuss the significance of this finding for the LMC
self-lensing models.
