We report the results of a successful 24 hour 6.7 GHz VLBI experiment using
the 30 meter radio telescope WARK30M near Warkworth, New Zealand, recently
converted from a radio telecommunications antenna, and two radio telescopes
located in Australia: Hobart 26-m and Ceduna 30-m. The geocentric position of
WARK30M is determined with a 100 mm uncertainty for the vertical component and
10 mm for the horizontal components. We report correlated flux densities at 6.7
GHz of 175 radio sources associated with Fermi gamma-ray sources. A parsec
scale emission from the radio source 1031-837 is detected, and its association
with the gamma-ray object 2FGL J1032.9-8401 is established with a high
likelihood ratio. We conclude that the new Pacific area radio telescope WARK30M
is ready to operate for scientific projects.
