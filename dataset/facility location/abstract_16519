We describe an ongoing variable star search program and present the first
reduced results of a search in a 19 square degree (4.4\circle x 4.4\circle)
field centered on J2000 {\alpha} = 22:03:24, {\delta} = +18:54:32. The search
was carried out with the Baker-Nunn Patrol Camera located at the Rothney
Astrophysical Observatory in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies. A total of
26,271 stars were detected in the field, over a range of about 11-15
(instrumental) magnitudes. Our image processing made use of the IRAF version of
the DAOPHOT aperture photometry routine and we used the ANOVA method to search
for periodic variations in the light curves. We formally detected periodic
variability in 35 stars, that we tentatively classify according to light curve
characteristics: 6 EA (Algol), 5 EB ({\beta} Lyrae), 19 EW (W UMa), and 5 RR
(RR Lyrae) stars. Eleven of the detected variable stars have been reported
previously in the literature. The eclipsing binary light curves have been
analyzed with a package of light curve modeling programs and 25 have yielded
converged solutions. Nine of these systems are detached, 3 semi0detached, 10
over-contact, and 2 appear to be in marginal contact. We discuss these results
as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the instrument and of the
program.
