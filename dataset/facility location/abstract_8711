Narrow-band imaging of the nuclear region of NGC 4151 with the Hubble Space
Telescope is presented. The filter bandpasses isolate line emission in various
high velocity ranges in several ions. Slitless and long-slit spectra of the
region with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph also indicate the
locations of high velocity gas. These emission regions are faint and are
interspersed among the bright emission clouds seen in direct images. They have
radial velocities up to 1400 km/s relative to the nucleus, and are found in
both approach and recession on both sides of the nucleus. This contrasts
strongly with the bright emission line clouds which have been discussed
previously as showing bidirectional outflow with velocities within 400 km/s of
the nucleus. We discuss the possible connections of the high velocity material
with the radio jet and the nuclear radiation.
