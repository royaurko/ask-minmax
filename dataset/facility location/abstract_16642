The blazar 1ES 0229+200 is a high frequency peaked BL Lac object with a hard
TeV spectrum extending to 10 TeV. Its unusual spectral characteristics make it
a frequently used probe for intergalactic radiation and magnetic fields. With
new, simultaneous observations in the optical, ultraviolet (UV) and X-rays, the
synchrotron emission is probed in great detail. The X-ray emission varies by a
factor of ~2 in 2009, while being rather stable in 2010. The X-ray spectrum is
very hard (\Gamma ~ 1.8) and it shows an indication of excess absorption above
the Galactic value. The X-ray emission is detected up to ~100 keV without any
significant cut-off, thus 1ES 0229+200 belongs to the class of extreme blazars.
The simultaneous measured, host galaxy- and extinction-corrected optical and UV
fluxes illustrate that the cut-off of the low energy part of the synchrotron
emission is located in the UV regime. The minimum energy of the electron
distribution has to be rather high to account for this cut-off. This implies
that there is a narrow-band energy distribution function of radiating
electrons, which is responsible for the unusually hard TeV spectrum. Other
extreme blazars have similar synchrotron peak frequencies but much softer TeV
spectra, hence 1ES 0229+200 has one of the highest inverse Compton (IC) peak
frequency and the narrowest electron distribution among the extreme blazars
known to date.
