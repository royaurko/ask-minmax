We study a family of orthogonal polynomials which satisfy (apart from a
3-term recurrence relation) an eigenvalue equation involving a third order
differential operator of Dunkl-type. The orthogonality measure of these
polynomials consists in the continuous measure of the little -1 Jacobi
polynomials to which is added an arbitrary mass located at the point $x=0$, the
middle of the orthogonality interval. This provides the first nontrivial
example of Krall-type polynomials with a point mass inside the orthogonality
interval. These polynomials can be obtained by a Geronimus transform of the
little $q$-Jacobi polynomials in the limit $q=-1$.
