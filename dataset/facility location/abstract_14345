The Cygnus region is a very active region of our Galaxy with many sources of
GeV and TeV gamma-ray emission, such as supernova remnants, pulsar wind
nebulae, and massive star clusters. A detailed study of the Cygnus region at
these energies can give insight into the processes of particle acceleration in
astrophysical sources. VERITAS (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope
Array System) is an array of four 12 meter diameter imaging atmospheric
Cherenkov telescopes located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) in
southern Arizona. From 2007 through 2012 VERITAS observed the Cygnus region for
nearly 300 hours, from 67 to 82 degrees Galactic longitude and from -1 to 4
degrees in Galactic latitude. We have reanalyzed the VERITAS data with updated
more sensitive analysis techniques and will be cross correlating that data with
the results of an analysis of nearly six years of Fermi-LAT data in the region.
Using this cross correlation we can motivate continued observations in this
active region of the Galaxy.
