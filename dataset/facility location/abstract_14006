Using event-by-event viscous fluid dynamics to evolve fluctuating initial
density profiles from the Monte-Carlo Glauber model for U+U collisions, we
report a "knee"-like structure in the elliptic flow as a function of collision
centrality, located near 0.5% centrality as measured by the final charged
multiplicity. This knee is due to the preferential selection of tip-on-tip
collision geometries by a high-multiplicity trigger. Such a knee structure is
not seen in the STAR data. This rules out the two-component MC-Glauber model
for initial energy and entropy production. An enrichment of tip-tip
configurations by triggering solely on high-multiplicity in the U+U collisions
thus does not work. On the other hand, using the Zero Degree Calorimeters
(ZDCs) coupled with event-shape engineering, we identify the selection purity
of body-body and tip-tip events in the full-overlap U+U collisions. With
additional constraints on the asymmetry of the ZDC signals one can further
increases the probability of selecting tip-tip events in U+U collisions.
