The OPERA collaboration has claimed evidence of superluminal {\nu}{_\mu}
propagation between CERN and the LNGS. Cohen and Glashow argued that such
neutrinos should lose energy by producing photons and e+e- pairs, through Z0
mediated processes analogous to Cherenkov radiation. In terms of the parameter
delta=(v^2_nu-v^2_c)/v^2_c, the OPERA result implies delta = 5 x 10^-5. For
this value of \delta a very significant deformation of the neutrino energy
spectrum and an abundant production of photons and e+e- pairs should be
observed at LNGS. We present an analysis based on the 2010 and part of the 2011
data sets from the ICARUS experiment, located at Gran Sasso National Laboratory
and using the same neutrino beam from CERN. We find that the rates and
deposited energy distributions of neutrino events in ICARUS agree with the
expectations for an unperturbed spectrum of the CERN neutrino beam. Our results
therefore refute a superluminal interpretation of the OPERA result according to
the Cohen and Glashow prediction for a weak current analog to Cherenkov
radiation. In particular no superluminal Cherenkov like e+e- pair or gamma
emission event has been directly observed inside the fiducial volume of the
"bubble chamber like" ICARUS TPC-LAr detector, setting the much stricter limit
of delta < 2.5 10^-8 at the 90% confidence level, comparable with the one due
to the observations from the SN1987A.
