In this paper, a new synesthetic documentation method that contributes to
media art conservation is presented. This new method is called e-Installation
in analogy to the idea of the e-Book as the electronic version of a real book.
An e-Installation is a virtualized media artwork that reproduces all
synesthesia, interaction, and meaning levels of the artwork. Advanced 3D
modeling and telepresence technologies with a very high level of immersion
allow the virtual re-enactment of works of media art that are no longer
performable or rarely exhibited. The virtual re-enactment of a media artwork
can be designed with a scalable level of complexity depending on whether it
addresses professionals such as curators, art restorers, and art theorists or
the general public. An e-Installation is independent from the artwork's
physical location and can be accessed via head-mounted display or similar data
goggles, computer browser, or even mobile devices. In combination with
informational and preventive conservation measures, the e-Installation offers
an intermediate and long-term solution to archive, disseminate, and pass down
the milestones of media art history as a synesthetic documentation when the
original work can no longer be repaired or exhibited in its full function.
