We analyse how nonclassical features of squeezed radiation (in particular the
sub-Poissonian noise) are degraded when it is transmitted through an amplifying
or absorbing medium with randomly located scattering centra. Both the cases of
direct photodetection and of homodyne detection are considered. Explicit
results are obtained for the dependence of the Fano factor (the ratio of the
noise power and the mean current) on the degree of squeezing of the incident
state, on the length and the mean free path of the medium, the temperature, and
on the absorption or amplification rate.
