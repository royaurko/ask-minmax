Since two years, the FACT telescope is operating on the Canary Island of La
Palma. Apart from its purpose to serve as a monitoring facility for the
brightest TeV blazars, it was built as a major step to establish solid state
photon counters as detectors in Cherenkov astronomy. The camera of the First
G-APD Cherenkov Telesope comprises 1440 Geiger-mode avalanche photo diodes
(G-APD), equipped with solid light guides to increase the effective light
collection area of each sensor. Since no sense-line is available, a special
challenge is to keep the applied voltage stable although the current drawn by
the G-APD depends on the flux of night-sky background photons significantly
varying with ambient light conditions. Methods have been developed to keep the
temperature and voltage dependent response of the G-APDs stable during
operation. As a cross-check, dark count spectra with high statistics have been
taken under different environmental conditions. In this presentation, the
project, the developed methods and the experience from two years of operation
of the first G-APD based camera in Cherenkov astronomy under changing
environmental conditions will be presented.
