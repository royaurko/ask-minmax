Starting in the middle of November 2002, the CMS experiment undertook an
evaluation of the European DataGrid Project (EDG) middleware using its event
simulation programs. A joint CMS-EDG task force performed a "stress test" by
submitting a large number of jobs to many distributed sites. The EDG testbed
was complemented with additional CMS-dedicated resources. A total of ~ 10000
jobs consisting of two different computational types were submitted from four
different locations in Europe over a period of about one month. Nine sites were
active, providing integrated resources of more than 500 CPUs and about 5 TB of
disk space (with the additional use of two Mass Storage Systems). Descriptions
of the adopted procedures, the problems encountered and the corresponding
solutions are reported. Results and evaluations of the test, both from the CMS
and the EDG perspectives, are described.
