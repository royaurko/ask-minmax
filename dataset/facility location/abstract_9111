We have investigated the constraints on the Cardassian model using the recent
results from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) for the locations
of the peaks of the Cosmic Microwave Background
 (CMB) anistropy spectrum. We find that the model is consistent with the recent
observational data for certain range of the model parameter $n$ and the
cosmological parameters. We find that the Cardassian model is favoured compared
to $\Lambda$CDM model, for a higher spectral index ($n_s \approx 1$) together
with lower value of
 Hubble parameter $h$ ($h\leq 0.71$). But for smaller values of $n_s$, both
$\Lambda$CDM and Cardassian are equally favoured. Also, irrespective of
Supernova constraint, CMB data alone predicts current acceleration of the
universe in this model. We have also studied the constraint on the
$\sigma_{8}$, the rms density fluctuations at
 $8h^{-1}$ Mpc scale.
