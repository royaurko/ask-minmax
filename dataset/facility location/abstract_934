The Large APEX Bolometer Camera, LABOCA, has been commissioned for operation
as a new facility instrument t the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment 12m
submillimeter telescope. This new 295-bolometer total power camera, operating
in the 870 micron atmospheric window, combined with the high efficiency of APEX
and the excellent atmospheric transmission at the site, offers unprecedented
capability in mapping submillimeter continuum emission for a wide range of
astronomical purposes.
