We present deep broad-band R and narrow-band Halpha images of Stephan's
Quintet. The observations in the R band show that the diffuse halo of the
Stephan's Quintet is larger than previously thought and extends out to NGC
7320C. However, we have not found emission connecting NGC 7331 and NGC 7320 to
R ~ 26.7 mag/arcsec^2 (at more than 3-sigma level), so there is no direct
evidence up to this limiting magnitude of a relation between the peculiar
kinematical structure found in NGC 7331 and an ongoing or past interaction
between this galaxy and NGC 7320. The Halpha emission at high-velocity
(6000-7000 km/s) is distributed in a diffuse structure running NS between NGC
7319 and NGC 7318B and in some other more concentrated features. Some of these
are located in the tidal tails produced by the interaction between the galaxies
of the group. With the Halpha images we have made a two-dimensional velocity
map which helps to identify the origin of each structure detected. This map
does not show features at intermediate velocities between the high- and
low-redshift members of the group. This is in agreement with the standard
scenario in which the apparent proximity of NGC 7320 to the rest of the
galaxies of the Quintet is merely a projection effect. The only point which is
unclear in this interpretation, is an Halpha filament which is seen extending
throughout NGC 7320 with velocity at 6500 km/s instead of the 800 km/s expected
for this galaxy.
