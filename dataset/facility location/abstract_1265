Underground cable power transmission and distribution system are susceptible
to faults. Accurate fault location for transmission lines is of vital
importance. A quick detection and analysis of faults is necessity of power
retailers and distributors. This paper reviews various fault locating methods
and highly computational methods proposed by research community that are
currently in use. The paper also presents some guidelines for design of fault
location and remote indication, for reducing power outages and reducing heavy
loss of revenue.
