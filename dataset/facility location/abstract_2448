The bio-inertness of titanium and its alloys attracts their use as bone
implants. However a bioactive coating is usually necessary for improving the
bone bonding of such implants. In this study, electrophoretic deposition(EPD)
of hydroxyapatite (HA) powder on titanium plate was performed using butanol as
solvent under direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) fields. The zeta
potential of the suspensions was measured to understand their stability and the
charge on the particles. Coating thickness was varied by adjusting the voltage
and time of deposition. Surface morphology and cross section thickness were
studied using scanning electron microscopy and image analysis software. Surface
crack density was calculated from the micrographs. The results showed that the
samples of similar thickness have higher grain density when coated using AC as
compared to DC EPD. This facile but novel test proves the capability of AC-EPD
to attain denser and uniform HA coatings from non-aqueous medium.
