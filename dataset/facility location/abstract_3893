Instrument backgrounds at neutron scattering facilities directly affect the
quality and the efficiency of the scientific measurements that users perform.
Part of the background at pulsed spallation neutron sources is caused by, and
time-correlated with, the emission of high energy particles when the proton
beam strikes the spallation target. This prompt pulse ultimately produces a
signal, which can be highly problematic for a subset of instruments and
measurements due to the time-correlated properties, and different to that from
reactor sources. Measurements of this background have been made at both SNS
(ORNL, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) and SINQ (PSI, Villigen, Switzerland). The
background levels were generally found to be low compared to natural
background. However, very low intensities of high-energy particles have been
found to be detrimental to instrument performance in some conditions. Given
that instrument performance is typically characterised by S/N, improvements in
backgrounds can both improve instrument performance whilst at the same time
delivering significant cost savings. A systematic holistic approach is
suggested in this contribution to increase the effectiveness of this.
Instrument performance should subsequently benefit.
