This article reviews some recent studies of the mass, age, and space
distributions of star clusters, with a primary focus on the large population of
clusters in the interacting Antennae galaxies. Some of the highlights of these
studies are the following: 1. The mass function of the young clusters (with
ages \tau < 10^8 yr) has power-law form, dN/dM propto M^{-2}, over the observed
range of masses, 10^4 < M < 10^6 solar masses. 2. The age distribution of the
clusters declines steeply at all ages, roughly as dN/d tau propto tau^{-1} for
mass-limited samples, indicating rapid disruption of most clusters. 3. At least
20% and possibly all stars form in clusters and/or associations, including
those that are unbound and short-lived. 4. Many of the clusters that remain
bound just after their formation are disrupted on longer timescales by a
combination of mass loss by stellar evolution and several stellar dynamical
processes. 5. The young clusters have a clumpy space distribution and are
located preferentially in regions of high interstellar density, at least when
averaged over scales of about a kpc. 6. The positions of the young clusters,
however, are not correlated with the local velocity gradients or velocity
dispersions in the interstellar medium. There are growing indications that most
of these conclusions also apply to the populations of young star clusters in
other galaxies, both interacting and quiescent.
