Using a relativistic transport model ART1.0, we explore effects of nuclear
symmetry energy on eta meson production and its rare decay to the dark U-boson
in heavy-ion reactions from 0.2 to 10 GeV/nucleon available at several current
and future facilities. The yield of eta mesons at sub-threshold energies is
found to be very sensitive to the density dependence of nuclear symmetry
energy. Above a beam energy of about 5 GeV/nucleon in Au+Au reactions, the
sensitivity to symmetry energy disappears. Using the branching ratio of the
rare eta decay (eta->gamma U) available in the literature, we estimate the
maximum cross section for the U-boson production in the energy range
considered, providing a useful reference for future U-boson search using
heavy-ion reactions.
