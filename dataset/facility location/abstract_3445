We compute the molecular line emission of massive protostellar disks by
solving the equation of radiative transfer through the cores and disks produced
by the recent radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of Krumholz, Klein, & McKee.
We find that in several representative lines the disks show brightness
temperatures of hundreds of Kelvin over velocity channels ~10 km s^-1 wide,
extending over regions hundreds of AU in size. We process the computed
intensities to model the performance of next-generation radio and submillimeter
telescopes. Our calculations show that observations using facilities such as
the EVLA and ALMA should be able to detect massive protostellar disks and
measure their rotation curves, at least in the nearest massive star-forming
regions. They should also detect significant sub-structure and non-axisymmetry
in the disks, and in some cases may be able to detect star-disk velocity
offsets of a few km s^-1, both of which are the result of strong gravitational
instability in massive disks. We use our simulations to explore the strengths
and weaknesses of different observational techniques, and we also discuss how
observations of massive protostellar disks may be used to distinguish between
alternative models of massive star formation.
