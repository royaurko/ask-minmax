We present results from Swift, XMM-Newton, and deep INTEGRAL monitoring in
the region of GRB 050925. This short Swift burst is a candidate for a newly
discovered soft gamma-ray repeater (SGR) with the following observational burst
properties: 1) galactic plane (b=-0.1 deg) localization, 2) 150 msec duration,
and 3) a blackbody rather than a simple power-law spectral shape (with a
significance level of 97%). We found two possible X-ray counterparts of GRB
050925 by comparing the X-ray images from Swift XRT and XMM-Newton. Both X-ray
sources show the transient behavior with a power-law decay index shallower than
-1. We found no hard X-ray emission nor any additional burst from the location
of GRB 050925 in ~5 Ms of INTEGRAL data. We discuss about the three BATSE short
bursts which might be associated with GRB 050925, based on their location and
the duration. Assuming GRB 050925 is associated with the H II regions (W 58) at
the galactic longitude of l=70 deg, we also discuss the source frame properties
of GRB 050925.
