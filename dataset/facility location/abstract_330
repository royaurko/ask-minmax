The concept of cloud computing was introduced to meet the increase in demand
for new application for a project, and to provide a large storage facility
whenever or wherever a user needs it. The cloud system facility helped many
industries as well as individual users to get authentic software at a very low
cost. But with this new system comes the major concern of security, as the
connection to the cloud is through the web and the data and application
availability need to be handled for each client. The paper describes the
various security measures that can be added in isolation or in combination for
securing data transmission, server and client.
