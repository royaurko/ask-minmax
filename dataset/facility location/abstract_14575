We use the calculations derived in a previous paper (M\'era, Chabrier and
Schaeffer, 1997), based on observational constraints arising from star counts,
microlensing experiments and kinematic properties, to determine the amount of
dark matter under the form of stellar and sub-stellar objects in the different
parts of the Galaxy. This yields the derivation of different mass-models for
the Galaxy. In the light of all the afore-mentioned constraints, we discuss two
models that correspond to different conclusions about the nature and the
location of the Galactic dark matter. In the first model there is a small
amount of dark matter in the disk, and a large fraction of the dark matter in
the halo is still undetected and likely to be non-baryonic. The second, less
conventional model is consistent with entirely, or at least predominantly
baryonic dark matter, under the form of brown dwarfs in the disk and white
dwarfs in the dark halo. We derive observational predictions for these two
models which should be verifiable by near future infrared and microlensing
observations.
