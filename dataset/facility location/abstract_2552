In today's world the use of computer and telecommunications networking is
essential for human life. Among these, mobile tools and devices due to
availability, have found a special impact on everyone life. This feature
addition to providing sample facilities such as financial transactions at any
place and time has raised the Sensitivities about security of these devices. In
order to provide security, numerous techniques have been proposed which due to
the limitations of mobile devices; an algorithm should be taken that have the
ability to function for light weight ubiquitous computing. In this paper, four
eSTREAM candidates from software profile were taken into account and analyzed
and implemented by using J2ME technology. Then these algorithms were
implemented on a variety of mobile phones and are compared with each other in
terms of execution time and finally the obtained Results are expressed.
