The main goal of this proposal is the search for a narrow cryptoexotic
nucleon resonance by scanning of the pi- p system invariant mass in the region
(1610-1770) MeV with the detection of pi- p and K Lambda decays. The scan is
supposed to be done by the variation of the incident pi- momentum and its
measurement with the accuracy of up to +-0.1% (better than 1 MeV in terms of
the invariant mass in the whole energy range) with a set of proportional
chambers located in the first focus of the magnetooptical channel. High
sensitivity of the method to the resonance under search is shown. The secondary
particles scattered from a liquid hydrogen target are detected by sets of the
wire drift chambers equipped with modern electronics. The time scale of the
project is about 3 years. The budget estimate including manpower, the apparatus
and operation cost, is about 40 million rubles. The beam time required is (4-6)
two week runs on "high" (10 GeV/c) flattop of the ITEP proton synchrotron.
