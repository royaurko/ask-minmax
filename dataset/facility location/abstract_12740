Here we show an example of a young asteroid cluster located in a dynamically
stable region, which was produced by partial disruption of a primitive body
about 30 km in size. We estimate its age to be only 1.9 +/- 0.3 Myr, thus its
post-impact evolution should have been very limited. The large difference in
size between the largest object and the other cluster members means that this
was a cratering event. The parent body had a large orbital inclination, and was
subject to collisions with typical impact speeds higher by a factor of 2 than
in the most common situations encountered in the main belt. For the first time
we have at disposal the observable outcome of a very recent event to study
high-speed collisions involving primitive asteroids, providing very useful
constraints to numerical simulations of these events and to laboratory
experiments.
