The longitudinal electrical resistivity and the transverse Hall resistivity
of CeFeAsO are simultaneously measured up to a magnetic field of 45T using the
facilities of pulsed magnetic field at Los Alamos. Distinct behaviour is
observed in both the magnetoresistance Rxx({\mu}0H) and the Hall resistance
Rxy({\mu}0H) while crossing the structural phase transition at Ts \approx 150K.
At temperatures above Ts, little magnetoresistance is observed and the Hall
resistivity follows linear field dependence. Upon cooling down the system below
Ts, large magnetoresistance develops and the Hall resistivity deviates from the
linear field dependence. Furthermore, we found that the transition at Ts is
extremely robust against the external magnetic field. We argue that the
magnetic state in CeFeAsO is unlikely a conventional type of spin-density-wave
(SDW).
