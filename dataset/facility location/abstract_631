A novel concept of high-power transmitters utilizing the Continuous Wave (CW)
magnetrons, frequency-locked by phase-modulated signals has been proposed to
compensate energy losses caused by Synchrotron Radiation (SR) in the electron
ring of the MEIC facility. At operating frequency of about 750 MHz the SR
losses are ~2 MW. They can be compensated by some number of Superconducting RF
(SRF) cavities at the feeding power of about 100-200 kW per cavity. A
high-power CW transmitters, based on magnetrons, frequency-locked by
phase-modulated signal, allowing a wide-band control in phase and power, and
associated with a wide-band closed feedback loop are proposed to feed the SRF
cavities to compensate the SR losses of the electron beam in the MEIC collider
electron ring.
