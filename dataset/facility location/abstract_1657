Baryons with a single heavy quark are being studied experimentally at
present. Baryons with two units of heavy flavor will be abundantly produced not
only at future colliders, but also at existing facilities. In this paper we
study the production via heavy quark fragmentation of baryons containing two
heavy quarks at the Tevatron, the LHC, HERA, and the NLC. The production rate
is woefully small at HERA and at the NLC, but significant at $pp$ and
$p\bar{p}$ machines. We present distributions in various kinematical variables
in addition to the integrated cross sections at hadron colliders.
