One major bottleneck in the practical implementation of received signal
strength (RSS) based indoor localization systems is the extensive deployment
efforts required to construct the radio maps through fingerprinting. In this
paper, we aim to design an indoor localization scheme that can be directly
employed without building a full fingerprinted radio map of the indoor
environment. By accumulating the information of localized RSSs, this scheme can
also simultaneously construct the radio map with limited calibration. To design
this scheme, we employ a source data set that possesses the same spatial
correlation of the RSSs in the indoor environment under study. The knowledge of
this data set is then transferred to a limited number of calibration
fingerprints and one or several RSS observations with unknown locations, in
order to perform direct localization of these observations using manifold
alignment. We test two different source data sets, namely a simulated radio
propagation map and the environments plan coordinates. For moving users, we
exploit the correlation of their observations to improve the localization
accuracy. The online testing in two indoor environments shows that the plan
coordinates achieve better results than the simulated radio maps, and a
negligible degradation with 70-85% reduction in calibration load.
