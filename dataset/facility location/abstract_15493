A new faint and large shell-type radio Supernova Remnant (SNR) G108.2-0.6 has
been discovered in the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS). The SNR shows an
elliptical shell-type structure at 1420 MHz, and has a 408-1420 MHz TT-plot
spectral index of $\alpha$=-0.5$\pm$0.1 (S$_{\nu}$$\propto$$\nu$$^{\alpha}$),
typical of a shell-type SNR. The remnant's flux density at 1420 MHz is
6.6$\pm$0.7 Jy, and at 408 MHz is 11.5$\pm$1.2 Jy. Both of these are corrected
for compact sources. An integrated spectral index of $-0.45\pm$0.13 is
determined. This new SNR has among the lowest surface brightness of any known
remnant ($\Sigma$$_{1 GHz}$=2.4$\times10^{-22}$ W m$^{-2}$ Hz$^{-1}$
sr$^{-1}$). 21 cm Stokes Q and U CGPS data (plus preliminary Effelsberg Q and U
maps) show some suggestive features that correlate with total power. \ion{H}{i}
observations show structures associated with G108.2$-$0.6 in the radial
velocity range $-$53 to $-$58 km s$^{-1}$, and indicate it is located in the
Perseus arm shock at a distance of 3.2$\pm$0.6 kpc. At this distance the
diameter of G108.2$-$0.6 is 58 pc. IRAS maps (12, 25, 60 and 100\mu m) of the
new SNR show rich infrared emission surrounding G108.2$-$0.6.
