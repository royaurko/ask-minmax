HESS J0632+057 is an unidentified gamma-ray source located in the Monoceros
region, probably associated with the massive Be star MWC 148. H.E.S.S. and
VERITAS observations in the very high energy (VHE) range combined with Swift
X-ray data indicate that this object is a new member of the elusive gamma-ray
binary class. We present here results of VHE gamma-ray observations from
VERITAS and HESS at energies above 100 GeV taken over more than six years. The
observations confirm HESS J0632+057 as a point-like VHE source with a
significance of more than 12 standard deviations. The VHE gamma-ray results are
discussed in the context of contemporaneous X-ray observations with Swift XRT.
