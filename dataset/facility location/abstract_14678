Color-magnitude diagrams from deep, wide-field CCD photometry of the Sculptor
dwarf spheroidal galaxy reveal that the red horizonal branch (RHB) stars are
strongly concentrated towards the center of the galaxy relative to the dominant
old population in Sculptor, confirming an earlier claim of such a gradient (Da
Costa et al. 1996). Since we find no radial gradients of the age or metallicity
distribution within Sculptor, neither age nor metallicity can individually
account for the internal `second parameter' problem observed within the galaxy.
We have also identified an unusual `spur' of stars that extends from the main
sequence turnoff region and located between the canonical blue straggler region
and the subgiant branch. These stars are also more centrally concentrated than
the oldest stars in Sculptor, although not as extremely as the RHB stars.
Unable to convincingly interpret the spur either as an unusual young population
or as a foreground population of stars, we conclude that binary stars offer the
most reasonable explanation for the origin of the spur that is also consistent
with other features in the CMD of Sculptor. We infer that 30-60% of all
apparently single stars in the inner region of Sculptor may be binaries. We
speculate that the possible radial gradient in the binary-star population may
be related to the variation of the HB morphology in Sculptor.
