In this paper, a division-of-amplitude photopolarimeter (DOAP) for measuring
the polarization state of free-electron laser (FEL) pulse is described. The
incident FEL beam is divided into four separate beams, and four Stokes
parameters can be measured in a single-shot. In the crossed-planar undulators
experiment at Shanghai deep ultraviolet FEL test facility, this DOAP instrument
constructed in house responses accurately and timely while the
polarization-state of fully coherent FEL pulses are switched, which is helpful
for confirming the crossed-planar undulators technique for short-wavelength
FELs.
