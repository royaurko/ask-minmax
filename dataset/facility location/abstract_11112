We provide a detailed analysis of several aspects of the turduckening
technique for evolving black holes. At the analytical level we study the
constraint propagation for a general family of BSSN-type formulation of
Einstein's field equations and identify under what conditions the turducken
procedure is rigorously justified and under what conditions constraint
violations will propagate to the outside of the black holes. We present
high-resolution spherically symmetric studies which verify our analytical
predictions. Then we present three dimensional simulations of single distorted
black holes using different variations of the turduckening method and also the
puncture method. We study the effect that these different methods have on the
coordinate conditions, constraint violations, and extracted gravitational
waves. We find that the waves agree up to small but non-vanishing differences,
caused by escaping superluminal gauge modes. These differences become smaller
with increasing detector location.
