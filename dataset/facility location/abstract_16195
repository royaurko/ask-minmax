Very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays have been detected from the direction of
the Galactic center. The H.E.S.S. Cherenkov telescopes have located this
gamma-ray source with a preliminary position uncertainty of 8.5" per axis (6"
statistic + 6" sytematic per axis). Within the uncertainty region several
possible counterpart candidates exist: the Super Massive Black Hole Sgr A*, the
Pulsar Wind Nebula candidate G359.95-0.04, the Low Mass X-Ray Binary-system
J174540.0-290031, the stellar cluster IRS 13, as well as self-annihilating dark
matter. It is experimentally very challenging to further improve the positional
accuracy in this energy range and therefore, it may not be possible to clearly
associate one of the counterpart candidates with the VHE-source. Here, we
present a new method to investigate a possible link of the VHE-source with the
near environment of Sgr A* (within approximately 1000 Schwarzschild radii).
This method uses the time- and energy-dependent effect of absorption of
gamma-rays by pair-production (in the following named pair-eclipse) with
low-energy photons of stars closely orbiting the SMBH Sgr A*.
