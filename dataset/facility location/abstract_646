A 3.9 GHz deflecting mode (pi, TM110) cavity has been long used for
six-dimensional phase-space beam manipulation tests at the A0 Photo-Injector
Lab (16 MeV) in Fermilab and their extended applications with vacuum
cryomodules are currently planned at the Advanced Superconducting Test
Accelerator (ASTA) user facility (> 50 MeV). Despite the successful test
results, the cavity, however, demonstrated limited RF performance during liquid
nitrogen (LN2) ambient operation that was inferior to theoretical prediction.
We have been performing full analysis of the designed cavity by analytic
calculation and comprehensive system simulation analysis to solve complex
thermodynamics and mechanical stresses. The re-assembled cryomodule is
currently under the test with a 50 kW klystron at the Fermilab A0 beamline,
which will benchmark the modeling analysis. The test result will be used to
design vacuum cryomodules for the 3.9 GHz deflecting mode cavity that will be
employed at the ASTA facility for beam diagnostics and phase-space control.
