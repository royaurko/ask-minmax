The Supernova/Acceleration Probe (SNAP) is a proposed space-borne observatory
that will survey the sky with a wide-field optical/near-infrared (NIR) imager.
The images produced by SNAP will have an unprecedented combination of depth,
solid-angle, angular resolution, and temporal sampling. For 16 months each, two
7.5 square-degree fields will be observed every four days to a magnitude depth
of AB=27.7 in each of the SNAP filters, spanning 3500-17000\AA. Co-adding
images over all epochs will give AB=30.3 per filter. In addition, a 300
square-degree field will be surveyed to AB=28 per filter, with no repeated
temporal sampling. Although the survey strategy is tailored for supernova and
weak gravitational lensing observations, the resulting data will support a
broad range of auxiliary science programs.
