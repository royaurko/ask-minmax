Location of formation of periodic solar wind number density structures is
discussed. Observation of proton and alpha anticorrelation in these structures
[Viall et al., 2009] indicates that taking into account that bulk velocity of
aplha-particles is higher than that of proton the place of formation for these
structures should be located at distance less 0.002 AU from place of
observation.
