The line profile asymmetry defining the Evershed effect in sunspot penumbrae,
disappears abruptly at the outer sunspot boundary over a horizontal distance of
less than 500 km immediately at the outermost ends of the dark penumbral
continuum structures ('filaments'). This is indicated from the non-magnetic
lines Ni I 5435.9 (g=0.5) and Fe I 5434.5 (g=0), which loose their profile
asymmetries at the same spatial location although formed at a vertical height
distance of 300 km. The widely accepted 'canopy' picture conflicts with this
finding which, in contrary, suggests that the gas motion associated with the
Evershed effect disappears together with the continuum intensity drop at the
outer sunspot (penumbral) border. Corresponding downflows must then be smaller
than the spatial resolution presently achieved (i.e., <0.5 arcsec) and located
at the immediate outer sunspot border. It is suggested that this location marks
the sharp threshold of the equipartition between kinetic and magnetic energy
density at the outer penumbral boundary.
