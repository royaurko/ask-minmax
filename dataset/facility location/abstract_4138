The outage probability performance of a dual-hop amplify-and-forward
selective relaying system with global relay selection is analyzed for
Nakagami-$m$ fading channels in the presence of multiple interferers at both
the relays and the destination. Two different cases are considered. In the
first case, the interferers are assumed to have random number and locations.
Outage probability using the generalized Gamma approximation (GGA) in the form
of one-dimensional integral is derived. In the second case, the interferers are
assumed to have fixed number and locations. Exact outage probability in the
form of one-dimensional integral is derived. For both cases, closed-form
expressions of lower bounds and asymptotic expressions for high
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio are also provided. Simplified
closed-form expressions of outage probability for special cases (e.g., dominant
interferences, i.i.d. interferers, Rayleigh distributed signals) are studied.
Numerical results are presented to show the accuracy of our analysis by
examining the effects of the number and locations of interferers on the outage
performances of both AF systems with random and fixed interferers.
