Proton scattering in some water and tissue equivalent phantom materials was
measured to evaluate their simulation accuracy of water and respective human
biological tissues. The measurements were performed on the medical facility of
the ITEP synchrotron, proton energy was 219 MeV, a narrow beam was formed by a
3 mm collimator. A stack of plastic slabs was set closely to the collimator
hole as a scatterer. Three types of Plastic Water (PW, PW LR and PW DT), lung,
cortical bone, adipose and muscle plastics (CIRS Inc., USA) were used in the
experiments as the substitutes under investigation and liquid water and PMMA
slabs as reference materials. Dose (intensity) profiles were measured for each
sample by two orthogonal strips of the Gafchromic EBT film. A total thickness
of the plastic slab was from 4 to 16 cm depending on the material. The
Gafchromic film response nonlinearity was taken into account by an additional
calibration vs. absorbed dose in a wide proton beam, the temporal
irradiation-to-scanning dependence was also accounted. The central part of each
angular distribution was fitted by the Gaussian function and compared with the
respective parameters calculated for the simulated medium by Monte Carlo
technique with the IThMC code.
