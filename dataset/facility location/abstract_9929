The microscopic origin of triplet superconductivity in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is
discussed, paying attention to the role of Coulomb interaction, $U_{pp}$, at
the O site. It is shown on the $d$-$p$ model that $U_{pp}$ induces a
ferromagnetic exchange interaction between "d-electrons" (molecular orbital
with $d_{xy}$-symmetry) at adjacent Ru sites, leading to short-range
ferromagnetic correlations and promoting Cooper pairing with ($\sin
p_x\pm\ii\sin p_y$)-symmetry on the $\gamma$-band. The reason why such
ferromagnetic correlations work effectively may be traced back to the fact that
the level of 4d-electrons at Ru sites is relatively low and located near that
of $2p$-electrons at O sites.
