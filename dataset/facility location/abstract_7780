In this paper we present simulated Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre
Array (ALMA) observations of self-gravitating circumstellar discs with
different properties in size, mass and inclination, located in four of the most
extensively studied and surveyed star-forming regions. Starting from a Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation and representative dust opacities, we
have initially constructed maps of the expected emission at sub-mm wavelengths
of a large sample of discs with different properties. We have then simulated
realistic observations of discs as they may appear with ALMA using the Common
Astronomy Software Application ALMA simulator. We find that, with a proper
combination of antenna configuration and integration time, the spiral structure
characteristic of self-gravitating discs is readily detectable by ALMA over a
wide range of wavelengths at distances comparable to TW Hydrae ($\sim 50
\,$pc), Taurus - Auriga and Ophiucus ($\sim 140 \,$pc) star-forming regions.
However, for discs located in Orion complex ($\sim 400 \,$pc) only the largest
discs in our sample (outer radius of 100 au) show a spatially resolved
structure while the smaller ones (outer radius of 25 au) are characterized by a
spiral structure that is not conclusively detectable with ALMA.
