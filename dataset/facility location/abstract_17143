We study an interacting random walk system on Z where at time 0 there is an
active particle at 0 and one inactive particle on each site $n \ge 1$.
Particles become active when hit by another active particle. Once activated,
the particle starting at n performs an asymmetric, translation invariant,
nearest neighbor random walk with left jump probability $l_n$. We give
conditions for global survival, local survival and infinite activation both in
the case where all particles are immortal and in the case where particles have
geometrically distributed lifespan (with parameter depending on the starting
location of the particle). More precisely, once activated, the particle at n
survives at each step with probability $p_n \in [0, 1]$. In particular, in the
immortal case, we prove a 0-1 law for the probability of local survival when
all particles drift to the right. Besides that, we give sufficient conditions
for local survival or local extinction when all particles drift to the left. In
the mortal case, we provide sufficient conditions for global survival, local
survival and local extinction (which apply to the immortal case with mixed
drifts as well). Analysis of explicit examples is provided: we describe
completely the phase diagram in the cases $1/2-l_n \sim \pm 1/n^\alpha$, $p_n =
1$ and $1_n-1/2 \sim \pm 1/n^\alpha$, $1-p_n \sim 1/n^\beta$ (where
$\alpha,\beta > 0$).
