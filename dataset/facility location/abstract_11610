Steganography is an emerging area which is used for secured data transmission
over any public media.Steganography is a process that involves hiding a message
in an appropriate carrier like image or audio. It is of Greek origin and means
"covered or hidden writing". The carrier can be sent to a receiver without any
one except the authenticated receiver knowing the existence of this
information. In this paper, a specific image based steganography technique for
communicating information more securely between two locations is proposed. The
contributor incorporated the idea of secret key and password security features for
authentication at both ends in order to achieve high level of security. As a
further improvement of security level, the information has been permuted,
encoded and then finally embedded on an image to form the stego image. In
addition segmented objects extraction and reassembly of the stego image through
normalized cut method has been carried out at the sender side and receiver side
respectively in order to prevent distortion of the Stego image during
transmission.
