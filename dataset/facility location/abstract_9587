We study the survival of gas planets around stars with masses in the range
1-5 Msun, as these stars evolve off the Main Sequence. We show that planets
with masses smaller than one Jupiter mass do not survive the Planetary Nebula
phase if located initially at orbital distances smaller than (3-5) AU. Planets
more massive than two Jupiter masses around low mass (1 Msun on the Main
Sequence) stars survive the Planetary Nebula stage down to orbital distances of
3 AU. As the star evolves through the Planetary Nebula phase, an evaporation
outflow will be established at the planet's surface. Evaporating planets may be
detected using spectroscopic observations. Planets around white dwarfs with
masses M_WD > 0.7 Msun are generally expected to be found at orbital radii r >
15 AU. If planets are found at smaller orbital radii around massive white
dwarfs, they had to form as the result of the merger of two white dwarfs.
