In this letter we present the study of the eightfold degeneracy in the
$(\theta_{13},\delta)$ measurement including both appearance and disappearance
channels. We analyse, for definiteness, the case of a standard low-$\gamma$
$\beta$-Beam and a 4 MWatt SPL Super-Beam facility, both aiming at a UNO-like
Mton water Cerenkov detector located at the Frejus laboratory, $L = 130$ km. In
the $\beta$-Beam case, the \nue disappearance channel does not improve the
$(\theta_{13},\delta)$ measurement when a realistic (i.e. $\ge$ 2%) systematic
error is included. In the Super-Beam case, the \numu disappearance channel
could, instead, be quite useful in reducing the impact of the eightfold
degeneracy in the $(\theta_{13},\delta)$ measurement, especially once the error
on the atmospheric mass difference is fully taken into account in the fit.
