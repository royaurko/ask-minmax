We analyze a lattice model closely related to the one-dimensional inelastic
gas with periodic boundary condition. The one-dimensional inelastic gas tends
to form high density clusters of particles with almost the same velocity,
separated by regions of low density; plotted as a function of particle indices,
the velocities of the gas particles exhibit sharp gradients, which we call
shocks. Shocks and clusters are seen to form in the lattice model too, although
no true positions of the particles are taken into account. The locations of the
shocks in terms of the particle index show remarkable independence on the
coefficient of restitution and the sequence of collisions used to update the
system, but they do depend on the initial configuration of the particle
velocities. We explain the microscopic origin of the shocks. We show that
dynamics of the velocity profile inside a cluster satisfies a simple continuum
equation, thereby allowing us to study cluster-cluster interactions at late
times.
