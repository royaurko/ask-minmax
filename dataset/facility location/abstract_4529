We have studied the differences between the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) and the
HII regions along a slit position in the local dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 6822.
The slit position passes through the two most prominent HII regions: Hubble V
and Hubble X. Important differences have been found in the excitation,
ionization, and [NII]6584/Ha and [SII]6717/Ha line ratios between the DIG and
the HII locations. Moreover, the values of all the line ratios are not similar
to those in the DIG locations of spiral galaxies but are very similar to the
values in other irregular galaxies, such as IC 10. We also determined the rate
of recombination using the HeI5875 line. Finally, we obtained a picture of the
ionization sources of the DIG. We consider that the leakage of photons from the
HII regions might explain most of the line ratios, except [NII]/Ha, which might
be explained by turbulence.
