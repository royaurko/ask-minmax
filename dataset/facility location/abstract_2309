The Human Space Technology Initiative (HSTI) has been launched under the
framework of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications with its aims
of promoting international cooperation in human spaceflight and space
exploration-related activities; creating awareness among United Nations Member
States on the benefits of utilizing human space technology and its
applications; and building capacity in microgravity education and research. The
International Space Station (ISS), being operational with a permanent crew of
six (6), is an unprecedented facility for research on science and technology
and can be regarded as one of the greatest resources for humankind to explore
space. The HSTI seeks to promote human space technology and to expand ISS
utilization. This report describes the background, objectives, and current
three-year work plan of HSTI which is composed of organizing expert meetings,
seminars, and workshops as well as building capacity by distributing
educational materials and zero-gravity experiment instruments.
