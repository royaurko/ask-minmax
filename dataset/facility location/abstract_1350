In this article, we reconsider the problem of estimating the unknown
symmetric density in a two-component location mixture model under the
assumption that the symmetric density is log-concave. When consistent
estimators for the shift locations and mixing probability are used, we show
that the nonparametric log-concave Maximum Likelihood estimator (MLE) of both
the mixed density and that of the unknown symmetric component are consistent in
the Hellinger distance. In case the estimators for the shift locations and
mixing probability are $\sqrt n$-consistent, we establish that these MLE's
converge to the truth at the rate $n^{-2/5}$ in the $L_1$ distance. To estimate
the shift locations and mixing probability, we use the estimators proposed by
Hunter et al. (2007). The unknown symmetric density is efficiently computed
using the R package logcondens.mode.
