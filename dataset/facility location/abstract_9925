We present an experimental system suitable for producing spherical crystals
and for observing the distribution of lattice defects (disclinations and
dislocations) on a significant fraction (50%) of the sphere. The introduction
of fluorescently labeled particles enables us to determine the location and
orientation of grain boundary scars. We find that the total number of scars and
the number of excess dislocations per scar agree with theoretical predictions
and that the geometrical centers of the scars are roughly positioned at the
vertices of an icosahedron.
