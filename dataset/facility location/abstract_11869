We use elementary methods to derive a sharp local central limit theorem for
simple random walk on the square lattice in dimensions one and two that is an
improvement of existing results for points that are particularly distant from
the starting point. More specifically, we give explicit asymptotic expressions
in terms of $n$ and $x$ in dimensions one and two for $P(S(n)=x)$, the
probability that simple random walk $S$ is at some point $x$ at time $n$, that
are valid for all $|x|\leq n/\log^2(n)$. We also show that the behavior of
planar simple random walk differs radically from that of planar standard
Brownian motion outside of the disk of radius $n^{3/4}$, where simple random
walk ceases to be approximately rotationally symmetric. Indeed, if
$n^{3/4}=o(|S(n)|)$, S(n) is more likely to be found along the coordinate axes.
This loss of rotational symmetry is not surprising, since if $|S(n)|=n$, there
are only four possible locations for S(n). In this paper, we show how the
transition from approximate rotational symmetry to complete concentration of
$S$ along the coordinate axes occurs.
