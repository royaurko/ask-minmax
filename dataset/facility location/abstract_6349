We examine the entanglement between two qubits, supposed to be remotely
located and driven by independent quantized optical fields. No interaction is
allowed between the qubits, but their degree of entanglement changes as a
function of time. We report a collapse and revival of entanglement that is
similar to the collapse and revival of single-atom properties in cavity QED.
