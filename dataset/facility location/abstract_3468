The study of exotic nuclei around 132Sn is a subject of current experimental
and theoretical interest. Experimental information for nuclei in the vicinity
of 132Sn, which have been long inaccessible to spectroscopic studies, is now
available thanks to new advanced facilities and techniques. The experimental
data which have been now become available for these neutron-rich nuclei may
suggest a modification in the shell structure. They are, in fact, somewhat
different from what one might expect by extrapolating the existing results for
N<82, and as a possible explanation a change in the single-proton level scheme
has been suggested. The latter would be caused by a more diffuse nuclear
surface, and could be seen as a precursor of major effects which should show up
at larger neutron excess. New data offer therefore the opportunity to test the
shell model and look for a possible evolution of shell structure when going
toward neutron drip line. This is stimulating shell-model studies in this
region. Here, we present an overview of recent shell-model studies of 132Sn
neighbors, focusing attention on those calculations employing realistic
effective interactions.
