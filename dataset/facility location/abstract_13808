Profiting from the emergence of web-scale social data sets, numerous recent
studies have systematically explored human mobility patterns over large
populations and large time scales. Relatively little attention, however, has
been paid to mobility and activity over smaller time-scales, such as a day.
Here, we use Twitter to identify people's frequently visited locations along
with their likely activities as a function of time of day and day of week,
capitalizing on both the content and geolocation of messages. We subsequently
characterize people's transition pattern motifs and demonstrate that spatial
information is encoded in word choice.
