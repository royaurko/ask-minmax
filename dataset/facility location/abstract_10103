Apparent horizons are structures of spacelike hypersurfaces that can be
determined locally in time. Closed surfaces of constant expansion (CE surfaces)
are a generalisation of apparent horizons. I present an efficient method for
locating CE surfaces. This method uses an explicit representation of the
surface, allowing for arbitrary resolutions and, in principle, shapes. The CE
surface equation is then solved as a nonlinear elliptic equation.
  It is reasonable to assume that CE surfaces foliate a spacelike hypersurface
outside of some interior region, thus defining an invariant (but still
slicing-dependent) radial coordinate. This can be used to determine gauge modes
and to compare time evolutions with different gauge conditions. CE surfaces
also provide an efficient way to find new apparent horizons as they appear e.g.
in binary black hole simulations.
