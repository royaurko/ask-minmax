We demonstrate position and energy-resolved phonon-mediated detection of
particle interactions in a silicon substrate instrumented with an array of
microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs). The relative magnitude and
delay of the signal received in each sensor allows the location of the
interaction to be determined with < 1 mm precision at 30 keV. Using this
position information, variations in the detector response with position can be
removed, and an energy resolution of \sigma_E = 0.55 keV at 30 keV was
measured. Since MKIDs can be fabricated from a single deposited film and are
naturally multiplexed in the frequency domain, this technology can be extended
to provide highly-pixelized athermal phonon sensors for ~1 kg scale detector
elements. Such high-resolution, massive particle detectors would be applicable
to next-generation rare-event searches such as the direct detection of dark
matter, neutrinoless double-beta decay, or coherent neutrino-nucleus
scattering.
