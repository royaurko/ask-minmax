The Chandra Carina Complex Project (CCCP) provides a sensitive X-ray survey
of a nearby starburst region over >1 square degree in extent. Thousands of
faint X-ray sources are found, many concentrated into rich young stellar
clusters. However, significant contamination from unrelated Galactic and
extragalactic sources is present in the X-ray catalog. We describe the use of a
naive Bayes classifier to assign membership probabilities to individual
sources, based on source location, X-ray properties, and visual/infrared
properties. For the particular membership decision rule adopted, 75% of CCCP
sources are classified as members, 11% are classified as contaminants, and 14%
remain unclassified. The resulting sample of stars likely to be Carina members
is used in several other studies, which appear in a Special Issue of the ApJS
devoted to the CCCP.
