In the coming years a new insight into galaxy formation and the thermal
history of the Universe is expected to come from the detection of the highly
redshifted cosmological 21 cm line. The cosmological 21 cm line signal is
buried under Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds which are likely to be a
few orders of magnitude brighter. Strategies and techniques for effective
subtraction of these foreground sources require a detailed knowledge of their
structure in both intensity and polarization on the relevant angular scales of
1-30 arcmin. We present results from observations conducted with the Westerbork
telescope in the 140-160 MHz range with 2 arcmin resolution in two fields
located at intermediate Galactic latitude, centred around the bright quasar
3C196 and the North Celestial Pole. They were observed with the purpose of
characterizing the foreground properties in sky areas where actual observations
of the cosmological 21 cm line could be carried out. The polarization data were
analysed through the rotation measure synthesis technique. We have computed
total intensity and polarization angular power spectra. Total intensity maps
were carefully calibrated, reaching a high dynamic range, 150000:1 in the case
of the 3C196 field. [abridged]
