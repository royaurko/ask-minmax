We report the discovery with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) of an
outflow of molecular gas in the radio-loud Seyfert galaxy IC5063 (z = 0.0110).
In addition to the emission of the large-scale CO disk, a prominent blueshifted
wing is observed in the CO(2-1) spectrum. IC5063 represents one of the best
cases of a fast jet-driven HI (and ionized gas) outflow, which is located at
the site of a radio-bright feature about 0.5 kpc from the nucleus. It is
possible that the blueshifted part of the molecular gas is associated with this
outflow and is accelerated by the interaction with the radio jet. The outflow
of molecular gas is characterized by an H$_2$ mass of the outflowing component
of between 2.25 +/- 0.70 x 10^7 M_sun and 1.29 +/- 0.40 x 10^8 M_sun and a mass
outflow rate between 22 and 129 M_sun/yr depending on the assumption for
alpha_X and assuming a luminosity ratio L'_CO(2-1)/L'_CO(1-0) = 1. This
confirms that this may indeed be the dominant component in outflows driven by
the nuclear activity that are also found in other objects. However, this high
mass outflow rate cannot easily be supported for a long time, suggesting that
the gas outflow in IC5063 happens in bursts and is in a particularly strong
phase at present. Owing to its proximity, IC5063 serves as an excellent
laboratory for understanding the impact of radio jets on the gas-rich
inter-stellar medium.
