When a beneficial mutation occurs in a population, the new, favored allele
may spread to the entire population. This process is known as a selective
sweep. Suppose we sample $n$ individuals at the end of a selective sweep. If we
focus on a site on the chromosome that is close to the location of the
beneficial mutation, then many of the lineages will likely be descended from
the individual that had the beneficial mutation, while others will be descended
from a different individual because of recombination between the two sites. We
introduce two approximations for the effect of a selective sweep. The first one
is simple but not very accurate: flip $n$ independent coins with probability
$p$ of heads and say that the lineages whose coins come up heads are those that
are descended from the individual with the beneficial mutation. A second
approximation, which is related to Kingman's paintbox construction, replaces
the coin flips by integer-valued random variables and leads to very accurate
results.
