Basing on the previously performed K-matrix analysis of experimental data,
we investigate, in the framework of the propagator matrix (D-matrix)
technique, the 1100-1900 MeV mass region, where overlapping resonances
$f_0(1300)$, $f_0(1500)$, $f_0(1530^{+90}_{-250})$, and $f_0(1780)$ are
located. Necessary elements of the D-matrix technique are developed. The
D-matrix analysis confirms previous K-matrix results: in the region 900-1900
MeV five scalar/isoscalar states are located. Four of them are members of the
two $q\bar q$-nonets, while one state is an extra for the $q\bar q$
systematics, being a good candidate for the lightest scalar glueball. The
D-matrix analysis shows that this extra state, a candidate for the lightest
scalar glueball, is dispersed, due to a mixing with $q\bar q$- states, over
three resonances: $f_0(1300)$, $f_0(1500)$, and $f_0(1530^{+90}_{-250})$. The
broad resonance $f_0(1530^+{90}_{-250})$ is a descendant of the lightest
glueball carrying about 50% of the gluonium component, the rest of the
gluonium is shared between $f_0(1300)$ and $f_0(1500)$.
