We argue that the fermionic zero mode in non-trivial gauge field backgrounds
must have a zero. We demonstrate this explicitly for calorons where its
location is related to a constituent monopole. Furthermore a topological
reasoning for the existence of the zero is given which therefore will be
present for any non-trivial configuration. We propose the use of this property
in particular for lattice simulations in order to uncover the topological
content of a configuration.
