We report the discovery of a new non-thermal filament, G358.85+0.47, the
``Pelican'', located ~225 pc in projection from SgrA, and oriented parallel to
the Galactic plane. VLA continuum observations at 20 cm reveal that this 7'
(17.5 pc) structure bends at its northern extension and is comprised of
parallel strands, most apparent at its ends. Observations at 6 and 3.6 cm
reveal that the Pelican is a synchrotron-emitting source and is strongly
linearly polarized over much of its extent. The spectral index of the filament
changes from alpha(20/6)=-0.8 to alpha(6/3.6)=-1.5. The rotation measures
exhibit a smooth gradient, with values ranging from -1000 rad/m2 to +500
rad/m2. The intrinsic magnetic field is well-aligned along the length of the
filament. Based on these properties, we classify the Pelican as one of the
non-thermal filaments unique to the Galactic center. Since these filaments
(most of which are oriented perpendicular to the Galactic plane) are believed
to trace the overall magnetic field in the inner Galaxy, the Pelican is the
first detection of a component of this field parallel to the plane. The Pelican
may thus mark a transition region of the magnetic field orientation in the
inner kiloparsec of the Galaxy.
