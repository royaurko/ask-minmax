We present a new algorithm for behavioural annotation. The EMbC algorithm
(Expectation-Maximization binary Clustering) is a variant of the Gaussian
Mixture Model maximum likelihood estimation algorithm, also known as
Expectation-Maximization Clustering. We focus on the analysis of two movement
variables (velocity and turn) obtained from the successive locations of a
trajectory. We show and discuss the EMbC behavioural annotation outputs in both
simulated and empirical trajectories. We also explore its robustness to data
loss and data inaccuracies, and compare EMbC with expert labelling. Finally, we
suggest a smoothing procedure that better accounts for the temporal
associations among behaviours/labels, and an algorithm to properly visualize
behavioural annotation in movement trajectories.
  The EMbC algorithm fills a gap in movement trajectory segmentation procedures
by reaching a good compromise between meaningful and easily interpretable
behavioural segmentation and sound (and robust) statistical performance. As an
unsupervised and non-intensive computing method, the EMbC algorithm is
particularly suited for big data and large scale analyses where comparisons
across species, sampling schemes, tracking technologies, and ecological
contexts are looked for.
  Our algorithm is available within the EMbC R-package. The package is linked
to the Move R-package developed by the Movebank team and forwardly deals with
Move objects.
