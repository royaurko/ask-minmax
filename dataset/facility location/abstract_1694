These comments were prepared during the ICFA Seminar on "Future Persrectives
in High Energy Physics" held at CERN (8-11 October 2002) and partially
presented at the Panel and General Discussion on Interregional Collaboration
for Future Facilities (10 October). Comments include arguments favoring the
existence of the fourth SM family and new level of compositness. Then, the
possible role of the linac-ring type colliders for future HEP research is
discussed emphasizing TeV scale lepton-hadron and photon-hadron colliders. This
preprint presents prepared transparencies and some illuminating remarks with
corresponding references.
