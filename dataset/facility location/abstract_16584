A new method of root finding is formulated that uses a numerical iterative
process involving three points. A given function y = f(x) whose roots are
desired is fitted and approximated by a polynomial function of the form P(x)=
a(x-b)^N that passes between three equi-spaced points using the method of least
squares. Successive iterations using the same procedure of curve fitting is
used to locate the root within a given level of tolerance. The power N of the
curve suitable for a given function form can be appropriately varied at each
step of the iteration to give a faster rate of convergence and avoid cases
where oscillation, divergence or off shooting to an invalid domain may be
encountered. An estimate of the rate of convergence is provided. It is shown
that the method has a quadratic convergence similar to that of Newton's method.
Examples are provided showing the procedure as well as comparison of the rate
of convergence with the secant and Newton methods. The method does not require
evaluation of function derivatives.
