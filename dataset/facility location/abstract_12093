We introduce a multiscale test statistic based on local order statistics and
spacings that provides simultaneous confidence statements for the existence and
location of local increases and decreases of a density or a failure rate. The
procedure provides guaranteed finite-sample significance levels, is easy to
implement and possesses certain asymptotic optimality and adaptivity
properties.
