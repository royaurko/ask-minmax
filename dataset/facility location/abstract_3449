We survey 129 lepton number violating effective operators, consistent with
the minimal Standard Model gauge group and particle content, of mass dimension
up to and including eleven. Upon requiring that each one radiatively generates
the observed neutrino masses, we extract an associated characteristic cutoff
energy scale which we use to calculate other observable manifestations of these
operators for a number of current and future experimental probes, concentrating
on lepton number violating phenomena. These include searches for neutrinoless
double-beta decay and rare meson, lepton, and gauge boson decays. We also
consider searches at hadron/lepton collider facilities in anticipation of the
LHC and the future ILC. We find that some operators are already disfavored by
current data, while more are ripe to be probed by next-generation experiments.
We also find that our current understanding of lepton mixing disfavors a subset
of higher dimensional operators. While neutrinoless double-beta decay is the
most promising signature of lepton number violation for the majority of
operators, a handful is best probed by other means. We argue that a combination
of constraints from various independent experimental sources will help to
pinpoint the ``correct'' model of neutrino mass, or at least aid in narrowing
down the set of possibilities.
