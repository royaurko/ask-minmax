The simplest purely imaginary and piecewise constant $\cal PT$-symmetric
potential located inside a larger box is studied. Unless its strength exceeds a
certain critical value, all the spectrum of its bound states remains real and
discrete. We interpret such a model as an initial element of the generalized
non-Hermitian Witten's hierarchy of solvable Hamiltonians and construct its
first supersymmetric (SUSY) partner in closed form.
