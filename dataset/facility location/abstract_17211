We present a detailed analysis of a highly ionized, multiphased and
collimated outflowing gas detected through O V, O VI, Ne VIII and Mg X
absorption associated with the QSO HE 0238 - 1904 (z_em ~ 0.629). Based on the
similarities in the absorption line profiles and estimated covering fractions,
we find that the O VI and Ne VIII absorption trace the same phase of the
absorbing gas. Simple photoionization models can reproduce the observed N(Ne
VIII), N(O VI) and N(Mg X) from a single phase whereas the low ionization
species (e.g. N III, N IV, O IV) originate from a different phase. The measured
N(Ne VIII)/N(O VI) ratio is found to be remarkably similar (within a factor of
~ 2) in several individual absorption components kinematically spread over ~
1800 km/s. Under photoionization this requires a fine tuning between hydrogen
density (nH) and the distance of the absorbing gas from the QSO. Alternatively
this can also be explained by collisional ionization in hot gas with T >
10^{5.7} K. Long-term stability favors the absorbing gas being located outside
the broad line region (BLR). We speculate that the collimated flow of such a
hot gas could possibly be triggered by the radio jet interaction.
