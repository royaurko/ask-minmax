We apply a new method of eclipse mapping to the light curves of eclipsing
polars. The technique aims to locate the bright emission associated with the
accretion stream, using a technique that makes the fewest prior assumptions
about the location of the accretion stream material. We have obtained data of
EP Dra and HU Aqr with the S-Cam 2 superconducting tunnel junction camera using
the William Herschel Telescope. The location of emission regions in both
systems show that previously assumed trajectories are consistent with those
found using our technique. Most of the emission is located in a region where we
expect material to be confined to magnetic field lines, particularly for HU
Aqr, while there appears to be less emission from where we conventionally
expect material to follow a ballistic trajectory from the L1-point.
