Thermal X-ray emission from young supernova remnants (SNRs) is usually
dominated by the emission lines of the supernova (SN) ejecta, which are widely
believed being crossed and thus heated by the inwards propagating reverse shock
(RS). Previous works using imaging X-ray data have shown that the ejecta are
heated by the RS by locating the peak emission region of the most recently
ionized matter, which is found well separated towards the inside from the
outermost boundary. Here we report the discovery of a systematic increase of
the Sulfur (S) to Silicon (Si) K$\alpha$ line flux ratio with radius in Tycho's
SNR. This allows us, for the first time, to present continuous radial profiles
of the ionization age and, furthermore, the elapsed ionization time since the
onset of the ionization, which tells the propagation history of the ionization
front into the SNR ejecta.
