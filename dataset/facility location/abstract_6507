This volume contains the proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on
Expressiveness in Concurrency (EXPRESS'09), which took place on 5th September
2009 in Bologna, co-located with CONCUR'09. The EXPRESS workshop series aim at
bringing together researchers who are interested in the expressiveness and
comparison of formal models that broadly relate to concurrency. In particular,
this also includes emergent fields such as logic and interaction,
game-theoretic models, and service-oriented computing.
