The fourth unambiguously identified Soft Gamma Repeater (SGR), SGR1627-41,
was discovered with the BATSE instrument on 1998 June 15 (Kouveliotou et al.
1998). Interplanetary Network (IPN) measurements and BATSE data constrained the
location of this new SGR to a 6 deg segment of a narrow (19") annulus (Hurley
et al. 1999; Woods et al. 1998). We present two bursts from this source
observed by the All-Sky Monitor (ASM) on RXTE. We use the ASM data to further
constrain the source location to a 5' long segment of the BATSE/IPN error box.
The ASM/IPN error box lies within 0.3' of the supernova remnant (SNR)
G337.0-0.1. The probability that a SNR would fall so close to the error box
purely by chance is ~5%.
