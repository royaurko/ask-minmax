We examine the possibility that ram pressure exerted by the galactic wind
from the Galaxy could have stripped gas from the Local Group dwarf galaxies,
thereby affecting their star formation histories. Whether gas stripping occurs
or not depends on the relative magnitudes of two counteracting forces acting on
gas in a dwarf galaxy: ram pressure force by the wind and the gravitational
binding force by the dwarf galaxy itself. We suggest that the galactic wind
could have stripped gas in a dwarf galaxy located within the distance of
$R_{c}\simeq 120(r_{s}/1 {kpc})^{3/2} ({\cal E}_{b}/10^{50} {erg})^{-1/2}$ kpc
(where $r_{s}$ is the surface radius and ${\cal E}_{b}$ is the total binding
energy of the dwarf galaxy, respectively) from the Galaxy within a timescale of
Gyr, thereby preventing star formation there. Our result based on this Galactic
wind model explains the recent observation that dwarfs located close to the
Galaxy experienced star formation only in the early phase of their lifetimes,
whereas distant dwarfs are still undergoing star formation. The present star
formation in the Large Magellanic Cloud can also be explained through our
Galactic wind model.
