Extra dimensions have interesting consequences for flavor physics. We
consider a setup where the standard model fermions and gauge fields reside in
the bulk of a warped extra dimension. Fermion masses and mixings are explained
by flavor dependent fermion locations, without relying on hierarchical Yukawa
couplings. We discuss various flavor violating processes induced by
(Kaluza-Klein) gauge boson exchange and non-renormalizable operators.
Experimental constraints are satisfied with a Kaluza-Klein scale of about 10
TeV. Some processes, such as muon-electron conversion, are within reach of next
generation experiments.
