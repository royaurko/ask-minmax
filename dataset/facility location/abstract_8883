We present the combined Infrared Space Observatory Short-Wavelength
Spectrometer and Long-Wavelength Spectrometer 2.4--197 micron spectrum of the
Planetary Nebula NGC 6302 which contains in addition to strong atomic lines, a
series of emission features due to solid state components. The broad wavelength
coverage enables us to more accurately identify and determine the properties of
both oxygen- and carbon-rich circumstellar dust. A simple model fit was made to
determine the abundance and typical temperature of the amorphous silicates,
enstatite and forsterite. Forsterite and enstatite do have roughly the same
abundance and temperature. The origin and location of the dust in a toroidal
disk around the central star are discussed.
