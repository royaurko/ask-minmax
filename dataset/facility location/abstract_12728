For axially symmetric flow of dissipationless inhomogeneous fluid onto a non
rotating astrophysical black hole under the influence of a generalized
pseudo-Schwarzschild gravitational potential, we investigate the influence of
the background flow configuration on determining the salient features of the
corresponding acoustic geometry. The acoustic horizon for the aforementioned
flow structure has been located and the corresponding acoustic surface gravity
$\kappa$ as well as the associated analogue Hawking temperature $T_{\rm AH}$
has been calculated {\it analytically}. The dependence of $\kappa$ on the flow
geometry as well as on the nature of the back ground black hole space time
(manifested through the nature of the pseudo-Schwarzschild potential used) has
been discussed. Dependence of the value of $\kappa$ on various initial boundary
conditions governing the dynamic and the thermodynamic properties of the
background fluid flow has also been studied.
