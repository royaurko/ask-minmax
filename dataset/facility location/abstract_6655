Radio-frequency reflectometry in silicon single-electron transistors (SETs)
is presented. At low temperatures (<4 K), in addition to the expected Coulomb
blockade features associated with charging of the SET dot, quasi-periodic
oscillations are observed that persist in the fully depleted regime where the
SET dot is completely empty. A model, confirmed by simulations, indicates that
these oscillations originate from charging of an unintended floating gate
located in the heavily doped polycrystalline silicon gate stack. The technique
used in this experiment can be applied for detailed spectroscopy of various
charge defects in nanoscale SETs and field effect transistors
