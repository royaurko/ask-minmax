The pulsed radio emission from the Galactic Center (GC) magnetar SGR J1745-29
probes the turbulent, magnetized plasma of the GC hyperstrong scattering screen
through both angular and temporal broadening. We present the first measurements
of the angular size of SGR J1745-29, obtained with the Very Long Baseline Array
and the phased Very Large Array at 8.7 and 15.4 GHz. The source sizes are
consistent with the scatter--broadened size of Sagittarius A* at each
frequency, demonstrating that SGR J1745-29 is also located behind the same
hyperstrong scattering medium. Combining the angular broadening with temporal
scattering obtained from pulsar observations provides a complete picture of the
scattering properties. If the scattering occurs in a thin screen, then it must
be at a distance \Delta >~ 5 kpc. A best-fit solution for the distance of a
thin screen is \Delta=5.9 +/-0.3 kpc, consistent with being located in the
Scutum spiral arm. This is a substantial revision of the previously held model
in which the scattering screen is located very close to the GC. As also
discussed in Spitler et al., these results suggest that GC searches can detect
millisecond pulsars gravitationally bound to Sgr A* with observations at >~ 10
GHz and ordinary pulsars at even lower frequencies.
