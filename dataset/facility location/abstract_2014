The recently proposed Super Marx generator pure deuterium micro-detonation
ignition concept is compared to the Lawrence Livermore National Ignition
Facility (NIF) Laser DT fusion-fission hybrid concept (LiFE) [1]. In a Super
Marx generator a large number of ordinary Marx generators charge up a much
larger second stage ultra-high voltage Marx generator, from which for the
ignition of a pure deuterium micro-explosion an intense GeV ion beam can be
extracted. A typical example of the LiFE concept is a fusion gain of 30, and a
fission gain of 10, making up for a total gain of 300, with about 10 times more
energy released into fission as compared to fusion. This means a substantial
release of fission products, as in fusion-less pure fission reactors. In the
Super Marx approach for the ignition of a pure deuterium micro-detonation a
gain of the same magnitude can in theory be reached [2]. If feasible, the Super
Marx generator deuterium ignition approach would make lasers obsolete as a
means for the ignition of thermonuclear micro-explosions.
