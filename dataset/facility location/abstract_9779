We study the emergency of mutual cooperation in evolutionary prisoner's
dilemma games when the players are located on a square lattice. The players can
choose one of the three strategies: cooperation (C), defection (D) or "tit for
tat" (T), and their total payoffs come from games with the nearest neighbors.
During the random sequential updates the players adopt one of their neighboring
strategies if the chosen neighbor has higher payoff. We compare the effect of
two types of external constraints added to the Darwinian evolutionary
processes. In both cases the strategy of a randomly chosen player is replaced
with probability P by another strategy. In the first case, the strategy is
replaced by a randomly chosen one among the two others, while in the second
case the new strategy is always C. Using generalized mean-field approximations
and Monte Carlo simulations the strategy concentrations are evaluated in the
stationary state for different strength of external constraints characterized
by the probability P.
