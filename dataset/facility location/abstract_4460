The Sun is located in a low-density region of the interstellar medium
partially filled with hot gas that is the likely result of several nearby
supernova explosions within the last 10 Myr. Here we use astrometric data to
show that part of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association was located closer to
the present position of the Sun 5-7 Myr ago than today. Evolutionary synthesis
models indicate that the association must have experienced ~20 supernova
explosions in the last 10-12 Myr, a prediction that is supported by the
detection of four or five runaway stars escaping from it. The ~6 SNe produced
by the Lower Centaurus Crux subgroup are likely responsible for the creation of
the Local Bubble.
