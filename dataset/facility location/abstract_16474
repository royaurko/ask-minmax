The majority of atomic hydrogen Br{\gamma} emission detected in the spectra
of young stellar objects (YSOs) is believed to arise from the recombination
regions associated with the magnetospheric accretion of circumstellar disk
material onto the forming star. In this paper, we present the results of a
K-band IFU spectroscopic study of Br{\gamma} emission in eight young
protostars: CW Tau, DG Tau, Haro 6-10, HL Tau, HV Tau C, RW Aur, T Tau and XZ
Tau. We spatially resolve Br{\gamma} emission structures in half of these young
stars and find that most of the extended emission is consistent with the
location and velocities of the known Herbig-Haro flows associated with these
systems. At some velocities through the Br{\gamma} line profile, the spatially
extended emission comprises 20% or more of the integrated flux in that spectral
channel. However, the total spatially extended Br{\gamma} is typically less
than ~10% of the flux integrated over the full emission profile. For DG Tau and
Haro 6-10 S, we estimate the mass outflow rate using simple assumptions about
the hydrogen emission region, and compare this to the derived mass accretion
rate. We detect extended Br{\gamma} in the vicinity of the more obscured
targets in our sample and conclude that spatially extended Br{\gamma} emission
may exist toward other stars, but unattenuated photospheric flux probably
limits its detectability.
