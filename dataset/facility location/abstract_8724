We carry out a two-dimensional, compressible, simulation of a disk, including
dust particles, to study the formation and role of vortices in protoplanetary
disks. We find that anticyclonic vortices can form out of an initial random
perturbation of the vorticity field. Vortices have a typical decay time of the
order of 50 orbital periods (for a viscosity parameter alpha=0.0001 and a disk
aspect ratio of H/r = 0.15). If vorticity is continuously generated at a
constant rate in the flow (e.g. by convection), then a large vortex can form
and be sustained (due to the merger of vortices).
  We find that dust concentrates in the cores of vortices within a few orbital
periods, when the drag parameter is of the order of the orbital frequency.
Also, the radial drift of the dust induces a significant increase in the
surface density of dust particles in the inner region of the disk. Thus,
vortices may represent the preferred location for planetesimal formation in
protoplanetary disks.
  We show that it is very difficult for vortex mergers to sustain a relatively
coherent outward flux of angular momentum.
