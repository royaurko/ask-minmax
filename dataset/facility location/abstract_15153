As part of a large Spitzer/MIPS GTO program, we have searched for infrared
excesses due to debris disks toward 26 FGK field stars known from radial
velocity (RV) studies to have one or more planets. While none of these stars
show excesses at 24um, we have detected 70um excesses around 6 stars at the
3-sigma confidence level. The excesses are produced by cool material (< 100 K)
located beyond 10 AU, well outside the "habitable zones" of these systems and
consistent with the presence of Kuiper Belt analogues with ~100 times more
emitting surface area than in our own planetary system.
  These planet-bearing stars are, by selection for RV studies, typically older
than 1 Gyr, and the stars identified here with excesses have a median age of 4
Gyr. We find a preliminary correlation of both the frequency and the magnitude
of dust emission with the presence of known planets. These are the first stars
outside the solar system identified as having both well-confirmed planetary
systems and well-confirmed IR excesses.
