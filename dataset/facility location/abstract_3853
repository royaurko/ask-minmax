This paper reports the results of the first experiment to directly measure
the properties of the scintillation light generated by minimum ionizing
cosmic-ray muons in liquid argon. Scintillation light from these muons is of
value to studies of weakly-interacting particles in neutrino experiments and
dark matter searches, as well as for particle identification. The experiment
was carried out at the TallBo facility at Fermilab using prototype light guides
and electronics developed for the Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment. Analysis
of the time-resolved structure of the scintillation light from cosmic-ray muons
gives $\langle \tau_{\text{T}}\rangle = 1.43 \pm 0.04~\text{(stat.)} \pm
0.007~\text{(sys.)}~\mu$s for the triplet light decay time constant. The ratio
of singlet to triplet light measured using surface-coated light guides is $R =
0.39 \pm 0.01~\text{(stat.)} \pm 0.008~\text{(sys.)}$. There is some evidence
that this value is not consistent with $R$ for minimum ionizing electrons.
However, the value for $R$ measured here clearly differs significantly from $R$
found for heavily ionizing particles like alphas. Furthermore, there is no
apparent difference in $R$ measured using light guides coated with TPB versus
bis-MSB, adding additional evidence that bis-MSB is a promising alternative to
TPB for detecting scintillation light in liquid argon.
