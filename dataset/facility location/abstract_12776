We take the viewpoint that the physically acceptable solutions of the
Lorentz-Dirac equation for radiation back-reaction are actually determined by a
second order equation of motion in such a way that the self-force can be given
as a function of spacetime location and velocity. This self-force function
turns out to be determined by a first order partial differential equation. In
view of possible practical difficulty in solving that partial differential
equation, we propose two iteration methods, too, for obtaining the self-force
function. For two example systems, the second order equation of motion is
obtained exactly in the nonrelativistic regime via each of the three methods,
and the three results are found to coincide. We reveal that, for both systems,
back-reaction induces a damping proportional to velocity and, in addition, it
decreases the effect of the external force.
