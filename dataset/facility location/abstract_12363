The statefinder indices are employed to test the superfluid Chaplygin gas
(SCG) model describing the dark sector of the universe. The model involves
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) as dark energy (DE) and an excited state above
it as dark matter (DM). The condensate is assumed to have a negative pressure
and is embodied as an exotic fluid with the Chaplygin equation of state.
Excitations forms the normal component of superfluid. The statefinder diagrams
show the discrimination between the SCG scenario and other models with the
Chaplygin gas and indicates a pronounced effect of the DM equation of state and
an indirect interaction between their two components on statefinder
trajectories and a current statefinder location.
