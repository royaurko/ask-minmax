NGC 6764 is a composite galaxy exhibiting central activity (LINER) and recent
massive star formation (Wolf-Rayet galaxy). We report new high-resolution
interferometric data of the CO(1--0) and CO(2--1) emission in the central part
of the galaxy together with high resolution VLA data of the radio continuum
emission. The bulk of molecular gas (few times 10^8 Msun) is located in the
central part. A molecular outflow (~1.7 x 10^7 Msun) out-of the plane is
associated with the starburst-driven outflow radiocontinuum emission.
