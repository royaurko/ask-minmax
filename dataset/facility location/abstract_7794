We present a survey for RR Lyrae stars in an area of 50 deg$^2$ around the
globular cluster $\omega$ Centauri, aimed to detect debris material from the
alleged progenitor galaxy of the cluster. We detected 48 RR Lyrae stars of
which only 11 have been previously reported. Ten among the eleven previously
known stars were found inside the tidal radius of the cluster. The rest were
located outside the tidal radius up to distances of $\sim 6$ degrees from the
center of the cluster. Several of those stars are located at distances similar
to that of $\omega$ Centauri. We investigated the probability that those stars
may have been stripped off the cluster by studying their properties (mean
periods), calculating the expected halo/thick disk population of RR Lyrae stars
in this part of the sky, analyzing the radial velocity of a sub-sample of the
RR Lyrae stars, and finally, studying the probable orbits of this sub-sample
around the Galaxy. None of these investigations support the scenario that there
is significant tidal debris around $\omega$ Centauri, confirming previous
studies in the region. It is puzzling that tidal debris have been found
elsewhere but not near the cluster itself.
