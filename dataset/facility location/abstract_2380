One of the most important steps of document image processing is binarization.
The computational requirements of locally adaptive binarization techniques make
them unsuitable for devices with limited computing facilities. In this paper,
we have presented a computationally efficient implementation of convolution
based locally adaptive binarization techniques keeping the performance
comparable to the original implementation. The computational complexity has
been reduced from O(W2N2) to O(WN2) where WxW is the window size and NxN is the
image size. Experiments over benchmark datasets show that the computation time
has been reduced by 5 to 15 times depending on the window size while memory
consumption remains the same with respect to the state-of-the-art algorithmic
implementation.
