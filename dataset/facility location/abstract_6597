We describe recent extensions of the program SPheno including flavour
aspects, CP-phases, R-parity violation and low energy observables. In case of
flavour mixing all masses of supersymmetric particles are calculated including
the complete flavour structure and all possible CP-phases at the 1-loop level.
We give details on implemented seesaw models, low energy observables and the
corresponding extension of the SUSY Les Houches Accord. Moreover, we comment on
the possiblities to include MSSM extensions in SPheno.
