We describe local Calabi-Yau geometries with two isolated singularities at
which systems of D3- and D7-branes are located, leading to chiral sectors
corresponding to a semi-realistic visible sector and a hidden sector with
dynamical supersymmetry breaking. We provide explicit models with a 3-family
MSSM-like visible sector, and a hidden sector breaking supersymmetry at a
meta-stable minimum. For singularities separated by a distance smaller than the
string scale, this construction leads to a simple realization of gauge mediated
supersymmetry breaking in string theory. The models are simple enough to allow
the explicit computation of the massive messenger sector, using dimer
techniques for branes at singularities. The local character of the
configurations makes manifest the UV insensitivity of the supersymmetry
breaking mediation.
