Let an EPR source which generates maximally entangled pairs be located so
that it has distances $L_1$ and $L_2$ to two users. After taking into account
various effects like loss of photons, deficiencies in the source and detectors,
an entangled pair traveling through the channel may loose its perfect
correlation due to errors in the channel. How the entanglement of the received
pair depends on the above distances and the local properties of the channels
used for this transmission? What is the best location of the source if we want
to achieve the highest fidelity? What is the threshold distance beyond which
the entanglement of the pair vanishes and becomes useless for using in
teleportation. We discuss these problems for the Pauli channel which simulates
the effect of optical fibers and possibly the atmosphere on the
polarization-entangled photons.
