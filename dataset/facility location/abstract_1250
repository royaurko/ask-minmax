We describe a finite-difference method for locating apparent horizons and
illustrate its capabilities on boosted Kerr and Schwarzschild black holes. Our
model spacetime is given by the Kerr-Schild metric. We apply a Lorentz boost to
this spacetime metric and then carry out a 3+1 decomposition. The result is a
slicing of Kerr/Schwarzschild in which the black hole is propagated and Lorentz
contracted. We show that our method can locate distorted apparent horizons
efficiently and accurately.
