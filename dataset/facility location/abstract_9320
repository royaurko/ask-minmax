The galaxy CFC97 Cen 05 has in the past been considered an HI-rich dwarf
galaxy in the nearby Centaurus A group. We have used Australia Telescope
Compact Array observations to show that the HI associated with CFC97 Cen 05 by
Cote et al. (1997) is most likely a Galactic High Velocity Cloud that is
centered ~17' from the optical image of the galaxy. At the optical location of
the galaxy, which is not that tabulated by Banks et al. (1999), there is no
indication of the presence of HI for velocities less than the upper limit of
the HIPASS survey at ~12,500 km/s. In addition, WFPC2 images of CFC97 Cen 05
obtained from the HST Archive reveal that this galaxy is in fact not a dwarf at
all, but rather is a distant background spiral not associated with the
Centaurus A group.
