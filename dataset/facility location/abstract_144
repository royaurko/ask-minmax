Until now, the detailed interpretation of the observed microlensing events
has suffered from the fact that the physical parameters of the phenomenon
cannot be uniquely determined from the available astronomical measurements,
i.e. the photometric lightcurves. The situation will change in the near-future
with the availability of long-baseline, sensitive optical interferometers,
which should be able to resolve the images of the lensed objects into their
components. For this, it will be necessary to achieve a milliarcsecond
resolution on sources with typical magnitudes K $\ga 12$. Indeed, brighter
events have never been observed up to now by micro-lensing surveys. We discuss
the possibilities opened by the use of long baseline interferometry in general,
and in particular for one such facility, the ESO VLT Interferometer, which will
attain the required performance. We discuss the expected accuracy and limiting
magnitude of such measurements. On the basis of the database of the events
detected by the OGLE experiment, we estimate the number of microlenses that
could be available for measurements by the VLTI. We find that at least several
tens of events could be observed each year. In conjunction with the photometric
data, our ability to measure the angular separation between the microlensed
images will enable a direct and unambiguous determination of both their masses
and locations.
