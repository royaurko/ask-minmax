The nuclear emulsion target of the CHORUS detector was exposed to the
wide-band neutrino beam of the CERN SPS of 27 GeV average neutrino energy from
1994 to 1997. In total about 100000 charged-current neutrino interactions with
at least one identified muon were located in the emulsion target and fully
reconstructed, using newly developed automated scanning systems. Charmed
particles were searched for by a program recognizing particle decays. The
observation of the decay in nuclear emulsion makes it possible to select a
sample with very low background and minimal kinematical bias. 2013
charged-current interactions with a charmed hadron candidate in the final state
were selected and confirmed through visual inspection. The charm production
rate induced by neutrinos relative to the charged-current cross-section is
measured to be sigma(nu_mu N -> mu- C X)/sigma(CC) = (5.75 +-0.32 stat +-0.30
syst)%. The charm production cross-section as a function of the neutrino energy
is also obtained. The results are in good agreement with previous measurements.
The charm-quark hadronization produces the following charmed hadrons with
relative fractions (in %): f_Dzero = 43.7+-4.5, f_Lambda_c^plus = 19.2+-4.2,
f_Dplus = 25.3+-4.2, and f_D_splus = 11.8+-4.7.
