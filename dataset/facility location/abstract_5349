The gamma p --> pi0 pi0 p reaction has been measured from threshold to 1.4
GeV using the Crystal Ball and TAPS photon spectrometers together with the
photon tagging facility at the Mainz Microtron. The experimental results
include total and differential cross sections as well as specific angular
distributions, which were used to extract partial-wave amplitudes. In
particular, the energy region below the D13(1520) resonance was studied.
