Spectral and kinematic studies suggest that the nonthermal radio source Sgr
A*, located at the center of the Milky Way, is a supermassive compact object
with a mass 2-3 million solar masses. Winds from nearby stars, located
approximately 0.06 pc to the east of Sgr A*, should, in the absence of any
outflow from the putative black hole itself, be accreting onto this object. We
report the results of the first 3D Bondi-Hoyle hydrodynamical numerical
simulations of this process under the assumption that the Galactic center wind
is generated by several different point sources (here assumed to be 10
pseudo-randomly placed stars). Our results show that the accretion rate onto
the central object can be higher than in the case of a uniform flow since
wind-wind shocks dissipate some of the bulk kinetic energy and lead to a higher
capture rate for the gas. However, even for this highly non-uniform medium,
most of the accreting gas carries with it a relatively low level of specific
angular momentum, though large transient fluctuations can occur. Additionally,
the post-bow-shock focusing of the gas can be substantially different than that
for a uniform flow, but it depends strongly on the stellar spatial
distribution. We discuss how this affects the morphology of the gas in the
inner 0.15 pc of the Galaxy and the consequences for accretion disk models of
Sgr A*.
