The Long Wavelength Array (LWA) will be a new multi-purpose radio telescope
operating in the frequency range 10-88 MHz. Upon completion, LWA will consist
of 53 phased array "stations" distributed over a region about 400 km in
diameter in the state of New Mexico. Each station will consist of 256 pairs of
dipole-type antennas whose signals are formed into beams, with outputs
transported to a central location for high-resolution aperture synthesis
imaging. The resulting image sensitivity is estimated to be a few mJy (5 sigma,
8 MHz, 2 polarizations, 1 hr, zenith) in 20-80 MHz; with resolution and field
of view of (8", 8 deg) and (2",2 deg) at 20 MHz and 80 MHz, respectively. All
256 dipole antennas are in place for the first station of the LWA (called
LWA-1), and commissioning activities are well underway. The station is located
near the core of the EVLA, and is expected to be fully operational in early
2011.
