Experimental observation of superfluidity in a microscopic cluster,
$M:(^4He)_x$, of a molecule ($M$) and $x$ number of $^4He$ atoms (with $x$
ranging from 1 to many) is qualitatively analyzed. It concludes that: (i) each
$^4He$ atom in the cluster has to have non-zero momentum for its confinement to
a space of size ($<$ the size of the cluster), (ii) superfluidity does not
require atoms with zero momentum ($p=0$), and (iii) while all $^4He$ atoms in
the cluster cease to have relative motions (hence the inter-atomic collisions),
they retain a freedom to move coherently in order of their locations on a
closed path around the rotor ($M$ plus few nearest $^4He$ atoms which follow
the molecular rotation for their relatively strong binding with $M$). The
analysis also identifies the basic arrangement of $^4He$ atoms which allows the
rotor to have free rotation in the cluster.
