Completed in May 2008, the ANTARES neutrino telescope is located 40 km off
the coast of Toulon, at a depth of about 2500 m. The telescope consists of 12
detect or lines housing a total of 884 optical modules. Each line is anchored
to the seabed and pulled taught by the buoyancy of the individual optical
modules and a top buoy. Due to the fluid nature of the sea-water detecting
medium and the flexible nature of the detector lines, the optical modules of
the ANTARES telescope can suffer from deviations of up to several meters from
the vertical and as such, real time positioning is needed. Real time
positioning of the ANTARES telescope is achieved by a combination of an
acoustic positioning system and a lattice of tiltmeters and compasses. These
independent and complementary systems are used to compute a global fit to each
individual detector line, allowing us to construct a 3 dimensional picture of
the ANTARES neutrino telescope with an accuracy of less than 10 cm. In this
paper we describe the positioning system of the ANTARES neutrino telescope and
discuss its performance during the first year of 12 line data taking.
