We present a minimal quasistatic 1D model describing the kinematics of the
transition from static friction to stick-slip motion of a linear elastic block
on a rigid plane. We show how the kinematics of both the precursors to
frictional sliding and the periodic stick-slip motion are controlled by the
amount of friction-induced torque at the interface. Our model provides a
general framework to understand and relate a series of recent experimental
observations, in particular the nucleation location of micro-slip instabilities
and the build up of an asymmetric field of real contact area.
