We present FLUKA and MARS simulation studies of the pion production and
energy deposition in the Neutrino Factory baseline target station, which
consists of a 4 MW proton beam interacting with a liquid mercury jet target
within a 20 T solenoidal magnetic field. We show that a substantial increase in
the shielding is needed to protect the superconducting coils from too much
energy deposition. Investigations reveal that it is possible to reduce the
magnetic field in the solenoid capture system without adversely affecting the
pion production efficiency. We show estimates of the amount of concrete
shielding that will be required to protect the environment from the high
radiation doses generated by the target station facility. We also present yield
and energy deposition results for alternative targets: gallium liquid jet,
tungsten powder jet and solid tungsten bars.
