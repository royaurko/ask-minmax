It is commonly thought that small couplings in a low-energy theory, such as
those needed for the fermion mass hierarchy or proton stability, must originate
from symmetries in a high-energy theory. We show that this expectation is
violated in theories where the Standard Model fields are confined to a thick
wall in extra dimensions, with the fermions "stuck" at different points in the
wall. Couplings between them are then suppressed due to the exponentially small
overlaps of their wave functions. This provides a framework for understanding
both the fermion mass hierarchy and proton stability without imposing
symmetries, but rather in terms of higher dimensional geography. A model
independent prediction of this scenario is non-universal couplings of the
Standard Model fermions to the ``Kaluza-Klein'' excitations of the gauge
fields. This allows a measurement of the fermion locations in the extra
dimensions at the LHC or NLC if the wall thickness is close to the TeV scale.
