We discuss the nature of eleven Possible Open Cluster Remnants (POCRs) by
using absolute proper motions from the Southern Proper Motion (SPM) Program 3
(Girard et al. 2004) combined with near infrared photometry from 2MASS. The
analysis is done by considering the distribution of stars in the
Color-Magnitude and the Vector Point diagrams. We successfully probed the
capabilities of the SPM catalog to detect a physical group by looking at the
open cluster Blanco~1. However, within the uncertainties of the SPM3 catalog
and basing on 2MASS photometry we conclude that only one -ESO282SC26- out of
eleven objects turns out to be a probable physical group. We suggest it is an
open cluster 1.3 Gyr old and located 1.4 kpc from the Sun.
