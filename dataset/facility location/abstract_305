The feasibility of performing fast neutron resonance radiography at the PTB
accelerator facility is studied. A neutron beam of a broad spectral
distribution is produced by a pulsed 13 MeV deuterium beam hitting a thick Be
target. The potential of 3 different neutron imaging detectors with time-of
flight capability are investigated. The applied methods comprise wire chambers
with hydrogenous converter layers and a fast plastic scintillator with
different optical readout schemes. We present the neutron facility, the imaging
methods employed and results obtained. in beam experiments where samples of
carbon rods with various length and diameter were imaged to study resolution
and sensitivity of the method.
