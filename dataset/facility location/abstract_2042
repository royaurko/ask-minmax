Updated results of the experiment E94-107 hypernuclear spectroscopy in Hall A
of the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab), are
presented. The experiment provides high resolution spectra of excitation energy
for 12B_\Lambda, 16N_\Lambda, and 9Li_\Lambda hypernuclei obtained by
electroproduction of strangeness. A new theoretical calculation for
12B_\Lambda, final results for 16N_\Lambda, and discussion of the preliminary
results of 9Li_\Lambda are reported.
