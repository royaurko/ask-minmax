We present two Arabic texts of historic observations of supernova SN 1006
from Yemen as reported by al-Yamani and Ibn al-Dayba (14th to 16th century AD).
An English translation of the report by the latter was given before (Stephenson
& Green 2002), but the original Arabic text was not yet published. In addition,
we present for the first time the earlier report, also from Yemen, namely by
al-Yamani in its original Arabic and with our English translation. It is quite
obvious that the report by Ibn al-Dayba is based on the report by al-Yamani (or
a common source), but the earlier report by al-Yamani is more detailed and in
better (Arabic) language. We discuss in detail the dating of these
observations. The most striking difference to other reports about SN 1006 is
the apparent early discovery in Yemen in the evening of 15th of Rajab of the
year 396h (i.e. AD 1006 Apr 17 \pm 2 on the Julian calendar), as reported by
both al-Yamani and Ibn al-Dayba. i.e. about 1.5 weeks earlier than the
otherwise earliest known reports. We also briefly discuss other information
from the Yemeni reports on brightness, light curve, duration of visibility,
location, stationarity, and color.
