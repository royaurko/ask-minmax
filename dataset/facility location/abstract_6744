Certain diabolical points in the tunneling spectrum of the single-molecule
magnet Fe$_8$ were previously believed to be have been eliminated as a result
of a weak fourth-order anisotropy. As shown by Bruno, this is not so, and the
points are only displaced in the magnetic field space along the medium
anisotropy direction. The previously missing points are numerically located by
following the lines of the Berry curvature. The importance of an experimental
search for these rediscovered points is discussed.
