The oscillations of the solar-like star HD 49933 have been observed
thoroughly by CoRot. Two dozens of frequency shifts, which are closely related
with the change in magnetic activity, have been measured. To explore the
effects of the magnetic activity on the frequency shifts, we calculate
frequency shifts for the radial and $l = 1$ p-modes of HD 49933 with the
general variational method, which evaluates the shifts using a spatial integral
of the product of a kernel and some sources. The theoretical frequency shifts
well reproduce the observation. The magnitudes and positions of the sources are
determined according to the $\chi^2$ criterion. We predict the source that
contributes to both $l = 0$ and $l = 1$ modes is located at $0.48 - 0.62$Mm
below the stellar surface. In addition, based on the assumption that $A_{0}$ is
proportional to the change in the MgII activity index $\Delta{i}_{MgII}$, we
obtained that the change of MgII index between minimum and maximum of HD 49933
cycle period is about 0.665. The magnitude of the frequency shifts compared to
the Sun already told us that HD 49933 is much more active than the Sun, which
is further confirmed in this paper. Furthermore, our calculation on the
frequency shifts of $l = 1$ modes indicates the variation of turbulent velocity
in the stellar convective zone may be an important source for the $l = 1$
shifts.
