The KPNO International Spectroscopic Survey (KISS) is an objective-prism
survey for extragalactic emission-line objects. It combines many of the
features of previous slitless spectroscopic surveys with the advantages of
modern CCD detectors, and is the first purely digital objective-prism survey
for emission-line galaxies. Here we present the first list of emission-line
galaxy candidates selected from our blue spectral data, which cover the
wavelength range 4800 -- 5500 A. In most cases, the detected emission line is
[O III]5007. The current survey list covers a one-degree-wide strip located at
Dec = 29 deg 30' (B1950.0) and spanning the right ascension range 8h 30m to 17h
0m. An area of 116.6 deg^2 is covered. A total of 223 candidate emission-line
objects have been selected for inclusion in the survey list (1.91 deg^-2). We
tabulate accurate coordinates and photometry for each source, as well as
estimates of the redshift, emission-line flux, and equivalent width based on
measurements of the digital objective-prism spectra. The median apparent
magnitude of the sample is B = 18.2, and galaxies with redshifts approaching z
= 0.1 are detected. The properties of the KISS emission-line galaxies are
examined using the available observational data, and compared to previous
surveys carried out with photographic plates as well as with the
H-alpha-selected portion of KISS.
