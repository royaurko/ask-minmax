It was the best of times; it was the worst of times is the way Dickens begins
the Tale of Two Cities. The line is appropriate to our time in particle
physics. It is the best of times because we are in the midst of a revolution in
understanding, the third to occur during my career. It is the worst of times
because accelerator facilities are shutting down before new ones are opening,
restricting the opportunity for experiments, and because of great uncertainty
about future funding. My task today is to give you a view of the most important
opportunities for our field under a scenario that is constrained by a tight
budget. It is a time when we cannot afford the merely good, but must give first
priority to the really important.
