The future of astronomy is inextricably entwined with the care and feeding of
astronomical data products. Community standards such as FITS and NDF have been
instrumental in the success of numerous astronomy projects. Their very success
challenges us to entertain pragmatic strategies to adapt and evolve the
standards to meet the aggressive data-handling requirements of facilities now
being designed and built. We discuss characteristics that have made standards
successful in the past, as well as desirable features for the future, and an
open discussion follows.
