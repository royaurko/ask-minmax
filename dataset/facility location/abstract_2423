Integrated tempering sampling (ITS) method is an approach to enhance the
sampling over a broad range of energies and temperatures in computer
simulations. In this paper, a new version of integrated tempering sampling
method is proposed. In the new approach presented here, we obtain parameters
such as the set of temperatures and the corresponding weighting factors from
canonical average of potential energies. These parameters can be easily
obtained without estimating partition functions. We apply this new approach to
study the Lennard-Jones fluid, the ALA-PRO peptide and the single polymer chain
systems to validate and benchmark the method.
