Long-slit observations of 4 dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the M81 group are
presented. We have obtained a heliocentric velocity of globular cluster
candidate located near the center of DDO78 to be +55 +- 10 km/s by
cross-correlation with template stars. We estimated a heliocentric radial
velocity of -116 +- 21 km/s for an HII region seen in the K 61.
 A red diffuse object near the K64 center is found to be a remote galaxy with a
heliocentric velocity of +46530 km/s.
