Measurements of the quenching factor for sodium recoils in a 5 cm diameter
NaI(Tl) crystal at room temperature have been made at a dedicated neutron
facility at the University of Sheffield. The crystal has been exposed to 2.45
MeV mono-energetic neutrons generated by a Sodern GENIE 16 neutron generator,
yielding nuclear recoils of energies between 10 and 100 keVnr. A cylindrical
BC501A detector has been used to tag neutrons that scatter off sodium nuclei in
the crystal. Cuts on pulse shape and time of flight have been performed on
pulses recorded by an Acqiris DC265 digitiser with a 2 ns sampling time.
Measured quenching factors of Na nuclei range from 19% to 26% in good agreement
with other experiments, and a value of 25.2 \pm 6.4% has been determined for 10
keV sodium recoils. From pulse shape analysis, the mean times of pulses from
electron and nuclear recoils have been compared down to 2 keVee. The
experimental results are compared to those predicted by Lindhard theory,
simulated by the SRIM Monte Carlo code, and a preliminary curve calculated by
Prof. Akira Hitachi.
