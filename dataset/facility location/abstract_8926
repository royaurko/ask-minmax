Relativistic jets carry a significant fraction of the total energy budget of
a radio source, rivaling the power that is extracted through accretion. A minor
part of this bulk kinetic power is transformed to radiation, possibly through
internal shocks if the plasma is accelerated, at the base of the jet, to a
velocity which changes in time. In this way we can understand why some
radiation is produced all along the jet even if most of it originates at a
preferred location, and why the efficiency of conversion of bulk to random
energy is small. The recent observations by Chandra of intense jet X-ray
emission at large scales suggest that at least the "spine" of jets continues to
be highly relativistics even up to hundreds of kiloparsecs away from the
nucleus and give tight lower limits on the jet bulk kinetic power.
