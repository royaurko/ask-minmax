The center of the our Galaxy is a region where very energetic phenomena take
place. In particular powerful cosmic ray sources can be located in that region.
The cosmic rays accelerated in these sources may interact with ambient protons
and/or low energy photons producing gamma rays and neutrinos. The observation
of these two types of secondary particles can be very useful for the
identification of the cosmic ray sources and for the understanding of the
physical processes occurring during acceleration.
  Motivated by the excess in the neutrino spectrum recently reported by the
IceCube Collaboration, we study in detail the shape of the gamma ray and
neutrino spectra originated from the interaction of cosmic ray protons with
ambient protons for sources located in the Galactic Center region. We consider
different models for proton acceleration and study the impact on the gamma ray
and neutrino spectra. We also discuss the possibility to constrain and even
identify a particular neutrino source by using the information given by the
gamma ray spectrum taking advantage of the modification of the spectral shape,
caused by the interaction of the gamma rays with the photons of the radiation
field present in the interstellar medium, which strongly depends on the source
distance.
