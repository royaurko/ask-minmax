We investigate the effect of quenched surface charge disorder on
electrostatic interactions between two charged surfaces in the presence of
dielectric inhomogeneities and added salt. We show that in the linear
weak-coupling regime (i.e., by including mean-field and Gaussian-fluctuations
contributions), the image-charge effects lead to a non-zero disorder-induced
interaction free energy between two surfaces of equal mean charge that can be
repulsive or attractive depending on the dielectric mismatch across the
bounding surfaces and the exact location of the disordered charge distribution.
