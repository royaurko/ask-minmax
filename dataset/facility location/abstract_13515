The last three decades the asteroid (1) Ceres is an object of the intensive
ground-and space-based observations. A new unusual contributing to these
studies represents the recent detection of localized sources of water vapour
releasing from its surface at a rate about 6 kg s-1 (K\"uppers et al 2014). A
drastic distinction between asteroid (1) Ceres and nearest the large asteroid
(4) Vesta in terms of their composition and appearance emphasizes an urgent
state of a problem of the possible origin of Ceres in the main asteroid belt.
By analogy with the early assumptions of some well-known astronomers of Mercury
and Mars as the escaped satellites of their host planets we have put forward
and semi-empirically have justified a hypothesis for the plausible origin of
Ceres as the satellite of a disrupted planet in the past orbited the Sun of ~ 5
AU. The orbital location of this host of Ceres beyond the snow line of the
Solar System explains a formation the icy mantle of Ceres, which appears may be
a water vapour source.
