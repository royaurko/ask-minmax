Inspired by biological evolution, we consider the following so-called
accessibility percolation problem: The vertices of the unoriented
$n$-dimensional binary hypercube are assigned independent $U(0, 1)$ weights,
referred to as fitnesses. A path is considered accessible if fitnesses are
strictly increasing along it. We prove that the probability that the global
fitness maximum is accessible from the all zeroes vertex converges to
$1-\frac{1}{2}\ln\left(2+\sqrt{5}\right)$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$. Moreover, we
prove that if one conditions on the location of the fitness maximum being $v$,
then provided $v$ is not too close to the all zeroes vertex in Hamming
distance, the probability that $v$ is accessible converges to a function of
this distance divided by $n$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$. This resolves a
conjecture by Berestycki, Brunet and Shi in almost full generality.
  As a second result we show that, for any graph, accessibility percolation can
equivalently be formulated in terms of first-passage site percolation. This
connection is of particular importance for the study of accessibility
percolation on trees.
