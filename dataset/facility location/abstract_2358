During 2010-2011, the Medicina 32-m dish hosted the 7-feed 18-26.5 GHz
receiver built for the Sardinia Radio Telescope, with the goal to perform its
commissioning. This opportunity was exploited to carry out a pilot survey at 20
GHz over the area for {\delta} > + 72.3{\deg}. This paper describes all the
phases of the observations, as they were performed using new hardware and
software facilities. The map-making and source extraction procedures are
illustrated. A customised data reduction tool was used during the follow-up
phase, which produced a list of 73 confirmed sources down to a flux density of
115 mJy. The resulting catalogue, here presented, is complete above 200 mJy.
Source counts are in agreement with those provided by the AT20G survey. This
pilot activity paves the way to a larger project, the K-band Northern Wide
Survey (KNoWS), whose final aim is to survey the whole Northern Hemisphere down
to a flux limit of 50 mJy (5{\sigma}).
