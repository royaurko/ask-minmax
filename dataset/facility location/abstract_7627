We investigate the environment of the infrared dust bubble S51 and search for
evidence of triggered star formation in its surroundings. We performed a
multiwavelength study of the region around S51 with data taken from large-scale
surveys: 2MASS, GLIMPSE, MIPSGAL, IRAS, and MALT90. We analyzed the spectral
profile and the distribution of the molecular gas (13CO, C18O, HCN, HNC, HCO+,
C2H, N2H+, and HC3N), and dust in the environment of S51. We used mid-infrared
emission three-color image to explore the physical environment and GLIMPSE
color-color diagram [5.8]-[8.0] versus [3.6]-[4.5] to search for young stellar
objects and identify the ionizing star candidates. From a comparison of the
morphology of the molecular gas and the Spitzer 8.0 \mu m emission, we conclude
that the dust bubble is interacting with CO at a kinematic distance of 3.4 kpc.
The bubble S51 structure, carried with shell and front side, is exhibited with
13CO and C18O emission. Both outflow and inflow may exist in sources in the
shell of bubble S51. We discover a small bubble G332.646-0.606 (R_in = 26",
r_in = 15", R_out = 35" and r_out = 25") located at the northwest border of
S51. A water maser, a methanol maser and IRAS 16158-5055 are located at the
junction of the two bubbles. Several young stellar objects are distributed
along an arc-shaped structure near the S51 shell. They may represent a second
generation of stars whose formation was triggered by the bubble expanding into
the molecular gas.
