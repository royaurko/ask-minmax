Evaluation of the additive constants in the space-time Lorentz transformation
equations required, according to Einstein, to correctly describe synchronised
clocks at different spatial locations, reveals the spurious and unphysical
nature of the 'relativity of simultaneity' and 'length contraction' effects of
conventional special relativity. Unlike time dilation, there is no experimental
evidence for these putative effects. Only a universal (position independent)
time dilation effect for different inertial frames distinguishes special from
Galilean relativity.
