Charged current scattering of nu_mu on 12C has been studied using a pi+
decay-in-flight nu_mu beam at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility. A sample
of 56.8 +- 9.6 events satisfying criteria for the exclusive reaction 12C +
nu_mu -> mu- + 12N_g.s. was obtained using the large Liquid Scintillator
Neutrino Detector (LSND). The observed flux-averaged cross section, (6.6 +- 1.0
+- 1.0) x 10^-41 cm^2, agrees well with reliable theoretical expectations. A
measurement was also obtained for the inclusive cross section to all accessible
12N states, 12C + nu_\mu -> mu- + X. This flux-averaged cross section is (11.2
+- 0.3 +- 1.8)x 10^-40 cm^2, which is approximately half of that given by a
recent Continuum Random Phase Approximation (CRPA) calculation.
