We have investigated the crystal and magnetic structures of the trigonal
iron-boracite Fe3B7O13X with X = OH by neutron diffraction. Neutron diffraction
enables us to locate the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group and determine the
magnetic ground state of this member of the multiferroic boracite family. No
evidence was found for a monoclinic distortion in the magnetic ordered state.
The magnetic symmetry allows for magnetoelectric and ferroelectric properties.
The N/'eel tempera- ture TN of 4.86(4) K confi?rms the general trends within
the boracites that TN decreases from X = I > Br > Cl > OH. Surprisingly while
Fe3B7O13OH exhibits the largest frustration with |theta/?=TN| = 5.6 within the
Fe3B7O13X series, no reduction of the magnetic moment is found using neutron
diffraction.
