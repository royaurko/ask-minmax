We investigate advection dominated, transsonic accretion flows in the
vicinity of a Kerr black hole. We take into account all relativistic effects in
the dynamics of the flow and in the propagation of light. We assume the matter
to be weakly magnetized and cool via the thermal synchrotron and Bremsstrahlung
radiation. We include also the effects of Comptonization. We calculate the
spectra of radiation as seen by observers located at different positions
relative to the equatorial plane of the disk. The radiation emitted by the
accreting matter is anisotropic and observers near the equatorial plane
register a higher energy flux. This effect is more pronounced in the case of
slowly rotating black holes. We calculate also the shape of a hypothetical
gamma line, which may be produced by the thermonuclear reactions in the inner
part of the flow. The line is strongly broadened, but the fact that the flow is
quasi-spherical removes the two-peak shape of the line seen in the spectra
emitted from thin, Keplerian disks. The kinematics of the advection dominated
flows is not unique (as opposed to Keplerian disks or spherical free-fall) and
it would probably be difficult to find strong limits on source models using the
spectral observations.
