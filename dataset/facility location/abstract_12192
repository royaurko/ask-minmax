We present an extended analysis of deep Chandra HETG observations of the
WR+OB binary system WR 147 that was resolved into a double X-ray source (Zhekov
& Park, 2010, ApJ, 709, L119). Our analysis of the profiles of strong emission
lines shows that their centroids are blue-shifted in the spectrum of the
northern X-ray source. We find no suppressed forbidden line in the He-like
triplets which indicates that the X-ray emitting region is not located near
enough to the stars in the binary system to be significantly affected by their
UV radiation. The most likely physical picture that emerges from the entire set
of HETG data suggests that the northern X-ray source can be associated with the
colliding stellar wind region in the wide WR+OB binary system, while the X-rays
of its southern counterpart, the WN8 star, are result from stellar wind
shocking onto a close companion (a hypothesized third star in the system).
