Issuing from a geometry with nonmetricity and torsion we build up a classical
theory of gravitation and electromagnetism. The theory is coordinate covariant
as well Weyl-gauge covariant. Massless and massive photons, intrinsic electr.
and magn. currents exist in this framework. The field EQ-s and EQ-s of motion
are derived from a geometrically based action. It is shown that the magn.-magn.
interaction is transmitted by massive photons. A magn. charge (monopole) cannot
be located together with an electr. one. In absence of torsion and in the
Einstein gauge one obtains the Einstein-Maxwell theory.
