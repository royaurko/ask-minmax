We present Submillimeter Array observations of the young stellar object IRAS
04579+4703 in the 1.3 mm continuum and in the 12CO(2-1), 13CO(2-1) and
C18O(2-1) lines. The 1.3 mm continuum image reveals a flattened structure with
a mass of 13 Msun. The 12CO(2-1) line map and position-velocity (PV) diagram,
together with the broad wing (full width=30 km/s of 12CO(2-1)) line, clearly
show that there is an outflow motion, which originates from an embedded massive
YSO in this region. The lengths of the blue-shifted and red-shifted lobes are
0.14 pc and 0.13 pc respectively. The total gas mass, average dynamical
timescale and mass entrainment rate of the outflow are 1.8 Msun, 1.7*10^4 yr
and 1.1*10^(-4) Msun/yr, respectively. The flattened morphology of the
continuum source perpendicular to the outflow direction, and the velocity
gradient seen in the spectra of C18O(2-1) taken from different locations along
the major axis of the continuum source, suggest the presence of an accretion
disk in this region.
