The dynamics of a small Prandtl number binary mixture in a laterally heated
cavity is studied numerically. By combining temporal integration, steady state
solving and linear stability analysis of the full PDE equations, we have been
able to locate and characterize a codimension-three degenerate Takens-Bogdanov
point whose unfolding describes the dynamics of the system for a certain range
of Rayleigh numbers and separation ratios near S=-1.
