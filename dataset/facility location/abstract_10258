In this paper, the possibility to exploit a high energy beta beam without
massive detectors is discussed. The radioactive ions are boosted up to very
high $\gamma$ with the neutrino beam pointing towards an instrumented surface
located at a moderate baseline (e.g. from CERN to the Gran Sasso Laboratories).
$\nu_e \to \nu_\mu$ oscillations and their CP conjugate are tagged as an excess
of horizontal muons produced in the rock and tracked by the low-mass
instrumented surface installed in one of the LNGS experimental halls. We show
that the performance of this complex for what concerns the determination of the
$\theta_{13}$ angle of the leptonic mixing matrix is comparable with the
current low-$\gamma$ design based on a gigantic water Cherenkov at Frejus.
