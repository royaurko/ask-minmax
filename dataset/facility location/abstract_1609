A Dual Digital Signal Processing VME Board was developed for the Continuous
Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) Beam Current Monitor (BCM) system at
Jefferson Lab. It is a versatile general-purpose digital signal processing
board using an open architecture, which allows for adaptation to various
applications. The base design uses two independent Texas Instrument (TI)
TMS320C6711, which are 900 MFLOPS floating-point digital signal processors
(DSP). Applications that require a fixed point DSP can be implemented by
replacing the baseline DSP with the pin-for-pin compatible TMS320C6211. The
design can be manufactured with a reduced chip set without redesigning the
printed circuit board. For example it can be implemented as a single-channel
DSP with no analog I/O.
