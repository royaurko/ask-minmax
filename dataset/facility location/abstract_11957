In this paper, we provide a new method to find all zeros of polynomials with
quaternionic coefficients located on only one side of the powers of the
variable (these polynomials are called simple polynomials). This method is much
more efficient and much simpler than the known one in [D. Janovska and G.
Opfer, A note on the computation of all zeros of simple quaternionic
polynomials, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 48(1)(2010), pp. 244-256]. We recover
several known results, and deduce several interesting consequences concerning
solving equations with all real coefficients or complex coefficients which do
not seem to be deduced easily from the results in [D. Janovska and G. Opfer, A
note on the computation of all zeros of simple quaternionic polynomials, SIAM
J. Numer. Anal., 48(1)(2010), pp. 244-256]. We also give a necessary and
sufficient condition for a simple quaternionic polynomials to have finitely
many solutions (only isolated solutions).
