The cataclysmic variable SDSSJ 015543.40+002807.2 is confirmed to be a
magnetic system of the AM Herculis type. With an orbital period of 87.13 min,
it is also the shortest-period eclipsing Polar known. Monitoring with
XMM-Newton finds a high-state light curve dominated by a single X-ray emitting
accretion pole located slightly prograde of the secondary star. The hard X-ray
spectrum is typical of radial shocks on magnetic white dwarfs (kT ~ 10keV), and
there is evidence for a soft X-ray component consistent with reprocessing from
the stellar surface. The optical circular polarization is weak (v < 3%) when
the accretion rate is high (mV ~ 15.5), due to optically-thick cyclotron
emission and the apparent competition between two accreting poles. However, in
low states (mV ~ 18), the polarization increases smoothly to the blue, reaching
20% at 4200A, and the flux spectrum displays a rich set of thermally-broadened
cyclotron harmonics that indicate a polar field of 29MG. The phase interval
preceding the 6.5 min eclipse depicts the development of P-Cygni components
followed by complete absorption reversals in the emission lines. This
phenomenon is not unexpected for a strongly accreting magnetic system viewed
through the cool base of the funnel, and high-quality spectroscopy through this
interval will likely lead to new insights into the dynamics of magnetic
coupling and gas flow onto the white dwarf.
