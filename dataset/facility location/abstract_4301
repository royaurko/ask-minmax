In this paper we present some interesting results involving summation of
series in particular trigonometric ones. We failed to locate these results in
existing literature or in the web like MathWorld
(http://mathworld.wolfram.com/) nor could we derive them using software for
analytical computation like Maple. The identities are beautiful and involve
finite series.
