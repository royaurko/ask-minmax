Pt deposited on a Ge(001) surface spontaneously forms nanowire arrays. These
nanowires are thermodynamically stable and can be hundreds of atoms long. The
nanowires only occur on a reconstructed Pt-Ge-surface where they fill the
troughs between the dimer rows on the surface. This unique connection between
the nanowires and the underlying substrate make a thorough understanding of the
latter necessary for understanding the growth of the nanowires. In this paper
we study possible surface reconstructions containing 0.25 and 0.5 of a
monolayer of Pt. Comparison of calculated STM images to experimental STM images
of the surface reconstruction reveal that the Pt atoms are located in the top
layer, creating a structure with rows of alternating Pt-Ge and Ge-Ge dimers in
a c(4x2) arrangement. Our results also show that Pt atoms in the second or
third layer can not be responsible for the experimentally observed STM images.
