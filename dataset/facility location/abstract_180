Understanding the effects of RF breakdown in high-gradient accelerator
structures on the accelerated beam is an extremely relevant aspect in the
development of the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) and is one of the main issues
addressed at the Two-beam Test Stand at the CLIC Test Facility 3 at CERN.
During a RF breakdown large electro-magnetic fields are generated and produce
parasitic magnetic fields which interact with the accelerated beam affecting
its orbit and energy. We discuss here measurements of such effects observed on
an electron beam accelerated in a CLIC prototype structure. Measurements of the
trajectory of bunch-trains on a nanosecond time-scale showed fast changes in
correspondence of breakdown which we compare with measurements of the relative
beam spots on a scintillating screen. We identify different breakdown scenarios
for which we offer an explanation based also on measurements of the power at
the input and output ports of the accelerator structure. Finally we present the
distribution of the magnitude of the observed changes in the beam orbit and we
discuss its correlation with RF power and breakdown location in the accelerator
structure.
