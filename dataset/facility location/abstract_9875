Numerical data for all movies released in theaters in the USA during the
period 1997-2003 are examined for the distribution of their popularity in terms
of (i) the number of weeks they spent in the Top 60 according to the weekend
earnings, and (ii) the box-office gross during the opening week, as well as,
the total duration for which they were shown in theaters. These distributions
show long tails where the most popular movies are located. Like the study of
Redner [S. Redner, Eur. Phys. J. B 4, 131 (1998)] on the distribution of
citations to individual papers, our results are consistent with a power-law
dependence of the rank distribution of gross revenues for the most popular
movies with a exponent close to -1/2.
