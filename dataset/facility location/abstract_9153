We show that by analyzing the spectra of lensed broad absorption line quasars
(BALQSOs), it is possible to reveal key properties of the outflowing gas in the
inner regions of these objects. This results from the fact that each image of
the quasar corresponds to a different line of sight through the outflow. This
combined with dynamical estimates for the location of the flow, adds new
information concerning the lateral, non line of sight structure of the
absorbing gas. Here we consider a sample of lensed BALQSOs and note that the
similarity of BAL profiles of different images of the same quasar implies that
the flow is relatively isotropic on small scales. We show that its geometry is
inconsistent with the ballistically accelerated spherical cloud model, and that
wind models provide a better description of the flow structure. Furthermore,
observations seem to disagree with naive interpretations of recent
time-dependent wind simulations. This may hint on several important physical
processes that govern the structure and dynamics of such flows. Future
prospects for the study of quasar outflows with the effect of strong
gravitational lensing are discussed.
