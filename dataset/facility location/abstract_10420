The bijection between composition structures and random closed subsets of the
unit interval implies that the composition structures associated with $S \cap
[0,1]$ for a self-similar random set $S\subset {\mathbb R}_+$ are those which
are consistent with respect to a simple truncation operation. Using the
standard coding of compositions by finite strings of binary digits starting
with a 1, the random composition of $n$ is defined by the first $n$ terms of a
random binary sequence of infinite length. The locations of 1s in the sequence
are the places visited by an increasing time-homogeneous Markov chain on the
positive integers if and only if $S = \exp(-W)$ for some stationary
regenerative random subset $W$ of the real line. Complementing our study in
previous papers, we identify self-similar Markovian composition structures
associated with the two-parameter family of partition structures.
