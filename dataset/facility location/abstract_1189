In this study we explore the possibility of using the existing structure of a
running experiment, the LVD supernova observatory at the INFN Gran Sasso
National Laboratory, as an active shield and veto for the muon-induced
background. In our vision LVD could become (without affecting in any way its
main purpose of SN neutrino telescope) a host for a relatively compact but
massive experiment looking for rare events. The empty volume that can be
obtained removing 2 modules from the most internal part of the detector is 2.1m
x 6.2m x 2.8m; we will call it LVD Core Facility (LVD-CF). We have evaluated
the active vetoing and shielding power of LVD, with a detailed MC simulation
(based on Geant4) of the detector and the rock that surrounds it. The results
show that the flux of neutrons that are not associated with a visible muon in
LVD is very low; it results reduced by a factor 50, equivalent to the one
present in a much deeper underground laboratory, i.e. Sudbury. Moreover we
present the results of on-going measurements about the gamma contamination
inside the LVD-CF: it is reduced by a factor greater than 10 with respect to
the one measured outside the LVD detector.
