It has been shown in a recent paper that the Higgs quartic and Yukawa sectors
of the Standard Model (SM) with a heavy fourth generation exhibit at a two-loop
level a quasi fixed point structure instead of the one-loop Landau singularity
and which could be located in the TeV region, a scale which is denoted by
$\Lambda_{FP} $ in this paper. This provides the possibility of the existence
of a TeV-scale physical cutoff endowed with several implications. In the
vicinity of this quasi fixed point
  bound states and Higgs-like condensates made up of the 4th generation quarks
and leptons get formed. It implies the possibility of a dynamical electroweak
symmetry breaking generated by 4th generation condensates. The quasi fixed
points also hint at at a possible restoration of scale symmetry at
$\Lambda_{FP} $ and above and the emergence of a theory which could be deeper
than the SM.
