We investigate the fluctuating pattern created by a jet of fluid impingent
upon an amphiphile-covered surface. This microscopically thin layer is
initially covered with 50 $\mu$m floating particles so that the layer can be
visualized. A vertical jet of water located below the surface and directed
upward drives a hole in this layer. The hole is particle-free and is surrounded
by the particle-laden amphiphile region. The jet ruptures the amphiphile layer
creating a particle-free region that is surrounded by the particle-covered
surface. The aim of the experiment is to understand the (fluctuating) shape of
the ramified interface between the particle-laden and particle-free regions.
