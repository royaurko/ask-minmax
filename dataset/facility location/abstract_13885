Molecular communication promises to enable communication between nanomachines
with a view to increasing their functionalities and open up new possible
applications. Due to some of the biological properties, bacteria have been
proposed as a possible information carrier for molecular communication, and the
corresponding communication networks are known as \textit{bacterial
nanonetworks}. The biological properties include the ability for bacteria to
mobilize between locations and carry the information encoded in
Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) molecules. However, similar to most organisms,
bacteria have complex social properties that govern their colony. These social
characteristics enable the bacteria to evolve through various fluctuating
environmental conditions by utilizing cooperative and non-cooperative
behaviors. This article provides an overview of the different types of
cooperative and non-cooperative social behavior of bacteria. The challenges
(due to non-cooperation) and the opportunities (due to cooperation) these
behaviors can bring to the reliability of communication in bacterial
nanonetworks are also discussed. Finally, simulation results on the impact of
bacterial cooperative social behavior on the end-to-end reliability of a
single-link bacterial nanonetwork are presented. The article concludes with
highlighting the potential future research opportunities in this emerging
field.
