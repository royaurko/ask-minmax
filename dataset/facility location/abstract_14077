All-optical amplification of the light pulse in a weakly coupled two
nonlinear photonic crystal waveguides (PCWs) is proposed. We consider
pillar-type PCWs, which consist of the periodically distributed circular rods
made from a Kerr-type dielectric material. Dispersion diagrams of the symmetric
and antisymmetric modes are calculated. The operating frequency is properly
chosen to be located at the edge of the dispersion diagram of the modes. In the
linear case no propagation modes are excited at this frequency, however, in
case of nonlinear medium when the amplitude of the injected signal is above
some threshold value, the solitons are formed and they are propagating inside
the coupled nonlinear PCWs. Near field distributions of the light pulse
propagation inside the coupled nonlinear PCWs and the output powers of the
registered signals are studied in a detail. The amplification coefficient is
calculated at the various amplitudes of the launched signal. The results
vividly demonstrate the effectiveness of the weakly coupled nonlinear PCWs as
all-optical digital amplifier.
