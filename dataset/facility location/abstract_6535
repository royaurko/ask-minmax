A smart Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) is designed and developed for some
application specific missions to operate predominantly in hazardous
environments. In our work, we have developed a small and lightweight vehicle to
operate in general cross-country terrains in or without daylight. The UGV can
send visual feedbacks to the operator at a remote location. Onboard infrared
sensors can detect the obstacles around the UGV and sends signals to the
operator.
