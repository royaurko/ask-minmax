Ground-state electric quadrupole moment of 31Al (I =5/2+, T_1/2 = 644(25) ms)
has been measured by means of the beta-NMR spectroscopy using a spin-polarized
31Al beam produced in the projectile fragmentation reaction. The obtained Q
moment, |Q_exp(31Al)| = 112(32)emb, are in agreement with conventional shell
model calculations within the sd valence space. Previous result on the magnetic
moment also supports the validity of the sd model in this isotope, and thus it
is concluded that 31Al is located outside of the island of inversion.
