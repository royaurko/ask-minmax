Mobile devices have been shipped with multiple wireless network interfaces in
order to meet their diverse communication and networking demands. In this
paper, we propose an A-GPS assisted scheme that discovers the nearest Wi-Fi
network access points (APs) by using user's location information. This allows
the user to switch to the Wi-Fi interface in an intelligent manner when she/he
arrives at the nearest Wi-Fi network AP. Therefore, it avoids the long periods
in idle state and greatly reduces the number of unnecessary Wi-Fi scans on the
mobile device. The experimental results demonstrate that our scheme effectively
saves energy for mobile devices integrated with Wi-Fi and cellular interfaces.
