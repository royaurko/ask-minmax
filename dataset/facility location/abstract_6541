We investigate the thermodynamic stability of neutral black objects with (at
least) two angular momenta. We use the quasilocal formalism to compute the
grand canonical potential and show that the doubly spinning black ring is
thermodynamically unstable. We consider the thermodynamic instabilities of
ultra-spinning black objects and point out a subtle relation between the
microcanonical and grand canonical ensembles. We also find the location of the
black string/membrane phases of doubly spinning black objects.
