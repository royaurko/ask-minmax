Groups of young stars located in the solar neighborhood have recently
received a lot of attention. These stars, which are $\lesssim$ 10 million years
old, can provide insights into the birth of stars and planetary systems. For
example, the TW Hydrae Association is just at the age when planets are believed
to form, while MBM12 represents an earlier stage. In this Perspective, I
briefly discuss recent research in this field.
