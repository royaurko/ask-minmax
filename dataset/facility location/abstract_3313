Massive tori with $\approx 10^{8-9}M_{\odot}$ are predicted to extend on
$\sim $100 pc scale around the centre of elliptical galaxy progenitors by a
model of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth coeval to the spheroidal
population of the host galaxy. Direct detection of such massive tori would cast
light on a key physical condition that allows the rapid growth of SMBHs and the
appearance of QSOs at high redshift. For this reason, we examine the
detectability of such structures at substantial redshift with the Atacama Large
Millimeter Array (ALMA). We propose that submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) are the
best targets to test our predictions. In order to assess the observational
feasibility, we estimate the expected number counts of SMGs with massive tori
and check the detectability with the ALMA instrument, the unique facility which
can resolve the central region of high redshift objects. Our work shows that
ALMA will be able to resolve and detect high-$J$ ($J >$ 4) CO emissions from
$\sim$100 pc scale extended massive tori up to $z\approx2$. Observations of
lensed SMGs will yield excellent spatial resolution, allowing even to resolve
their massive tori at higher redshift. We discuss further the detectability of
the HCN molecule, as a better tracer of the high density gas expected in such
tori. The final goal of these kind of observations is to pinpoint possible
physical mechanisms that storage in the very central galactic regions very
large amount gas on timescale of several 10$^{8}$ yr.
