The Cygnus Loop is classified as a middle-aged supernova remnant (SNR)
located below the Galactic equator (l=74, b=-8.6) and 770 pc away from us. Its
large size and little confusion with Galactic emission makes it an ideal test
ground for evolutionary and structural theories of SNRs. New radio continuum
mapping of the Cygnus Loop at 2695 MHz with the Effelsberg 100-m telescope
provides indications that the Cygnus Loop consists of two separate SNRs.
Combining this result with data from the literature we argue that a secondary
SNR exists in the south with a recently detected neutron star close to its
center. Two interacting SNRs seem to be the best explanation to account for the
Cygnus Loop observations at all wavelengths.
