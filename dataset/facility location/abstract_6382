The stability of feedback systems consisting of linear time-delay plants and
PID controllers has been investigated for many years by means of several
methods, of which the Nyquist criterion, a generalization of the
Hermite-Biehler Theorem, and the root location method are well known. The main
purpose of these researches is to determine the range of controller parameters
that allow stability. Explicit and complete expressions of the boundaries of
these regions and computation procedures with a finite number of steps are now
available only for first-order plants, provided with one time delay. In this
note, the same results, based on Pontryagin's studies, are presented for
arbitrary-order plants.
