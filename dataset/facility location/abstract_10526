The pd break-up amplitude in the Faddeev scheme is calculated by employing a
three-dimensional method without partial wave decomposition (PWD). In a first
step and in view of higher energies only the leading term is evaluated and this
for the process d(p,n)pp. A comparison with the results based on PWD reveals
discrepancies in the cross section around 200 MeV. This indicates the onset of
a limitation of the partial wave scheme. Also, around 200 MeV relativistic
effects are clearly visible and the use of relativistic kinematics shifts the
cross section peak to where the experimental peak is located. The theoretical
peak height, however, is wrong and calls first of all for the inclusion of
rescattering terms, which are shown to be important in a nonrelativistic full
Faddeev calculation in PWD.
