We have obtained V and I-band photometry for about 17500 stars in the field
of the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC3109, located in the outskirts of the Local
Group. The photometry allows us to study the stellar populations present inside
and outside the disk of this galaxy. From the VI color-magnitude diagram we
infer metallicities and ages for the stellar populations in the main body and
in the halo of NGC3109. The stars in the disk of this galaxy have a wide
variety of ages, including very young stars with approximately 10^7 yr. Our
main result is to establish the presence of a halo consisting of population II
stars, extending out to about 4.5 arcmin (or 1.8 kpc) above and below the plane
of this galaxy. For these old stars we derive an age of > 10 Gyr and a
metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.8 +/- 0.2. We construct a deep luminosity function,
obtaining an accurate distance modulus (m-M)_0 = 25.62 +/- 0.1 for this galaxy
based on the I-magnitude of the red giant branch (RGB) tip and adopting E(V-I)
= 0.05.
