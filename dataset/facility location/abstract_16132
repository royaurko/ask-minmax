We consider a branching-selection particle system on $\Z$ with $N \geq 1$
particles. During a branching step, each particle is replaced by two new
particles, whose positions are shifted from that of the original particle by
independently performing two random walk steps according to the distribution $p
\delta_{1} + (1-p) \delta_{0}$, from the location of the original particle.
During the selection step that follows, only the N rightmost particles are kept
among the 2N particles obtained at the branching step, to form a new population
of $N$ particles. After a large number of iterated branching-selection steps,
the displacement of the whole population of $N$ particles is ballistic, with
deterministic asymptotic speed $v_{N}(p)$. As $N$ goes to infinity, $v_{N}(p)$
converges to a finite limit $v_{\infty}(p)$. The main result is that, for every
$0<p<1/2$, as $N$ goes to infinity, the order of magnitude of the difference
$v_{\infty}(p)- v_{N}(p)$ is $\log(N)^{-2}$. This is called Brunet-Derrida
behavior in reference to the 1997 paper by E. Brunet and B. Derrida "Shift in
the velocity of a front due to a cutoff" (see the reference within the paper),
where such a behavior is established for a similar branching-selection particle
system, using both numerical simulations and heuristic arguments.
