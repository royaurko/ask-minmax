We demonstrate experimentally that the spectral broadening of CW
supercontinuum can be controlled by using photonic crystal fibers with two
zero-dispersion wavelengths pumped by an Yb fiber laser at 1064 nm. The
spectrum is bounded by two dispersive waves whose spectral location depends on
the two zero-dispersion wavelengths of the fiber. The bandwidth of the
generated spectrum and the spectral power density may thus be tailored for
particular applications, such as high-resolution optical coherence tomography
or optical spectroscopy.
