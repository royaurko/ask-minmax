A laser facility based on a linear image sensor with a sampling period of
100microseconds allows to investigate the dissipative dynamics of a vibrated
granular matter under gravity. The laser reveals the vertical movement of an
individual Zirconia-Ytria stabilized 2mm ball at the surface of a weakly
excited 3D granular matter bed. The stochastic realizations are measured from
the top of the container. Then, power spectra measurements reveal the different
cooperative dynamics of the fluidized gap. We also carried out measurements for
one steel ball and many balls in 1D and 3D systems. We fit the measured
different regimes with generalized Langevin pictures. We introduce a fractional
temporal operator to characterize the ensemble of dissipative particles which
cannot be represented by a single Langevin particle in a complex fluid.
