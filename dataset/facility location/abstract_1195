The Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST) is a concept
for an 8-meter to 16-meter UVOIR space observatory for launch in the 2025-2030
era. ATLAST will allow astronomers to answer fundamental questions at the
forefront of modern astronphysics, including "Is there life elsewhere in the
Galaxy?" We present a range of science drivers that define the main performance
requirements for ATLAST (8 to 16 milliarcsec angular resolution, diffraction
limited imaging at 0.5 {\mu}m wavelength, minimum collecting area of 45 square
meters, high sensitivity to light wavelengths from 0.1 {\mu}m to 2.4 {\mu}m,
high stability in wavefront sensing and control). We will also discuss the
synergy between ATLAST and other anticipated future facilities (e.g., TMT,
EELT, ALMA) and the priorities for technology development that will enable the
construction for a cost that is comparable to current generation
observatory-class space missions.
