We determined the curvature of the phase transition line in the mu-T plane
using a Taylor expansion in mu. The Polyakov loop and the strange quark number
susceptibility were measured to locate the pseudocritical line. The analysis
was carried out on Nt=4,6,8,10 lattices generated with a Symanzik improved
gauge and stout-link improved (2+1) flavour staggered fermion action using
physical quark masses.
