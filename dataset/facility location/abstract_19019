We have compared the radio emission from a sample of parsec-scale AGN jets as
measured by the VLBA at 15 GHz, with their associated gamma-ray properties that
are reported in the Fermi LAT 3-month bright source list. We find in our
radio-selected sample that the gamma-ray photon flux correlates well with the
quasi-simultaneously measured compact radio flux density. The LAT-detected jets
in our radio-selected complete sample generally have higher compact radio flux
densities, and their parsec-scale cores are brighter (i.e., have higher
brightness temperature) than the jets in the LAT non-detected objects. This
suggests that the jets of bright gamma-ray AGN have preferentially higher
Doppler-boosting factors. In addition, AGN jets tend to be found in a more
active radio state within several months from LAT-detection of their strong
gamma-ray emission. This result becomes more pronounced for confirmed gamma-ray
flaring sources. We identify the parsec-scale radio core as a likely location
for both the gamma-ray and radio flares, which appear within typical timescales
of up to a few months of each other.
