The machines and beamlines controlled by VME industrial networks are very
popular in accelerator faculties. Recently new software technology, among of
which are Internet/Intranet application, Java language, and distributed
calculating environment, changes the control manner rapidly. A program based on
DCOM is composed to control of a variable included angle spherical grating
monochromator beamline at National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) in
China. The control computer with a residential DCOM program is connected to
Intranet by LAN, over which the user-end-operating program located in another
computer sends driving beamline units' commands to the control computer. And
also a web page coded in Java, published by the WWW service running in the
control computer, is simply illustrated how to use web browser to query the
states of or to control the beamline units.
