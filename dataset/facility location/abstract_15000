We present the preliminary results of a wide-field photometric survey of
individual red giant branch (RGB) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in
the M81 group, performed with the CFH12K mosaic camera of the CFHT. We use deep
VI images of 0.65 sq. deg. of sky to map out the two-dimensional distribution
of intragroup stars and to search for stars associated with the many HI tidal
tails in the group. We place an upper limit on the presence of metal-poor RGB
stars in a field located 50-80 kpc from M81, and derive an `intragroup'
fraction of <2%. In a field sampling the M81-NGC3077 HI tidal tail, we find
blue stars associated with some of the tidal features, including 2 clumps which
we tentatively describe as tidal dwarf candidates. These objects are ~1 kpc in
size, and, based on their color-magnitude diagrams, have formed stars as
recently as ~30-70 Myr ago, long after the group's most recent interactions.
