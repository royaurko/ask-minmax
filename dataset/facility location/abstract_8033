A Chandra ACIS-S observation of PKS 2152-699 reveals thermal emission from a
diffuse region around the core and a hotspot located 10" northeast from the
core. This is the first detection of thermal X-ray radiation on kiloparsec
scales from an extragalactic radio source. Two other hotspots located 47"
north-northeast and 26" southwest from the core were also detected. Using a
Raymond-Smith model, the first hotspot can be characterized with a thermal
plasma temperature of 2.6$\times10^6$ K and an electron number density of 0.17
cm$^{-3}$. These values correspond to a cooling time of about 1.6$\times10^7$
yr. In addition, an emission line from the hotspot, possibly Fe xxv, was
detected at rest wavelength 10.04\AA.
  The thermal X-ray emission from the first hotspot is offset from the radio
emission but is coincident with optical filaments detected with broadband
filters of HST/WFPC2. The best explanation for the X-ray, radio, and optical
emission is that of a `jet-cloud' interaction.
  The diffuse emission around the nucleus of PKS 2152-699 can be modeled as a
thermal plasma with a temperature of 1.2$\times10^7$ K and a luminosity of
1.8$\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This emission appears to be asymmetric with a
small extension toward Hotspot A, similar to a jet. An optical hotspot (EELR)
is seen less than an arcsecond away from this extension in the direction of the
core. This indicates that the extension may be caused by the jet interacting
with an inner ISM cloud, but entrainment of hot gas is unavoidable. Future
observations are discussed.
