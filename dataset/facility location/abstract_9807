We report the continuous or pulsed loading of a slow and cold atomic beam
into a magnetic guide. In order to optimize the transfer into the guide, we
have studied two coupling schemes. The first one is based on an auxiliary
two-dimensional MOT that confines the atoms transversally before they enter the
guide. However, for low atomic velocities, the atoms are strongly heated in the
longitudinal direction. This limitation does not occur in the second coupling
scheme which relies on magnetic confinement in the transfer zone. For this
purpose, we have constructed a miniature magnetic guide located between the
atomic source and the long magnetic guide. The latter scheme allows to inject
atoms with velocities down to 70 cm/s into the guide.
