We are continuing a J, K and narrow-band imaging survey of 300 square degrees
of the plane of the Galaxy, searching for new Wolf-Rayet stars. Our survey
spans 150 degrees in Galactic longitude and reaches 1 degree above and below
the Galactic plane. The survey has a useful limiting magnitude of K = 15 over
most of the observed Galactic plane, and K = 14 (due to severe crowding) within
a few degrees of the Galactic center. Thousands of emission line candidates
have been detected. In spectrographic follow-ups of 146 relatively bright WR
star candidates we have re-examined 11 previously known WC and WN stars and
discovered 71 new WR stars, 17 of type WN and 54 of type WC. Our latest image
analysis pipeline now picks out WR stars with a 57% success rate. Star subtype
assignments have been confirmed with K band spectra, and distances approximated
using the method of spectroscopic parallax. Some of the new WR stars are
amongst the most distant known in our Galaxy. The distribution of these new WR
stars is beginning to trace the locations of massive stars along the distant
spiral arms of the Milky Way.
