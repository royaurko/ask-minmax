We study center vortex free energies and 't Hooft's electric fluxes on the
lattice in 2+1 dimensions, where SU(2) for example, is in the universality
class of the 2d Ising model. This places a wealth of exact results at our
fingertips. In particular, spacelike center vortices in SU(2) near criticality
correspond to spin interfaces in the 2d Ising model, whose universal scaling
functions are known exactly. We exploit this to locate the deconfinement
transition with unprecedented precision and subsequently for a finite size
scaling analysis, where the self-duality of the $2d$ spin model is reflected in
a duality between the spacelike vortices and confining electric fluxes. The
corresponding relation between the string tension and its dual in the high
temperature phase is arguably the simplest example of a universal amplitude
ratio. Around the transition, both can be efficiently extracted from the exact
results with a global one-parameter fit which allows straightforward continuum
extrapolation.
