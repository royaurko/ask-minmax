Molecular clouds are expected to emit non-thermal radiation due to cosmic ray
interactions in the dense magnetized gas. Such emission is amplified if a cloud
is located close to an accelerator of cosmic rays and if energetic particles
can leave the accelerator site and diffusively reach the cloud. We consider
here the situation in which a molecular cloud is located in the proximity of a
supernova remnant which is efficiently accelerating cosmic rays and gradually
releasing them in the interstellar medium. We calculate the multiwavelength
spectrum from radio to gamma rays which is emerging from the cloud as the
result of cosmic ray interactions. The total energy output is dominated by the
gamma ray emission, which can exceed the emission in other bands by an order of
magnitude or more. This suggests that some of the unidentified TeV sources
detected so far, with no obvious or very weak counterparts in other
wavelengths, might be in fact associated with clouds illuminated by cosmic rays
coming from a nearby source. Moreover, under certain conditions, the gamma ray
spectrum exhibit a concave shape, being steep at low energies and hard at high
energies. This fact might have important implications for the studies of the
spectral compatibility of GeV and TeV gamma ray sources.
