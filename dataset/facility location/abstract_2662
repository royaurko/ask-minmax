The outpatients department in a developing country is typically understaffed
and inadequately equipped to handle a large numbers of patients filing through
on an average day. The use of electronic medical record (EMR) systems can
resolve some of the longstanding medical inefficiencies common in developing
countries. This paper presents the design and implementation of a proposed
outpatient management system that enables efficient management of a patient's
medical details. We present a system to create appointments with medical
practitioners by integrating a proposed Android-based mobile application with a
selected open source EMR system. The application allows both the patient and
the medical practitioners to manage appointments and make use of the electronic
messaging facility to send reminders when the appointed time is approaching in
real-time. A mobile application prototype is developed and the road map for
implementation is also discussed.
