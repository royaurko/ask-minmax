We report the detection of high-energy gamma-ray emission from two starburst
galaxies using data obtained with the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Steady point-like emission above 200 MeV has been
detected at significance levels of 6.8 sigma and 4.8 sigma respectively, from
sources positionally coincident with locations of the starburst galaxies M82
and NGC 253. The total fluxes of the sources are consistent with gamma-ray
emission originating from the interaction of cosmic rays with local
interstellar gas and radiation fields and constitute evidence for a link
between massive star formation and gamma-ray emission in star-forming galaxies.
