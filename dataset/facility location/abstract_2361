A compact X-ray Free Electron Laser (SwissFEL) is under development at the
Paul Scherrer Institute. To increase facility efficiency the main linac will
operate in two electron bunch mode. The two bunches are separated in time by 28
ns and sent to two undulator lines. The combination of two beam lines should
produce short X-ray pulses covering wavelength range from 1 to 70 {\AA} with
submicron position stability. To separate the two bunches, a novel electron
beam switching system is being developed. The total deflection is achieved with
a combination of high Q-factor resonant deflector magnet, followed by a DC
septum magnet. The shot-to-shot deflection stability of the entire switching
system should be <+/-10 ppm in amplitude and +/-100 ps in time, values which
present severe measurement difficulties. Deflection magnets requirements,
development and results of the kicker prototype are presented.
