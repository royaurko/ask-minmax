Granular superconductivity occurs when microscopic superconducting grains are
separated by non-superconducting regions through which they communicate by
Josephson tunneling to establish the macroscopic superconducting state [1].
Although crystals of the cuprate high-Tc superconductors are not granular in a
structural sense, theory indicates that at low hole densities the holes can
become concentrated at some locations resulting in hole-rich superconducting
domains [2-5]. Granular superconductivity due to Josephson tunneling through
'undoped' regions between such domains would represent a new paradigm for the
underdoped cuprates. Here we report studies of the spatial interrelationships
between STM tunneling spectra in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x. They reveal an
apparent spatial segregation of the electronic structure into ~3nm diameter
domains (with superconducting characteristics and local energy gap delta<50
meV) in an electronically distinct background. To explore whether this
represents nanoscale segregation of two distinct electronic phases, we employ
scattering-resonances at Ni impurity atoms [6] as 'markers' for the local
existence of superconductivity [7-9]. No Ni-resonances are detected in any
regions where delta>50(2.5) meV. These observations suggest that underdoped
Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x is a mixture of two different short-range electronic orders
with the long-range characteristics of a granular superconductor.
