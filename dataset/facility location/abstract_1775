Lambda-hypernuclei are produced and studied, with the FINUDA spectrometer,
for the first time at an e+e- collider: DAPHNE, the Frascati phi-factory. The
slow negative kaons from phi(1020) decay are stopped in thin (0.2 g/cm^2)
nuclear targets, and Lambda-hypernuclei formation is detected by measuring the
momentum of the outgoing pi^-. A preliminary analysis on 12Lambda-C shows an
energy resolution of 1.29 MeV FWHM on the hypernuclear levels, the best
obtained so far with magnetic spectrometers at hadron facilities. Capture rates
for the ground state and the excited ones are reported, and compared with
previous experiments.
