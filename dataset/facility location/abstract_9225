The detection and characterization of accretion processes in the disks
surrounding young stars may be directly relevant to studies of planet
formation. Especially the study of systems with very low accretion rates (<<
10^{-10} M_sun yr^{-1}) is important, since at those rates radial mixing
becomes inefficient and disk material will have to be dissipated into larger
bodies at its present location. In these proceedings, we compare the different
methods of tracing accretion onto Herbig Ae/Be stars and conclude that
high-resolution infrared spectroscopy is currently the only reliable method
that offers the required sensitivity to shed light on this problem.
