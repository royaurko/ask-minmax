We experimentally verified the phenomena of photonic jets generated by
plane-electromagnetic-wave-illuminated dielectric micro-cylinders with diameter
comparable to the corresponding wavelength at microwave frequencies. Using a
home-made 2D spatial field mapping system, we carried out a point-by-point
measurement of both phase and intensity of spatial electric field distribution
inside and around scattering cylinders, providing a clear complete
electromagnetic field picture for these phenomena. Correspondingly, the
theoretically predicted super-enhancement of the backscattering induced by
small particles of deeply-subwavelength size located within the photonic jets
was also confirmed. Our measurements agreed well with the numerical
simulations, indicating that the photonic jets indeed can provide a promising
powerful way for deeply subwavelength detection and imaging.
