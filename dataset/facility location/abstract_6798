Nonlinear wave run-up on the beach caused by harmonic wave maker located at
some distance from the shore line is studied experimentally. It is revealed
that under certain wave excitation frequencies a significant increase in run-up
amplification is observed. It is found that this amplification is due to the
excitation of resonant mode in the region between the shoreline and wave maker.
Frequency and magnitude of the maximum amplification are in good correlation
with the numerical calculation results represented in the paper (T.S.
Stefanakis et al. PRL (2011)). These effects are very important for
understanding the nature of rougue waves in the coastle zone.
