A survey of young bipolar outflows in regions of low-to-intermediate-mass
star formation has been carried out in two class I methanol maser transitions:
7_0-6_1A+ at 44 GHz and 4_{-1}-3_0E at 36 GHz. We detected narrow features
towards NGC 1333I2A, NGC 1333I4A, HH25MMS, and L1157 at 44 GHz, and towards NGC
2023 at 36 GHz. Flux densities of the lines detected at 44 GHz are no higher
than 11 Jy and the relevant source luminosities are about 10^{22} erg s{-1},
which is much lower than those of strong masers in high-mass star formation
regions. No emission was found towards 39 outflows. All masers detected at 44
GHz are located in clouds with methanol column densities of the order of or
larger than a few x 10^{14} cm$^{-2}. The upper limits for the non-detections
are typically of the order of 3--5 Jy. Observations in 2004, 2006, and 2008 did
not reveal any significant variability of the 44 GHz masers in NGC 1333I4A,
HH25MMS, and L1157.
