We examine the prospects for observations of CMB anisotropy with the SKA; we
discuss the advantages of interferometric SKA imaging, observing strategies,
calibration issues and the achievable sensitivity. Although the SKA will
probably operate at cm wavelengths, where discrete source confusion dominates
the CMB anisotropy, its extreme sensitivity to point sources will make it
possible to subtract the source contamination at these wavelengths and thereby
image the low surface brightness CMB anisotropies on small angular scales. The
SKA, operating at 10-20 GHz, may usefully make high-l observations of the CMB
anisotropy spectrum and survey the sky for Sunyaev-Zeldovich decrements.
