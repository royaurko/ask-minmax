The near threshold total cross section and angular distributions of K+K- pair
production via the reaction pp --> ppK+K- have been studied at an excess energy
of Q = 17 MeV using the COSY-11 facility at the cooler synchrotron COSY. The
obtained cross section as well as an upper limit at an excess energy of Q = 3
MeV represent the first measurements on the K+K- production in the region of
small excess energies where production via the channel pp --> pp Phi --> ppK+K-
is energetically forbidden. The possible influence of a resonant production via
intermediate scalar states f0(980) and a0(980) is discussed.
