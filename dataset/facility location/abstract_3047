If stiff inclusions are closely located, then the stress, which is the
gradient of the solution, may become arbitrarily large as the distance between
two inclusions tends to zero. In this paper we investigate the asymptotic
behavior of the stress concentration factor, which is the normalized magnitude
of the stress concentration, as the distance between two inclusions tends to
zero. For that purpose we show that the gradient of the solution to the case
when two inclusions are touching decays exponentially fast near the touching
point. We also prove a similar result when two inclusions are closely located
and there is no potential difference on boundaries of two inclusions. We then
use these facts to show that the stress concentration factor converges to a
certain integral of the solution to the touching case as the distance between
two inclusions tends to zero. We then present an efficient way to compute this
integral.
