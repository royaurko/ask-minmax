The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has brought the study of spin
effects in hadronic collisions to a new energy regime. In conjunction with
other experiments at facilities around the world, much can be learned from the
high-energy polarized proton collisions RHIC provides, allowing the collider to
serve as a powerful tool to continue to understand the rich subtleties and
surprises of spin effects in QCD, some of which were originally discovered more
than three decades ago.
