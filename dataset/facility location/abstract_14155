We present deep, 170 ks, Chandra X-ray observations of Abell 2219 (z=0.23)
one of the hottest and most X-ray luminous clusters known, and which is
experiencing a major merger event. We discover a 'horseshoe' of high
temperature gas surrounding the ram-pressure-stripped, bright, hot, X-ray
cores. We confirm an X-ray shock front located north-west of the X-ray centroid
and along the projected merger axis. We also find a second shock front to the
south-east of the X-ray centroid making this only the second cluster where both
the shock and reverse shock are confirmed with X-ray temperature measurements.
We also present evidence for a sloshing cold front in the 'remnant tail' of one
of the sub-cluster cores. The cold front and north-west shock front
geometrically bound the radio halo and appear to be directly influencing the
radio properties of the cluster.
