As part of a project to develop more accurate estimates of the risks due to
tropical cyclones, we describe a non-parametric method for the statistical
simulation of the location of tropical cyclone genesis. The method avoids the
use of arbitrary grid boxes, and the spatial smoothing of the historical data
is constructed optimally according to a clearly defined merit function.
