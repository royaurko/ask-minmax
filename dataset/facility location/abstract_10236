Where is the long--awaited one? A supersymmetric neutralino has been a
favored candidate for the WIMP dark matter but, so far, it has not been found.
One way to locate it is to identify where it can be hiding in the vast
supersymmetric parameter space. A combination of theoretical, experimental and
cosmological constraints leads to remarkably well--defined allowed regions
which favor lighter neutralino, and other superpartner, mass ranges.
Nevertheless the neutralino can still be as heavy as roughly $800\gev$. The
resulting scalar direct detection cross sections range from some $10^{-7}$ pb
down to $10^{-10}$ pb, which is at least one order of magnitude below the
sensitivity of today's experiments but which will be almost fully explored by a
new generation of planned detectors.
