We present the results of global analyses of short-baseline neutrino
oscillation data in 3+1, 3+2 and 3+1+1 neutrino mixing schemes. We show that
the data do not allow us to abandon the simplest 3+1 scheme in favor of the
more complex 3+2 and 3+1+1 schemes. We present the allowed region in the 3+1
parameter space, which is located at $\Delta{m}^2_{41}$ between 0.82 and 2.19
$\text{eV}^2$ at $3\sigma$. The case of no oscillations is disfavored by about
$6\sigma$, which decreases dramatically to about $2\sigma$ if the LSND data are
not considered. Hence, new high-precision experiments are needed to check the
LSND signal.
