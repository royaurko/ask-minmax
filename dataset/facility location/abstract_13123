To investigate the possible cooling of the corona by soft X-rays bursts, we
have studied 114 bursts embedded in the known X-ray evolution of 4U 1636-536.
We have grouped these bursts according to the ratio of the flux in the 1.5--12
keV band with respect to that in the 15--50 keV band, as monitored by RXTE/ASM
and Swift/BAT, respectively. We have detected a shortage at hard X-rays while
bursting. This provides hints for a corona cooling process driven by soft
X-rays fed by the bursts that occurred on the surface of neutron star. The flux
shortage at 30--50 keV has a time lag of 2.4$\pm$1.5 seconds with respect to
that at 2--10 keV, which is comparable to that of 0.7$\pm$0.5 seconds reported
in bursts of IGR 17473-2721. We comment on the possible origin of these
phenomena and on the implications for the models on the location of the corona.
