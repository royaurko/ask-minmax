Given a series of photographs taken during a Go game, we describe the
techniques we successfully employ for pinpointing the grid lines of the Go
board and for tracking their small movements between consecutive photographs;
then we discuss how to approximate the location and orientation of the
observer's point of view, in order to compensate for projection effects.
Finally we describe the different criteria that jointly form the algorithm for
stones' detection, thus enabling us to automatically reconstruct the whole move
sequence.
