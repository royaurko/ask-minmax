NGC 3576 (G291.28-0.71; l=291.3o, b=-0.7o) and NGC 3603 (G291.58-0.43;
l=291.6o, b=-0.5o) are optically visible, luminous HII regions located at
distances of 3.0 kpc and 6.1 kpc, respectively. We present 3.4 cm Australian
Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) observations of these two sources in the
continuum and the H90a, He90a, C90a and H113b recombination lines with an
angular resolution of 7" and a velocity resolution of 2.6 km/s. All four
recombination lines are detected in the integrated profiles of the two sources.
Broad radio recombination lines are detected in both NGC 3576 (DV_{FWHM}>= 50
km/s) and NGC 3603 (DV_{FWHM}>=70 km/s). In NGC 3576 a prominent N-S velocity
gradient (~30 km/s/pc) is observed, and a clear temperature gradient (6000 K to
8000 K) is found from east to west, consistent with a known IR color gradient
in the source. In NGC 3603, the H90a, He90a and the H113b lines are detected
from 13 individual sources. The Y^+ (He/H) ratios in the two sources range from
0.08+/-0.04 to 0.26+/-0.10. We compare the morphology and kinematics of the
ionized gas at 3.4 cm with the distribution of stars, 10 micron emission and
H_2O, OH, and CH_3OH maser emission. These comparisons suggest that both NGC
3576 and NGC 3603 have undergone sequential star formation.
