We have mapped the Helix (NGC 7293) planetary nebula (PN) with the IRAC
instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope. The Helix is one of the closest
bright PN, and therefore provides an opportunity to resolve the small-scale
structure in the nebula. The emission from this PN in the 5.8 and 8 micron IRAC
bands is dominated by the pure rotational lines of molecular hydrogen, with a
smaller contribution from forbidden line emission such as [Ar III] in the
ionized region. The IRAC images resolve the "cometary knots" which have been
previously studied in this PN. The "tails" of the knots and the radial rays
extending into the outer regions of the PN are seen in emission in the IRAC
bands. IRS spectra on the main ring and the emission in the IRAC bands are
consistent with shock-excited H2 models, with a small (~10%) component from
photodissociation regions. In the Northeast Arc, the H2 emission is located in
a shell outside of the H alpha emission.
