APECS is the distributed control system of the new Atacama Pathfinder
EXperiment (APEX) telescope located on the Llano de Chajnantor at an altitude
of 5107 m in the Atacama desert in northern Chile. APECS is based on Atacama
Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) software and employs a modern, object-oriented
design using the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) as the
middleware. New generic device interfaces simplify adding instruments to the
control system. The Python based observer command scripting language allows
using many existing software libraries and facilitates creating more complex
observing modes. A new self-descriptive raw data format (Multi-Beam FITS or
MBFITS) has been defined to store the multi-beam, multi-frequency data. APECS
provides an online pipeline for initial calibration, observer feedback and a
quick-look display. APECS is being used for regular science observations in
local and remote mode since August 2005.
