We report a pronounced peak effect in the magnetization and the
magnetocaloric coefficient in a single crystal of the superconductor Nb3Sn. As
the origin of the magnetization peak effect in classical type-II
superconductors is still strongly debated, we performed an investigation of its
underlying thermodynamics. Calorimetric experiments performed during field
sweeps at constant temperatures reveal that the sharp increase in the current
density occurs concurrently with additional degrees of freedom in the specific
heat due to thermal fluctuations and a liquid vortex phase. No latent heat due
to a direct first-order melting of a Bragg glass phase into the liquid phase is
found which we take as evidence for an intermediate glass phase with enhanced
flux pinning. The Bragg glass phase can however be restored by a small AC
field. In this case a first-order vortex melting transition with a clear
hysteresis is found. In the absence of an AC field the intermediate glass phase
is located within the field range of this hysteresis. This indicates that the
peak effect is associated with the metastability of an underlying first-order
vortex melting transition.
