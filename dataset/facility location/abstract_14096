A planned rapid submillimeter (submm) Gamma Ray Burst (GRBs) follow-up
observations conducted using the Greenland Telescope (GLT) is presented. The
GLT is a 12-m submm telescope to be located at the top of the Greenland ice
sheet, where the high-altitude and dry weather porvides excellent conditions
for observations at submm wavelengths. With its combination of wavelength
window and rapid responding system, the GLT will explore new insights on GRBs.
Summarizing the current achievements of submm GRB follow-ups, we identify the
following three scientific goals regarding GRBs: (1) systematic detection of
bright submm emissions originating from reverse shock (RS) in the early
afterglow phase, (2) characterization of forward shock and RS emissions by
capturing their peak flux and frequencies and performing continuous monitoring,
and (3) detections of GRBs as a result of the explosion of first-generation
stars result of GRBs at a high redshift through systematic rapid follow ups.
The light curves and spectra calculated by available theoretical models clearly
show that the GLT could play a crucial role in these studies.
