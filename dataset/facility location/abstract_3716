The sensitivity of inertial confinement fusion implosions of the type
performed on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) to low-mode flux asymmetries
has been investigated numerically. It is shown that large-amplitude, low-order
mode shapes (Legendre polynomial P4), resulting from associated low order flux
asymmetries, cause spatial variations in capsule and fuel momentum that prevent
the DT ice layer from being decelerated uniformly by the hot spot pressure.
This reduces the transfer of kinetic to internal energy of the central hot
spot, thus reducing neutron yield. Furthermore, synthetic gated x-ray images of
the hot spot self-emission indicate that P4 shapes may be unquantifiable for DT
layered capsules. Instead the positive P4 asymmetry aliases itself as an oblate
P4 in the x-ray self emission images. Correction of this apparent P2 distortion
can further distort the implosion while creating a round x-ray image. Long
wavelength asymmetries may be playing a significant role in the observed yield
reduction of NIF DT implosions relative to detailed post-shot 2D simulations.
