We report on the optical identification of the companion star to the
eclipsing millisecond pulsar PSR J1824-2452H in the galactic globular cluster
M28 (NGC 6626). This star is at only 0.2" from the nominal position of the
pulsar and it shows optical variability (~ 0.25 mag) that nicely correlates
with the pulsar orbital period. It is located on the blue side of the cluster
main sequence, ~1.5 mag fainter than the turn-off point. The observed light
curve shows two distinct and asymmetric minima, suggesting that the companion
star is suffering tidal distortion from the pulsar. This discovery increases
the number of non-degenerate MSP companions optically identified so far in
globular clusters (4 out of 7), suggesting that these systems could be a common
outcome of the pulsar recycling process, at least in dense environments where
they can be originated by exchange interactions.
