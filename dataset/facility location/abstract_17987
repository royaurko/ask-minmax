We discuss a possible answer to the fundamental question of why nature would
actually prefer low-scale supersymmetry, but end up with a supersymmetry scale
that is not completely natural. This question is inevitable if we postulate
that low-energy supersymmetry is indeed realized in nature, despite the null
observation of superparticles below a TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. As we
argue in this paper, superparticles masses in the multi-TeV range can, in fact,
be reconciled with the concept of naturalness by means of a cosmological
selection effect--a selection effect based on the assumption of an exact
discrete R-symmetry that is spontaneously broken by gaugino condensation in a
pure supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. In such theories, the dynamical scale of
the Yang-Mills gauge interactions is required to be higher than the
inflationary Hubble scale, in order to avoid the formation of domain walls.
This results in a lower limit on the superparticle masses and leads us to
conclude that, according to the idea of naturalness, the most probable range of
superparticle masses is potentially located at the multi-TeV, if the
inflationary Hubble rate is of O(10^{14}) GeV. Our argument can be partially
tested by future measurements of the tensor fraction in the Cosmic Microwave
Background fluctuations.
