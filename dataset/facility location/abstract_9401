We explore the nature of the faint blue objects in the Hubble Deep Field
South. We have derived proper motions for the point sources in the Hubble Deep
Field South using a 3 year baseline. Combining our proper motion measurements
with spectral energy distribution fitting enabled us to identify 4 quasars and
42 stars, including 3 white dwarf candidates. Two of these white dwarf
candidates, HDFS 1444 and 895, are found to display significant proper motion,
21.1 $\pm$ 7.9 mas/yr and 34.9 $\pm$ 8.0 mas/yr, and are consistent with being
thick disk or halo white dwarfs located at ~2 kpc. The other faint blue objects
analyzed by Mendez & Minniti do not show any significant proper motion and are
inconsistent with being halo white dwarfs; they do not contribute to the
Galactic dark matter. The observed population of stars and white dwarfs is
consistent with standard Galactic models.
