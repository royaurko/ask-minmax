The option to install two injectors is foreseen at the European XFEL
Facility. The injectors will be located on top of each other in the same
building, both with the offset of 2.75 m with respect to the main linac axis.
The translation system (dogleg) from the injector axis to the main linac axis
has to fulfill very tight requirements of the chromatic properties, because the
energy chirp required for the downstream bunch length compression in magnetic
chicanes will be created upstream in the injector linac. In this paper we
present such an large energy acceptance dogleg and discuss the optical
principles which form the basis of its design.
