Monte Carlo simulations have been performed in order to evaluate the
efficiencies of several light ions identification techniques. The detection
system was composed with layers of scintillating material to measure either the
deposited energy or the time-of-flight of ions produced by nuclear reactions
between 12C projectiles and a PMMA target. Well known techniques such as
(DELTA) E--Range, (DELTA) E--E--ToF and (DELTA)E--E are presented and their
particle identification efficiencies are compared one to another regarding the
generated charge and mass of the particle to be identified. The simulations
allowed to change the beam energy matching the ones proposed in an hadron
therapy facility, namely from 95 to 400 MeV/A.
