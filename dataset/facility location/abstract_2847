It is, perhaps, surprising that the location of the unique supremum of a
stationary process on an interval can fail to be uniformly distributed over
that interval. We show that this distribution is absolutely continuous in the
interior of the interval and describe very specific conditions the density has
to satisfy. We establish universal upper bounds on the density and demonstrate
their optimality.
