We present one of the most precise measurement to date of the spatial
clustering of X-ray selected AGNs using a sample derived from the Chandra X-ray
Observatory survey in the Bootes field. The real-space two-point correlation
function over a redshift interval from z=0.17 to z~3 is well described by the
power law, xi(r)=(r/r0)^-gamma, for comoving separations r<~20h^-1 Mpc. We find
gamma=1.84+-0.12 and r0 consistent with no redshift trend within the sample
(varying between r0=5.5+-0.6 h^-1 Mpc for <z>=0.37 and r0=6.9+-1.0 h^-1 Mpc for
<z>=1.28). Further, we are able to measure the projections of the two-point
correlation function both on the sky plane and in the line of sight. We use
these measurements to show that the Chandra/Bootes AGNs are predominantly
located at the centers of dark matter halos with the circular velocity Vmax>320
km/s or M_200 > 4.1e12 h^-1 Msun, and tend to avoid satellite galaxies in halos
of this or higher mass. The halo occupation properties inferred from the
clustering properties of Chandra/Bootes AGNs --- the mass scale of the parent
dark matter halos, the lack of significant redshift evolution of the clustering
length, and the low satellite fraction --- are broadly consistent with the
Hopkins et al. scenario of quasar activity triggered by mergers of
similarly-sized galaxies.
