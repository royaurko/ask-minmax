We report on the discovery of recently ionized hydrogen-deficient gas in the
immediate circumstellar environment of the final helium shell flash star V4334
Sgr (Sakurai's object). On spectra obtained with FORS2 multi-object
spectroscopy we have found spatially extended (about 2") emission from [N II],
[O I], [O II] and very faint Halpha and [S II]. In the [N II] (ll6548,83) lines
we have identified two components located at velocities -350 +/-50 and +200
+/-50 km/s, relative to V4334 Sgr itself. The full width of the [N II] l6583
feature at zero intensity corresponds to a velocity spread of about 1500 km/s.
Based on the available data it is not possible to conclusively determine the
mechanism of ionization. Both photo-ionization, from a rapidly evolving central
star, and shock excitation, as the result of the collision of the fast ouflows
with slower circumstellar matter, could account for the observed lines. The
central star is still hidden behind strong dust absorption, since only a faint
highly reddened continuum is apparent in the spectra. Theory states that it
will become hotter and will retrace its post-asymptotic giant branch evolution
towards the planetary nebula domain. Our detection of the ionized ejecta from
the very late helium shell flash marks the beginning of a new phase in this
star's amazingly rapid evolution.
