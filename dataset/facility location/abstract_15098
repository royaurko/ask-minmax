We study arrival directions of 1.4x10^6 extensive air showers (EAS)
registered with the EAS--1000 Prototype Array in the energy range 0.1--10 PeV.
By applying an iterative algorithm that provides uniform distribution of the
data with respect to sidereal time and azimuthal angles, we find a number of
zones with excessive flux of cosmic rays (CRs) at >=3 sigma level. We compare
locations of the zones with positions of galactic supernova remnants (SNRs),
pulsars, open star clusters, and regions of ionized hydrogen and find
remarkable coincidences, which may witness in favour of the hypothesis that
certain objects of these types, including the SNRs Cassiopeia A, the Crab
Nebula, the Monogem Ring and some other, provide a noticeable contribution to
the flux of CRs in the PeV range of energies. In addition, we find certain
signs of a contribution from the M33 galaxy and a number of comparatively
nearby groups of active galactic nuclei and interacting galaxies, in particular
those in the Virgo cluster of galaxies. The results also provide some hints for
a search of possible sources of ultra-high energy (UHE) cosmic rays and support
an earlier idea that a part of both UHE and PeV CRs may originate from the same
astrophysical objects.
