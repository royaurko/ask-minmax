We aim at resolving the circumstellar environment around beta Pic in the
near-infrared in order to study the inner planetary system (< 200 mas, i.e., ~4
AU). Precise interferometric fringe visibility measurements were obtained over
seven spectral channels dispersed across the H band with the four-telescope
VLTI/PIONIER interferometer. Thorough analysis of interferometric data was
performed to measure the stellar angular diameter and to search for
circumstellar material. We detected near-infrared circumstellar emission around
beta Pic that accounts for 1.37% +/- 0.16% of the near-infrared stellar flux
and that is located within the field-of-view of PIONIER (i.e., ~200 mas in
radius). The flux ratio between this excess and the photosphere emission is
shown to be stable over a period of 1 year and to vary only weakly across the H
band, suggesting that the source is either very hot (> 1500 K) or dominated by
the scattering of the stellar flux. In addition, we derived the limb-darkened
angular diameter of beta Pic with an unprecedented accuracy (theta_LD= 0.736
+/- 0.019 mas). The presence of a small H-band excess originating in the
vicinity of beta Pic is revealed for the first time thanks to the
high-precision visibilities enabled by VLTI/PIONIER. This excess emission is
likely due to the scattering of stellar light by circumstellar dust and/or the
thermal emission from a yet unknown population of hot dust, although hot gas
emitting in the continuum cannot be firmly excluded.
