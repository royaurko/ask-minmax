We propose a Plasma Accelerator Research Station (PARS) based at proposed FEL
test facility CLARA (Compact Linear Accelerator for Research and Applications)
at Daresbury Laboratory. The idea is to use the relativistic electron beam from
CLARA, to investigate some key issues in electron beam transport and in
electron beam driven plasma wakefield acceleration, e.g. high gradient plasma
wakefield excitation driven by a relativistic electron bunch, two bunch
experiment for CLARA beam energy doubling, high transformer ratio, long bunch
self-modulation and some other advanced beam dynamics issues. This paper
presents the feasibility studies of electron beam transport to meet the
requirements for beam driven wakefield acceleration and presents the plasma
wakefield simulation results based on CLARA beam parameters. Other possible
experiments which can be conducted at the PARS beam line are also discussed.
