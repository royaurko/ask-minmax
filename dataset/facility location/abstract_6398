We propose that in a system with pocket Fermi surfaces, a pairing state with
a finite total momentum q_tot like the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state
can be stabilized even without a magnetic field. When a pair is composed of
electrons on a pocket Fermi surface whose center is not located at Gamma point,
the pair inevitably has finite q_tot. To investigate this possibility, we
consider a two-orbital model on a square lattice that can realize pocket Fermi
surfaces and we apply fluctuation exchange approximation. Then, by changing the
electron number n per site, we indeed find that such superconducting states
with finite q_tot are stabilized when the system has pocket Fermi surfaces.
