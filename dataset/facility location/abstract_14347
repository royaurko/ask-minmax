Excitation and propagation of waves in a thermally stratified disk with an
arbitrary vertical temperature profile are studied. Previous analytical studies
of three-dimensional waves had been focused on either isothermal or polytropic
vertical disk structures. However, at the location in a protoplanetary disk
where the dominant heating source is stellar irradiation, the temperature
gradient may become positive in the vertical direction. We extend the analysis
to study the effects of the vertical temperature structure on the waves that
are excited at the Lindblad resonances. For a hotter disk atmosphere, the
$f$-mode contributes less to the torque and remains confined near the midplane
as it propagates away from the resonances. On the other hand, the excitation of
the $g$-modes is stronger. As they propagate, they channel to the top of disk
atmosphere and their group velocities decrease. The differences compared to
previous studies may have implications in understanding the wave dynamics in a
realistic disk structure.
