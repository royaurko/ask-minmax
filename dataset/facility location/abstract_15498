Recent analysis of stellar populations in barred galaxies have focused on the
spatial distribution of stellar population ages and metallicities. However,
barred galaxies are complex objects where dynamical instabilities play a
leading role in shaping any spatial distribution. The age distribution of
stellar populations should thus be analyzed from the two points of view of
stellar population evolution and dynamical secular evolution. Chemodynamical
simulations of single barred galaxies with simple but realistic star formation
and feedback recipes are used to produce face-on mass-weighted maps of stellar
population ages. Luminosity-weighted maps in V-band are also displayed after
calibrating the simulation with mass-to-light ratios provided by a synthesis
population model. It is shown that inside a stellar bar two persistent
diametrically opposed regions display a mean age lower than the surrounding
average. These two low-age regions are due to the accumulation of young stellar
populations trapped on elliptical-like orbits along the bar, near the
ultra-harmonic resonance. Age gradients along the bar major-axis are comparable
to recent observations. Another low-age region is the outer ring located near
the Outer Lindblad Resonance, but the presence and strength of this structure
is very time-dependent.
