Putative global minima of sodium clusters with up to 380 atoms have been
located for two model interatomic potentials. Structures based upon the Mackay
icosahedra predominate for both potentials, and the magic numbers for the
Murrell-Mottram model show excellent agreement with the sizes at which maxima
in the latent heat and entropy change at melting have been found in experiment.
