We describe an experimental apparatus capable of achieving a high loading
rate of strontium atoms in a magneto-optical trap operating in a high vacuum
environment. A key innovation of this setup is a two dimensional
magneto-optical trap deflector located after a Zeeman slower. We find a loading
rate of 6x10^9/s whereas the lifetime of the magnetically trapped atoms in the
3P2 state is 54s.
