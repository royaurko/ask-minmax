Visible Light Communication (VLC) using light emitting diodes (LEDs) has been
gaining increasing attention in recent years as it is appealing for a wide
range of applications such as indoor positioning. Orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) has been applied to indoor wireless optical communications
in order to mitigate the effect of multipath distortion of the optical channel
as well as increasing data rate. In this paper, a novel OFDM VLC system is
proposed which can be utilized for both communications and indoor positioning.
A positioning algorithm based on power attenuation is used to estimate the
receiver coordinates. We further calculate the positioning errors in all the
locations of a room and compare them with those using single carrier modulation
scheme, i.e., on-off keying (OOK) modulation. We demonstrate that OFDM
positioning system outperforms its conventional counterpart. Finally, we
investigate the impact of different system parameters on the positioning
accuracy of the proposed OFDM VLC system.
