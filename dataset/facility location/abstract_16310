We investigate the emission mechanism and evolution of pulsars that are
associated with supernova remnants.
  We used imaging techniques in both the optical and near infrared, using
images with very good seeing (<0.6) to study the immediate surroundings of the
Crab pulsar. In the case of the infrared, we took two data sets with a time
window of 75 days, to check for variability in the inner part of the Crab
nebula. We also measure the spectral indices of all these wisps, the nearby
knot, and the interwisp medium, using our optical and infrared data. We then
compared the observational results with the existing theoretical models.
  We report variability in the three nearby wisps located to the northwest of
the pulsar and also in a nearby anvil wisp in terms of their structure,
position, and emissivity within the time window of 75 days. All the wisps and
the inner knot display red spectra with similar spectral indices. Similarly,
the interwisp medium regions also show red spectra similar to those of the
wisps. Also, based on archival HST data and our IR data, we find that the inner
knot remains stationary for a time period of 13.5 years. The projected average
velocity relative to the pulsar for this period is < 8 km/s.
  By comparing the spectral indices of the structures in the inner Crab with
the current theoretical models, we find that the Del Zanna et al. (2006) model
for the synchrotron emission fits our observations, although the spectral index
is at the flatter end of their modelled spectra.
