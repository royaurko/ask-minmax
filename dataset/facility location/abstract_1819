Two new facilities have recently been proposed to measure low energy
neutrino-nucleus cross sections, the nu-SNS (Spallation Neutron Source) and low
energy beta beams. The former produces neutrinos by pion decay at rest, while
the latter produces neutrinos from the beta decays of accelerated ions. One of
the uses of neutrino-nucleus cross section measurements is for supernova
studies, where typical neutrino energies are 10s of MeV. In this energy range
there are many different components to the nuclear response and this makes the
theoretical interpretation of the results of such an experiment complex.
Although even one measurement on a heavy nucleus such as lead is much
anticipated, more than one data set would be still better. We suggest that this
can be done by breaking the electron spectrum down into the parts produced in
coincidence with one or two neutrons, running a beta beam at more than one
energy, comparing the spectra produced with pions and a beta beam or any
combination of these.
