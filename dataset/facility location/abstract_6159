We present the results of work in which we derived the order rho^2
corrections to the Friedmann equations in the Randall-Sundrum I model. The
effects of Golberger-Wise stabilization are taken into account. We surprisingly
find that in the cases of inflation and radiation domination, the leading
corrections on a given brane come exclusively from the effects of energy
density located on the opposite brane.
