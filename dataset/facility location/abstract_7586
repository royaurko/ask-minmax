Open source projects often maintain open bug repositories during development
and maintenance, and the reporters often point out straightly or implicitly the
reasons why bugs occur when they submit them. The comments about a bug are very
valuable for developers to locate and fix the bug. Meanwhile, it is very common
in large software for programmers to override or overload some methods
according to the same logic. If one method causes a bug, it is obvious that
other overridden or overloaded methods maybe cause related or similar bugs. In
this paper, we propose and implement a tool Rebug- Detector, which detects
related bugs using bug information and code features. Firstly, it extracts bug
features from bug information in bug repositories; secondly, it locates bug
methods from source code, and then extracts code features of bug methods;
thirdly, it calculates similarities between each overridden or overloaded
method and bug methods; lastly, it determines which method maybe causes
potential related or similar bugs. We evaluate Rebug-Detector on an open source
project: Apache Lucene-Java. Our tool totally detects 61 related bugs,
including 21 real bugs and 10 suspected bugs, and it costs us about 15.5
minutes. The results show that bug features and code features extracted by our
tool are useful to find real bugs in existing projects.
