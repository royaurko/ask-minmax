Cathodoluminescence imaging and spectroscopy experiments on a single
bamboo-like boron nitride nanotube are reported. Imaging experiments show that
the luminescence is located all along the nanotube. Spectroscopy experiments
point out the important role of dimensionality in this one dimensional object.
