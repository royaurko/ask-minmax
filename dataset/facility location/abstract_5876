Biological filaments such as DNA or bacterial flagella are typically curved
in their natural states. To elucidate the interplay of viscous drag, twisting,
and bending in the overdamped dynamics of such filaments, we compute the
steady-state torsional stress and shape of a rotating rod with a kink. Drag
deforms the rod, ultimately extending or folding it depending on the kink
angle. For certain kink angles and kink locations, both states are possible at
high rotation rates. The agreement between our macroscopic experiments and the
theory is good, with no adjustable parameters.
