We show that it is possible to detect mechanical bending modes on 1 micron
long ropes of single walled-carbon nanotubes suspended between 2 metallic
contacts. This is done by measuring either their dc resistance in a region of
strong temperature dependence (in the vicinity of superconducting or
metal-insulator transition), or their critical current. The vibrations are
excited by a radio-frequency electric field produced by an antenna located in
the vicinity of the sample. We analyze the mechanism of detection of the
mechanical resonances in terms of heating and phase breaking effects.
