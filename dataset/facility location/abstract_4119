As the recent publication by Breen et al (2013) found Class II methanol
masers are exclusively associated with high mass star forming regions. Based on
the positions of the Class I and II methanol and H$_{2}$O masers, UC H II
regions and 4.5 $\mu$m infrared sources, and the center velocities
($v_{\text{LSR}}$) of the Class I methanol and H$_{2}$O masers, compared to the
$v_{\text{LSR}}$ of the Class II methanol masers, we propose three disk-outflow
models that may be traced by methanol masers. In all three models, we have
located the Class II methanol maser near the protostar, and the Class I
methanol maser in the outflow, as is known from observations during the last
twenty years. In our first model, the H$_{2}$O masers trace the linear extent
of the outflow. In our second model, the H$_{2}$O masers are located in a
circumstellar disk. In our third model, the H$_{2}$O masers are located in one
or more outflows near the terminating shock where the outflow impacts the
ambient interstellar medium. Together, these models reiterate the utility of
coordinated high angular resolution observations of high mass star forming
regions in maser lines and associated star formation tracers.
