Located at the South Pole, IceCube is a particle-astrophysics observatory
composed of a square-kilometer surface air shower array (IceTop) and a 1.4 km
deep cubic-kilometer optical Cherenkov detector array. We review results of
measurements of the cosmic ray spectrum and average mass in the energy range 1
PeV to 1 EeV.
