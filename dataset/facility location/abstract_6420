We address the existence and properties of solitons in layered thermal media
made of alternating focusing and defocusing layers. Such structures support
robust bright solitons even if the averaged nonlinearity is defocusing. We show
that non-oscillating solitons may form in any of the focusing domains, even in
those located close to the sample edge, in contrast to uniform thermal media
where light beams always oscillate when not launched exactly on the sample
center. Stable multipole solitons may include more than four spots in layered
media.
