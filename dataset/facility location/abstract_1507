We assess the possibility of determining the Hubble constant H_0 by measuring
time delays between multiple images of supernovae gravitationally lensed by
rich clusters of galaxies and combining these delay measurements with detailed
cluster-potential models based on other lensing constraints. Such a lensing
determination of H_0 would be complementary to those obtained from galaxy-QSO
lensing studies, and could potentially be better calibrated. We show that
relatively low-redshift (z approximately 0.2), significantly elliptical
clusters have appreciable lensing cross sections for observable image pairings
with tractable time delays on the order of a few years despite large lensing
mass scales. We find that a targeted search for such image pairs would be a
significant undertaking for current observatories, but that it would be
appropriate for a facility such as the proposed Large-aperture Synoptic Survey
Telescope.
