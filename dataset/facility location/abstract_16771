We analyse the kinematic and chemical evolution of 203 distant spheroidal
(elliptical and S0) galaxies at 0.2<z<0.8 which are located in different
environments (rich clusters, low-mass clusters and in the field). VLT/FORS and
CAHA/MOSCA spectra with intermediate-resolution have been acquired to measure
the internal kinematics and stellar populations of the galaxies. From HST/ACS
and WFPC2 imaging, surface brightness profiles and structural parameters were
derived for half of the galaxy sample. The scaling relations of the
Faber-Jackson relation and Kormendy relation as well as the Fundamental Plane
indicate a moderate evolution for the whole galaxy population in each density
regime. In all environments, S0 galaxies show a faster evolution than
elliptical galaxies. For the cluster galaxies a slight radial dependence of the
evolution out to one virial radius is found. Dividing the samples with respect
to their mass, a mass dependent evolution with a stronger evolution of
lower-mass galaxies (M<2x10^{11} M_{\sun}) is detected. Evidence for recent
star formation is provided by blue colours and weak OII emission or strong
H\delta absorption features in the spectra. The results are consistent with a
down-sizing formation scenario which is independent from the environment of the
galaxies.
