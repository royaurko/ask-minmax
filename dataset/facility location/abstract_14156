We compare the dynamics of satellite galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
to simple models in order to test the hypothesis that a large fraction of
satellites co-rotate in coherent planes. We confirm the previously-reported
excess of co-rotating satellite pairs located near diametric opposition with
respect to the host, but show that this signal is unlikely to be due to
rotating discs (or planes) of satellites. In particular, no overabundance of
co-rotating satellites pairs is observed within $\sim 20^{\circ}-50^{\circ}$ of
direct opposition, as would be expected for planar distributions inclined
relative to the line-of-sight. Instead, the excess co-rotation for satellite
pairs within $\sim 10^{\circ}$ of opposition is consistent with random noise
associated with undersampling of an underlying isotropic velocity distribution.
We conclude that at most $10\%$ of the hosts in our sample harbor co-rotating
satellite planes (as traced by the luminous satellite population).
