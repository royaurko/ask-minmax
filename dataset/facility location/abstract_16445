As the technology rapidly grows, the trend is clear that the use of mobile
devices is gain an attention nowadays, thus designing a system by integrating
it with notification feature is becoming an important aspect especially in
tracking and monitoring system. Conventional security surveillance systems
require the constant attention from the user, to monitor the location
concurrently. In order to reduce the cost of computing power and advance
technology of mobile phone in widespread acceptance of the Internet as a viable
communication medium, this paper is aimed to design a low cost web-based system
as a platform to view the image captured. When the network camera detects any
movement from the intruders, it automatically captures the image and sends it
to the database of the web-based directly by the network through File Transfer
Protocol (FTP). The camera is attached through an Ethernet connection and power
source. Therefore, the camera can be viewed from either standard Web browser or
cell phone. Nowadays, when a security camera is installed, user is notified as
long as the camera is switched on since any slight movement requires the
attention of the supervisor. The utility of the system has proven
theoretically. This system will also notify the user by sending a notification
through Short Messages Services (SMS).
