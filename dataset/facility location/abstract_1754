The rapid nuetron-capture process (r process) produces roughly half of the
elements heavier than iron. The path and abundances produced are uncertain,
however, because of the lack of nuclear strucure information on important
neutron-rich nuclei. We are studying nuclei on or near the r-process path via
single-nucleon transfer reactions on neutron-rich radioactive beams at ORNL's
Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF). Owing to the difficulties in
studying these reactions in inverse kinematics, a variety of experimental
approaches are being developed. We present the experimental methods and initial
results.
