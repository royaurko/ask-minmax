By utilizing the frequency anticorrelation of two-photon states produced via
spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC), the working principle of a novel
remote spectrometer is demonstrated. With the help of a local scanning
monochromator, the spectral transmission function of an optical element (or
atmosphere) at remote locations can be characterized for wide range of
wavelengths with expected high resolution.
