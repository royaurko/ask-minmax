The multiplayer dynamics of a football game is analyzed to unveil
self-similarities in the time evolution of player and ball positioning.
Temporal fluctuations in both the team-turf boundary and the ball location are
uncovered to follow the rules of fractional Brownian motion with a Hurst
exponent of H=0.7. The persistence time below which self-similarity holds is
found to be several tens of seconds, implying a characteristic time scale that
governs far-from-equilibrium motion on a playing field.
