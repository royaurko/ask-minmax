Construction was completed during summer 2013 on the Telescope Array RAdar
(TARA) bi-static radar observatory for Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR).
TARA is co-located with the Telescope Array, the largest "conventional" cosmic
ray detector in the Northern Hemisphere, in radio-quiet Western Utah. TARA
employs an 8 MW Effective Radiated Power (ERP) VHF transmitter and smart
receiver system based on a 250 MS/s data acquisition system in an effort to
detect the scatter of sounding radiation by UHECR-induced atmospheric
ionization. TARA seeks to demonstrate bi-static radar as a useful new remote
sensing technique for UHECRs, extending their detection aperture far beyond
what is accessible by conventional means. In this report, we describe the
design and performance of the TARA transmitter and receiver systems.
