In the present paper we construct a self-consistent theory, interpreting the
observations of the MAGIC Cherenkov Telescope of the very high energy (VHE)
pulsed emission from the Crab pulsar. In particular, on the basis of the
Vlasov's kinetic equation we study the process of the quasi-linear
diffusion(QLD) developed by means of the cyclotron instability. This mechanism
provides simultaneous generation of low (radio) and VHE (0.01-25GeV) emission
on the light cylinder scales, in one location of the pulsar magnetosphere. A
different approach of the synchrotron theory is considered, giving the spectral
index of VHE emission ($\beta=2$) and the exponential cutoff energy (23 GeV) in
a good agreement with the observational data.
