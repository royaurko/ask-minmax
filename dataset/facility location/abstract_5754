I will briefly present my work on cosmological parameters estimation.
Classical methods for parameters estimation involve the exploration of the
parameter space on a precalculated grid of cosmological models. Here we try to
estimate the cosmological parameters by using a minimization method associated
with the interpolation of the C_l spectrum. We first use a simple
multidimensional linear interpolation, and show the flaws of this method. We
then introduce a new interpolation method, based on a physical description of
the location of the acoustic peaks in the power spectrum
