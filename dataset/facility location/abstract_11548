Aims: I study new deep (DeltaV ~ 1.20-1.65 mag) occultation events of the
delta Scuti, Herbig Ae/Be star V1247 Ori in the Ori OB1 b association. Methods:
I use the V-band ASAS light curve of V1247 Ori, which covers the last nine
years, together with photometric data in the near-ultraviolet, visible, near-,
and far-infrared taken from the literature. I carry out a periodogram analysis
of the "cleaned" light curve and construct the spectral energy distribution of
the star. Results: The star V1247 Ori is interesting for the study of the UX
Orionis phenomenon, in which Herbig Ae/Be stars are occulted by their
protoplanetary discs, for three reasons: brightness (V ~ 9.85 mag), large
infrared excess at 20-100 mum (F_60 ~ 10 Jy), and photometric stability out of
occultation (sigma(V) ~ 0.02 mag), which may help to determine the location and
spatial structure of the occulting disc clumps.
