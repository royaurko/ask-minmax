The paper focuses on characterisation of information hiding possibilities in
Cloud Computing. After general introduction to cloud computing and its security
we move to brief description of steganography. In particular we introduce
classification of steganographic communication scenarios in cloud computing
which is based on location of the steganograms receiver. These scenarios as
well as the threats that steganographic methods can cause must be taken into
account when designing secure cloud computing services.
