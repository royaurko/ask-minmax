We calculate the low-frequency optical conductivity sigma(w) of clean metals
and superconductors at zero temperature neglecting the effects of impurities
and phonons. In general, the frequency and temperature dependences of sigma
have very little in common. For small Fermi surfaces in three dimensions (but
not in 2D) we find for example that Re sigma(w>0)=const. for low w which
corresponds to a scattering rate Gamma proportional to w^2 even in the absence
of Umklapp scattering when there is no T^2 contribution to Gamma. In the main
part of the paper we discuss in detail the optical conductivity of d-wave
superconductors in 2D where Re sigma(w>0) \propto w^4 for the smallest
frequencies and the Umklapp processes typically set in smoothly above a finite
threshold w_0 smaller than twice the maximal gap Delta. In cases where the
nodes are located at (pi/2, pi/2), such that direct Umklapp scattering among
them is possible, one obtains Re sigma(w) \propto w^2.
