The ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As has emerged as the most studied
material for prototype applications in semiconductor spintronics. Because
ferromagnetism in (Ga,Mn)As is hole-mediated, the nature of the hole states has
direct and crucial bearing on its Curie temperature TC. It is vigorously
debated, however, whether holes in (Ga,Mn)As reside in the valence band or in
an impurity band. In this paper we combine results of channeling experiments,
which measure the concentrations both of Mn ions and of holes relevant to the
ferromagnetic order, with magnetization, transport, and magneto-optical data to
address this issue. Taken together, these measurements provide strong evidence
that it is the location of the Fermi level within the impurity band that
determines TC through determining the degree of hole localization. This finding
differs drastically from the often accepted view that TC is controlled by
valence band holes, thus opening new avenues for achieving higher values of TC.
