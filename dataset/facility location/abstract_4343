The cable capacitance in cryogenic and high vacuum applications of quartz
tuning forks imposes severe constraints on the bandwidth and noise performance
of the measurement. We present a single stage low noise transimpedance
amplifier with a bandwidth exceeding 1 MHz and provide an in-depth analysis of
the dependence of the amplifier parameters on the cable capacitance.
