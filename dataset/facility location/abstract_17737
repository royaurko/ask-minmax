We present deep $UBVI_C$ photometric data of the young open cluster
Westerlund 2. An abnormal reddening law of $R_{V,cl}=4.14\pm0.08$ was found for
the highly reddened early-type members ($E(B-V)\geq 1.45$), whereas a fairly
normal reddening law of $R_{V,fg}=3.33\pm0.03$ was confirmed for the foreground
early-type stars ($E(B-V)_{fg}<1.05$). The distance modulus was determined from
zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) fitting to the reddening-corrected
colour-magnitude diagram of the early-type members to be $V_0-M_V=13.9\pm0.14$
(random error) $_{-0.1}^{+0.4}$ (the upper limit of systematic error) mag ($d =
6.0 \pm 0.4 _{-0.3}^{+1.2}$ kpc). To obtain the initial mass function,
pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars were selected by identifying the optical
counterparts of Chandra X-ray sources and mid-infrared emission stars from the
Spitzer GLIMPSE source catalog. The initial mass function shows a shallow slope
of $\Gamma=-1.1 \pm 0.1$ down to $\log m = 0.7$. The total mass of Westerlund 2
is estimated to be at least 7,400 $M_{\odot}$. The age of Westerlund 2 from the
main-sequence turn-on and PMS stars is estimated to be $\lesssim$ 1.5 Myr. We
confirmed the existence of a clump of PMS stars located $\sim1$ arcmin north of
the core of Westerlund 2, but we could not find any clear evidence for an age
difference between the core and the northern clump.
