We present results of numerical simulation of thin accretion disks and winds.
We use the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique for this purpose. We
show that the simulation agrees very well with the recent theoretical work on
the shock formation. The most significant conclusion is that shocks in an
inviscid flow are extremely stable. For the first time, our work also removes
the ambiguity in terms of the location and stability of shocks in adiabatic
flows.
