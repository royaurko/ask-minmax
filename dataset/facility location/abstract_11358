Magnetic Bright Points (MBPs) in the internetwork are among the smallest
objects in the solar photosphere and appear bright against the ambient
environment. An algorithm is presented that can be used for the automated
detection of the MBPs in the spatial and temporal domains. The algorithm works
by mapping the lanes through intensity thresholding. A compass search, combined
with a study of the intensity gradient across the detected objects, allows the
disentanglement of MBPs from bright pixels within the granules. Object growing
is implemented to account for any pixels that might have been removed when
mapping the lanes. The images are stabilized by locating long-lived objects
that may have been missed due to variable light levels and seeing quality.
Tests of the algorithm employing data taken with the Swedish Solar Telescope
(SST), reveal that ~90% of MBPs within a 75"x 75" field of view are detected.
