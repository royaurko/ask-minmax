Results of detailed Monte Carlo energy deposition studies performed for the
LBNE absorber core and the surrounding shielding with the MARS15 code are
described. The model of the entire facility, that includes a pion-production
target, focusing horns, target chase, decay channel, hadron absorber system --
all with corresponding radiation shielding -- was developed using the recently
implemented ROOT-based geometry option in the MARS15 code. This option provides
substantial flexibility and automation when developing complex geometry models.
Both normal operation and accidental conditions were studied. Various design
options were considered, in particular the following: (i) filling the decay
pipe with air or helium; (ii) the absorber mask material and shape; (iii) the
beam spoiler material and size. Results of detailed thermal calculations with
the ANSYS code helped to select the most viable absorber design options.
