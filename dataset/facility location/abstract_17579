Particle acceleration is one of the most significant features that are
ubiquitous among space and cosmic plasmas. It is most prominent during flares
in the case of the Sun, with which huge amount of electromagnetic radiation and
high-energy particles are expelled into the interplanetary space through
acceleration of plasma particles in the corona. Though it has been well
understood that energies of flares are supplied by the mechanism called
magnetic reconnection based on the observations in X-rays and EUV with space
telescopes, where and how in the flaring magnetic field plasmas are accelerated
has remained unknown due to the low plasma density in the flaring corona. We
here report the first observational identification of the energetic non-thermal
electrons around the point of the ongoing magnetic reconnection (X-point); with
the location of the X-point identified by soft X-ray imagery and the localized
presence of non-thermal electrons identified from imaging-spectroscopic data at
two microwave frequencies. Considering the existence of the reconnection
outflows that carries both plasma particles and magnetic fields out from the
X-point, our identified non-thermal microwave emissions around the X-point
indicate that the electrons are accelerated around the reconnection X-point.
Additionally, the plasma around the X-point was also thermally heated up to 10
MK. The estimated reconnection rate of this event is ~0.017.
