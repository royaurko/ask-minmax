We investigate the interiors of 3+1 dimensional asymptotically flat charged
and rotating black holes as described by observers who fall into the black
holes at late times, long after any perturbations of the exterior region have
decayed. In the strict limit of late infall times, the initial experiences of
such observers are precisely described by the region of the limiting stationary
geometry to the past of its inner horizon. However, we argue that late
infall-time observers encounter a null shockwave at the location of the
would-be outgoing inner horizon. In particular, for spherically symmetric black
hole spacetimes we demonstrate that freely-falling observers experience a
metric discontinuity across this shock, that is, a gravitational shock-wave.
Furthermore, the magnitude of this shock is at least of order unity. A similar
phenomenon of metric discontinuity appears to take place at the inner horizon
of a generically-perturbed spinning black hole. We compare the properties of
this null shockwave singularity with those of the null weak singularity that
forms at the Cauchy horizon.
