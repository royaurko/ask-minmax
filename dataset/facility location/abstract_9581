Observations at radio wavelengths address key problems in astrophysics,
astrobiology, and lunar structure including the first light in the Universe
(the Epoch of Reionization), the presence of magnetic fields around extrasolar
planets, particle acceleration mechanisms, and the structure of the lunar
ionosphere. Moreover, achieving the performance needed to address these
scientific questions demands observations at wavelengths longer than those that
penetrate the Earth's ionosphere, observations in extremely "radio quiet"
locations such as the Moon's far side, or both. We describe a series of
lunar-based radio wavelength interferometers of increasing capability. The
Radio Observatory for Lunar Sortie Science (ROLSS) is an array designed to be
deployed during the first lunar sorties (or even before via robotic rovers) and
addressing particle acceleration and the lunar ionosphere. Future arrays would
be larger, more capable, and deployed as experience is gained in working on the
lunar surface.
