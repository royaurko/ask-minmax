There are a total of 1451 gamma-ray emitting objects in the Fermi Large Area
Telescope First Source Catalogue. The point source location accuracy of
typically a few arcminutes has allowed the counterparts for many of these
sources to be found at other wavelengths, but even so there are 630 which are
described as having no plausible counterpart at 80% confidence. In order to
help identify the unknown objects, we have cross-correlated the positions of
these sources with the Rosat All Sky Survey Bright Source Catalogue. In this
way, for Fermi sources which have a possible counterpart in soft X-rays, we can
use the, much smaller, Rosat error box to search for identifications. We find a
strong correlation between the two samples and calculate that there are about
60 sources with a Rosat counterpart. Using the Rosat error boxes we provide
tentative associations for half of them, demonstrate that the majority of these
are either blazars or blazar candidates and give evidence that most belong to
the BL Lac class. Given that they are X-ray selected and most are high
synchrotron peaked objects, which indicates the presence of high energy
electrons, these sources are also good candidates for TeV emission, and
therefore good probes of the extragalactic background light.
