A new electrostatic storage ring for beams at energies up to 30keV.q is
currently under development at the National Centre for Mathematics and Physics
(NCMP), King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST). The ring design
is based on the existing electrostatic storage rings, but stretches
significantly beyond them in that it shall form the core of a unique flexible
experimental facility at KACST. The lattice of this ring has been designed in a
way that enables the use of state-of-the-art experimental methods to study
electron-ion, laser-ion, and ion-neutral beams interactions. The lattice design
also allows for a future upgrade of the ring to a double storage ring structure
that would enable ion-ion beam interactions to be performed. In this paper, we
present the design of this ring with a focus on beam dynamics calculations for
the 7o single-bend racetrack layout. The study is principally based on the
SIMION8 program. We complemented this study further by using purpose-written
routine and MAD-X simulation code. An in-depth investigation into beam
stability under consideration of non-linear field components in the
electrostatic optical elements, is presented. Finally, different working points
and stability regions are discussed.
