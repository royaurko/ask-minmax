We present a weak lensing mass reconstruction of the interacting cluster
1E0657-558 in which we detect both the main cluster and a sub-cluster. The
sub-cluster is identified as a smaller cluster which has just undergone initial
in-fall and pass-through of the primary cluster, and has been previously
identified in both optical surveys and X-ray studies. The X-ray gas has been
separated from the galaxies by ram-pressure stripping during the pass-through.
The detected mass peak is located between the X-ray peak and galaxy
concentration, although the position is consistent with the galaxy centroid
within the errors of the mass reconstruction. We find that the mass peak for
the main cluster is in good spatial agreement with the cluster galaxies and
offset from the X-ray halo at 3.4 sigma significance, and determine that the
mass-to-light ratios of the two components are consistent with those of relaxed
clusters. The observed offsets of the lensing mass peaks from the peaks of the
dominant visible mass component (the X-ray gas) directly demonstrate the
presence, and dominance, of dark matter in this cluster. This proof of the dark
matter existence holds true even under the assumption of modified Newtonian
gravity (MOND); from the observed gravitational shear to optical light ratios
and mass peak - X-ray gas offsets, the dark matter component in a MOND regime
has a total mass which is at least equal to the baryonic mass of the system.
