We consider a directed walk model of a homopolymer (in two dimensions) which
is self-interacting and can undergo a collapse transition, subject to an
applied tensile force. We review and interpret all the results already in the
literature concerning the case where this force is in the preferred direction
of the walk. We consider the force extension curves at different temperatures
as well as the critical-force temperature curve. We demonstrate that this model
can be analysed rigorously for all key quantities of interest even when there
may not be explicit expressions for these quantities available. We show which
of the techniques available can be extended to the full model, where the force
has components in the preferred direction and the direction perpendicular to
this. Whilst the solution of the generating function is available, its analysis
is far more complicated and not all the rigorous techniques are available.
However, many results can be extracted including the location of the critical
point which gives the general critical-force temperature curve. Lastly, we
generalise the model to a three-dimensional analogue and show that several key
properties can be analysed if the force is restricted to the plane of preferred
directions.
