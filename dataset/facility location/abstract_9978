Within the t-t'-J model, the electron spectrum and quasiparticle dispersion
in doped bilayer cuprates in the normal state are discussed by considering the
bilayer interaction. It is shown that the bilayer interaction splits the
electron spectrum of doped bilayer cuprates into the bonding and antibonding
components around the $(\pi,0)$ point. The differentiation between the bonding
and antibonding components is essential, which leads to two main flat bands
around the $(\pi,0)$ point below the Fermi energy. In analogy to the doped
single layer cuprates, the lowest energy states in doped bilayer cuprates are
located at the $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ point. Our results also show that the striking
behavior of the electronic structure in doped bilayer cuprates is intriguingly
related to the bilayer interaction together with strong coupling between the
electron quasiparticles and collective magnetic excitations.
