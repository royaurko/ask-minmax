Project GRAND is a 100m x 100m air shower array of position sensitive
proportional wire chambers (PWCs) located at 41.7 degrees North and 86.2
degrees West at an elevation of 220m above sea level. Its convenient location
adjacent to the campus of the University of Notre Dame makes it a good training
ground for students. There are 64 stations each with eight 1.29 m^2 PWCs. The
geometry of the stations allows for the angles of charged secondaries to be
determined to within 0.26 degrees in each of two orthogonal planes; muons are
differentiated from electrons and hadrons by means of a steel plate. Two
triggers are run simultaneously: a multiple hit coincidence trigger, rich in
extensive air showers, and a single track trigger, rich in secondary muon
tracks. The former trigger is sensitive to primary energies greater than ~100
TeV, the latter to energies greater than ~10 GeV.
