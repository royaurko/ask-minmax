Chandra X-ray imaging spectroscopy of the nearby Herbig Ae star HD 163296 at
100 AU angular resolution is reported. A point-like, soft (kT~0.5 keV),
emission-line source is detected at the location of the star with an X-ray
luminosity of 4.0e29 erg/s. In addition, faint emission along the direction of
a previously-detected Ly-alpha-emitting jet and Herbig-Haro outflow may be
present. The relatively low luminosity, lack of a hard spectral component, and
absence of strong X-ray variability in HD 163296 can be explained as
originating from optically-thin shock-heated gas accreting onto the stellar
surface along magnetic field lines. This would require a (dipole) magnetic
field strength at the surface of HD 163296 of at least ~100 G and perhaps as
high as several kG. HD 163296 joins the T Tauri star TW Hya in being the only
examples known to date of pre-main-sequence stars whose quiescent X-ray
emission appears to be completely dominated by accretion.
