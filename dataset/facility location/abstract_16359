The earthquake of Skyros Island in Greece (26/7/2001, Ms = 6.1 R) was
announced three days before its occurrence in a meeting organized by the
Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia on 2001. In this work a review is made on
the results of the methodologies which were used for the analysis of the
available data in order to utilize the specific prognosis. Of particular
interest is the fact that the determined time of occurrence deviated for less
than an hour (actually it was 41 minutes) from the actual occurrence time of
the specific EQ. A similar example of another large EQ (Kythira, Greece, Ms =
6.9R, 8th January, 2006) by using the very same methodology deviated for 43
minutes only. The rest of the prognostic parameters: the epicenter location and
the magnitude of the Skyros EQ were utilized by manipulating the past seismic
energy release history of the regional seismogenic area and the observed
earth's electric field which was recorded during the last 25 days, before the
occurrence of the large seismic event, by VOL earth's electric field monitoring
site. It is concluded that a short-term earthquake prediction can be utilized
as a really "short" one, once the available precursory data are processed with
the appropriate methodologies.
