New abundances of planetary nebulae located towards the bulge of the Galaxy
are derived based on observations made at LNA (Brazil). We present accurate
abundances of the elements He, N, S, O, Ar, and Ne for 56 PNe located towards
the galactic bulge. The data shows a good agreement with other results in the
literature, in the sense that the distribution of the abundances is similar to
those works. From the statistical analysis performed, we can suggest a
bulge-disk interface at 2.2 kpc for the intermediate mass population, marking
therefore the outer border of the bulge and inner border of the disk.
