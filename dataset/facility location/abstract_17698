In this work, we explore the ability of plasma assisted chemical vapor
deposition (PACVD) operating under high power densities to produce thin
high-quality diamond layers with a controlled doping with negatively-charged
nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers. This luminescent defect possesses specific
physical characteristics that make it suitable as an addressable solid-state
electron spin for measuring magnetic fields with unprecedented sensitivity. To
this aim, a relatively large number of NV- centers (> 10^12 cm^-3) should
ideally be located in a thin diamond layer (a few tens of nm) close to the
surface which is particularly challenging to achieve with the PACVD technique.
Here we show that intentional temperature variations can be exploited to tune
NV- creation efficiency during growth, allowing engineering complex stacking
structures with a variable doping. Because such a temperature variation can be
performed quickly and without any change of the gas phase composition, thin
layers can be grown. Measurements show that despite the temperature variations,
the luminescent centers incorporated using this technique exhibit spin
coherence properties similar to those reached in ultra-pure bulk crystals,
which suggests that they could be successfully employed in magnetometry
applications.
