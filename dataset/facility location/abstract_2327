The NOAO currently operates the two most capable platforms in the world for
optical surveys, the 4-m KPNO (Mayall) and 4-m CTIO (Blanco) telescopes. It was
only discovered recently (in 2009) that a field of view of 3 deg diameter is
possible on these telescopes. In combination, these two telescopes provide the
unique capability of a common telescope platform for full-sky surveys. The
survey power (in \'etendue) is 45% that of LSST.
  Two ambitious surveys are already planned using these telescopes in the
coming decade: Dark Energy Survey (imaging on the Blanco) and BigBOSS
(spectroscopy on the Mayall). The BigBOSS collaboration has proposed a survey
of 20 million galaxies in one hemisphere, and the full sky could be completed
by moving the instrument to its sister platform in the South. These and other
possible surveys argue for the continued investment in these uniquely- capable
facilities by NSF Astronomy.
