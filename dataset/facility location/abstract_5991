The distribution of scattering delay times is analyzed for classical
electrons which are transmitted through a finite waveguide. For non-zero
magnetic field the distribution shows a regular pattern of maxima (logarithmic
singularities). Although their location follows from a simple commensurability
condition, there is no straightforward geometric explanation of this
self-pulsing effect. Rather it can be understood as a time-dependent analog of
transverse magnetic focusing, in terms of the stationary points of the delay
time. We also discuss the possibility of singularities in the delay-time
distribution for generic 2D scattering systems.
