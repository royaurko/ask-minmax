This paper reports about our work in the ICON 2013 NLP TOOLS CONTEST on Named
Entity Recognition. We submitted runs for Bengali, English, Hindi, Marathi,
Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu. A statistical HMM (Hidden Markov Models) based model
has been used to implement our system. The system has been trained and tested
on the NLP TOOLS CONTEST: ICON 2013 datasets. Our system obtains F-measures of
0.8599, 0.7704, 0.7520, 0.4289, 0.5455, 0.4466, and 0.4003 for Bengali,
English, Hindi, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu respectively.
