Galaxy clusters are key places to study the contribution of {\it nature}
(i.e. mass, morphology) and {\it nurture} (i.e.environment) in the formation
and evolution of galaxies. Recently, a number of clusters at z$>$1, i.e.
corresponding to the first epochs of the cluster formation, has been discovered
and confirmed spectroscopically. We present new observations obtained with the
{\sc LUCIFER} spectrograph at Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) of a sample of
star-forming galaxies associated with a large scale structure around the radio
galaxy 7C1756+6520 at z=1.42. Combining our spectroscopic data and the
literature photometric data, we derived some of the properties of these
galaxies: star formation rate, metallicity and stellar mass. With the aim of
analyzing the effect of the cluster environment on galaxy evolution, we have
located the galaxies in the plane of the so-called Fundamental Metallically
Relation (FMR), which is known not to evolve with redshift up to z$=2.5$ for
field galaxies, but it is still unexplored in rich environments at low and high
redshift. We found that the properties of the galaxies in the cluster 7C
1756+6520 are compatible with the FMR which suggests that the effect of the
environment on galaxy metallicity at this early epoch of cluster formation is
marginal. As a side study, we also report the spectroscopic analysis of a
bright AGN, belonging to the cluster, which shows a significant outflow of gas.
