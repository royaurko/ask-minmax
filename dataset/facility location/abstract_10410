A linear list is a collection of items that can be accessed sequentially. The
cost of a request is the number of items that need to be examined before the
desired item is located, i.e., the distance of the requested item from the
beginning of the list. The transposition rule is one of the algorithms designed
to reduce the search cost by organizing the list. In particular, upon a request
for a given item, the item is transposed with the preceding one. We develop a
new approach for analyzing the algorithm. The approach is based on a coupling
with a certain constrained asymmetric exclusion process. This allows us to
establish an asymptotic optimality of the rule for two families of request
distributions.
