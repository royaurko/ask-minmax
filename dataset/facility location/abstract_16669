Strong quasi-periodic oscillations in the tails of the giant gamma-ray flares
seen in SGR 1806-20 and SGR 1900+14 are thought to be produced by starquakes in
the flaring magnetar. However, the large fractional amplitudes (up to ~20%)
observed are difficult to reconcile with predicted amplitudes of starquakes.
Here we demonstrate that the steeply pulsed emission profile in the tail of the
giant flare can enhance the observed amplitude of the underlying oscillation,
analogously to a beam of light oscillating in and out of the line of sight.
This mechanism will also broaden the feature in the power spectrum and
introduce power at harmonics of the oscillation. The observed strength of the
oscillation depends on the amplitude of the underlying starquake, the
orientation and location of the emission on the surface of the star, and the
gradient of the light curve profile. While the amplification of the signal can
be significant, we demonstrate that even with uncertainties in the emission
geometry, this effect is not sufficient to produce the observed QPOs. This
result excludes the direct observation of a starquake, and suggests that the
observed variations come from modulations in the intensity of the emission.
