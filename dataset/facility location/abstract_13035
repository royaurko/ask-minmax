We analyzed the B and V light curves of two EA-type binaries V211 and NV358
using the WD code for the first time. Our analysis shows that V211 is a typical
Algol-type binary and NV358 is a well detached binary system. As the two
binaries are definite proper motion members of omega Centauri, we estimated
their physical parameters, obtaining M_1=1.13\pm0.03M_\odot,
R_1=0.98\pm0.01R_\odot and M_2=0.33\pm0.01M_\odot, R_2=0.92\pm0.01R_\odot for
V211; M_1=1.30\pm0.05M_\odot, R_1=1.03\pm0.01R_\odot and
M_2=0.58\pm0.02M_\odot, R_2=0.78\pm0.01R_\odot for NV358. On the
color-magnitude diagram of omega Centauri, V211 is located in the faint blue
straggler region and its primary component is more massive than a star at the
main-sequence turnoff. Therefore, V211 is a blue straggler and should be formed
by mass transfer from the secondary component to the primary. The age of NV358
is less than 1.93 Gyr, indicating that it is much younger than first-generation
stars in omega Centauri. As NV364 in omega Centauri, NV358 should be a
second-generation binary.
