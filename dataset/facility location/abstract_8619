We present a study of molecular hyrogen (H_2) in the SMC gas, based on space
shuttle Far UV spectroscopy with ORFEUS and the Tuebingen echelle spectrograph,
in the line of sight to the SMC star HD 5980. 17 absorption lines from the
Lyman band have been analysed. Our line of sight crosses two clouds within the
SMC. We detect a cool molecular component near +120 km/s, where the H_2 from
the lowest 3 rotational states (J<3) is found. For this cloud we derive an
excitation temperature of 70 K, probably the kinetic temerature of the gas. The
cloud is located in the SMC foreground.
  Another SMC component is visible at
+160 km/s. Here we find unblended H_2 absorption lines from levels 4 < J < 8.
For this component we obtain an equivalent excitation temperature T > 2350 K
and conclude that this cloud must be highly excited by strong UV radiation from
its energetic environment. (Research supported in part by the DARA)
