A generalized Strangeness-incorporating Statistical Bootstrap Model (SSBM) is
constructed so as to include indepedent fugacities for up and down quarks. Such
an extension is crucial for the confrontation of multiparticle data emerging
from heavy ion collisions, wherein isospin symmetry is not satisfied. Two
constraints, in addition to the presence of a critical surface which sets the
boundaries of the hadronic world, enter the extended model. An analysis
pertaining to produced particle multiplicities and ratios is performed for the
S+Ag interaction at 200 GeV/nucleon. The resulting evaluation, concerning the
location of the source of the produced system, is slightly in favor the source
being outside the hadronic domain.
