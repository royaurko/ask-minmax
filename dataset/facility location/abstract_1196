The traditional Power Grid has been designed in a hierarchical fashion, with
Energy pushed from the large scale production facilities towards the end users.
But with the increasing availability of micro and medium scale generating
facilities, the situation is changing. Many end users can now produce energy
and share it over the Power Grid. Naturally, end users need to have incentives
to do so and might want to be able to act in an open decentralized energy
market. In the present work, we offer a novel analysis of the Medium and Low
Voltage Power Grids of the North Netherlands using statistical tools from the
Complex Network Analysis field. We use a weighted model based on actual Grid
data and propose a set of statistical measures to evaluate the adequacy of the
current infrastructure for a decentralized energy market. Further, we use the
insight gained by the analysis to propose parameters that tie the statistical
topological measures to economic factors that might influence the
attractiveness to the end users in participating in such a decentralized energy
market, thus identifying what are the important topological parameters to work
on to facilitate such open decentralized markets.
