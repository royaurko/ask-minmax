An analysis of the analytical solution of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation (which
is a second order differential equation) for $H_2^+$ shows that the second
linear independent solution of this equation is a square integrable function
and therefore the ground state total wave function is a linear combination of
two linear independent wave functions of different space symmetry: cylindrical
and spherical. The wave function of cylindrical symmetry is well known. It has
maxima at the positions of nuclei. The wave function of spherical symmetry and
the corresponding spherical electron distribution, which exists at $R\neq0$ and
locates at the middle of the bond, represents a quasiatom of electron density
of non-nuclear united atom. In the light of the new result the qualitative
behavior of the ground state wave function and the electron density of $H_2^+$
has been reinvestigated. It is shown analytically that a transformation of the
total molecular wave function with two maxima to that one with one maximum
passes through a flat wave function. The presented three-dimension figures of
the electron density visualize the spherical component of the total wave
function and its transformation with increasing internuclear separation.
