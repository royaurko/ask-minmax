We propose that a pair of electron linacs with high accelerating gradients
and an optical FEL be built at an existing laboratory. The linacs would employ
CLIC-type rf cavities and a klystron-based power source; a two-beam scheme
could be implemented at a later stage. The proposed facility would serve
primarily as an e+e-/gamma-gamma Higgs-boson factory. The rich set of final
states in e+e- and gamma-gamma collisions would play an essential role in
measuring the mass, spin, parity, two-photon width and trilinear self-coupling
of the Higgs-boson, as well as its couplings to fermions and gauge bosons.
These quantities are more difficult to determine with only one initial state.
For some processes within and beyond the Standard Model, the required CM energy
is considerably lower at the proposed facility than at an e+e- or proton
collider.
