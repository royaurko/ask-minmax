We present the first systematic study of timing and spectral diagrams of
magnetic video-pulse influence on the NMR two-pulse echo in a number of magnets
(ferromagnets, ferrites, half metals, intermetals). It is shown that the timing
diagrams showing the dependence of two-pulse echo intensity on the temporal
location of a magnetic video-pulse in respect to radio-frequency pulses and the
spectral diagrams of this influence are defined mainly by the local hyperfine
field anisotropy and domain walls mobility. These diagrams could be used for
the identification of the nature of NMR spectra in multidomain magnetic
materials and to improve the resolution capacity of the NMR method in magnets.
