Accumulation of electrical charge on the end mirrors of gravitational wave
observatories, such as the space-based LISA mission and ground-based LIGO
detectors, can become a source of noise limiting the sensitivity of such
detectors through electronic couplings to nearby surfaces. Torsion balances
provide an ideal means for testing gravitational wave technologies due to their
high sensitivity to small forces. Our torsion pendulum apparatus consists of a
movable Au-coated Cu plate brought near a Au-coated Si plate pendulum suspended
from a non-conducting quartz fiber. A UV LED located near the pendulum
photoejects electrons from the surface, and a UV LED driven electron gun
directs photoelectrons towards the pendulum surface. We have demonstrated both
charging and discharging of the pendulum with equivalent charging rates of
$\sim$$10^5 e/\mathrm{s}$, as well as spectral measurements of the pendulum
charge resulting in a white noise level equivalent to $3\times10^5
e/\sqrt{Hz}$.
