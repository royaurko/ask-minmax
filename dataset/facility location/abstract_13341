We demonstrate numerically the ability to displace a magnetic domain wall by
a remote spin current injection. We consider a long and narrow magnetic
nanostripe with a single domain wall (DW). The spin-polarized current is
injected perpendicularly to the plane of the film (CPP) through a small
nanocontact which is located at certain distance from the domain wall initial
position. We show theoretically that the DW motion can be initiated not only by
conventional spin-transfer torque but also by indirect spin-torque, created by
a remote spin-current injection and then transferred to the DW by the
exchange-spring mechanism. An analytical description of this effect is
proposed. This finding may lead to a solution of bottleneck problems of DW
motion-based spintronic and neuromorphic devices with perpendicular
spin-current injection.
