We study the effects of inhomogeneous influence of individuals on collective
phenomena. We focus analytically on a typical model of the majority rule,
applied to the completely connected agents. Two types of individuals $A$ and
$B$ with different influence activity are introduced. The individuals $A$ and
$B$ are distributed randomly with concentrations $\nu$ and $1-\nu$ at the
beginning and fixed further on. Our main result is that the location of the
order-disorder transition is affected due to the introduction of the
inhomogeneous influence. This result highlights the importance of inhomogeneous
influence between different types of individuals during the process of opinion
updating.
