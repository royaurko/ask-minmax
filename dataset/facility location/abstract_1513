Long-baseline interferometry at optical and near-infrared wavelengths is an
emerging technology which is quickly becoming a useful tool to investigate
stellar atmospheres and to compare observations with models. Stellar atmosphere
models have so far mainly been constrained by comparisons with stellar spectra
which are integrated over the stellar disks. Interferometric observations
provide spatially and spectrally resolved information and can thus provide
important complementary observational information which can be compared to
model predictions. Here, I summarize the different aspects on this topic which
were discussed at a round table on Thursday, June 20, 2002, during IAU
Symposium 210. This summary gives an overview on discussed interferometric
facilities and techniques, concepts to study atmospheres by optical
interferometry, and particular classes of objects. We conclude that more
frequent interactions between the efforts of atmosphere modelling and
interferometric observations promise to lead to increased confidence in stellar
model atmospheres and to further advancement of the field in the next years.
