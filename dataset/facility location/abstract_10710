A depth-based rank sum statistic for multivariate data introduced by Liu and
Singh [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 88 (1993) 252--260] as an extension of the
Wilcoxon rank sum statistic for univariate data has been used in multivariate
rank tests in quality control and in experimental studies. Those applications,
however, are based on a conjectured limiting distribution, provided by Liu and
Singh [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 88 (1993) 252--260]. The present paper proves
the conjecture under general regularity conditions and, therefore, validates
various applications of the rank sum statistic in the literature. The paper
also shows that the corresponding rank sum tests can be more powerful than
Hotelling's T^2 test and some commonly used multivariate rank tests in
detecting location-scale changes in multivariate distributions.
