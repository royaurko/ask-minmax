A monolayer graphene exists in an environment where a uniform magnetic field
interacts a spatially modulated magnetic field. The spatially modulated
magnetic field could affect Landau levels due to a uniform magnetic field. The
modulation effects on Landau levels are investigated through the Peierl's
tight-binding model. The magneto-electronic properties are dominated by the
period, the strength, and the direction of a spatially modulated magnetic
field. Such a field could induce the growth in dimensionality, the change of
energy dispersions, the destroy of state degeneracy, and the creation of
band-edge states. There are a robust Landau level at Fermi level and 1D
parabolic subbands located around the original Landau levels, which make
density of states exhibit a delta-function-like structure and many pairs of
asymmetric peak structure, respectively. The density of states and the energies
of band-edge states strongly depend on the strength, but not on the period and
the direction.
