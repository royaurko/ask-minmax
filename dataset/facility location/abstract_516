This paper discusses a new protocol implementing authentication in a
multi-located environment that avoids man-in-the-middle (MIM) attack, replay
attack and provides privacy, integrity of a message for multi-located parties.
The protocol uses the concept that each party is associated with a subsidiary
agent.
