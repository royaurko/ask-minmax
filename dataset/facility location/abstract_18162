Exclusive neutral-pion electroproduction ($ep\to e^\prime p^\prime \pi^0$)
was measured at Jefferson Lab with a 5.75-GeV electron beam and the CLAS
detector. Differential cross sections $d^4\sigma/dtdQ^2dx_Bd\phi_\pi$ and
structure functions $\sigma_T+\epsilon\sigma_L, \sigma_{TT}$ and $\sigma_{LT}$
as functions of $t$ were obtained over a wide range of $Q^2$ and $x_B$. The
data are compared with Regge and handbag theoretical calculations. Analyses in
both frameworks find that a large dominance of transverse processes is
necessary to explain the experimental results. For the Regge analysis it is
found that the inclusion of vector meson rescattering processes is necessary to
bring the magnitude of the calculated and measured structure functions into
rough agreement. In the handbag framework, there are two independent
calculations, both of which appear to roughly explain the magnitude of the
structure functions in terms of transversity generalized parton distributions.
