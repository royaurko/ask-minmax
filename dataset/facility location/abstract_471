Spatial distribution of intensity, degree and direction of linear
polarization of tagged photon beam, which is obtained due to Compton
backscattering of laser light on high-energy electron beam, are calculated.
Effects of angular dispersion and spatial spread of electron beam are taken
into account. Calculations have been carried out for the example of LEGS
facility.
