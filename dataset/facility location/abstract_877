At the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF) at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory (ORNL), molecular ions extracted from a positive ion source and
subsequently broken up in a charge exchange cell produce Radioactive Ion Beams
(RIBs) with several hundred eV energy spread, preventing effective magnetic
isobar separation. In order to perform magnetic isobar separation prior to
charge exchange, a multi-harmonic buncher and a 12 MHz RFQ (Radio-Frequency
Quadrupole) is proposed to supplement the present 300 kV injection system for
the 25 MV tandem electrostatic accelerator. The RFQ will be mounted on a
variable high voltage platform to accelerate ions with masses from 10 to 150
amu.
