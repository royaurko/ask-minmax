The location of the critical end point of QCD has been determined in previous
studies of $N_f=2+1$ and $N_f=2+1+1$ dynamical quark flavors using a
(truncated) set of Dyson-Schwinger equations for the quark and gluon
propagators of Landau-gauge QCD. A source for systematic errors in these
calculations has been the omission of terms in the quark-gluon interaction that
can be parametrized in terms of baryonic degrees of freedom. These have a
potentially large dependence on chemical potential and therefore may affect the
location of the critical end point. In this exploratory study we estimate the
effects of these contributions, both in the vacuum and at finite temperature
and chemical potential. We find only a small influence of baryonic
contributions on the location of the critical end point. We estimate the
robustness of this result by parameterizing further dependencies on chemical
potential.
