A method for obtaining asteroseismological information of a Gamma Doradus
oscillating star showing at least three pulsation frequencies is presented.
This method is based on a first-order asymptotic g-mode expression, in
agreement with the internal structure of Gamma Doradus stars. The information
obtained is twofold: 1) a possible identification of the radial order n and
degree l of observed frequencies (assuming that these have the same l), and 2)
an estimate of the integral of the buoyancy frequency (Brunt-Vaisala) weighted
over the stellar radius along the radiative zone. The accuracy of the method as
well as its theoretical consistency are also discussed for a typical Gamma
Doradus stellar model. Finally, the frequency ratios method has been tested
with observed frequencies of the Gamma Doradus star HD 12901. The number of
representative models verifying the complete set of constraints (the location
in the HR diagram, the Brunt-Vaisala frequency integral, the observed
metallicity and frequencies and a reliable identification of n and l) is
drastically reduced to six.
