The FORG (Fibre Optic Resonant Gyroscope) opeeration principle uses a
recirculating ring resonant cavity to get a rotation-induced Sagnac effect
enhancement (cited by Ezekiel and Balsamo). It grants to a FORG a comparable
sensitivity in relation an I-FOG (Interferometric Fibre Optic Gyroscope)that
has the fiber lenght equal a half of finesse factor times longer. Other
advantages is despite of thermal drift because the FORG uses less quantity of
fibre than the I-FOG, giving to the first less thermal drift sensitivity than
the last. The proposal of this work is to show a applied to a FORG technique
that simplifies the signal treatment, employing all digital setup, resulting in
a maximally flat scale factor. In this investigation are presented over the
simulations results, employing the modified digital FM spectrometry techniques
by decimation and interpolation techniques over a ring resonator that pursuit a
10 meters SM-PM lenght fiber coil and 10 centimeters of diameter, with a 1550
nanometers laser source. The advantages of these techniques are to simplify the
electronic circuitry, offering an upgrade facility, using only one DSP (Digital
Signal Processor), realizing all needed functions. The investigation of this
method is based in a optical field switching scheme and digital frequency
domain spectrometry.
