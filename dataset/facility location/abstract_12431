The diffusion characteristics of stable aqueous dispersion of "single-nano
buckydiamond" concentration 80 mg/ml, average particle size 8 nm and pure water
as the reference system were investigated by quasielastic neutron scattering.
The difference of these spectra were analyzed by two ways. In the first way
dispersion water was described as the two-component system, consisted of bulk
water and a small additive having presumably the lorentzian form (Hydration
water, HW). This additive is located in the nearest surrounding of nano-diamond
particle. The second approach included the direct subtraction of dispersion
water and bulk water spectra, properly normalized in the regions of their
wings, where the influence of HW can be neglected. For both cases of analysis,
the relative fraction HW appeared to be about 3%. HW was found to have
diffusive mobility which is retarded as compared to bulk water due to the
weakening of the rotational component of diffusion and the increased residence
lifetime of molecules.
