In view of the advent of large-scale neutrino detectors such as IceCube, the
future Hyper-Kamiokande and the ones proposed for the Laguna project in Europe,
we re-examine the determination of the directional position of a Galactic
supernova by means of its neutrinos using the triangulation method. We study
the dependence of the pointing accuracy on the arrival time resolution of
supernova neutrinos at different detectors. For a failed supernova, we expect
better results due to the abrupt termination of the neutrino emission which
allows one to measure the arrival time with higher precision. We found that for
the time resolution of $\pm$ 2 (4) ms, the supernova can be located with a
precision of $\sim$ 5 (10)$^\circ$ on the declination and of $\sim$ 8
(15)$^\circ$ on the right ascension angle, if we combine the observations from
detectors at four different sites.
