We consider a monotone increasing operator in an ordered Banach space having
$u_-$ and $u_+$ as a strong super- and subsolution, respectively. In contrast
with the well studied case $u_+ < u_-$, we suppose that $u_- < u_+$. Under the
assumption that the order cone is normal and minihedral, we prove the existence
of a fixed point located in the ordered interval $[u_-,u_+].$
