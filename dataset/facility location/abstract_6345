We study the fate of a spin-1/2 impurity in the itinerant antiferromagnetic
metallic phase via a renormalization group analysis and a variational
calculation. The local moment - conduction electron interaction hamiltonian in
an antiferromagnetic metal is spin non-conserving. We show that for a general
location of the impurity, the Kondo singularities still occur, but the ground
state has a partially unscreened moment. We calculate the magnitude of this
residual moment and the variation of the spin polarization with energy for a
substitutional impurity as a function of the staggered magnetization. The usual
Kondo effect only occurs if the impurity is placed at points where the
magnetization is zero.
