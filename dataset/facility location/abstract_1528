We derive general equations for non-linearity corrections and statistical
uncertainty (variance) estimates for data acquired with near-infrared detectors
employing correlated double sampling, multiple correlated double sampling
(Fowler sampling) and uniformly-spaced continuous readout techniques. We
compare our equation for the variance on each pixel associated with Fowler
sampling with measurements obtained from data taken with the array installed in
the near-infrared cross-dispersed spectrograph (SpeX) at the NASA Infrared
Telescope Facility and find that it provides an accurate representation of the
empirical results. This comparison also reveals that the read noise associated
with a single readout of the SpeX array increases with the number of
non-destructive reads, n_r, as n_r^0.16. This implies that the {effective} read
noise of a stored image decreases as n_r^-0.34, shallower than the expected
rate of n_r^-0.5. The cause of this read noise behavior is uncertain, but may
be due to heating of the array as a result of the multiple read outs. Such
behavior may be generic to arrays that employ correlated or multiple correlated
double sampling readouts.
