An R Coronae Borealis (RCB) star is a rare type of supergiant star that is
increasingly thought to be the evolved merger product of two white dwarfs.
Recently, many of them have been found distributed in a thin disk structure
embedded inside the Galactic Bulge. This unexpected high density can give us
more insight into the nature and age of RCB stars. We applied and tested
successfully a new technique to find RCB stars based on the particular infrared
emission. We demonstrated that RCB stars can now be found without the need of a
light curve analysis, and therefore outside optically monitored fields. The
selection of RCB candidates was based on their near-infrared excess and on
particular mid-infrared emission of RCB shells, using photometric data from the
2MASS and Spitzer/GLIMPSE surveys. The OGLE light curves of all RCB candidates
were then inspected visually and the ones presenting large and fast declines
were followed-up spectroscopically . We discovered two new R Coronae Borealis
stars, but also propose four new candidates. We stress that all of the 7 known
RCB stars located in both Spitzer/GLIMPSE and OGLE-III fields were
re-discovered, which indicates the high efficiency of our analysis. The
proposed new technique to find RCB stars has been successful. It can now be
extented to larger area, specially where the instellar extinction is too high
to have been monitored by microlensing surveys, i.e the inner part of the
Galactic Bulge.
