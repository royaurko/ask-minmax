The 10-antenna prototype of the multifrequency Siberian radioheliograph is
described. The prototype consists of four parts: antennas with broadband
front-ends, analog back-ends, digital receivers and a correlator. The prototype
antennas are mounted on the outermost stations of the Siberian Solar Radio
Telescope (SSRT) array. A signal from each antenna is transmitted to a workroom
by an analog fiber optical link, laid in an underground tunnel. After mixing,
all signals are digitized and processed by digital receivers before the data
are transmitted to the correlator. The digital receivers and the correlator are
accessible by the LAN. The frequency range of the prototype is from 4 to 8 GHz.
Currently the frequency switching observing mode is used. The prototype data
include both circular polarizations at a number of frequencies given by a list.
This prototype is the first stage of the multifrequency Siberian
radioheliograph development. It is assumed that the radioheliograph will
consist of 96 antennas and will occupy stations of the West-East-South subarray
of the SSRT. The radioheliograph will be fully constructed in autumn of 2012.
We plan to reach the brightness temperature sensitivity about 100 K for the
snapshot image, a spatial resolution up to 13 arcseconds at 8 GHz and
polarization measurement accuracy about a few percent.
  First results with the 10-antenna prototype are presented of observations of
solar microwave bursts. The prototype abilities to estimate source size and
locations at different frequencies are discussed.
