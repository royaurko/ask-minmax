Data from earthquake measurements using a Nano-Resolution Pressure Sensor and
a co-located Ocean Bottom Seismometer have been compared and analyzed. It is
shown that the Nano-Resolution Pressure Sensor can serve as a vertical OBS.
Moreover, using the pressure sensor in conjunction with a seismometer helps to
separate the ocean and seismic signals.
