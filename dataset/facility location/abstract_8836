The ``current wisdom'' regarding the structuring of the X-ray emitting corona
in active stars (i.e. a corona dominated by extended coronal structures) is
briefly reviewed, followed by a review of a new approach to flare analysis and
the analysis of a significant number of newly observed and previously published
large flares, all leading to a much more compactly structured corona. Recent
observations showing the polar location of the flaring plasma are then
discussed, showing how the current evidence points toward a (flaring) corona
composed of rather low-lying polar structures, also in agreement with some
recent radio VLBI observational results and with starspot Doppler images. The
resulting picture is significantly different from the solar case.
