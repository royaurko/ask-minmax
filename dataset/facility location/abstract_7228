In recent years a wealth of data and detailed hydrodynamical simulations have
appeared that show the effects of interactions between the ICM and galaxies.
Single dish observations show that cluster galaxies are deficient in their HI
content out to 2 Abell radii. The deficient galaxies tend to be on radial
orbits. Imaging of the HI distribution in individual galaxies shows a
remarkable trend of HI extent with location in the cluster. These trends can be
reproduced in simulations of ram pressure stripping by the ICM using SPH and 3D
hydro-codes. Detailed imaging of individual galaxies shows in some caes
undisturbed old stellar disks, truncated gas disks that are much smaller than
the stellar disks, asymmetric extraplanar gas in the center and enhanced
central star formation. These phenomena have all been predicted by
hydrodynamical simulations. Optical imaging and spectroscopic surveys show that
small HI disks go together with truncated star forming disks, that HI
deficiency correlates with suppressed star formation rates and that the spatial
extent of HI deficiency in clusters is matched by or even surpassed by the
extent of reduced star formation rates. Recent volume limited HI imaging
surveys of clusters in the local universe show that most gas rich galaxies are
located in groups and subclumps, that yet have to fall into the clusters. In
these groups we see much evidence for interactions between gas rich galaxies.
