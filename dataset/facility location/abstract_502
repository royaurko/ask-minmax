We present a collection of MATLAB routines using discontinuous Galerkin
finite elements method (DGFEM) for solving steady-state
diffusion-convection-reaction equations. The code employs the sparse matrix
facilities of MATLAB with "vectorization" and uses multiple matrix
multiplications {\it "MULTIPROD"} to increase the efficiency of the program.
