We present high-speed photometric observations of ZZ Ceti white dwarf
candidates drawn from the spectroscopic survey of bright DA stars from the
Villanova White Dwarf Catalog by Gianninas et al., and from the recent
spectroscopic survey of white dwarfs within 40 parsecs of the Sun by Limoges et
al. We report the discovery of six new ZZ Ceti pulsators from these surveys,
and several photometrically constant DA white dwarfs, which we then use to
refine the location of the ZZ Ceti instability strip.
