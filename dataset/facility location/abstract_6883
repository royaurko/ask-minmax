We address the possibility to control high power pulses extracted from the
maximally compressed pulse in a nonlinear optical fiber by adjusting the
initial excitation parameters. The numerical results show that the power,
location and splitting order number of the maximally compressed pulse and the
transmission features of high power pulses extracted from the maximally
compressed pulse can be manipulated through adjusting the modulation amplitude,
width, and phase of the initial Gaussian-type perturbation pulse on a
continuous wave background.
