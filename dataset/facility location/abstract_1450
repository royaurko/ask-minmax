This is the first paper in a series aimed at defining a statistically
significant sample of QSOs in the range $ 15 < B < 18.75$ and $ 0.3 < z < 2.2$.
The selection is carried out using direct plates obtained at the ESO and UK
Schmidt Telescopes, scanned with the COSMOS facility and searched for objects
with an ultraviolet excess. Follow-up spectroscopy, carried out at ESO La
Silla, is used to classify each candidate. In this initial paper, we describe
the scientific objectives of the survey; the selection and observing techniques
used. We present the first sample of 285 QSOs ($M_B < -23$) in a 153 deg$^2$
area, covered by the six ``deep'' fields, intended to obtain significant
statistics down $B \simeq 18.75$ with unprecedented photometric accuracy. From
this database, QSO counts are determined in the magnitude range $ 17 < B <
18.75$.
