Using zero temperature Monte Carlo simulations we have studied the magnetic
hysteresis in a three-dimensional Ising model with nearest neighbor exchange
and dipolar interaction. The average magnetization of spins located inside a
sphere on a cubic lattice is determined as a function of magnetic field varied
periodically. The simulations have justified the appearance of hysteresis and
allowed us to have a deeper insight into the series of metastable states
developed during this process.
