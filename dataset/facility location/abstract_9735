To understand how the human visual system analyzes images, it is essential to
know the structure of the visual environment. In particular, natural images
display consistent statistical properties that distinguish them from random
luminance distributions. We have studied the geometric regularities of oriented
elements (edges or line segments) present in an ensemble of visual scenes,
asking how much information the presence of a segment in a particular location
of the visual scene carries about the presence of a second segment at different
relative positions and orientations. We observed strong long-range correlations
in the distribution of oriented segments that extend over the whole visual
field. We further show that a very simple geometric rule, cocircularity,
predicts the arrangement of segments in natural scenes, and that different
geometrical arrangements show relevant differences in their scaling properties.
Our results show similarities to geometric features of previous physiological
and psychophysical studies. We discuss the implications of these findings for
theories of early vision.
