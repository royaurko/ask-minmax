Consider the system of particles on ${\Bbb Z}^d$ where particles are of two
types, $A$ and $B$, and execute simple random walks in continuous time.
Particles do not interact with their own type, but when a type $A$ particle
meets a type $B$ particle, both disappear. Initially, particles are assumed to
be distributed according to homogeneous Poisson random fields, with equal
intensities for the two types. This system serves as a model for the chemical
reaction $A+B\to inert$. In [BrLe91a], the densities of the two types of
particles were shown to decay asymptotically like $1/t^{d/4}$ for $d<4$ and
$1/t$ for $d\geq 4$, as $t\to\infty$. This change in behavior from low to high
dimensions corresponds to a change in spatial structure. In $d<4$, particle
types segregate, with only one type present locally. After suitable rescaling,
the process converges to a limit, with density given by a Gaussian process. In
$d>4$, both particle types are, at large times, present locally in
concentrations not depending on the type, location or realization. In $d=4$,
both particle types are present locally, but with varying concentrations. Here,
we analyze this behavior in $d<4$; the behavior for $d\geq 4$ will be handled
in a future work [BrLe99].
