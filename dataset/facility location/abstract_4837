We use Chandra observations to estimate the accretion rate of hot gas onto
the central supermassive black hole in four giant (of stellar mass 10E11 -
10E12 solar masses) early-type galaxies located in the Virgo cluster. They are
characterized by an extremely low radio luminosity, in the range L < 3E25 -
10E27 erg/s/Hz. We find that, accordingly, accretion in these objects occurs at
an extremely low rate, 0.2 - 3.7 10E-3 solar masses per year, and that they
smoothly extend the relation accretion - jet power found for more powerful
radio-galaxies. This confirms the dominant role of hot gas and of the galactic
coronae in powering radio-loud active galactic nuclei across ~ 4 orders of
magnitude in luminosity. A suggestive trend between jet power and location
within the cluster also emerges.
