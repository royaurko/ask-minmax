The locations of long GRBs and stripped supernovae are compared to those of
their favored progenitors, WR stars, and their sub-classes. Compared to
Leloudas et al. (2010), we have doubled the number of galaxies with suitable WR
data. In the combined sample, WC stars are found, on average, in brighter
locations than WN stars. The WN distribution is fully consistent with the one
of SNe Ib, while it is inconsistent with those of SNe II, Ic and GRBs. The WC
distribution is both consistent with SNe Ib and Ic. It is inconsistent with SNe
II, and marginally consistent with GRBs. Furthermore, we present a
spectroscopic study of the locations of SNe Ib/c. The average metallicity in
the environments of SNe Ic is found to be a little higher than for SNe Ib, but
the difference is small and not significant within our sample. Under the
assumption that the SN regions were formed in an instantaneous burst of star
formation, we find that a fraction of them appear older than what is allowed in
order to host SNe Ib/c from single massive stars. Within this framework, these
SNe must come from lower mass binaries.
