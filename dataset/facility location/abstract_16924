Since it is not possible to predict when a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) will occur
or when Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) flaring activity starts,
follow-up/monitoring ground telescopes must be located as uniformly as possible
all over the world in order to collect data simultaneously with Fermi and Swift
detections. However, there is a distinct gap in follow-up coverage of
telescopes in the eastern U.S. region based on the operations of Swift.
Motivated by this fact, we have constructed a 14" fully automated optical
robotic telescope, Goddard Robotic Telescope (GRT), at the Goddard Geophysical
and Astronomical Observatory. The aims of our robotic telescope are 1) to
follow-up Swift/Fermi GRBs and 2) to perform the coordinated optical
observations of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) AGN. Our telescope system
consists of off-the-shelf hardware. With the focal reducer, we are able to
match the field of view of Swift narrow instruments (20' x 20'). We started
scientific observations in mid-November 2008 and GRT has been fully remotely
operated since August 2009. The 3 sigma upper limit in a 30-second exposure in
the R filter is ~15.4 mag; however, we can reach to ~18 mag in a 600-second
exposures. Due to the weather condition at the telescope site, our observing
efficiency is 30-40% on average.
