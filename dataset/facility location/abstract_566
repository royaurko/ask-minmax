The High-Energy Storage Ring (HESR) of the future International Facility for
Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) at GSI in Darmstadt is planned as an
anti-proton cooler ring in the momentum range from 1.5 to 15 GeV/c. An
important and challenging feature of the new facility is the combination of
highly dense phase space cooled beams with internal targets. A detailed
numerical and analytical approach to the Fokker-Planck equation for
longitudinal filter cooling including the beam - target interaction has been
carried out to demonstrate the stochastic cooling capability. To gain
confidence in the model predictions a series of experimental stochastic cooling
studies with the internal target ANKE at COSY have been carried out. A
remarkable agreement between model and experiment was achieved. On this basis
longitudinal stochastic cooling simulations were performed to predict the
possibilities and limits of cooling when the newly installed WASA Pellet-target
is operated.
