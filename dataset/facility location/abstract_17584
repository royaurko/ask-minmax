In this paper we investigate the formation of Uranus and Neptune, according
to the core-nucleated accretion model, considering formation locations ranging
from 12 to 30 AU from the Sun, and with various disk solid-surface densities
and core accretion rates. It is shown that in order to form Uranus-like and
Neptune-like planets in terms of final mass and solid-to-gas ratio, very
specific conditions are required. We also show that when recently proposed high
solid accretion rates are assumed, along with solid surface densities about 10
times those in the minimum-mass solar nebula, the challenge in forming Uranus
and Neptune at large radial distances is no longer the formation timescale, but
is rather finding agreement with the final mass and composition of these
planets. In fact, these conditions are more likely to lead to gas-giant
planets. Scattering of planetesimals by the forming planetary core is found to
be an important effect at the larger distances. Our study emphasizes how (even
slightly) different conditions in the protoplanetary disk and the birth
environment of the planetary embryos can lead to the formation of very
different planets in terms of final masses and compositions (solid-to-gas
ratios), which naturally explains the large diversity of intermediate-mass
exoplanets.
