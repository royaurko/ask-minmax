Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory is constructing a superconducting 1.3
GHz cryomodule test facility located at the New Muon Lab building. The facility
will be used for testing and validating cryomodule designs as well as support
systems. For the initial phase of the project, a single Type III plus 1.3 GHz
cryomodule will be cooled and tested using a single Tevatron style standalone
refrigerator. Subsequent phases involve testing as many as two full RF units
consisting of up to six 1.3 GHz cryomodules with the addition of a new
cryogenic plant. The cryogenic infrastructure consists of the refrigerator
system, cryogenic distribution system as well as an ambient temperature pumping
system to achieve 2 K operations with supporting purification systems. A
discussion of the available capacity for the various phases versus the proposed
heat loads is included as well as commissioning results and testing schedule.
This paper describes the plans, status and challenges of this initial phase of
the New Muon Lab cryogenic system.
