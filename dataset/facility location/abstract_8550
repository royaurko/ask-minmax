After a quarter of a century of gamma-ray burst (GRB) astronomy, the
Italian-Dutch satellite BeppoSAX on Feb 28th, 1997 detected a soft X-ray
afterglow from GRB 970228 and positioned it accurately. This made possible the
successful detection of an optical transient. Two public Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) images of the GRB/optical transient region were taken on March 26th and
April 7th, 1997. They are analyzed here, with the purpose of understanding the
nature of GRB 970228. We find that the position of the faint point-like object
V ~ 26 seen at the transient location changed by 0.40 +/-0.10 pixels in 12
days, corresponding to a proper motion of ~ 550 mas/year. By comparison, four
adjacent sources in the same field do not show any significant displacement,
with astrometric residuals close to zero and average absolute displacements
less than 0.09 pixels. If confirmed, this result would strongly support the
galactic nature of GRB 970228.
