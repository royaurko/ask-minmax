We have carried out radio studies of the surroundings of the superluminal
microquasar GRS~1915+105. Our main goal was to understand the possible relation
of GRS~1915+105 with two infrared/radio sources that appear symmetrically
located with respect to GRS~1915+105 and aligned with the position angle of the
relativistic ejecta. We have also studied a nearby supernova remnant to test if
the event that created the remnant could have been the progenitor of this hard
X-ray binary.
