We present detailed comparisons between high quality observational
colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of open star clusters and synthetic CMDs based
on MonteCarlo numerical simulations. The comparisons account for all of the
main parameters which determine the shape of the CMD for a stellar population.
For the four clusters studied, NGC 6819, NGC 2099 (M37), NGC 2168 (M35) and NGC
2323 (M50), we derive reddening, distance, age, binary fraction, star formation
rate and indicative metallicity by comparing the locations and density of
points in the observed CMDs to the simulated CMDs. We estimate the
uncertainties related to stellar evolution theories by adopting various sets of
stellar models for all of the synthetic CMDs and discuss which stellar models
provide the theoretical CMDs that best reproduce the observations.
