We discuss models for coronal abundance anomalies observed in the coronae of
the sun and other late-type stars following a scenario first introduced by
Schwadron, Fisk & Zurbuchen of the interaction of waves at loop footpoints with
the partially neutral gas. Instead of considering wave heating of ions in this
location, we explore the effects on the upper chromospheric plasma of the wave
ponderomotive forces. These can arise as upward propagating waves from the
chromosphere transmit or reflect upon reaching the chromosphere-corona
boundary, and are in large part determined by the properties of the coronal
loop above. Our scenario has the advantage that for realistic wave energy
densities, both positive and negative changes in the abundance of ionized
species compared to neutrals can result, allowing both FIP and Inverse FIP
effects to come out of the model. We discuss how variations in model parameters
can account for essentially all of the abundance anomalies observed in solar
spectra. Expected variations with stellar spectral type are also qualitatively
consistent with observations of the FIP effect in stellar coronae.
