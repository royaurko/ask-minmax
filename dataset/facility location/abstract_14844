We present new Hubble Space Telescope, high-resolution optical imaging of the
submm luminous Lyman-break galaxy, Westphal-MMD11, an interacting starburst at
z=2.979. The new imaging data, in conjunction with re-analysis of Keck optical
and near-IR spectra, demonstrate MMD11 to be an interacting system of at least
three components: a luminous blue source, a fainter blue source, and an
extremely red object (ERO) with R-K>6. The separations between components are
\~8 kpc (Lambda=0.7, Omega_M=0.3, h=0.65), similar to some of the local
ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIGs). The lack of obvious AGN in MMD11,
along with the fragmented, early stage merger morphology, suggest a young
forming environment. While we cannot unambiguously identify the location of the
far-IR emission within the system, analogy to similar ULIGs suggests the ERO as
the likely far-IR source. The >10^{12} L_sun bolometric luminosity of MMD11 can
be predicted reasonably from its rest frame UV properties once all components
are taken into account, however this is not typically the case for local
galaxies of similar luminosities. While LBGs as red in g-R and R-K as MMD11 are
rare, they can only be found over the restricted 2.7 < z < 3.0 range. Therefore
a substantial number of MMD11-like galaxies (~<0.62 arcmin^{-2}) may exist when
integrated over the likely redshift range of SCUBA sources (z=1 -5), suggesting
that SCUBA sources should not necessarily be seen as completely orthogonal to
optically selected galaxies.
