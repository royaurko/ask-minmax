This work is part of an effort to provide more experimental data for the
(n,n'x) reaction. The experiments were carried out at The Svedberg Laboratory
in Uppsala, Sweden, at the quasi-mono-energetic neutron beam of 96 MeV, before
the facility was upgraded in 2004. Using an extended data analysis of data
primarily intended for measuring elastic neutron scattering only, it was found
to be possible to extract information on the inelastic scattering from several
nuclei. In the preliminary data analysis, an iterative forward-folding
technique was applied, in which a physically reasonable trial spectrum was
folded with the response function of the detector system and the output was
compared to the experimental data. As a result, double-differential cross
sections and angular distributions of inelastic neutron scattering from 12-C,
56-Fe, 89-Y and 208-Pb could be obtained. In this paper, a status update on the
efforts to improve the description of the detector response function is given.
