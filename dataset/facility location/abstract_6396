This paper describes the so-called 1/f noise generated within the depleted
region below a free semiconducting surface. It was shown that there is a link
between the 1/f noise, which can be controlled by the band-bending, and the
very narrow energy states (E<<kT) located on the top surface and vanishing into
the bulk region. Also, it was shown that the noise can be lowered when the
band-bending is reduced. A quantitative description of this reduction was
provided. This study considered the n-type semiconductor.
