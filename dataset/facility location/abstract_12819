The high-energy-peaked BL Lac H 2356-309 (z=0.165) was detected by HESS at
very high energies (VHE, >100 GeV) with relatively high significance in the
years 2004-2007, allowing a good determination of its gamma-ray spectrum. After
correction for the interaction with the diffuse extragalactic background light
(EBL), the VHE spectrum is flat (Gamma~1.9-2) over a decade in energy, locating
the gamma-ray peak around or above 0.6-1 TeV. This is remarkably at odds with
the interpretation and modeling provided by HESS, which do not correspond to
the source properties and can be excluded with high confidence. The overall
GeV-to-TeV characteristics of H 2356-309 seem intermediate between the
"TeV-peaked" (Fermi-faint) and "100 GeV-peaked" (Fermi-bright) BL Lac objects,
and difficult to reconcile with the shape of the synchrotron emission in a
single-zone SSC scenario.
