The interrelation between the epitaxial strain and oxygen deficiency in
La0.7Ca0.3MnO3-{\delta} thin films was studied in terms of structural and
functional properties. The films with a thickness of 1000{\AA} were prepared
using a PLD system equipped with a RHEED facility and a pyrometric film
temperature control. The epitaxial strain and the oxygen deficiency in the
samples were systematically modified using three different substrates: SrTiO3,
(LaAlO3)0.3-(Sr2AlTaO6)0.7 and LaSrAlO4, and four different oxygen pressures
during film growth ranging from 0.27mbar to 0.1mbar. It could be demonstrated
that the oxygen incorporation depends on the epitaxial strain: oxygen vacancies
were induced to accommodate tensile strain whereas the compressive strain
suppressed the generation of oxygen vacancies.
