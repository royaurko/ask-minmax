We derived the distance to the central region of the Sagittarius dwarf
spheroidal galaxy from the Red Giant Branch Tip. The obtained distance modulus
is $(m-M)_0=17.10\pm0.15$, corresponding to a heliocentric distance
$D=26.30\pm1.8$ Kpc. This estimate is in good agreement with the distance
obtained from RR Lyrae stars of the globular cluster M~54, located in the core
of the Sgr galaxy, once the most accurate estimate of the cluster metallicity
and the most recent calibration of the $M_V(RRLy) vs.[Fe/H]$ relation are
adopted.
