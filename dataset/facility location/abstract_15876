In this note, we will discuss two aspects of brane-antibrane forces. In one
aspect, we generalize the force calculation of D0-${\bar {\rm D}}$0 of Banks
and Susskind to Dp-${\bar {\rm D}}p$ for $1\le p \leq 8$. In particular, we
find that the force is also divergent for p = 1 while for the other cases ($p
\ge 2$) the forces are in general finite when $Z \to 0^+$, where $Z =
\frac{Y^2}{2\pi^2\alpha'} - 1$ with Y, the brane-antibrane separation. However,
the forces are divergent for all cases when Z < 0, signalling the occurrence of
open string tachyon condensation in this regime. The other deals with the
puzzling static nature of the supergravity brane-antibrane configurations. We
will show that the force on a brane probe due to a brane-antibrane background
vanishes when the probe is placed at the location of the coincident
brane-antibranes, thereby providing a direct evidence for the existence of
general static brane-antibrane configuration in the supergravity approximation.
