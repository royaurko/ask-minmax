The influence of a superconducting fault current limiter (FCL) on the
transient stability of the synchronic operation of electric machines is
analyzed for different locations of the inductive FCL in a network and for
different parameters of the device. It is shown that the stability can be
improved or degraded depending on the FCL impedance under a fault and the time
of the recovery of the initial state of the limiter after a fault. Improving
the transient stability with the inductive superconducting FCL is demonstrated
in the experiments on the electrodynamic model of a power system. The expansion
of the obtained results for other FCL designs is discussed.
