We report the discovery of a gravitationally lensed quasar resulting from our
survey for lenses in the southern sky. Radio images of PMN J1632-0033 with the
VLA and ATCA exhibit two compact, flat-spectrum components with separation
1.47" and flux density ratio 13.2. Images with the HST reveal the optical
counterparts to the radio components and also the lens galaxy. An optical
spectrum of the bright component, obtained with the first Magellan telescope,
reveals quasar emission lines at redshift 3.42. Deeper radio images with MERLIN
and the VLBA reveal a faint third radio component located near the center of
the lens galaxy, which is either a third image of the background quasar or
faint emission from the lens galaxy.
