In a sensor network with remote sensor devices, it is important to have a
method that can accurately localize a sound event with a small amount of data
transmitted from the sensors. In this paper, we propose a novel method for
localization of a sound source using compressive sensing. Instead of sampling a
large amount of data at the Nyquist sampling rate in time domain, the acoustic
sensors take compressive measurements integrated in time. The compressive
measurements can be used to accurately compute the location of a sound source.
