The proton-rich nucleus 33Ar has been studied by detailed proton and
gamma-ray spectroscopy at the low-energy facility of SPIRAL at GANIL. Proton
and gamma-ray singles and coincidence measurements allowed to establish a quasi
complete decay scheme of this nucleus. By comparing the proton intensity to
different daughter states, tentative spin assignments have been made for some
of the states of 33Cl. The Gamow-Teller strength distribution is deduced and
compared to shell-model calculations and a quenching factor is determined.
States close to the isobaric analogue state are searched for with respect to
isospin mixing.
