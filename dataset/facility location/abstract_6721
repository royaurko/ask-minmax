In this work, we present a model based on a competitive dynamics that intends
to imitate the processes leading to some characteristics of the geopolitical
division. The model departs from very simple principles of geopolitical theory
and geometrical considerations, but succeeds to explain general features
related to the actual process. At the same time, we will propose an
evolutionary explanation to the fact that most capitals (in Eurasia) are
located far from the borders or coasts and, in many cases, close to the
barycenter of the respective countries.
