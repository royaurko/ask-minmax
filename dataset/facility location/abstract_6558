We describe a wavefunction engineering approach to the formation of textures
in a two-component nonrotated Bose-Einstein condensate. By controlling the
phases of wavepackets that combine in a three-wave interference process, a
ballistically-expanding regular lattice-texture is generated, in which the
phases determine the component textures. A particular example is presented of a
lattice-texture composed of half-quantum vortices and spin-2 textures. We
demonstrate the lattice formation with numerical simulations of a viable
experiment, identifying the textures and relating their locations to a linear
theory of wavepacket interference.
