We are in motion against the cosmic backdrop. This motion is evidenced by the
systematic temperature shift - or dipole anisotropy - observed in the Cosmic
Microwave Background radiation (CMB). Because of the Doppler effect, the
temperature of the CMB is 0.1 per cent higher in our direction of motion
through the Universe. If our standard cosmological understanding is correct,
this dipole should also be present as an enhancement in the surface density of
distant galaxies. The main obstacle in finding this signal is the very uneven
distribution of nearby galaxies in the Local Supercluster, which drowns out the
small cosmological imprint. Here we report the first detection of the expected
dipole anisotropy in the galaxy distribution, in a survey of galaxies detected
in radio waves. Radio galaxies are mostly located at cosmological distances, so
the contamination from nearby clusters should be small. With local radio
sources removed, we find a dipole anisotropy in the radio galaxy distribution
in the same direction as the CMB, close to the expected amplitude. This result
is confirmation of the standard cosmological interpretation of the CMB.
