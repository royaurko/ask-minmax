We have investigated the electronic states of the uranium monochalcogenide
US, which is a typical ferromagnetic uranium compound, using soft x-ray
photoemission spectroscopy (SX-PES). In early ultraviolet photoemission
spectroscopy studies, two peak structures of the U 5f states were observed and
have been interpreted that one has an itinerant character around the Fermi
level (EF) and the other located below EF has a character of localized U 5f
electrons. In this study, the intrinsic bulk valence-band spectrum of US was
first deduced by estimating the contribution of surface states to the
valence-band spectrum using core-level photoemission spectra. We conclude that
the electronic structure of US can be basically described by the itinerant
nature of the U 5f electrons from comparison with theoretical valence-band
spectra obtained by band-structure calculation in the local-density
approximation.
