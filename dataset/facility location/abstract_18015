Wireless Gigabit (WiGig) access points (APs) using 60 GHz unlicensed
frequency band are considered as key enablers for future Gbps wireless local
area networks (WLANs). Exhaustive search analog beamforming (BF) is mainly used
with WiGig transmissions to overcome channel propagation loss and accomplish
high rate data transmissions. Due to its short range transmission with high
susceptibility to path blocking, a multiple number of WiGig APs should be
installed to fully cover a typical target environment. Therefore, coordination
among the installed APs is highly needed for enabling WiGig concurrent
transmissions while overcoming packet collisions and reducing interference,
which highly increases the total throughput of WiGig WLANs. In this paper, we
propose a comprehensive architecture for coordinated WiGig WLANs. The proposed
WiGig WLAN is based on a tight coordination between the 5 GHz (WiFi) and the 60
GHz (WiGig) unlicensed frequency bands. By which, the wide coverage WiFi band
is used to do the signaling required for organizing WiGig concurrent data
transmissions using control/user (C/U) plane splitting. To reduce interference
to existing WiGig data links while doing BF, a novel location based BF
mechanism is also proposed based on WiFi fingerprinting. The proposed
coordinated WiGig WLAN highly outperforms conventional un-coordinated one in
terms of total throughput, average packet delay and packet dropping rate.
