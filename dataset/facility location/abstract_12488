The two BL Lac objects, 1ES 1215+303 and 1ES 1218+304, separated by 0.8
degree, were observed with the MAGIC Cherenkov telescopes in 2010-2011. The
January 2011 observations resulted in the first detection above 100 GeV of 1ES
1215+303 (known also as ON-325) which has been flagged as a promising Very High
Energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray source candidate by the Fermi-LAT
Collaboration in October 2010. The January 2011 observations were triggered by
the high optical state of the source, as reported by the Tuorla blazar
monitoring program. A comparison with the 2010 data suggests that 1ES 1215+303
was also flaring in VHE gamma-rays. In addition, the Swift Target of
Opportunity (ToO) observations in X-rays showed that the flux was almost
doubled with respect to previous observations (December 2009). Instead, 1ES
1218+304 is a well known VHE gamma-ray emitter located in the same field of
view, which was then simultaneously observed with MAGIC. In this contribution
we present preliminary results of the MAGIC observations of these two VHE
gamma-ray emitting AGNs.
