Nearly simultaneous VLBA observations of 3C 84, the radio source associated
with NGC 1275, have been made at multiple frequencies to study the free-free
absorption of the northern, or "counterjet", feature found by Walker, Romney,
and Benson (1994, Ap.J. 430, L45) and by Vermeulen, Readhead, and Backer (1994,
Ap.J. 430, L41). Our observations confirm that the spectra are consistent with
free-free absorption and eliminate the possibility that the earlier result was
an effect of variability. The northern feature is well resolved spatially, so
images have been made showing the distribution of the absorption over a region
of about 1.5 pc on a side, beginning about 1.5 pc from the presumed location of
the central object. That distribution is dominated by a strong decrease with
radial distance. The magnitude of the absoption near 2.5 pc projected distance
from the central object is consistent with a 10^4 K gas with an emission
measure of about 5 X 10^8 pc cm^-6. The geometry is consistent with absorption
by ionized gas associated with an accretion disk. The data provide firm
constraints for models of the outer regions of accretion disks and, perhaps,
associated winds.
