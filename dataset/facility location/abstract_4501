Data collected with Polrad swept frequency analyzer during almost 2.5 years
of Interball-2 mission are used to investigate the directivity properties of
AKR observed in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast with the previous, mostly
statistical studies, single dynamic spectra have been analyzed. Simple modeling
of AKR source visibility from the location of the observer makes possible to
find approximate locations of remotely observed radiation sources and to model
the overall form of the dynamic spectrum with a single set of geometric
parameters valid during up to tens of minutes. Cases of filled and partially
filled emission cones are found as well as smaller emission cones embedded in
the main cone. Anisotropic AKR beams aligned with subcones as thin as 10
degrees and sometimes narrower have been detected.
