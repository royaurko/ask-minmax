In order to increase the accelerating gradient of Superconducting Radio
Frequency (SRF) cavities, Magnesium Diboride (MgB2) opens up hope because of
its high transition temperature and potential for low surface resistance in the
high RF field regime. However, due to the presence of the small superconducting
gap in the {\pi} band, the nonlinear response of MgB2 is potentially quite
large compared to a single gap s-wave superconductor (SC) such as Nb.
Understanding the mechanisms of nonlinearity coming from the two-band structure
of MgB2, as well as extrinsic sources, is an urgent requirement. A localized
and strong RF magnetic field, created by a magnetic write head, is integrated
into our nonlinear-Meissner-effect scanning microwave microscope [1]. MgB2
films with thickness 50 nm, fabricated by a hybrid physical-chemical vapor
deposition technique on dielectric substrates, are measured at a fixed location
and show a strongly temperature-dependent third harmonic response. We propose
that at least two mechanisms are responsible for this nonlinear response, one
of which involves vortex nucleation and penetration into the film. [1] T. M.
