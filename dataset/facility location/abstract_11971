We model the quasiparticle interference (QPI) pattern in the recently
discovered (K,Tl)Fe_xSe2 superconductors. We show in the superconducting state
that, due to the absence of hole pockets at the Brillouin zone center, the
quasiparticle scattering occurs around the momentum transfer q=(0,0) and (\pm
\pi, \pm \pi) between electron pockets located at the zone boundary. More
importantly, although both d_{x^2-y^2}-wave and s-wave pairing symmetry lead to
nodeless quasiparticle excitations, distinct QPI features are predicted between
both types of pairing symmetry. In the presence of a nonmagnetic impurity
scattering, the QPI exhibits strongest scattering with q=(\pm \pi, \pm \pi) for
the d_{x^2-y^2}-wave pairing symmetry; while the strongest scattering exhibits
a ring-like structure centered around both q=(0,0) and (\pm \pi, \pm \pi) for
the isotropic s-wave pairing symmetry. A unique QPI pattern has also been
predicted due to a local pair-potential-type impurity scattering. The
significant contrast in the QPI pattern between the d_{x^2-y^2}-wave and the
isotropic s-wave pairing symmetry can be used to probe the pairing symmetry
within the Fourier-transform STM technique.
