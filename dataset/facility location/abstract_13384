A strong demographic Allee effect in which the expected population growth
rate is negative below a certain critical population size can cause high
extinction probabilities in small introduced populations. However, many species
are repeatedly introduced to the same location and eventually one population
may overcome the Allee effect by chance. With the help of stochastic models, we
investigate how much genetic diversity such successful populations harbour on
average and how this depends on offspring-number variation, an important source
of stochastic variability in population size. We find that with increasing
variability, the Allee effect increasingly promotes genetic diversity in
successful populations. Successful Allee-effect populations with highly
variable population dynamics escape rapidly from the region of small population
sizes and do not linger around the critical population size. Therefore, they
are exposed to relatively little genetic drift. We show that here---unlike in
classical population genetics models---the role of offspring-number variation
cannot be accounted for by an effective-population-size correction. Thus, our
results highlight the importance of detailed biological knowledge, in this case
on the probability distribution of family sizes, when predicting the
evolutionary potential of newly founded populations or when using genetic data
to reconstruct their demographic history.
