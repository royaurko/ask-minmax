Equilibrium crystal surfaces, constrained to equilibrate by means of
dissociative dimer deposition and evaporation, have anomalous global surface
roughness. We generalize earlier results for one dimensional interfaces to two
dimensions. The global surface width scales with surface size L as W^2 \sim log
[L/ (log L)^{1/4}] instead of the conventional form W^2 \sim log L. The surface
roughening transition does not change in nature, but its location is subject to
a large and slowly varying logarithmic finite-size-scaling shift.
