The comparison of the free precession of co-located 3He-129Xe spins (clock
comparison) enables us to search for very tiny nonmagnetic spin interactions.
With our setup we could establish new limits for Lorentz invariance violating
interactions of spins with a relic background field which permeates the
Universe and points in a preferred direction in space.
