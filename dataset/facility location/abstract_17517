The understanding of interaction effects between marine energy converters
represents the next step in the research process that should eventually lead to
the deployment of such devices. Although some a priori considerations have been
suggested recently, very few real condition studies have been carried out
concerning this issue. Trials were run on 1/30th scale models of three-bladed
marine current turbine prototypes in a flume tank. The present work focuses on
the case where a turbine is placed at different locations in the wake of a
first one. The interaction effects in terms of performance and wake of the
second turbine are examined and compared to the results obtained on the case of
one single turbine. Besides, a three-dimensional software, based on a vortex
method is currently being developed, and will be used in the near future to
model more complex layouts. The experimental study shows that the second
turbine is deeply affected by the presence of an upstream device and that a
compromise between individual device performance and inter-device spacing is
necessary. Numerical results show good agreement with the experiment and are
promising for the future modelling of turbine farms.
