We investigated how measurements of weak boson production at high energy $ep$
and $e\gamma$ collisions can provide important information on anomalous
$WW\gamma$ couplings. We also considerd the sinlge muon production through the
virtual $W$-decay at the Pohang Light Source (PLS) facility, and found this
process is not adequate to be detected at the PLS until a large luminosity
($\sim 10^{33}$/sec/cm$^2$) Free Electron Laser is installed.
