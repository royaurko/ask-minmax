Extending work of Kapouleas and Yang, we construct by gluing methods
sequences of closed minimal surfaces embedded in the round 3-sphere. Each
surface resembles multiple tori, all coaxial with a nearby Clifford torus, that
have been connected by many small catenoidal tunnels. The sequences can be
indexed by the number N of tori joined and by a rectangular lattice on the
corresponding Clifford torus, aligned with its axis circles. The terms of a
given sequence themselves are then indexed by the sublattices of this lattice,
which determine the locations of the catenoidal tunnels. The elements of O(4)
preserving a surface in the sequence constitute a discrete group preserving the
corresponding sublattice, and this symmetry group contains isometries
exchanging the two sides of the associated Clifford torus precisely when the
lattice is square. A given sequence converges to the Clifford torus counted
with multiplicity N, while an appropriately blown-up sequence of tunnels at a
fixed location converges to a standard Euclidean catenoid. The finite number of
tori and rational ratio of lattice spacings may be prescribed at will, but the
number of tunnels, or equivalently the surface's genus, must be taken large in
terms of this data in order to complete the construction.
