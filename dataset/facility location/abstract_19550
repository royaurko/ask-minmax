We present observations of the rotational ortho-water ground transition, the
two lowest para-water transitions, and the ground transition of ionised
ortho-water in the archetypal starburst galaxy M82, performed with the HIFI
instrument on the Herschel Space Observatory. These observations are the first
detections of the para-H2O(111-000) (1113\,GHz) and ortho-H2O+(111-000)
(1115\,GHz) lines in an extragalactic source. All three water lines show
different spectral line profiles, underlining the need for high spectral
resolution in interpreting line formation processes. Using the line shape of
the para-H2O(111-000) and ortho-H2O+(111-000) absorption profile in conjunction
with high spatial resolution CO observations, we show that the (ionised) water
absorption arises from a ~2000 pc^2 region within the HIFI beam located about
~50 pc east of the dynamical centre of the galaxy. This region does not
coincide with any of the known line emission peaks that have been identified in
other molecular tracers, with the exception of HCO. Our data suggest that water
and ionised water within this region have high (up to 75%) area-covering
factors of the underlying continuum. This indicates that water is not
associated with small, dense cores within the ISM of M82 but arises from a more
widespread diffuse gas component.
