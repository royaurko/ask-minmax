In the last decade, the scattering of polarized neutrons on compound nucleus
resonances proved to be a powerful experimental technique for probing nuclear
parity violation. Longitudinal analyzing powers in neutron transmission
measurements on p-wave resonances in nuclei such as $^{139}$La and $^{232}$Th
were found to be as large as 10%. Here we examine the possibilities of carrying
out a parallel program to measure asymmetries in the $(n,\gamma$) reaction on
these same compound nuclear resonances. Symmetry-violating $(n,\gamma$) studies
can also show asymmetries as large as 10%, and have the advantage over
transmission experiments of allowing parity-odd asymmetries in several
different gamma-decay branches from the same resonance. Thus, studies of parity
violation in the $(n,\gamma)$ reaction using high efficiency germanium
detectors at the Los Alamos Lujan facility, for example, could determine the
parity-odd nucleon-nucleon matrix elements in complex nuclei with high
accuracy. Additionally, simultaneous studies of the E1 and $V_{PNC}$ matrix
elements invol ved in these decays could be used to help constrain the
statistical theory of parity non-conservation in compound nuclei.
