In 1974, Nelson, Kase, and Svenson published an experimental investigation on
muon shielding using the SLAC high energy LINAC. They measured muon fluence and
absorbed dose induced by a 18 GeV electron beam hitting a copper/water beam
dump and attenuated in a thick steel shielding. In their paper, they compared
the results with the theoretical mode ls available at the time. In order to
compare their experimental results with present model calculations, we use the
modern transport Monte Carlo codes MARS15, FLUKA2011 and GEANT4 to model the
experimental setup and run simulations. The results will then be compared
between the codes, and with the SLAC data.
