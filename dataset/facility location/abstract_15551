The ground state phase diagram of the 1D Hubbard chain with pair-hopping
interaction is studied. The analysis of the model is performed using the
continuum-limit field theory approach and exact diagonalization studies. At
half-filling the phase diagram is shown to consist of two superconducting
states with Cooper pair center-of-mass momentum Q=0 (BCS-\eta_0 phase) and
Q=\pi (\eta_\pi-phase) and four insulating phases corresponding to the Mott
antiferromagnet, the Peierls dimerized phase, the charge-density-wave (CDW)
insulator as well as an unconventional insulating phase characterized by the
coexistence of a CDW and a bond-located staggered magnetization. Away from
half-filling the phase diagram consists of the superconducting BCS-\eta_0 and
\eta_\pi phases and the metallic Luttinger-liquid phase. The BCS-\eta_0 phase
exhibits smooth crossover from a weak-coupling BCS type to a strong coupling
local-pair regime. The \eta_\pi phase shows properties of the doublon (zero
size Cooper pair) superconductor with Cooper pair center-of-mass momentum
Q=\pi. The transition into the \eta_\pi- paired state corresponds to an abrupt
change in the groundstate structure. After the transition the conduction band
is completely destroyed and a new \eta_\pi-pair band corresponding to the
strongly correlated doublon motion is created.
