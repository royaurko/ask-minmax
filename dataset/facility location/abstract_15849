Unconstrained CO2 emission from fossil fuel burning has been the dominant
cause of observed anthropogenic global warming. The amounts of "proven" and
potential fossil fuel reserves are uncertain and debated. Regardless of the
true values, society has flexibility in the degree to which it chooses to
exploit these reserves, especially unconventional fossil fuels and those
located in extreme or pristine environments. If conventional oil production
peaks within the next few decades, it may have a large effect on future
atmospheric CO2 and climate change, depending upon subsequent energy choices.
Assuming that proven oil and gas reserves do not greatly exceed estimates of
the Energy Information Administration, and recent trends are toward lower
estimates, we show that it is feasible to keep atmospheric CO2 from exceeding
about 450 ppm by 2100, provided that emissions from coal, unconventional fossil
fuels, and land use are constrained. Coal-fired power plants without
sequestration must be phased out before mid-century to achieve this CO2 limit.
It is also important to "stretch" conventional oil reserves via energy
conservation and efficiency, thus averting strong pressures to extract liquid
fuels from coal or unconventional fossil fuels while clean technologies are
being developed for the era "beyond fossil fuels". We argue that a rising price
on carbon emissions is needed to discourage conversion of the vast fossil
resources into usable reserves, and to keep CO2 beneath the 450 ppm ceiling.
