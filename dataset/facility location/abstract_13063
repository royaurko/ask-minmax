The characteristics of energy band spectrum of armchair graphene nanoribbons
in presence of line defect are analyzed within a simple non-interacting
tight-binding framework. In metallic nanoribbons an energy gap may or may not
appear in the band spectrum depending on the location of the defect line, while
in semiconducting ribbons the gaps are customized, yielding the potential
applicabilities of graphene nanoribbons in nanoscale electronic devices. With a
more general model, we also investigate two-terminal electron transport using
Green's function formalism.
