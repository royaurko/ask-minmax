The hypothesis about the relation between the observed alignment of spots in
the x-ray film in cosmic ray emulsion experiments and the features of events in
which jets prevail at super high energies is tested. Due to strong dynamical
correlation between jet axis directions and that between momenta of jet
particles (almost collinearity), the evaluated degree of alignment is
considerably larger than that for randomly selected chaoticly located spots in
the x-ray film. It appears comparable with experimental data provided that the
height of primary interaction, the collision energy and the total energy of
selected clusters meet certain conditions. The Monte Carlo generator PYTHIA,
which basically well describes jet events in hadron-hadron interactions, was
used for the analysis.
