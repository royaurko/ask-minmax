Beyond reionization epoch cosmic hydrogen is neutral and can be directly
observed through its 21 cm line signal. If dark matter (DM) decays or
annihilates the corresponding energy input affects the hydrogen kinetic
temperature and ionized fraction, and contributes to the Ly_alpha background.
The changes induced by these processes on the 21 cm signal can then be used to
constrain the proposed DM candidates, among which we select the three most
popular ones: (i) 25-keV decaying sterile neutrinos, (ii) 10-MeV decaying light
dark matter (LDM) and (iii) 10-MeV annihilating LDM. Although we find that the
DM effects are considerably smaller than found by previous studies (due to a
more physical description of the energy transfer from DM to the gas), we
conclude that combined observations of the 21 cm background and of its gradient
should be able to put constrains at least on LDM candidates. In fact, LDM
decays (annihilations) induce differential brightness temperature variations
with respect to the non decaying/annihilating DM case up to Delta_delta T_b=8
(22) mK at about 50 (15) MHz. In principle this signal could be detected both
by current single dish radio telescopes and future facilities as LOFAR;
however, this assumes that ionospheric, interference and foreground issues can
be properly taken care of.
