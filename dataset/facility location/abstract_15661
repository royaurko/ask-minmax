The next-generation astronomy digital archives will cover most of the
universe at fine resolution in many wave-lengths, from X-rays to ultraviolet,
optical, and infrared. The archives will be stored at diverse geographical
locations. One of the first of these projects, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) will create a 5-wavelength catalog over 10,000 square degrees of the sky
(see http://www.sdss.org/). The 200 million objects in the multi-terabyte
database will have mostly numerical attributes, defining a space of 100+
dimensions. Points in this space have highly correlated distributions.
  The archive will enable astronomers to explore the data interactively. Data
access will be aided by a multidimensional spatial index and other indices.
The data will be partitioned in many ways. Small tag objects consisting of the
most popular attributes speed up frequent searches. Splitting the data among
multiple servers enables parallel, scalable I/O and applies parallel processing
to the data. Hashing techniques allow efficient clustering and pair-wise
comparison algorithms that parallelize nicely. Randomly sampled subsets allow
debugging otherwise large queries at the desktop. Central servers will operate
a data pump that supports sweeping searches that touch most of the data. The
anticipated queries require special operators related to angular distances and
complex similarity tests of object properties, like shapes, colors, velocity
vectors, or temporal behaviors. These issues pose interesting data management
challenges.
