We report an extensive study of the phase diagram of a simple model for
ortho-terphenyl, focusing on the limits of stability of the liquid state.
Reported data extend previous studies of the same model to both lower and
higher densities and to higher temperatures. We estimate the location of the
homogeneous liquid-gas nucleation line and of the spinodal locus. Within the
potential energy landscape formalism, we calculate the distributions of depth,
number, and shape of the potential energy minima and show that the statistical
properties of the landscape are consistent with a Gaussian distribution of
minima over a wide range of volumes. We report the volume dependence of the
parameters entering in the Gaussian distribution (amplitude, average energy,
variance). We finally evaluate the locus where the configurational entropy
vanishes, the so-called Kauzmann line, and discuss the relative location of the
spinodal and Kauzmann loci.
