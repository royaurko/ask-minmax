Isobenefit Lines can offer a certain range of applicability in Location
Theory and Gravitational Models for Urban and Geography Economics, in
positional decision processes made by citizens, and, last but not least, in
land value and property market theories and analysis. The value of a land, or a
property, in a generic k point, is, ceteris paribus, the mirror of the quality,
attractiveness, benefit characterizing k. Preference Gap Gain (PGG) of a
person, is the difference between his Personal Isobenefit Lines and that of the
majority of people. In monetary terms, when buying or renting a property, it
can become an economic gain or vice versa, and PGG localizes and quantifies
this gain.
