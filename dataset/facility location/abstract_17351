The low-beta magnet systems are located in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
insertion regions around the four interaction points. They are the key elements
in the beams focusing/defocusing process allowing proton collisions at
luminosity up to 10**34/cm**2s. Those systems are a contribution of the US-LHC
Accelerator project. The systems are mainly composed of the quadrupole magnets
(triplets), the separation dipoles and their respective electrical feed-boxes
(DFBX). The low-beta magnet systems operate in an environment of extreme
radiation, high gradient magnetic field and high heat load to the cryogenic
system due to the beam dynamic effect. Due to the severe environment, the
robustness of the diagnostics is primordial for the operation of the triplets.
The hardware commissioning phase of the LHC was completed in February 2010. In
the sake of a safer and more user-friendly operation, several consolidations
and instrumentation modifications were implemented during this commissioning
phase. This paper presents the instrumentation used to optimize the engineering
process and operation of the final focusing/defocusing quadrupole magnets for
the first years of operation.
