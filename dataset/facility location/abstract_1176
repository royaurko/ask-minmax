The creation of intense radioactive beams requires intense and energetic
primary beams. A task force analysis of this subject recommended an
acceleration system capable of 400 MeV/u uranium at 1 particle uA as an
appropriate driver for such a facility. The driver system should be capable of
accelerating lighter ions at higher intensity such that a constant final beam
power (~100kW) is maintained. This document is a more detailed follow on to the
previous analysis of such a system incorporating a cyclotron. The proposed
driver pre-acceleration system consists of an ion source, radio frequency
quadrupole, and linac chain capable of producing a final energy of 30 MeV/u and
a charge (Q) to mass (A) of Q/A ~1/3. This acceleration system would be
followed by a Separated Sector Cyclotron with a final output energy of 400
MeV/u. This system provides a more cost-effective solution in terms of initial
capital investment as well as of operation compared to a fully linac system
with the same primary beam output parameters.
