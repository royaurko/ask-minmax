The thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the methanolysis and hydrolysis
reactions of glycerol triacetate or triacetin, a model triacylglycerol
compound, were investigated by using Density Functional Theory (DFT) at the
B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) level of calculation. Twelve elementary steps of triacetin
methanolysis were studied under acid-catalyzed and base-catalyzed conditions.
The mechanism of acid-catalyzed methanolysis reaction which has not been
reported yet for any esters was proposed. The effects of substitution,
methanolysis/hydrolysis position, solvent and face of nucleophilic attack on
the free energy of reaction and activation energy were examined. The prediction
confirmed the facile position at the middle position of glycerol observed by
NMR techniques. The calculated activation energy and the trends of those
factors agree with existing experimental observations in biodiesel production.
