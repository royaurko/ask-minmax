We present the first results in the search for relativistic magnetic
monopoles with the IceCube detector, a subsurface neutrino telescope located in
the South Polar ice cap containing a volume of 1 km$^{3}$. This analysis
searches data taken on the partially completed detector during 2007 when
roughly 0.2 km$^{3}$ of ice was instrumented. The lack of candidate events
leads to an upper limit on the flux of relativistic magnetic monopoles of
$\Phi_{\mathrm{90%C.L.}}\sim 3\e{-18}\fluxunits$ for $\beta\geq0.8$. This is a
factor of 4 improvement over the previous best experimental flux limits up to a
Lorentz boost $\gamma$ below $10^{7}$. This result is then interpreted for a
wide range of mass and kinetic energy values.
