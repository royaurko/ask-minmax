The best-studied version of the RS1 model has all the Standard Model
particles confined to the TeV brane. However, recent variants have the Standard
Model fermions and gauge bosons located in the bulk five-dimensional spacetime.
We study the potential reach of the LHC in searching for the lightest KK
partner of the graviton in the most promising such models in which the
right-handed top is localized very near the TeV brane and the light fermions
are localized near the Planck brane. We consider both detection and the
establishment of the spin-2 nature of the resonance should it be found.
