We present preliminary Sloan u',g'-band light curves for a sample of known RR
Lyrae variables in the Galactic globular cluster Omega Cen. Results are based
on the partial reduction of multi-band time series photometric data collected
during six consecutive nights with the visitor instrument ULTRACAM mounted on
the New Technology Telescope (La Silla, ESO). This facility allowed us to
simultaneously observe in three different bands (Sloan u',g',r') a field of
view of about 6x6 arcminutes. The telescope and the good seeing conditions
allowed us to sample the light curves every 15 seconds. We ended up with a data
set of about 6,000 images per night per filter, for a total of more than
200,000 images of the selected field. This data set allowed us to detect
different kind of variables, such as RR-Lyraes, SX Phoenicis, eclipsing
binaries, semi-regulars. More importantly, we were able for the first time to
sample at high-frequency cluster RR Lyraes in the u',g'-band and to show in
detail the pulsation phases across the dip located along the rising branch of
RR-Lyraes.
