The Allen Telescope Array (ATA) is a Large-Number-Small-Diameter radio
telescope array currently with 42 individual antennas and 5 independent
back-end science systems (2 imaging FX correlators and 3 time domain beam
formers) located at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory (HCRO). The goal of the ATA
is to run multiple back-ends simultaneously, supporting multiple science
projects commensally. The primary software control systems are based on a
combination of Java, JRuby and Ruby on Rails. The primary control API is
simplified to provide easy integration with new back-end systems while the
lower layers of the software stack are handled by a master observing system.
Scheduling observations for the ATA is based on finding a union between the
science needs of multiple projects and automatically determining an efficient
path to operating the various sub-components to meet those needs. When
completed, the ATA is expected to be a world-class radio telescope, combining
dedicated SETI projects with numerous radio astronomy science projects.
