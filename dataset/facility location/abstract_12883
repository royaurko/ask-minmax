A global phase diagram of disordered weak and strong topological insulators
is established numerically. As expected, the location of the phase boundaries
is renormalized by disorder, a feature recognized in the study of the so-called
topological Anderson insulator. Here, we report unexpected quantization, i.e.,
robustness against disorder of the conductance peaks on these phase boundaries.
Another highlight of the work is on the emergence of two subregions in the weak
topological insulator phase under disorder. According to the size dependence of
the conductance, the surface states are either robust or "defeated" in the two
subregions. The nature of the two distinct types of behavior is further
revealed by studying the Lyapunov exponents.
