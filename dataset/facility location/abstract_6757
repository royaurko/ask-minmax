In this paper we give a frame for application of the averaging method to
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and obtain an abstract result upon the
dynamics of BECs. Using aver- aging method, we determine the location where the
modulated amplitude waves (periodic or quasi-periodic) exist and we also study
the stability and instability of modulated amplitude waves (periodic or
quasi-periodic). Compared with the previous work, modulated amplitude waves
studied in this paper have nontrivial phases and this makes the problem become
more diffcult, since it involves some singularities.
