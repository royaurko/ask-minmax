The lack of detected pulsars at the Galactic Center (GC) region is a
long-standing mystery. We argue that the high stellar density in the central
parsec around the GC is likely to result in a pulsar population dominated by
millisecond pulsars (MSPs), similar to the situation in globular cluster
environments. Earlier GC pulsar searches have been largely insensitive to such
an MSP population, accounting for the lack of pulsar detections. We estimate
the best search frequency for such an MSP population with present and upcoming
broad-band radio telescopes for two possible scattering scenarios, the
"weak-scattering" case suggested by the recent detection of a magnetar close to
the GC, and the "strong-scattering" case, with the scattering screen located
close to the GC. The optimal search frequencies are $\approx 8$ GHz
(weak-scattering) and $\approx 25$ GHz (strong-scattering), for pulsars with
periods 1-20 ms, assuming that GC pulsars have a luminosity distribution
similar to that those in the rest of the Milky Way. We find that 10-30 hour
integrations with the Very Large Array and the Green Bank Telescope would be
sufficient to detect MSPs at the GC distance in the weak-scattering case.
However, if the strong-scattering case is indeed applicable to the GC,
observations with the full Square Kilometre Array would be needed to detect the
putative MSP population.
