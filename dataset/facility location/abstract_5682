We revisited the BeppoSAX observation of SAX J0635+0533, suggested as a
possible counterpart to the gamma-ray source
 2EG J0635+0521. We have discovered a 33.8 ms pulsation from the source and
derived an improved position, consistent with the location of the Be star
proposed as a binary companion.
 We interpret the periodicity as the spin period of a neutron star in a binary
system with a Be companion.
