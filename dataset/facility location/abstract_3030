This paper presents the design and development of a context-aware
notification system for university students using RFID technology. This system
is leveraging on the student's matrix card as the RFID tag (sensor), RFID
reader and server as the processors and screen monitor at the various locations
in the campus as the actuator of the output. This system aims to deliver urgent
notifications to the intended students immediately at their respective
locations. In addition, the system is also able to display personalized
information based on the students' preferences and current location when
accessing the system. The background of the study, the design approaches for
this system and the preliminary evaluation of the prototype are presented in
this paper. The evaluation results have indicated that the the proposed system
is useful and easy to use.
