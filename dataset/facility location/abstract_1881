Recent results of an aging test performed at the CERN Gamma Irradiation
Facility on a single--gap RPC prototype developed for the LHCb Muon System are
presented. The results are based on an accumulated charge of about 0.45
C/cm$^2$, corresponding to about 4 years of LHCb running at the highest
background rate. The performance of the chamber has been studied under several
photon flux values exploiting a muon beam. A degradation of the rate capability
above 1 kHz/cm$^2$ is observed, which can be correlated to a sizeable increase
of resistivity of the chamber plates. An increase of the chamber dark current
is also observed. The chamber performance is found to fulfill the LHCb
operation requirements.
