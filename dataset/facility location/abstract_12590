The dynamics following the photoexcitation of Na and Li atoms located on the
surface of helium nanodroplets has been investigated in a joint experimental
and theoretical study. Photoelectron spectroscopy has revealed that excitation
of the alkali atoms via the (n+1) -> ns transition leads to the desorption of
these atoms. The mean kinetic energy of the desorbed atoms, as determined by
ion imaging, shows a linear dependence on excitation frequency. These
experimental findings are analyzed within a three-dimensional, time-dependent
density functional approach for the helium droplet combined with a Bohmian
dynamics description of the desorbing atom. This hybrid method reproduces well
the key experimental observables. The dependence of the observables on the
impurity mass is discussed by comparing the results obtained for the 6Li and
7Li isotopes. The calculations show that the desorption of the excited alkali
atom is accompanied by the creation of highly non-linear density waves in the
helium droplet that propagate at supersonic velocities.
