We review the main aspects of multiple photoionization processes in atoms
exposed to intense, short wavelength radiation. The main focus is the
theoretical framework for the description of such processes as well as the
conditions under which direct multiphoton multiple ionization processes can
dominate over the sequential ones. We discuss in detail the mechanisms
available in different wavelength ranges from the infrared to the hard X-rays.
The effect of field fluctuations, present at this stage in all SASE
free-electron-laser (FEL) facilities, as well as the effect of the interaction
volume integration, are also discussed.
