We report on the first spatially resolved observation of mesoscopic flux
jumps in superconducting films. Magneto-optical imaging was used to visualize
the flux penetration in MgB2 films subjected to a slowly varying perpendicular
field. Below 10 K, flux jumps with typical size 10-20 microns and regular shape
are found to occur at random locations along the flux front. The total number
of vortices participating in one jump is varying between 50 and 10000.
Simultaneously, big dendritic jumps with dimensions comparable to the sample
size (10^6-10^8 vortices) are also found in this temperature range. We believe
that both types of jumps result from thermo-magnetic instability.
