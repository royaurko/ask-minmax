We present here the first detailed study of a giant radio galaxy of the
Fat-Double type. The lobes of the double radio galaxy SGRS J0515-8100 have
transverse widths that are 1.3 times their extent from the center, their
surface brightness is the lowest among known giant radio sources and the lobes
have relatively steep radio spectra. We infer that these wide lobes were
created as a result of a highly variable and intermittent jet whose axis
direction also varied significantly: the Fat-Double lobes in this giant radio
source are a result of the ejection and deposition of synchrotron plasma over a
wide range of angles over time rather than the expansion of relic lobes.
Additionally, the optical host shows evidence for an ongoing galaxy-galaxy
interaction. SGRS J0515-8100 supports the hypothesis that interactions with
companions might perturb the inner accretion disk that produces and sustains
the jets at the centers of active galactic nuclei. As a result, it appears
unnecessary to invoke black-hole coalescence to explain such morphologies,
implying that the corresponding event rates predicted for gravitational wave
detectors may be overestimates.
