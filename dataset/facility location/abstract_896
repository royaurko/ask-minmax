We introduce the LIPI Public Cluster, the first parallel machine facility
fully open for public and for free in Indonesia and surrounding countries. In
this paper, we focus on explaining our globally new concept on open cluster,
and how to realize and manage it to meet the users needs. We show that after 2
years trial running and several upgradings, the Public Cluster performs well
and is able to fulfil all requirements as expected.
