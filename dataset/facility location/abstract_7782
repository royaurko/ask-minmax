From the sun's location in the Galactic disk, one can use different arm
tracers (CO, HII, thermal or ionized or relativistic electrons, masers, cold or
hot dust, etc) to locate a tangent to each spiral arm in the disk of the Milky
Way galaxy. We present a Master catalog of the astronomically observed tangents
to the Galaxy's spiral arms, using different arm tracers from the literature.
Some arm tracers can have slightly divergent results from several papers, so a
mean is taken - see Appendix for CO, HII, and masers. The Master catalog of
means currently consists of 63 mean tracer entries, spread over many arms
(Carina, Crux-Centaurus, Norma, Perseus origin, near 3-kpc, Scutum,
Sagittarius), stemming from 107 original arm tracer entries.
  Additionally, we updated and revised a previous a previous statistical
analysis of the angular offset and linear separation from the mid-arm, for each
different mean arm tracer. Given enough arm tracers, and summing and averaging
over all spiral arms, one could determine if arm tracers have separate and
parallel lanes in the Milky Way. This statistical analysis allows a cross-cut
of a galactic spiral arm to be made, confirming a recent discovery of a linear
separation between arm tracers. Here, from the mid-arm's CO to the inner edge's
hot dust, the arm half-width is about 340 parsecs; doubling would yield a full
arm width of 680 parsecs. We briefly compare these observations with the
predictions of many spiral arm theories, notably the density wave theory.
