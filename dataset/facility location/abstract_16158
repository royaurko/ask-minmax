The cutoff phenomenon describes a sharp transition in the convergence of a
family of ergodic finite Markov chains to equilibrium. Many natural families of
chains are believed to exhibit cutoff, and yet establishing this fact is often
extremely challenging. An important such family of chains is the random walk on
$\G(n,d)$, a random $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices. It is well known that
almost every such graph for $d\geq 3$ is an expander, and even essentially
Ramanujan, implying a mixing-time of $O(\log n)$. According to a conjecture of
Peres, the simple random walk on $\G(n,d)$ for such $d$ should then exhibit
cutoff with high probability. As a special case of this, Durrett conjectured
that the mixing time of the lazy random walk on a random 3-regular graph is
w.h.p. $(6+o(1))\log_2 n$.
  In this work we confirm the above conjectures, and establish cutoff in
total-variation, its location and its optimal window, both for simple and for
non-backtracking random walks on $\G(n,d)$. Namely, for any fixed $d\geq3$, the
simple random walk on $\G(n,d)$ w.h.p. has cutoff at $\frac{d}{d-2}\log_{d-1}
n$ with window order $\sqrt{\log n}$. Surprisingly, the non-backtracking random
walk on $\G(n,d)$ w.h.p. has cutoff already at $\log_{d-1} n$ with constant
window order. We further extend these results to $\G(n,d)$ for any $d=n^{o(1)}$
that grows with $n$ (beyond which the mixing time is O(1)), where we establish
concentration of the mixing time on one of two consecutive integers.
