This paper presents techniques developed by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration
to search for the stochastic gravitational-wave background using the co-located
pair of LIGO interferometers at Hanford, WA. We use correlations between
interferometers and environment monitoring instruments, as well as time-shifts
between two interferometers (described here for the first time) to identify
correlated noise from non-gravitational sources. We veto particularly noisy
frequency bands and assess the level of residual non-gravitational coupling
that exists in the surviving data.
