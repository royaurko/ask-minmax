The BABAR experiment is a new generation detector located at the SLAC B
factory PEP-II ring which should start taking data at the end of 1999. Its main
goal is the study of CP violation in the B0-B0b system. After explaining the
nature of this CP violation, I review the scientific program for achieving this
study in many different modes, in the light of the recent developments obtained
both on the experimental and theoretical side. Implications for the Standard
Model are then discussed.
