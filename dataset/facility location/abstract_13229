We present {\it Gemini} longslit optical spectroscopy and VLA radio
observations of the nuclear region of NGC 4178, a late-type bulgeless disk
galaxy recently confirmed to host an AGN through infrared and X-ray
observations. Our observations reveal that the dynamical center of the galaxy
is coincident with the location of the {\it Chandra} X-ray point source
discovered in a previous work, providing further support for the presence of an
AGN. While the X-ray and IR observations provide robust evidence for an AGN,
the optical spectrum shows no evidence for the AGN, underscoring the need for
the penetrative power of mid-IR and X-ray observations in finding buried or
weak AGNs in this class of galaxy. Finally, the upper limit to the radio flux,
together with our previous X-ray and IR results, is consistent with the
scenario in which NGC 4178 harbors a deeply buried AGN accreting at a high
rate.
