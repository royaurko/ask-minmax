We demonstrate with a quantum-mechanical approach that carbon nanotubes are
excellent spin-current waveguides and are able to carry information stored in a
precessing magnetic moment for long distances with very little dispersion and
with tunable degrees of attenuation. Pulsed magnetic excitations are predicted
to travel with the nanotube Fermi velocity and are able to induce similar
excitations in remote locations. Such an efficient way of transporting magnetic
information suggests that nanotubes are promising candidates for memory devices
with fast magnetization switchings.
