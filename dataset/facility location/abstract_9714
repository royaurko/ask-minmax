Radiation from acoustic sources located inside randomly-layered structures is
studied using the transfer matrix method. It is shown that in contrast to the
periodically layered cases where the radiation can be either enhanced or
inhibited depending on the frequency, and the characteristics and the material
composition of the structures, in the random structures the radiation is always
inhibited. The degree of inhibition depends on the acoustic frequency, number
of random layers, and the randomness and acoustic parameters of the structures.
Both spherically and cylindrically random structures are considered. The
results point to the possibility of designing sonic waveguide devices which
will not suffer from the energy loss caused by radiation, thus allowing
effective energy confinement or long-range energy propagation.
