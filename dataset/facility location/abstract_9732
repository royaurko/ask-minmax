We present a numerical study of the self-affine profiles obtained from
configurations of the q-state Potts (with q=2,3 and 7) and p=10 clock models as
well as from the occupation states for site-percolation on the square lattice.
The first and second order static phase transitions of the Potts model are
located by a sharp change in the value of the roughness exponent $\alpha$
characterizing those profiles. The low temperature phase of the Potts model
corresponds to flat ($\alpha\simeq 1$) profiles, whereas its high temperature
phase is associated to rough ($\alpha\simeq 0.5$) ones. For the p=10 clock
model, in addition to the flat (ferromagnetic) and rough (paramagnetic)
profiles, an intermediate rough ($0.5< \alpha <1$) phase - associated to a soft
spin-wave one - is observed. Our results for the transition temperatures in the
Potts and clock models are in agreement with the static values, showing that
this approach is able to detect the phase transitions in these models directly
from the spin configurations, without any reference to thermodynamical
potentials, order parameters or response functions. Finally, we show that the
roughness exponent $\alpha$ is insensitive to geometric critical phenomena.
