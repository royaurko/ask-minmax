Development of nuclear energy applications requires data for neutron-induced
reactions for actinides in a wide neutron energy range. Here we describe
measurements of pre-neutron emission fission fragment mass yields of 232Th and
238U at incident neutron energies from 10 to 33 MeV. The measurements were done
at the quasi-monoenergetic neutron beam of the Louvain-la-Neuve cyclotron
facility CYCLONE; a multi-section twin Frisch-gridded ionization chamber was
used to detect fission fragments. For the peak neutron energies at 33, 45 and
60 MeV, the details of the data analysis and the experimental results have been
published before and in this work we present data analysis in the low-energy
tail of the neutron energy spectra. The preliminary measurement results are
compared with available experimental data and theoretical predictions.
