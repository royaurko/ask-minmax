The scintillator-strip electromagnetic calorimeter (ScECAL) is one of the
calorimeter technologies which can achieve fine granularity required for the
particle flow algorithm. Second prototype of the ScECAL has been built and
tested with analog hadron calorimeter (AHCAL) and tail catcher (TCMT) in
September 2008 at Fermilab meson test beam facility. Data are taken with 1 to
32 GeV of electron, pion and muon beams to evaluate all the necessary
performances of the ScECAL, AHCAL and TCMT system. This manuscript describes
overview of the beam test and very preliminary results focusing on the ScECAL
part.
