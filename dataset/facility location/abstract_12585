The MINOS Near and Far Detectors are two large, functionally-identical,
steel-scintillating sampling calorimeters located at depths of 220 mwe and 2100
mwe respectively. The detectors observe the muon component of hadronic showers
produced from cosmic ray interactions with nuclei in the earth's atmosphere.
From the arrival direction of these muons, the anisotropy in arrival direction
of the cosmic ray primaries can be determined. The MINOS Near and Far Detector
have observed anisotropy on the order of 0.1% at 1 and 11 TeV respectively. The
amplitude and phase of the first harmonic at 1 TeV are
8.2$\pm$1.7(stat.)$\times 10^{-4}$ and (8.9$\pm$12.1(stat.))$^{\circ}$, and at
11 TeV are 3.8$\pm$0.5(stat.)$\times 10^{-4}$ and
(27.2$\pm$7.2(stat.))$^{\circ}$.
