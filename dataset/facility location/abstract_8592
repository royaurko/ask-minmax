The distance-redshift relation depends on the amount of matter of each type
in the universe. Measurements at different redshifts constrain differing
combinations of these matter densities and thus may be used in combination to
constrain each separately. The combination of Omega_0 and Omega_Lambda measured
in supernovae at z<1 is almost orthogonal to the combination probed by the
location of features in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy
spectrum. We analyze the current combined data set in this framework, showing
that the regions preferred by the Supernova and CMB measurements are
compatible. We quantify the favoured region. We also discuss models in which
the matter density in the universe is augmented by a smooth component to give
critical density. These models, by construction and in contrast, are not
strongly constrained by the combination of the data sets.
