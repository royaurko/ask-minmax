With smartphones becoming our everyday companions, high-quality mobile
applications have become an important integral of people's lives. The intensive
and ubiquitous use of mobile applications have also led to the explosive growth
of mobile data traffics. Therefore, to accommodate the surge mobile traffic yet
providing the guaranteed service quality to mobile users represent a key issue
of the next generation mobile networks. This motivates the emergence of Fog
computing as a promising, practical and efficient solution tailored to serving
mobile traffics. Fog computing deploys highly virtualized computing and
communication facilities at the proximity of mobile users. Dedicated to serving
the mobile users, Fog computing explores the predictable service demand
patterns of mobile users and typically provides desirable localized services
accordingly. Stitching above features, Fog computing can provide mobile users
with the demanded services via low-latency and short-distance local
connections. In this article, we outline the main features of Fog computing and
describe its concept, architecture and design goals. Lastly, we discuss on the
potential research issues from the networking's perspective.
