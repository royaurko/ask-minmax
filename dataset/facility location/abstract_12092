We discuss the {\em intermediate} wave-packet formalism for analytically
quantifying the energy dependence of the two-flavor conversion formula that is
usually considered for analyzing neutrino oscillations and adjusting the
focusing horn, target position and/or detector location of some flavor
conversion experiments. Following a sequence of analytical approximations where
we consider the second-order corrections in a power series expansion of the
energy, we point out a {\em residual} time-dependent phase which, in addition
to some well known wave-packet effects, can subtly modify the oscillation
parameters and limits. In the present precision era of neutrino oscillation
experiments where higher precision measurements are required, we quantify some
small corrections in neutrino flavor conversion formulae which lead to a
modified energy-dependence for $\nu_{\mu}\leftrightarrow\nu_{e}$ oscillations.
