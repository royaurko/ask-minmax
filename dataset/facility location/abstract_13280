Several scenarios explaining how filaments are formed can be found in
literature. In this paper, we analyzed the observations of an active region
filament and critically evaluated the observed properties in the context of
current filament formation models. This study is based on multi-height
spectropolarimetric observations. The inferred vector magnetic field has been
extrapolated starting either from the photosphere or from the chromosphere. The
line-of-sight motions of the filament, which was located near disk center, have
been analyzed inferring the Doppler velocities. We conclude that a part of the
magnetic structure emerged from below the photosphere.
