The issues related to moving elements in space and instruments working in
broader wavelength ranges lead to a need for robust polarimeters, efficient on
a wide spectral domain, and adapted to space conditions. As part of the UVMag
consortium, created to develop spectropolarimetric UV facilities in space, such
as the Arago mission project, we present an innovative concept of static
spectropolarimetry. We studied a static and polychromatic method for
spectropolarimetry, applicable to stellar physics. Instead of modulating the
polarization information temporally, as usually done in spectropolarimeters,
the modulation is performed in a spatial direction, orthogonal to the spectral
one. Thanks to the proportionality between phase retardance imposed by a
birefringent material and its thickness, birefringent wedges can be used to
create this spatial modulation. The light is then spectrally cross-dispersed,
and a full-Stokes determination of the polarization over the whole spectrum can
be obtained with a single-shot measurement. The use of Magnesium Fluoride
wedges, for example, could lead to a compact, static polarimeter working at
wavelengths from 0.115 mm up to 7 mm. We present the theory and simulations of
this concept, as well as laboratory validation and a practical application to
Arago.
