Sensor nodes are low cost, low power devices that are used to collect
physical data and monitor environmental conditions from remote locations.
Wireless Sensor Networks(WSN) are collection of sensor nodes, coordinating
among themselves to perform a particular task. Localization is defined as the
deployment of the sensor nodes at known locations in the network. Localization
techniques are classified as Centralized and Distributed. MDS-Map and SDP are
some of the centralized algorithms while Diffusion, Gradient,APIT, Bounding
Box, Relaxation-Based and Coordinate System Stitching come under Distributed
algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid localization technique,
which combines the advantages of the centralized and distributed algorithms and
overcomes some of the drawbacks of the existing techniques. Simulations done
with J-Sim prove advantage of the proposed scheme in terms of localization
error calculated by varying the sink nodes, increasing node density and
increasing communication range.
