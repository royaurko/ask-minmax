The bulk matter Randall-Sundrum (RS) model is a setup where Standard Model
(SM) matter and gauge fields reside in the bulk of 5D warped spacetime while
the Higgs field is confined on the IR brane. The wavefunctions of the 1st and
2nd generation matter particles are localized towards the UV brane and those of
the 3rd generation towards the IR brane, so that the hierarchical structure of
the Yukawa couplings arises geometrically without hierarchy in fundamental
parameters. This paper discusses an experimental test of this model in the case
where the Kaluza-Klein scale is far above the collider scale, but the model is
combined with 5D Minimal SUSY Standard Model (MSSM) and SUSY particles are in
the reach of collider experiments. A general SUSY breaking mass spectrum
consistent with the bulk matter RS model is considered: SUSY breaking sector
locates on the IR brane and its effects are mediated to 5D MSSM through a
hybrid of gravity mediation, gaugino mediation and gauge mediation. This paper
argues that it is possible to observe the signals of the bulk matter RS model
through rare decays of "almost SU(2) singlet mass eigenstates" that are induced
by flavor-violating gravity mediation contributions to matter soft SUSY
breaking terms.
