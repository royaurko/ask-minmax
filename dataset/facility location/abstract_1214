A Baker-Nunn Camera (BNC), originally installed at the Real Instituto y
Observatorio de la Armada (ROA) in 1958, was refurbished and robotized. The new
facility, called Telescope Fabra ROA Montsec (TFRM), was installed at the
Observatori Astron\`omic del Montsec (OAdM).
  The process of refurbishment is described in detail. Most of the steps of the
refurbishment project were accomplished by purchasing commercial components,
which involve little posterior engineering assembling work. The TFRM is a 0.5m
aperture f/0.96 optically modified BNC, which offers a unique combination of
instrumental specifications: fully robotic and remote operation, wide-field of
view (4.4 deg x 4.4 deg), moderate limiting magnitude (V~19.5mag), ability of
tracking at arbitrary right ascension and declination rates, as well as opening
and closing CCD shutter at will during an exposure.
  Nearly all kind of image survey programs can benefit from those
specifications. Apart from other less time consuming programs, since the
beginning of science TFRM operations we have been conducting two specific and
distinct surveys: super-Earths transiting around M-type dwarfs stars, and
geostationary debris in the context of Space Situational Awareness / Space
Surveillance and Tracking (SSA/SST) programs. Preliminary results for both
cases will be shown.
