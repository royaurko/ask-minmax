We present a new automated algorithm to identify, track, and characterize
small-scale brightening associated with solar eruptive phenomena observed in
H{\alpha}. The temporal spatially-localized changes in chromospheric
intensities can be separated into two categories: flare ribbons and sequential
chromospheric brightenings (SCBs). Within each category of brightening we
determine the smallest resolvable locus of pixels, a kernel, and track the
temporal evolution of the position and intensity of each kernel. This tracking
is accomplished by isolating the eruptive features, identifying kernels, and
linking detections between frames into trajectories of kernels. We fully
characterize the evolving intensity and morphology of the flare ribbons by
observing the tracked flare kernels in aggregate. With the location of SCB and
flare kernels identified, they can easily be overlaid on top of complementary
data sets to extract Doppler velocities and magnetic field intensities
underlying the kernels. This algorithm is adaptable to any dataset to identify
and track solar features.
