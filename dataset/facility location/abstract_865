This paper reports on the feasibility study of a proton Super-Conducting
Linac (SCL) as a new injector to the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) of
the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). The Linac beam energy is in the range
of 1.5 to 2.4 GeV. The Beam intensity is adjusted to provide an average beam
power of 4 MW at the top energy of 24 GeV. The repetition rate of the SCL-AGS
facility is 5 beam pulses per second.
