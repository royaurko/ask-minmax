We monitored Eta Carinae with HST WFPC2 and Gemini GMOS throughout the 2009
spectroscopic event, which was expected to differ from its predecessor in 2003
(Davidson et al. 2005). Here we report major observed differences between
events, and their implications. Some of these results were quite unexpected.
(1) The UV brightness minimum was much deeper in 2009. This suggests that
physical conditions in the early stages of an event depend on different
parameters than the "normal" inter-event wind. Extra mass ejection from the
primary star is one possible cause. (2) The expected He II 4687 brightness
maximum was followed several weeks later by another. We explain why this fact,
and the timing of the 4687 maxima, strongly support a "shock breakup"
hypothesis for X-ray and 4687 behavior as proposed 5-10 years ago. (3) We
observed a polar view of the star via light reflected by dust in the Homunculus
nebula. Surprisingly, at that location the variations of emission-line
brightness and Doppler velocities closely resembled a direct view of the star;
which should not have been true for any phenomena related to the orbit. This
result casts very serious doubt on all the proposed velocity interpretations
that depend on the secondary star's orbital motion. (4) Latitude-dependent
variations of H I, He I and Fe II features reveal aspects of wind behavior
during the event. In addition, we discuss implications of the observations for
several crucial unsolved problems.
