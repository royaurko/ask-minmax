Nuclear star clusters are located at the dynamical centers of the majority of
galaxies. They are usually the densest and most massive star cluster in their
host galaxy. In this article, I will give a brief overview of our current
knowledge on nuclear star clusters and their formation. Subsequently, I will
introduce the nuclear star cluster at the center of the Milky Way, that
surrounds the massive black hole, Sagittarius A*. This cluster is a unique
template for understanding nuclear star clusters in general because it is the
only one of its kind which we can resolve into individual stars. Thus, we can
study its structure, dynamics, and population in detail. I will summarize our
current knowledge of the Milky Way nuclear star cluster, discuss its relation
with nuclear clusters in other galaxies, and point out where further research
is needed.
