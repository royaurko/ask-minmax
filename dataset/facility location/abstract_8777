A massive young star cluster, initially embedded in its parent molecular
cloud, will spiral into the Galactic Center from $\lta 30m_6^{1/2}\pc$ during
the life-time of its most massive stars, if the combined total mass is $\sim
10^6m_6\msun$. On its way inwards the system loses most of its mass to the
strong tidal field, until the dense cluster core of high-mass stars is finally
disrupted near the central black hole. A simple model is presented to argue
that this scenario may under plausible conditions explain the observed location
and rotation of the Galactic Center HeI stars. Accretion of star clusters into
the Galactic Center could be recurrent, and play an important role in
regulating the activity of Sgr A$^\ast$.
