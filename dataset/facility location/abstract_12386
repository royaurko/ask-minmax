We present an optimization of the hadron focusing system for a low-energy
high-intensity conventional neutrino beam (Super-Beam) proposed on the basis of
the HP-SPL at CERN with a beam power of 4 MW and an energy of 4.5 GeV. The far
detector would be a 440 kton Water Cherenkov detector (MEMPHYS) located at a
baseline of 130 km in the Fr\'ejus site. The neutrino fluxes simulation relies
on a new GEANT4 based simulation coupled with an optimization algorithm based
on the maximization of the sensitivity limit on the $\theta_{13}$ mixing angle.
A new configuration adopting a multiple horn system with solid targets is
proposed which improves the sensitivity to $\theta_{13}$ and the CP violating
phase $\delta_{CP}$.
