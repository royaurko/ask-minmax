The Dirichlet process mixture model and more general mixtures based on
discrete random probability measures have been shown to be flexible and
accurate models for density estimation and clustering. The goal of this paper
is to illustrate the use of normalized random measures as mixing measures in
nonparametric hierarchical mixture models and point out how possible
computational issues can be successfully addressed. To this end, we first
provide a concise and accessible introduction to normalized random measures
with independent increments. Then, we explain in detail a particular way of
sampling from the posterior using the Ferguson-Klass representation. We develop
a thorough comparative analysis for location-scale mixtures that considers a
set of alternatives for the mixture kernel and for the nonparametric component.
Simulation results indicate that normalized random measure mixtures potentially
represent a valid default choice for density estimation problems. As a
byproduct of this study an R package to fit these models was produced and is
available in the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).
