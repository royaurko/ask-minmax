We present new optical and X-ray observations to show that the X-ray source 1
WGA J1346.5--6255 previously associated with the SNR G309.2--0.6 can be
unequivocally identified with the emission line star HD 119682 located in the
foreground open cluster NGC 5281. Images from Chandra in the X-ray band as well
as from Magellan in the narrow optical H-alpha band show a coincidence of the
source positions within 0.5". The X-ray source appears extremely hot for an
OB-star identified as of O9.7e type. XMM-Newton spectra show plasma
temperatures of 1 keV and >8 keV with an X-ray luminosity of 6.2E32 +/-0.1E32
erg/s. The optical and X-ray properties are very reminiscent of the prototype
emission line star Gamma-Cas. We discuss the ramifications of this similarity
with respect to very early type emission line stars as a new class of hard
X-ray sources.
