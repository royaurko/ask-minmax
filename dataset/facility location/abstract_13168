The study of meteorite craters on Earth provides information about the
dynamic evolution of bodies within the Solar System. Bosumtwi crater is a well
studied, 10.5 km in diameter, ca. 1.07 Ma old impact structure located in
Ghana. The impactor was $\sim$ 1 km in diameter, an ordinary chondrite and
struck the Earth with an angle between 30$^\circ$ and 45$^\circ$ from the
horizontal. We have used a two phase backward integration to constrain the most
probable parent region of the impactor. We find that the most likely source
region is a high inclination object from the Middle Main Belt.
