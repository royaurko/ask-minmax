We present VI photometry for the open cluster NGC 637 which is located in the
Cassiopeia region. Morphology of cluster color-magnitude diagram indicates that
it is a young object with age of a few million years. The apparent distance
modulus of the cluster is 13.9<(m-M)_V<14.3, while reddening is
0.69<E(V-I)<0.73. We estimated the heliocentric distance as 2.6<d<3.3 kpc. We
also report the identification of two variable stars in NGC 637. One of the
variables is a non-radial pulsating beta Cep-type star. Other one is a likely
ellipsoidal variable, however its pulsating nature can not be excluded.
