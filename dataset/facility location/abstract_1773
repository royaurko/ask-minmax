The photoproduction of omega mesons on nuclei has been investigated using the
Crystal Barrel/TAPS experiment at the ELSA tagged photon facility in Bonn. The
aim is to study possible in-medium modifications of the omega meson via the
reaction A(gamma, omega)X. Results obtained for Nb are compared to a reference
measurement on a liquid hydrogen target. While for recoiling, long-lived mesons
(pi, eta and etaprime), which decay outside of the nucleus, a difference in the
lineshape for the two data samples is not observed, we find a significant
enhancement towards lower masses for omega mesons with low momenta produced on
the Nb target.
