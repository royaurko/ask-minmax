We perform a multi-band statistical analysis of core-dominated superluminal
active galactic nuclei (AGN) detected with Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT).
The detection rate of $\gamma$-ray jets is found to be high for optically
bright AGN. There is a significant correlation between the $\gamma$-ray
luminosity and the optical nuclear and radio (15 GHz) luminosities of AGN. We
report a well defined positive correlation between the $\gamma$-ray luminosity
and the radio-loudness for quasars and BL Lacertae type objects (BL Lacs). The
slope of the best-fit line is significantly different for quasars and BL Lacs.
The relations between the optical and radio luminosities and the $\gamma$-ray
loudness are also examined, showing a different behavior for the populations of
quasars and BL Lacs. Statistical results suggest that the $\gamma$-ray, optical
and radio emission is generated at different locations and velocity regimes
along the parsec-scale jet.
