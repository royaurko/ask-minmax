We consider an electrostatic qubit located near a Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC) of noninteracting bosons in a double-well potential, which is used for
qubit measurements. Tracing out the BEC variables we obtain a simple analytical
expression for the qubit's density-matrix. The qubit's evolution exhibits a
slow ($\propto1/\sqrt{t}$) damping of the qubit's coherence term, which however
turns to be a Gaussian one in the case of static qubit. This stays in contrast
to the exponential damping produced by most classical detectors. The
decoherence is, in general, incomplete and strongly depends on the initial
state of the qubit.
