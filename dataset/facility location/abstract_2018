During the past five years, the Spitzer Space Telescope and improved
ground-based facilities have enabled a huge increase in the number of
circumstellar disks, around young stars of Solar mass or smaller, in which the
composition of the solid component has been studied with complete mid-infrared
spectra. With these samples we can assess observationally the evolution of dust
through the planet-forming era, in parallel with the evolution of the
composition and structure of protoplanetary disks. Here we will review the
progress in this endeavour, with emphasis on objects in nearby associations and
star-formation regions, and on the methods by which dust composition is
determined from the infrared spectra of young stellar objects.
