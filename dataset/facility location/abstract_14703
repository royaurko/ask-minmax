We present the Catalog of microlensing events detected toward the Galactic
bulge in three observing seasons, 1997--1999, during the OGLE-II microlensing
survey. The search for microlensing events was performed using a database of
about 4*10^9 photometric measurements of about 20.5 million stars from the
Galactic bulge. The Catalog comprises 214 cases of microlensing events found in
the fields covering about 11 square degrees on the sky and distributed in
different parts of the Galactic bulge. The sample includes 20 binary
microlensing events, 14 of them are caustic crossing. In one case a double star
is likely lensed.
  We present distribution of the basic parameters of microlensing events and
show preliminary rate of microlensing in different regions of the Galactic
bulge. The latter reveals clear dependence on the Galactic coordinates. The
dependence on 'l' indicates that the majority of lenses toward the Galactic
bulge are located in the Galactic bar. Models of the Galactic bar seem to
reasonably predict the observed spatial distribution of microlensing events in
the Galactic bulge.
  All data presented in the Catalog and photometry of all events are available
from the OGLE Internet archive.
