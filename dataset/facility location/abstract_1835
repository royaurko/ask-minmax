An update is presented on a conceptual design for a pion production target
station using a rotating cupronickel band and that was originally proposed for
use at a muon collider facility with a 4 MW pulsed proton beam. After reviewing
the salient design features and motivations for this target, ongoing studies
are described that are attempting to benchmark the thermal stresses and
radiation damage on the target band using data from the Fermilab antiproton
source and other operating targets. Possible parameter optimizations and
alternative technologies for the rotating band are surveyed, including
discussion on the the various proton beam parameters that might be encountered
for rotating band targets at either muon colliders or neutrino factories.
Finally, an outline is proposed for a possible R&D path towards capability for
the actual construction of rotating band pion production targets.
