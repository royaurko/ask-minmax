The performance of scintillating fibre detectors was studied with electrons
at the spectrometer facility of the Mainz microtron MAMI, as well as in a C-12
beam of 2 AGeV energy and in a beam of different particle species at GSI.
Multi-anode photomultipliers were used to read out one or more bundles of 128
fibres each in different geometries. For electrons a time resolution of FWHM =
1 ns was measured in a single detector plane with a detection efficiency
epsilon > 99%. A time resolution of 310 ps (FWHM) between two planes of fibres
was achieved for carbon ions, leading to a FWHM = 220 ps for a single detector.
The hit position residual was measured with a width of FWHM = 0.27 mm. The
variation in the measured energy deposition was Delta E/E= 15-20% (FWHM) for
carbon ions. In addition, the energy response to p/pi/d particles was studied.
Based on the good detector performance fibre hodoscopes will be constructed for
the KAOS/A1 spectrometer at MAMI and for the HypHI experiment at GSI.
