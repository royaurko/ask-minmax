The determination of parton distribution functions in the nucleon and nuclei
is important for obtaining precise hadron-reaction cross sections, from which
any new exotic signature could be found. We show that a future neutrino factory
could provide important information on the parton distributions. First, a
recent effort concerning the parametrization of nuclear parton distributions is
explained. It suggests that the factory should be important for determining
unknown behavior of valence-quark distributions in nuclei at small $x$. Second,
the facility could be used for understanding nucleon spin structure and isospin
violation in the parton distributions.
