We report the first identification of the optical bands of the B-X system of
AlO in the red supergiant VY CMa. In addition to TiO, VO, ScO, and YO, which
were recognized in the optical spectrum of the star long time ago, AlO is
another refractory molecule which displays strong emission bands in this
peculiar star. Simulating the bands of AlO, we derive a rotational temperature
of the circumstellar gas of Trot=700K. By resolving individual rotational
components of the bands, we derive the kinematical characteristics of the gas,
finding that the emission is centered at the stellar radial velocity and its
intrinsic width is 13.5 km/s (full width at half maximum). It is the narrowest
emission among all (thermal) features observed in VY CMa so far. The
temperature and line widths suggest that the emission arises in gas located
within ~20 stellar radii, where the outflow is still being accelerated. This
result contradicts equilibrium-chemistry models which predict substantial AlO
abundances only to within a few stellar radii. We argue that non-equilibrium
models involving propagation of shocks are needed to explain the observations.
