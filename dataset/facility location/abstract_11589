Using a high performance computer cluster, we run simulations regarding an
open problem about d-dimensional critical branching random walks in a random
IID environment The environment is given by the rule that at every site
independently, with probability p>0, there is a cookie, completely suppressing
the branching of any particle located there. Abstract. The simulations suggest
self averaging: the asymptotic survival probability in n steps is the same in
the annealed and the quenched case; it is \frac{2}{qn}, where q:=1-p. This
particular asymptotics indicates a non-trivial phenomenon: the tail of the
survival probability (both in the annealed and the quenched case) is the same
as in the case of non-spatial unit time critical branching, where the branching
rule is modified: branching only takes place with probability q for every
particle at every iteration.
