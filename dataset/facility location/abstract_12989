We propose an effect whereby an electric current along the interface between
a ferromagnetic and normal metal leads to injection of pure spin current into
the normal metal, if the magnetization-direction in the ferromagnet varies
along the direction of current. For the specific example of a ferromagnetic
domain wall, we compute the inverse spin-Hall effect voltage this spin current
gives rise to when injected into a Pt layer. Furthermore, we show that this
pure spin current leads to modification of the parameters that govern spin
transfer and current-driven domain-wall motion, which can be use to optimize
the latter in layered magnetic systems. This effect in principle enables
control over the location of spin-current injection in devices.
