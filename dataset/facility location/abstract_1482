Chemical abundances provide important clues to the evolution of galaxies.
Ionized nebulae are one of the main sources of chemical abundance measurements,
especially in external galaxies. Studies of H II regions have shown that the
overall metallicity of galaxies increases with galactic luminosity, and that
spiral galaxies characteristically have radial gradients in chemical
composition. There are indications of environmental influences on chemical
abundances. Planetary nebulae provide another measure of abundances in the
Milky Way and other galaxies. Space facilities have allowed measurements for
elements that are inaccessible at optical wavelengths. Large telescopes make
possible the study of individual stars in external galaxies and the study of
interstellar abundances in galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts. These
advances promise exciting times as astrophysicists strive to paint a complete
picture of galactic evolution from the Big Bang to the present.
