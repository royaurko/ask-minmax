In this paper it is shown that the location of the characteristic overshoot
of the Richardson's annular effect changes with the Kinematic Reynolds number
$\omega^*=\omega r_0^2 /\nu$ in the range of frequencies within the laminar
regime. From the study of the Richardson's overshoot at different times it was
identified the existence of aparent transverse damped waves similar to those
ones observed in the famous Stokes second problem, the physical analysis of
this waves was used for the establishment of a semi-empirical law that gives
the functional relation of the mean overshoot maximum with the kinematic
reynolds number, say $B_0(\omega^*)=2.28 + 0.51{\omega^*}^{-1/2}$. Finally a
transient solution was constructed and verified asymptotically for large times,
and the tipical time for which the transient solution resembles the steady
oscillating one was identified to be dependent of the viscosity of the fluid
and of the radius of the pipe.
