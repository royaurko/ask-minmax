Supernovae (SNe) exploding in a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) are
predicted to accelerate cosmic rays in collisionless shocks and emit GeV gamma
rays and TeV neutrinos on a time scale of several months. Here we summarize the
results of the first systematic search for gamma-ray emission in Fermi-LAT data
in the energy range from 100 MeV to 300 GeV from a large sample of SNe
exploding in dense CSM. We search for a gamma-ray excess at the position of 147
SNe Type IIn in a one year time window after the optical peak time. In addition
we combine the closest and optically brightest sources of our sample in a joint
likelihood analysis in three different time windows (3, 6 and 12 months). No
excess gamma-ray emission is found and limits on the gamma-ray luminosity and
the ratio of gamma-ray to optical luminosity are presented.
