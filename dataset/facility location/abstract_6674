Previous human foraging experiments have shown that human groups routinely
undermatch environmental resources much like other animal species. In this
experiment, we test whether humans also selectively rely on others as
information sources when the environmental state is uncertain, and we also test
whether overt signals of other foragers' success influences group matching
behavior and group adaptation to a changing environment. The results show
evidence of reliance on social information in specific conditions, but
participants were primarily influenced by their individual assessments of food
location rather than the success of other foragers.
