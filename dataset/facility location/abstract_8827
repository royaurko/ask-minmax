Using the PV observation of A1795, we illustrate the capability of XMM-EPIC
to measure cluster temperature profiles, a key ingredient for the determination
of cluster mass profiles through the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium. We
develop a methodology for spatially resolved spectroscopy of extended sources,
adapted to XMM background and vignetting characteristics. The effect of the
particle induced background is discussed. A simple unbiased method is proposed
to correct for vignetting effects, in which every photon is weighted according
to its energy and location on the detector. We were able to derive the
temperature profile of A1795 up to 0.4 times the virial radius. A significant
and spatially resolved drop in temperature towards the center (r<200 kpc) is
observed, which corresponds to the cooling flow region of the cluster. Beyond
that region, the temperature is constant with no indication of a fall-off at
large radii out to 1.2 Mpc.
