The pressure effects on the JT distortion of three representative compounds
belonging to the LaMn_1-xGa_xO_3 (x= 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) family was widely
investigated by means of X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. A compound
with a fully JT distorted structure (x=0.2), one with regular octahedra (x=0.6)
and one in an intermediate configuration (x=0.3) were selected. A pressure
induced transitions from the orthorhombic Pbnm phase towards structures with
higher symmetry were observed in all the samples. Both Raman and X-ray data
confirm that the most important structural effect of pressure is that of
reducing the octahedral distortion. The appearance of a feature in the lattice
parameter behavior connected to a structural instability was also detected,
pointing out the key role of the JT distortion in stabilizing the manganite
structures. On the other hand, the complete suppression of the JT distortion in
the high-pressure phases cannot be claimed. The Raman spectra collected from
more distorted compounds (x=0.2, 0.3) reveal clearly the coexistence of domains
of distorted and more regular octahedra in a certain pressure range. The first
sketch of the Pressure vs. Ga-content phase diagram was drawn.
