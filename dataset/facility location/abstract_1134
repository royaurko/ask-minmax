We demonstrate computerized tomography (CT) reconstruction from absorption,
phase and dark-field signals obtained from scans where the X-ray probe light is
modulated with speckle. Two different interlaced schemes are proposed to reduce
the number of sample exposures as well as the total time of irradiation. The
first scheme allows tomographic reconstruction with the three different signals
obtained from multiple images per projection whilst the second one provides
absorption and phase reconstruction but from a single image per angular
projection. Experimental reconstructions of tomography data obtained at a
synchrotron facility emphasize the potential of the approach for the imaging of
dose sensitive samples.
