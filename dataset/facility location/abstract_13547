First observations of electrostatic potential variations within the flux
surfaces of a toroidal magnetic confinement device are presented. Measurements
are taken in the TJ-II stellarator with two distant Langmuir probe arrays. The
edge floating potentials display differences of several tens of Volts in
electron-root wave-heated plasmas. The differences are reduced for higher
densities and lower electron temperatures after the ion-root electric field
forms at the plasma edge. Neoclassical Monte Carlo simulations estimate the
correct order of magnitude for the overall variation in potential and predict
the trend observed with the radial electric field. However, for the specific
location of the probes, the simulations give differences smaller than those
observed experimentally.
