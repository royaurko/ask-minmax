We report on the design and status of the FLAMINGOS-2 instrument - a
fully-cryogenic facility near-infrared imager and multi-object spectrograph for
the Gemini 8-meter telescopes. FLAMINGOS-2 has a refractive all-spherical
optical system providing 0.18-arcsecond pixels and a 6.2-arcminute circular
field-of-view on a 2048x2048-pixel HAWAII-2 0.9-2.4 mm detector array. A
slit/decker wheel mechanism allows the selection of up to 9 multi-object
laser-machined plates or 3 long slits for spectroscopy over a 6x2-arcminute
field of view, and selectable grisms provide resolutions from $\sim$ 1300 to
$\sim $3000 over the entire spectrograph bandpass. FLAMINGOS-2 is also
compatible with the Gemini Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics system, providing
multi-object spectroscopic capabilities over a 3x1-arcminute field with high
spatial resolution (0.09-arcsec/pixel). We review the designs of optical,
mechanical, electronics, software, and On-Instrument WaveFront Sensor
subsystems. We also present the current status of the project, currently in
final testing in mid-2006.
