Knowledge of window style, content, location and grammatical structure may be
used to classify documents as originating within a particular discipline or may
be used to place a document on a theory versus practice spectrum. This
distinction is also studied here using the type-token ratio to differentiate
between sublanguages. The statistical significance of windows is computed,
based on the the presence of terms in titles, abstracts, citations, and section
headers, as well as binary independent (BI) and inverse document frequency
(IDF) weightings. The characteristics of windows are studied by examining their
within window density (WWD) and the S concentration (SC), the concentration of
terms from various document fields (e.g. title, abstract) in the fulltext. The
rate of window occurrences from the beginning to the end of document fulltext
differs between academic fields. Different syntactic structures in sublanguages
are examined, and their use is considered for discriminating between specific
academic disciplines and, more generally, between theory versus practice or
knowledge versus applications oriented documents.
