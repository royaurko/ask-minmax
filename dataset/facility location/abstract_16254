LOPES is a digitally read out antenna array consisting of 30 calibrated
dipole antennas. It is located at the site of the KASCADE-Grande experiment at
Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe and measures the radio emission of cosmic ray air
showers in the frequency band from 40 to 80 MHz. LOPES is triggered by KASCADE
and uses the KASCADE reconstruction of the shower axis as an input for the
analysis of the radio pulses. Thereby LOPES works as an interferometer when the
signal of all antennas is digitally merged to form a beam into the shower
direction. To be sensitive to the coherence of the radio signal, a precise time
calibration with an accuracy in the order of 1 ns is required. Thus, it is
necessary to know the delay of each antenna which is time and frequency
dependent. Several calibration measurements are performed to correct for this
delay in the analysis: The group delay of every antenna is measured regularly
(roughly once per year) by recording a test pulse which is emitted at a known
time. Furthermore, the delay is monitored continuously by the so called phase
calibration method: A beacon (a dipole antenna) emits continuously two sine
waves at 63.5 MHz and 68.1 MHz. By that a variation of the delay can be
detected in a subsequent analysis of the radio events as a change of the phase
at these frequencies. Finally, the dispersion of the analog electronics has
been measured to account for the frequency dependence of the delay.
