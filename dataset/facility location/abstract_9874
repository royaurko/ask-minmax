We present an analysis of a time series of a wind strength measurements
recorded at Florence airport in the period October 2002 - March 2003. The data
were taken simultaneously by two runway head anemometers, located at a distance
of 900 m, at a frequency of 3.3 10-3 Hz. The data show strong correlations over
long time spans over a few tens of hours. We performed an analysis of wind
velocity as it is usually done for turbulence laboratory experiments. Wind
velocity returns and wind velocity differences were considered. The pdfs of
these quantities exhibit strong non-Gaussian fat tails. The distribution of the
standand deviations of the fluctuations can be successfully reproduced by a
Gamma distribution, while the Log-normal one fails completely. Following Beck
and Cohen superstatistics approach, we extract the Tsallis entropic index q
from this Gamma distribution. The corresponding q-exponential curves reproduce
with a very good accuracy the pdfs of returns and velocity differences.
