We present a simple fabrication technique for lateral nanowire wrap-gate
devices with high capacitive coupling and field-effect mobility. Our process
uses e-beam lithography with a single resist-spinning step, and does not
require chemical etching. We measure, in the temperature range 1.5-250 K, a
subthreshold slope of 5-54 mV/decade and mobility of 2800-2500 $cm^2/Vs$ --
significantly larger than previously reported lateral wrap-gate devices. At
depletion, the barrier height due to the gated region is proportional to
applied wrap-gate voltage.
