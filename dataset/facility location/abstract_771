Preliminary results of the analyzing power for the production of forward,
high-energy pi0 mesons from collisions of transversely polarized protons at
sqrt(s)=200 GeV from STAR are presented. The kinematic ranges covered by the
data are x_F=0.2-0.6 and p_T=1-3 GeV/c. The analyzing power at sqrt(s)=200 GeV
is found to be comparable to that observed at sqrt(s)=20 GeV.
