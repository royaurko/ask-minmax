We study the dynamics of the batch minority game, with random external
information, using generating functional techniques a la De Dominicis. The
relevant control parameter in this model is the ratio $\alpha=p/N$ of the
number $p$ of possible values for the external information over the number $N$
of trading agents. In the limit $N\to\infty$ we calculate the location
$\alpha_c$ of the phase transition (signaling the onset of anomalous response),
and solve the statics for $\alpha>\alpha_c$ exactly. The temporal correlations
in global market fluctuations turn out not to decay to zero for infinitely
widely separated times. For $\alpha<\alpha_c$ the stationary state is shown to
be non-unique. For $\alpha\to 0$ we analyse our equations in leading order in
$\alpha$, and find asymptotic solutions with diverging volatility
$\sigma=\order(\alpha^{-{1/2}})$ (as regularly observed in simulations), but
also asymptotic solutions with vanishing volatility
$\sigma=\order(\alpha^{{1/2}})$. The former, however, are shown to emerge only
if the agents' initial strategy valuations are below a specific critical value.
