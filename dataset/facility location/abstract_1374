We obtain phase diagrams of regular and irregular finite connectivity
spin-glasses. Contact is firstly established between properties of the phase
diagram and the performances of low density parity check codes (LDPC) within
the Replica Symmetric (RS) ansatz. We then study the location of the dynamical
and critical transition of these systems within the one step Replica Symmetry
Breaking theory (RSB), extending similar calculations that have been performed
in the past for the Bethe spin-glass problem. We observe that, away from the
Nishimori line, in the low temperature region, the location of the dynamical
transition line does change within the RSB theory, in comparison with the (RS)
case. For LDPC decoding over the binary erasure channel we find, at zero
temperature and rate R=1/4 an RS critical transition point located at p_c =
0.67 while the critical RSB transition point is located at p_c = 0.7450, to be
compared with the corresponding Shannon bound 1-R. For the binary symmetric
channel (BSC) we show that the low temperature reentrant behavior of the
dynamical transition line, observed within the RS ansatz, changes within the
RSB theory; the location of the dynamical transition point occurring at higher
values of the channel noise. Possible practical implications to improve the
performances of the state-of-the-art error correcting codes are discussed.
