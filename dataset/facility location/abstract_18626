We report on the multi-epoch observations of H2O maser emission in star
forming region OH 43.8-0.1 carried out with VLBI Exploration of Radio
Astrometry (VERA). The large-scale maser distributions obtained by single-beam
VLBI mapping reveal new maser spots scattered in area of 0.7 x 1.0 arcsec, in
addition to a `shell-like' structure with a scale of 0.3 x 0.5 arcsec which was
previously mapped by Downes et al.(1979). Proper motions are also obtained for
43 spots based on 5-epoch monitoring with a time span of 281 days. The
distributions of proper motions show a systematic outflow in the north-south
direction with an expansion velocity of ~8 km/s, and overall distributions of
maser spots as well as proper motions are better represented by a bipolar flow
plus a central maser cluster with a complex structure, rather than a shell with
a uniform expansion such as those found in Cep A R5 and W75N VLA2. The distance
to OH 43.8-0.1 is also estimated based on the statistical parallax, yielding D
= 2.8 +/- 0.5 kpc. This distance is consistent with a near kinematic distance
and rules out a far kinematics distance (~9 kpc), and the LSR velocity of OH
43.8-0.1 combined with the distance provides a constraint on the flatness of
the galactic rotation curve, that there is no systematic difference in rotation
speeds at the Sun and at the position of OH 43.8-0.1, which is located at the
galacto-centric radius of ~6.3 kpc.
