Employing an attenuated oscillation method, the anisotropic interaction force
between two vertically aligned dust particles located in the sheath of a
complex plasma was measured experimentally based on a linear approximation to
the interaction force. Experimental data shows that although both particles
experience a repulsive interaction force, the upper particle experiences a
stronger magnitude force than does the lower. This result can be explained by
the ion wakefield since the lower particle resides within the ion wakefield
generated by the streaming ions passing through the sheath and around the upper
particle.
