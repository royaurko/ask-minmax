This paper describes test particle simulations of the response of the outer
parts of Galactic disks to barring and spiral structure. Simulations are
conducted for cold Mestel disks and warm quasi-exponential disks with
completely flat rotation curves, subjected to pure quadrupoles and logarithmic
spirals. Even though the starting velocity distributions are smooth, the
end-points of the bar simulations show bimodality and multi-peaked structures
at locations near the outer Lindblad resonance (OLR), although spirality can
make this smoother. The growth of a bar may cause the disk isophotes to become
boxy at the OLR, as stars accummulate particularly along the minor axis. The
growth of a bar is also accompanied by substantial heating of the disk stars
near the OLR. For the growth of a $10^{10} M_{\rm \odot}$ bar, the radial
velocity dispersion is typically quadrupled for initially cold disks (initial
\sigmau $\sim 10$ \kms), and typically doubled for disks with final \sigmau
$\sim 45$ \kms. Simulations performed of the growth and dissolution of bars
give very similar results, demonstrating that the heat once given to disk stars
is very difficult to remove.
