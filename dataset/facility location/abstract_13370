We investigate the capabilities of hyperbolic metamaterials (HMs) to couple
near-fields (i.e., evanescent waves) emitted by a two-dimensional periodic
array of electric dipoles to propagating waves. In particular, large order
Floquet harmonics with transverse magnetic (TM) polarization, that would be
evanescent in free space and therefore confined near the array surface, are
transformed into propagating spectrum inside the HM, and thus carry power away.
Because of this property, independent of the finite or infinite extent of the
HM, the power generated by an array of elementary electric dipoles is strongly
enhanced when the array is located near a HM surface and is mostly directed
into the HM. In particular, the power coupled to the HM exhibits narrow
frequency features that can be employed in detection applications. The results
shown in this paper provide a clear signature on wave dynamics in HMs. A link
between the results pertaining to the case of an isolated dipole on top of HM
and the planar array is found convenient to explain both wave dynamics and
spectral power distribution. The narrow frequency emission features appear in
the array case only; they depend on its spatial periodicity and remarkable on
the HM thickness.
