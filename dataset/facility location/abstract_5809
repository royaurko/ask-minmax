The dynamic process for the two dimensional three state Potts model in the
critical domain is simulated by the Monte Carlo method. It is shown that the
critical point can rigorously be located from the universal short-time
behaviour. This makes it possible to investigate critical dynamics
independently of the equilibrium state. From the power law behaviour of the
magnetization the exponents $\beta / (\nu z)$ and $1/ (\nu z)$ are determined.
