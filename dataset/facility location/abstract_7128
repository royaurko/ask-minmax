In the digital watermarking with DCT method,the watermark is located within a
range of DCT coefficients of the cover image. In this paper to use the
low-frequency band, a new method is proposed by using a combination of the DCT
and PCA transform. The proposed method is compared to other DCT methods, our
method is robust and keeps the quality of cover image, also increases capacity
of the watermarking.
