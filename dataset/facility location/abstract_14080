Fast Radios Bursts (FRBs) show large dispersion measures (DMs), suggesting an
extragalactic location. We analyze the DMs of the 11 known FRBs in detail and
identify steps as integer multiples of half the lowest DM found, 187.5cm$^{-3}$
pc, so that DMs occur in groups centered at 375, 562, 750, 937, 1125cm$^{-3}$
pc, with errors observed <5%. We estimate the likelhood of a coincidence as
5:10,000. We speculate that this could originate from a Galaxy population of
FRBs, with Milky Way DM contribution as model deviations, and an underlying
generator process that produces FRBs with DMs in discrete steps. However, we
find that FRBs tend to arrive at close to the full integer second, like
man-made perytons. If this holds, FRBs would also be man-made. This can be
verified, or refuted, with new FRBs to be detected.
