We investigate the dynamic impact of heterogeneous environments on
superdiffusive random walks known as L\'evy flights. We devote particular
attention to the relative weight of source and target locations on the rates
for spatial displacements of the random walk. Unlike ordinary random walks
which are slowed down for all values of the relative weight of source and
target, non-local superdiffusive processes show distinct regimes of attenuation
and acceleration for increased source and target weight, respectively.
Consequently, spatial inhomogeneities can facilitate the spread of
superdiffusive processes, in contrast to common belief that external disorder
generally slows down stochastic processes. Our results are based on a novel
type of fractional Fokker-Planck equation which we investigate numerically and
by perturbation theory for weak disorder.
