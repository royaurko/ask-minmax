Starburst99 is a comprehensive set of model predictions for
spectrophotometric and related properties of galaxies with active star
formation. The models are an improved and extended version of the data set
previously published by Leitherer & Heckman (1995). We have upgraded our code
by implementing the latest set of stellar evolution models of the Geneva group
and the model atmosphere grid compiled by Lejeune et al. (1997). Several
predictions which were not included in the previous publication are shown here
for the first time. The models are presented in a homogeneous way for five
metallicities between Z = 0.040 and 0.001 and three choices of the initial mass
function. The age coverage is 10^6 to 10^9 yr. We also show the spectral energy
distributions which are used to compute colors and other quantities. The full
data set is available for retrieval at
http://www.stsci.edu/science/starburst99/. This website allows users to run
specific models with non-standard parameters as well. We also make the source
code available to the community.
