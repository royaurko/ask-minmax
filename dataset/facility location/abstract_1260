A simple method to generate a two-dimensional binary grid pattern, which
allows for absolute and accurate self-location in a finite planar region, is
proposed. The pattern encodes position information in a local way so that
reading a small number of its black or white pixels at any place provides
sufficient data from which the location can be decoded both efficiently and
robustly.
