In this study, we investigate hybrid utilization of angle-of-arrival (AOA)
and received signal strength (RSS) information in visible light communication
(VLC) systems for 3D localization. We show that AOA-based localization method
allows the receiver to locate itself via a least squares estimator by
exploiting the directionality of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). We then prove
that when the RSS information is taken into account, the positioning accuracy
of AOA-based localization can be improved further using a weighted least
squares solution. On the other hand, when the radiation patterns of LEDs are
explicitly considered in the estimation, RSS-based localization yields highly
accurate results. In order to deal with the system of nonlinear equations for
RSS-based localization, we develop an analytical learning rule based on the
Newton-Raphson method. The non-convex structure is addressed by initializing
the learning rule based on 1) location estimates, and 2) a newly developed
method, which we refer as random report and cluster algorithm. As a benchmark,
we also derive analytical expression of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for
RSS-based localization, which captures any deployment scenario positioning in
3D geometry. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
solutions for a wide range of LED characteristics and orientations through
extensive computer simulations.
