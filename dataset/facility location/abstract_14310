This paper presents a performance analysis of self-interference cancellation
methods in full-duplex large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems. To support huge data traffic demands, we assume that the base station
is assumed to be located in the small cell, giving it compact antenna arrays
with a high channel correlation. From the analysis and the numerical results,
the time-domain-cancellation (TDC) outperforms the spatial suppression in the
perfect channel estimation cases. It is also concluded that the ergodic
performance of the spatial suppression is better than those of the TDC in the
imperfect channel estimation.
