We study numerically the critical properties of the U(1)-Higgs lattice model,
with fixed Higgs modulus, in the region of small gauge coupling where the Higgs
and Confining phases merge. We find evidence of a first order transition line
that ends in a second order point. By means of a rotation in parameter space we
introduce thermodynamic magnitudes and critical exponents in close resemblance
with simple models that show analogous critical behaviour. The measured data
allow us to fit the critical exponents finding values in agreement with the
mean field prediction. The location of the critical point and the slope of the
first order line are accurately given.
