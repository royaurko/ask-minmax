We present results from a deep VERITAS exposure of the distant (z=0.89)
flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) 4C +55.17. The high flux, hard index and
steady emission found by Fermi LAT observations make this blazar a promising
very-high-energy (VHE; E>100 GeV) candidate, offering a possibility to clarify
the location of FSRQ VHE emission. Non-detection supports the hypothesis that
any VHE gamma-rays are produced within and absorbed by the broad-line region
while VHE detection would support an emission region outside the broad line
region and far from the base of the jet. This FSRQ additionally provides the
possible means, by photon-photon pair production, to constrain the currently
available extragalactic background light (EBL) models out to the groundbreaking
redshift of z=0.89. The log-parabolic model that is fitted to the LAT photons
allows an extrapolation of the fit up to VHE while accounting for the gamma-ray
absorption by the EBL. The VERITAS upper limit derived from the deep exposure
is compared to this extrapolated VHE flux.
