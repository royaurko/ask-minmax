The Isaac Newton Telescope Photometric H-alpha Survey (IPHAS) is currently
mapping the Northern Galactic plane reaching to r'=20 mag with typically 1"
resolution. Hundreds of Planetary Nebulae (PNe), both point-like and resolved,
are expected to be discovered. We report on the discovery of the first new PN
from this survey: it is an unusual object located at a large galactocentric
distance and has a very low oxygen abundance. The nebula shows an intricate
morphology: there is an inner ring surrounding the central star, bright inner
lobes with an enhanced waist, and very faint lobular extensions reaching up to
more than 100". We classify it as a quadrupolar PN, a rather unusual class of
planetary showing two pairs of misaligned lobes. From long-slit spectroscopy we
derive Te[NII] =12800+-1000K, Ne = 390+-40 cm-3, and chemical abundances
typical of Peimbert's Type I nebulae (He/H =0.13, N/O =1.8) with an oxygen
abundance of 12 + log(O/H)=8.17+-0.15. A kinematic distance of 7.0 kpc is
derived, implying an unusually large size of >4 pc for the nebula. The
photometry of the central star indicates the presence of a relatively cool
companion. This, and the evidence for a dense circumstellar disk and
quadrupolar morphology, all of which are rare among PNe, support the hypothesis
that this morphology is related to binary interaction.
