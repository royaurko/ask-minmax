An electronically excited atom or molecule located outside but near a planar
optical waveguide can decay by spontaneous emission of a photon into a guided
mode of the waveguide. We outline a QED theory for calculating the probability
for this process and describe general physical insights from that theory. A
couple of representative examples are discussed in detail.
