We report on a shell-model study of Sn isotopes beyond N=82 employing a
realistic effective interaction derived from the CD-Bonn nucleon-nucleon
potential renormalized through use of the V-low-k approach. At present, the
most exotic Sn isotope for which some experimental information exists is 134Sn
with an N/Z ratio of 1.68. It is the aim of our study to compare the results of
our calculations with the available experimental data and to make predictions
for the neighboring heavier isotopes which may be within reach of the next
generation of radioactive ion beam facilities. The very good agreement between
theory and experiment obtained for 134Sn gives confidence in the predictive
power of our realistic shell-model calculations.
