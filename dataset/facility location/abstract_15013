A galaxy can act as a gravitational lens, producing multiple images of a
background object. Theory predicts there should be an odd number of images but,
paradoxically, almost all observed lenses have 2 or 4 images. The missing image
should be faint and appear near the galaxy's center. These ``central images''
have long been sought as probes of galactic cores too distant to resolve with
ordinary observations. There are five candidates, but in one case the third
image is not necessarily a central image, and in the others, the central
component might be a foreground source rather than a lensed image. Here we
report the most secure identification of a central image, based on radio
observations of PMN J1632-0033, one of the latter candidates. Lens models
incorporating the central image show that the mass of the lens galaxy's central
black hole is less than 2 x 10^8 M_sun, and the galaxy's surface density at the
location of the central image is more than 20,000 M_sun per square parsec, in
agreement with expectations based on observations of galaxies hundreds of times
closer to the Earth.
