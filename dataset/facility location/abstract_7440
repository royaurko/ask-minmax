Based on the Ogorodnikov-Milne model, we analyze the proper motions of 95 633
red giant clump (RGC) stars from the Tycho-2 Catalogue. The following Oort
constants have been found: A = 15.9+-0.2 km/s/kpc and B = -12.0+-0.2 km/s/kpc.
Using 3632 RGC stars with known proper motions, radial velocities, and
photometric distances, we show that, apart from the star centroid velocity
components relative to the Sun, only the model parameters that describe the
stellar motions in the XY plane differ significantly from zero. We have studied
the contraction (a negative K-effect) of the system of RGC stars as a function
of their heliocentric distance and elevation above the Galactic plane. For a
sample of distant (500--1000 pc) RGC stars located near the Galactic plane
(|Z|<200 pc) with an average distance of d=0.7 kpc, the contraction velocity is
shown to be Kd= -3.5+-0.9 km/s; a noticeable vertex deviation, lxy = 9.1+-0.5
degrees, is also observed for them. For stars located well above the Galactic
plane (|Z|>=200 pc), these effects are less pronounced, Kd = -1.7+-0.5 km/s and
lxy = 4.9+-0.6 degrees. Using RGC stars, we have found a rotation around the
Galactic X axis directed toward the Galactic center with an angular velocity of
-2.5+-0.3 km/s/kpc, which we associate with the warp of the Galactic
stellar-gaseous disk.
