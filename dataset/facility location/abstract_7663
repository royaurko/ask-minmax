Exploring the accelerated expansion of the universe, we investigate the
generalized ghost dark energy (GGDE) model from the statefinder diagnosis
analysis in a flat FRW universe. First we calculate the cosmological evolution
and statefinder trajectories for non-interacting case and then extend this work
by considering the interaction between dark matter and dark energy components.
We show that in the non-interacting case the phantom line can not be crossed
and also he evolutionary trajectories of model in $s-r$ plane can not be
discriminated. It has been shown that the present location of model in $s-r$
plane would be close to observational value for negative values of model
parameter. In the presence of interaction between dark matter and dark energy,
the phantom regime is achieved, the accelerated phase of expansion occurs
sooner compare with non-interacting case. The GGDE model is also discussed from
the viewpoint of perturbation theory by calculating the adiabatic sound speed
of the model. Finally, unlike the non-interacting case, the evolutionary
trajectories in $s-r$ plane can be discriminated in the interacting model. Like
non-interacting model, in the interacting case the present location of GGDE
model is closer to observational value for negative values of model parameter.
