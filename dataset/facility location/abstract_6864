Balasubramanian, Czech, Chowdhury and de Boer \cite{BCCdB} studied a
"spherical Rindler space" and found that accelerating observers are causally
disconnected from a spherical region located at the origin of Minkowski space.
We show that there is no any horizon of size $R_{0}$ (which is related to the
chosen initial conditions) and the event horizon at $r = 0$ is obtained only
from the two-dimensional ($r, t$) static restriction. Their near-horizon
geometry cancels the time dependence of the original metric and therefore the
approximation used is doubtful.
