The Fermi Bubbles, which comprise two large and homogeneous regions of
spectrally hard gamma-ray emission extending up to $55^{o}$ above and below the
Galactic Center, were first noticed in GeV gamma-ray data from the Fermi
Telescope in 2010. The mechanism or mechanisms which produce the observed hard
spectrum are not understood. Although both hadronic and lep- tonic models can
describe the spectrum of the bubbles, the leptonic model can also explain
similar structures observed in microwave data from the WMAP and Planck
satellites. Recent publications show that the spectrum of the Fermi Bubbles is
well described by a power law with an exponential cutoff in the energy range of
100MeV to 500GeV. Observing the Fermi Bubbles at higher gamma-ray energies will
help constrain the origin of the bubbles. A steeper cutoff will favor a
leptonic model. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory, located
4100m above sea level in Mexico, is designed to measure high-energy gamma rays
between 100GeV to 100TeV. With a large field of view and good sensitivity to
spatially extended sources, HAWC is the best observatory suited to look for
extended regions like the Fermi Bubbles at TeV energies. We will present
results from a preliminary analysis of the Fermi Bubble visible to HAWC in the
Galactic Northern Hemisphere during the ICRC conference.
