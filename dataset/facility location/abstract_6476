The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment is a general purpose particle
detector experiment located at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. In
2008, the LHC beam was commissioned and successfully steered through the CMS
detector. First results from CMS with beam data are described, focusing on
detector commissioning with beam data, from beam halo studies with the endcap
muon system to displays of "beam splash" events, in which the proton beam was
stopped by an upstream collimator.
