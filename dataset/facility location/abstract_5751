We measured the Cerenkov signal fluctuations in the water tanks of the Pierre
Auger Observatory. Two stations located near the center of the 32-tank
Engineering Array separated by 11 m were used for the purpose. At this
separation the stations sample nearly the same region of the air shower.
Sources of the signal fluctuations are discussed.
