Superclusters of galaxies can be defined kinematically from local evaluations
of the velocity shear tensor. The location where the smallest eigenvalue of the
shear is positive and maximal defines the center of a basin of attraction.
Velocity and density fields are reconstructed with Wiener Filter techniques.
Local velocities due to the density field in a restricted region can be
separated from external tidal flows, permitting the identification of
boundaries separating inward flows toward a basin of attraction and outward
flows. This methodology was used to define the Laniakea Supercluster that
includes the Milky Way. Large adjacent structures include Perseus-Pisces, Coma,
Hercules, and Shapley but current kinematic data are insufficient to capture
their full domains. However there is a small region trapped between Laniakea,
Perseus-Pisces, and Coma that is close enough to be reliably characterized and
that satisfies the kinematic definition of a supercluster. Because of its
shape, it is given the name the Arrowhead Supercluster. This entity does not
contain any major clusters. A characteristic dimension is ~25 Mpc and the
contained mass is only ~10^15 Msun.
