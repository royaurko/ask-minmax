The recently inaugurated 2.4\,m Thai National Telescope (TNT) is equipped,
among other instruments, with the ULTRASPEC low-noise, frame-transfer EMCCD
camera. At the end of its first official observing season, we report on the use
of this facility to record high time resolution imaging using small detector
subarrays with sampling as fast as several $10^2$\,Hz. In particular, we have
recorded lunar occultations of several stars which represent the first
contribution to this area of research made from South-East Asia with a
telescope of this class. Among the results, we discuss an accurate measurement
of $\alpha $~Cnc, which has been reported previously as a suspected close
binary. Attempts to resolve this star by several contributors have so far met with a
lack of unambiguous confirmation. With our observation we are able to place
stringent limits on the projected angular separation ($<0\farcs003$) and
brightness ($\Delta{\rm m} > 5$) of a putative companion. We also present a
measurement of the binary {HR~7072}, which extends considerably the time
coverage available for its yet undetermined orbit. We discuss our precise
determination of the flux ratio and projected separation in the context of
other available data. We conclude by providing an estimate of the performance
of ULTRASPEC at TNT for lunar occultation work. This facility can help to
extend the lunar occultation technique in a geographical area where no
comparable resources were available until now.
