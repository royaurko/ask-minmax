Motivated by the analysis of the distribution of university grades, which is
usually asymmetric, we discuss two informative priors for the shape parameter
of the skew-normal distribution, showing that they lead to closed-form
full-conditional posterior distributions, particularly useful in MCMC
computation. Gibbs sampling algorithms are discussed for the joint vector of
parameters, given independent prior distributions for the location and scale
parameters. Simulation studies are performed to assess the performance of Gibbs
samplers and to compare the choice of informative priors against a
non-informative one. The method is used to analyze the grades of the basic
statistics examination of the first-year undergraduate students at the School
of Economics, University of Padua, Italy.
