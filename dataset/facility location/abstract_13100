\rm Observations of close binary system (CBS) V1357 Cyg=Cyg X-1 in the $WBVR$
bands are reported. Photometry was carried out at the telescopes located in
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Crimea equipped with single-channel
$WBVR$-photometer with photon counting. 1358 individual observations in $WBVR$
bands on 202 nights were obtained.
  The analysis of the photometric data allows to conclude that different
photometric effects are superimposed on the orbital light curve of the system.
Among them are brightness declines, outbursts with different duration and
amplitude, chaotic variability, which sometimes exceeded the ellipsoidal
variability. Strong brightness decreases with magnitude $0^m.035 - 0^m.045$ are
observed, they are equal to the contribution of accretion disc to the total
luminosity of the system.
  10 years of photometric monitoring allowed to detect continous brightening of
the system, followed by luminosity decline (slow outburst). After the maximum
in 1994-96 the decline was equal to 7% in the $W$ band, 4% in the $V$ band, and
2% in the $V$ and $R$ bands.
  This paper continues the series of works on close systems with X-ray sources.
  \textbf{Key words}: Close binary systems - luminosity - ellipsoidal
variability - accretion disc
