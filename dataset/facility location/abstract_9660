The structure of AgCl formed in the course of chlorine adsorption on Ag(111)
surface was studied by STM. For the first time atomic resolution STM images of
silver chloride were obtained. The silver chloride was detected as small (30-60
A in diameter) islands located on the atomic terraces. The upper plane of the
islands was found to be AgCl(111) with interatomic distance close to the bulk
value. The chloride surface lattice was not rotated with respect to the
substrate. A possible mechanism of AgCl growth on Ag(111) is discussed.
