We present preliminary results from the deepest and largest photographic
proper-motion survey ever undertaken of the Galactic bulge. Our first-epoch
plate material (from 1972-3) goes deep enough (V_lim = 22) to reach below the
bulge main-sequence turnoff. These plates cover an area of approximately 25
arc-min X 25 arc-min of the bulge in the low-extinction (A_v = 0.8 mag) Plaut
field at l= 0 deg, b= -8 deg, approximately 1 kpc south of the nucleus. This is
the point at which the transition between bulge and halo populations likely
occurs and is, therefore, an excellent location to study the interface between
the dense metal-rich bulge and the metal-poor halo. In this conference we
report results based on three first-epoch and three second-epoch plates
spanning 21 years. It is found that it is possible to obtain proper-motions
with errors less than 0.5 mas/yr for a substantial number of stars down to V=
20, without color restriction. For the subsample with errors less than 1 mas/yr
we derive proper-motion dispersions in the direction of Galactic longitude and
latitude of 3.378 +/- 0.033 mas/yr and 2.778 +/- 0.028$ mas/yr respectively.
These dispersions agree with those derived by Spaenhauer et al. (1992) in
Baade's window.
