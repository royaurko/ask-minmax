We have investigated a Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM), focusing on CP
violation. Various scenarios with spontaneous and explicit breaking of CP have
been considered. Some features of CP violation related to a choice of the basis
for the two Higgs doublets have been discussed and clarified. Regions in the
physical parameter space corresponding to spontaneous and explicit CP violation
have been located and discussed. The possibility to determine parameters of the
scalar potential with no reference to Yukawa couplings has been considered and
an unavoidable ambiguity has been found. The issue of disentangling spontaneous
and explicit CP violation has been investigated.
