We have used XMM-Newton's Optical Monitor (OM) images to study the local
environment of a sample of 27 Ultraluminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) in nearby
galaxies. UVW1 fluxes were extracted from 100 pc regions centered on the ULX
positions. We find that at least 4 ULXs (out of 10 published) have spectral
types that are consistent with previous literature values. In addition the
colors are similar to those of young stars. For the highest-luminosity ULXs,
the UVW1 fluxes may have an important contribution from the accretion disk. We
find that the majority of ULXs are associated with recent star-formation. Many
of the ULXs in our sample are located inside young OB associations or
star-forming regions (SFRs). Based on their colors, we estimated ages and
masses for star-forming regions located within 1 kpc from the ULXs in our
sample. The resolution of the OM was insufficient to detect young dense
super-clusters, but some of these star-forming regions are massive enough to
contain such clusters. Only three ULXs have no associated SFRs younger than 50
Myr. The age and mass estimates for clusters were used to test runaway
scenarios. The data are in general compatible with stellar-mass binaries
accreting at super-Eddington rates and ejected by natal kicks. We also tested
the hypothesis that ULXs are sub-Eddington accreting IMBHs ejected by
three-body interactions, however this is not supported well by the data.
