In the future neutrino experiments, a beta-beam, which can produce pure
electron neutrino beam, is expected to achive precise measurement of the
neutrino oscillation parameters. In the $\nu_{\mu}$ appearance measurement of a
beta-beam, a detector does not need to identify particle charge and thus, a
water Cherecov detector will be a candidate for the far detector. In this
paper, we study the expected signal detection efficiencies and background at
the proposed beta beam facilities with the water Cherenkov detector. In the
estimation, we use the current simulation and analysis tools developed for the
Super-Kamiokande experiment. Depending on the beta beam setups, the signal
detection efficiencies are found to vary from 36.4$%$ to 75.3$%$ in the
standard $\nu_{\mu}$ search. The major source of background was found to be
neutral current pion production, and the fraction of the background increases
with the mean energy of the neutrino beam.
