On-chip Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) of magnetic molecules requires the
ability to precisely position nanosized samples in antinodes of the
electro-magnetic field for maximal magnetic interaction. A method is developed
to entrap micro-crystals containing spins in a well defined location on a
substrate's surface. Traditional cavity ESR measurements are then performed on
a mesoscopic crystal at 34 GHz. Polycrystalline diluted Cr$^{5+}$ spins were
entrapped as well and measured while approaching the lower limit of the ESR
sensitivity. This method suggests the feasibility of on-chip ESR measurements
at dilution refrigerator temperatures by enabling the positioning of samples
atop an on-chip superconducting cavity.
