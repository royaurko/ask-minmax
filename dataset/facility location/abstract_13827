We introduce a multivariate multidimensional mixed-effects regression model
in a finite mixture framework. We relax the usual unidimensionality assumption
on the random effects multivariate distribution. Thus, we introduce a
multidimensional multivariate discrete distribution for the random terms, with
a possibly different number of support points in each univariate profile,
allowing for a full association structure. Our approach is motivated by the
analysis of economic growth. Accordingly, we define an extended version of the
augmented Solow model. Indeed, we allow all model parameters, and not only the
mean, to vary according to a regression model. Moreover, we argue that
countries do not follow the same growth process, and that a mixture-based
approach can provide a natural framework for the detection of similar growth
patterns. Our empirical findings provide evidence of heterogenous behaviors and
suggest the need of a flexible approach to properly reflect the heterogeneity
in the data. We further test the behavior of the proposed approach via a
simulation study, considering several factors such as the number of observed
units, times and levels of heterogeneity in the data.
