5D cosmological model with 3-brane with matter is considered. The brane
divides bulk in two AdS half spaces. Geometry of the model can be described by
two types of coordinates: in the first setting the metric is static and the
brane is moving in the bulk, in the second approach the metric is
time-dependent and the brane is located at a fixed position in the bulk.
Coordinate transformation connecting two coordinate systems is constructed.
