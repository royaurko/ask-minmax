Personalisation in smart phones requires adaptability to dynamic context
based on user mobility, application usage and sensor inputs. Current
personalisation approaches, which rely on static logic that is developed a
priori, do not provide sufficient adaptability to dynamic and unexpected
context. This paper proposes genetic programming (GP), which can evolve program
logic in realtime, as an online learning method to deal with the highly dynamic
context in smart phone personalisation. We introduce the concept of
collaborative smart phone personalisation through the GP Island Model, in order
to exploit shared context among co-located phone users and reduce convergence
time. We implement these concepts on real smartphones to demonstrate the
capability of personalisation through GP and to explore the benefits of the
Island Model. Our empirical evaluations on two example applications confirm
that the Island Model can reduce convergence time by up to two-thirds over
standalone GP personalisation.
