The commissioning of two cryomodule components is underway at Fermilab's
Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) Accelerator Test Facility. The research
at this facility supports the next generation high intensity linear
accelerators such as the International Linear Collider (ILC), a new high
intensity injector (Project X) and other future machines. These components,
Cryomodule #1 (CM1) and Capture Cavity II (CC2), which contain 1.3 GHz cavities
are connected in series in the beamline and through cryogenic plumbing. Studies
regarding characterization of ground motion, technical and cultural noise
continue. Mechanical transfer functions between the foundation and critical
beamline components have been measured and overall system displacement
characterized. Baseline motion measurements given initial operation of
cryogenic, vacuum systems and other utilities are considered.
