We investigate the phase diagram of the so-called
Polyakov--Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model at finite temperature and nonzero chemical
potential with three quark flavors. Chiral and deconfinement phase transitions
are discussed, and the relevant order-like parameters are analyzed. A special
attention is payed to the critical end point (CEP): the influence of the
strangeness on the location of the CEP is studied; also the strength of the
flavor-mixing interaction alters the CEP location, once when it becomes weaker
the CEP moves to low temperatures and can even disappear.
