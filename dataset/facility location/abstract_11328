The MAGIC telescope, with its 17-m diameter mirror, is currently the largest
single-dish Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope. It is located on the Canary Island
of La Palma, at an altitude of 2200 m above sea level, and is operating since
2004. The accessible energy range is in the very high energy (VHE, E>100 GeV)
gamma-ray domain, and roughly 40% of the duty cycle is devoted to observation
of extragalactic sources. Due to the lowest energy threshold (25 GeV), it can
observe the deepest universe, and it is thus well suited for extragalactic
observations. The strategies of extragalactic observations by MAGIC are
manifold: long time monitoring of known TeV blazars, detailed study of blazars
during flare states, multiwavelength campaigns on most promising targets, and
search for new VHE gamma-ray emitters. In this talk, highlights of observations
of extragalactic objects will be reviewed.
