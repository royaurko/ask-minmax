The main subject of the work is experimental investigation of local-time
effect existence on laboratory scale, which means longitudinal distances
between locations of measurements from tens to one meter. Also short revue of
our investigations of local-time effect existence for distances from 15 km to
500 m are presented. Besides investigations of the minimal spatial scale of
local-time effect existence the paper presents investigations of the named
effect for time domain. In this relation a structure of intervals distribution
in neighborhood of local-time peak was studied and splitting of the peak was
found out. Further investigations shows second order splitting of local-time
peak. From this result arise a supposition that space-time heterogeneity, which
following from local-time effect existence probably has fractal character.
Obtained results lead to conclusion about sharp anisotropy of space-time.
