Tests of discrete symmetry violation have played an important role in
understand the structure of weak interactions in the Standard Model of particle
physics. Historically these measurements have been extensively performed at
experiments with large samples of K and B mesons. A high luminosity tau-charm
facility presents physicists with the opportunity to comprehensively explore
discrete symmetry violation and test the Standard Model using tau leptons,
charm mesons and charmed baryons. This paper discusses several possible
measurements for a future tau-charm factory.
