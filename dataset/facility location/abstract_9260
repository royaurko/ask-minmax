We present the analysis of seven band (1.2 to 8 micron) ground and
space-based imaging of the NGC 7129 young stellar cluster from FLAMINGOS on
MMT, 2MASS, and the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space
Telescope. An analysis of the H-[4.5] vs. J-H colors reveals 84 objects with
circumstellar disks. Of these, 42 are located within the cluster core, a 0.5 pc
(100'') radius region of enhanced stellar surface density. From a luminosity
and extinction limited sample of the stars within the cluster core boundary we
have determined that 54% +/- 14% have circumstellar disks. Finally, we report
the detection of several resolved outflows in the IRAC 4.5 micron mosaic.
