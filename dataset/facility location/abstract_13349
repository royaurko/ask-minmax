String theory gives a well defined procedure for computing the S-matrix of
BPS or a class of massless states, but similar calculation for general massive
states is plagued with difficulties due to mass renormalization effect. In this
paper we describe a procedure for computing the renormalized masses and
S-matrix elements in bosonic string theory for a special class of massive
states which do not mix with unphysical states under renormalization. Even
though this requires working with off-shell amplitudes which are ambiguous, we
show that the renormalized masses and S-matrix elements are free from these
ambiguities. We also argue that the masses and S-matrix elements for general
external states can be found by examining the locations of the poles and the
residues of the S-matrix of special states. Finally we discuss generalizations
to heterotic and superstring theories.
