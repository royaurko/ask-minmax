The totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) with a localized
defect is revisited in this article with attention paid to the power spectra of
the particle occupancy N(t). Intrigued by the oscillatory behaviors in the
power spectra of an ordinary TASEP in high/low density phase(HD/LD) observed by
Adams et al. (2007 Phys. Rev. Lett. 99 020601), we introduce a single slow site
with hopping rate q<1 to the system. As the power spectrum contains
time-correlation information of the particle occupancy of the system, we are
particularly interested in how the defect affects fluctuation in particle
number of the left and right subsystems as well as that of the entire system.
Exploiting Monte Carlo simulations, we observe the disappearance of
oscillations when the defect is located at the center of the system. When the
defect is off center, oscillations are restored. To explore the origin of such
phenomenon, we use a linearized Langevin equation to calculate the power
spectrum for the sublattices and the whole lattice. We provide insights into
the interactions between the sublattices coupled through the defect site for
both simulation and analytical results.
