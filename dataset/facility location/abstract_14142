Using the data from the public database of the All Sky Automated Survey ({\tt
ASAS}) we performed the very first light curve analyses of the three eclipsing
binary systems \astrobj{AO~Aqr}, \astrobj{CW~Aqr} and
\astrobj{ASAS~012206-4924.7}. The physical parameters of the systems were
determined by the {\tt PHOEBE} software. From an analysis of the ASAS data it
was concluded that AO~Aqr was found to be a contact binary system while CW~Aqr
and ASAS~012206-4924.7 were found to be near--contact and detached binaries,
respectively. Finally, the locations of the components, corresponding to the
estimated physical parameters, in the HR diagram were also discussed.
