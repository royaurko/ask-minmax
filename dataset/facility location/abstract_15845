We discuss Subaru and Spitzer Space Telescope imaging and spectroscopy of M87
in the mid-infrared from 5-35 um. These observations allow us to investigate
mid-IR emission mechanisms in the core of M87 and to establish that the
flaring, variable jet component HST-1 is not a major contributor to the mid-IR
flux. The Spitzer data include a high signal-to-noise 15-35 $\mu$m spectrum of
the knot A/B complex in the jet, which is consistent with synchrotron emission.
However, a synchrotron model cannot account for the observed {\it nuclear}
spectrum, even when contributions from the jet, necessary due to the degrading
of resolution with wavelength, are included. The Spitzer data show a clear
excess in the spectrum of the nucleus at wavelengths longer than 25 um, which
we model as thermal emission from cool dust at a characteristic temperature of
55 \pm 10 K, with an IR luminosity \sim 10^{39} {\rm ~erg ~s^{-1}}. Given
Spitzer's few-arcsecond angular resolution, the dust seen in the nuclear
spectrum could be located anywhere within ~5'' (390 pc) of the nucleus. In any
case, the ratio of AGN thermal to bolometric luminosity indicates that M87 does
not contain the IR-bright torus that classical unified AGN schemes invoke.
However, this result is consistent with theoretical predictions for
low-luminosity AGNs
