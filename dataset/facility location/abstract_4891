The remotely sensed data from an unknown location is transmitted in real time
through internet and gathered in a PC. The data is collected for a considerable
period of time and analyzed in PC as to assess the suitability and fertility of
the land for establishing an electronic plantation in that area. The analysis
also helps deciding the plantation of appropriate plants in the location
identified. The system performing this task with appropriate transducers
installed in remote area, the methodologies involved in transmission and data
gathering are reported.. The second part of the project deals with data
gathering from remote site and issuing control signals to remote appliances in
the site; all performed through internet. Therefore, this control scheme is a
duplex system monitoring the irrigation activities by collecting data in one
direction and issuing commands on the opposite direction. This scheme maintains
the digital irrigation systems effectively and efficiently as to utilize the
resources optimally for yielding enhanced production. The methodologies
involved in extending the two way communication of data are presented.
