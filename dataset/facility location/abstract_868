We present the first time resolved OTR angular distribution measurements of
an intense pulsed electron beam (1.7 kA, 60 ns). These initial experiments on
the first axis of the Dual Axis Radiographic Hydro-Testing (DARHT) facility and
subsequent analysis, demonstrate the possibility to extract, from the data, the
energy and the divergence angle of a 3.8 and 20 MeV electrons.
