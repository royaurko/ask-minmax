In the standard cosmological model, the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic
microwave background is interpreted as variation in the gravitational potential
at the point of emission, due to the emitter being embedded in a region ${\cal
C}$ of over- or under-density spanning the length (or size) scale $\lambda$ on
which the anisotropy is measured. If the Universe is inhomogeneous, however,
similar density contrasts of size $\lambda$ are also located everywhere
surrounding ${\cal C}$. Since they are superposition states of many independent
Fourier modes with no preferred direction, such primordial clumps and voids
should not be configured according to some prescribed spatial pattern. Rather,
they can randomly trade spaces with each other while preserving the
Harrison-Zeldovich character of the matter spectrum. The outcome is an {\it
extra} perturbation of the potential when averaged over length $\lambda$ at the
emitter, and consequently an additional anisotropy on the same scale, which has
apparently been overlooked. Unlike the conventional application of the
Sachs-Wolfe effect to the WMAP observations, this extra effect is {\it not}
scale independent over the $P(k) \sim k$ part of the matter spectrum, but
increases towards smaller lengths, as $\sqrt{k}$. The consequence is a
substantial revision of the currently advertised values of the key cosmological
parameters, {\it unless} one postulates a more rapid decrease in the
gravitational force with distance than that given by the inverse-square law.
