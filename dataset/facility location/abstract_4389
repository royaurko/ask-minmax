We consider one dimensional random walks in random environment where every
time the process stays at a location, it dies with a fixed probability. Under
some mild assumptions it is easy to show that the survival probability goes to
zero as time tends to infinity. In this paper we derive formulas for the rate
with which this probability decays. It turns out that there are three distinct
regimes, depending on the law of the environment.
