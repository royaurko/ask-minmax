We present spin-resolved X-ray data of the neutron star binary Her X-1. We
find evidence that the Iron line at 6.4 keV originates from the same location
as the blackbody X-ray component. The line width and energy varies over both
the spin period and the 35 day precession period. We also find that the
correlation between the soft and hard X-ray light curves varies over the 35 day
period.
