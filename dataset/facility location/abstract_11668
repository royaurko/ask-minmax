The IBIS imager on board INTEGRAL, with a sensitivity better than a mCrab in
deep observations and a point source location accuracy of the order of few
arcminutes, has localized so far 723 hard X-ray sources in the 17--100 keV
energy band, of which a fraction of about 1/3 are still unclassified. The aim
of this research is to provide sub-arcsecond localizations of the unidentified
sources, necessary to pinpoint the optical and/or infrared counterpart of those
objects whose nature is so far unknown. The cross-correlation between the new
IBIS sources published within the fourth INTEGRAL/IBIS Survey catalogue and the
CHANDRA/ACIS data archive resulted in a sample of 5 not yet identified objects.
We present here the results of CHANDRA X-ray Observatory observations of these
five hard X-ray sources discovered by the INTEGRAL satellite. We associated IGR
J10447-6027 with IR source 2MASSJ10445192-6025115, IGR J16377-6423 with the
cluster CIZA J1638.2-6420, IGR J14193-6048 with the pulsar with nebula PSR
J1420-6048 and IGR J12562+2554 with the Quasar SDSSJ125610.42+260103.5. We
suggest that the counterpart of IGR J12288+0052 may be an AGN/QSO type~2 at a
confidence level of 90%.
