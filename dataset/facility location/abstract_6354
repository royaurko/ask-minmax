Many existing thermal management techniques focus on reducing the overall
power consumption of the chip, and do not address location-specific temperature
problems referred to as hotspots. We propose the use of dynamic runtime
reconfiguration to shift the hotspot-inducing computation periodically and make
the thermal profile more uniform. Our analysis shows that dynamic
reconfiguration is an effective technique in reducing hotspots for NoCs.
