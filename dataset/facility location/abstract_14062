Hybrid lateral superlattices composed of a square array of antidots and a
periodic one-dimensional magnetic modulation are prepared in
$\mathrm{Ga[Al]As}$ heterostructures. The two-dimensional electron gases
exposed to these superlattices are characterized by magnetotransport
experiments in vanishing average perpendicular magnetic fields. Despite the
absence of closed orbits, the diagonal magnetoresistivity in the direction
perpendicular to the magnetic modulation shows pronounced classical resonances.
They are located at magnetic fields where snake trajectories exist which are
quasi-commensurate with the antidot lattice. The diagonal magnetoresistivity in
the direction of the magnetic modulation increases sharply above a threshold
magnetic field and shows no fine structure. The experimental results are
interpreted with the help of numerical simulations based on the semiclassical
Kubo model.
