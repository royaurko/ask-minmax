The orbital motion of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) produces
amplitude, phase and frequency modulation of a gravitational wave signal. The
modulations have the effect of spreading a monochromatic gravitational wave
signal across a range of frequencies. The modulations encode useful information
about the source location and orientation, but they also have the deleterious
affect of spreading a signal across a wide bandwidth, thereby reducing the
strength of the signal relative to the instrument noise. We describe a simple
method for removing the dominant, Doppler, component of the signal modulation.
The demodulation reassembles the power from a monochromatic source into a
narrow spike, and provides a quick way to determine the sky locations and
frequencies of the brightest gravitational wave sources.
