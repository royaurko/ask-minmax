We consider a generalized version in continuous time of the parking problem
of Knuth. Files arrive following a Poisson point process and are stored on a
hardware identified with the real line. We specify the distribution of the
space of unoccupied locations at a fixed time and give its asymptotics when the
hardware is becoming full.
