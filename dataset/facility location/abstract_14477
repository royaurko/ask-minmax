Supervoids are regions in the local Universe which do not contain rich clusters
of galaxies. We have studied the closest example, the Northern Local Void,
situated between the Local, Coma, and the Hercules superclusters. We find that
this supervoid is not empty, but it contains small galaxy systems and poor
clusters of galaxies. We study the cosmography of this void by analyzing the
distribution of poor clusters of galaxies, elliptical and other galaxies in two
projections. We present a catalogue of voids, defined by galaxies of different
morphological type and luminosity, and analyze mean diameters of voids in
different environments. The sizes of voids and the properties of void walls are
related. Voids defined by poor clusters of galaxies and by bright elliptical
galaxies have a mean diameter of up to 40 h-1 Mpc. Faint late-type galaxies
divide these voids into smaller voids. The faintest galaxies we can study are
outlining voids with mean diameters of about 8 h-1 Mpc. Voids located in a
high-density environment are smaller than voids in low-density regions. This
analysis shows that voids form a hierarchical system.
