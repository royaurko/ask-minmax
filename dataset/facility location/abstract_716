Directional clustering can be expected in cosmic ray observations due to
purely statistical fluctuations for sources distributed randomly in the sky. We
develop an analytic approach to estimate the probability of random cluster
configurations, and use these results to study the strong potential of the
HiRes, Auger, Telescope Array and EUSO/OWL/AirWatch facilities for deciding
whether any observed clustering is most likely due to non-random sources.
