Field characterization methods using a scattering target in the absence of a
point-like receiver have been well described in which scattering is recorded by
a relatively large receiver located outside the field of measurement.
Unfortunately, such methods are prone to artifacts due to averaging across the
receiver surface. To avoid this problem while simultaneously increasing the
gain of a received signal, the present study introduces a binary plate lens
designed to focus spherically-spreading waves onto a planar region having a
nearly-uniform phase proportional to that of the target location. The lens is
similar to a zone plate, but modified to produce a bi-convex-like behavior,
such that it focuses both planar and spherically spreading waves. A measurement
device suitable for characterizing narrowband ultrasound signals in air is
designed around this lens by coupling it to a target and planar receiver. A
prototype device is constructed and used to characterize the field of a
highly-focused 400 kHz air transducer along 2 radial lines. Comparison of the
measurements with numeric predictions formed from nonlinear acoustic simulation
showed good relative pressure correlation, with mean differences of 10% and 12%
over center 3dB FWHM drop and 12% and 17% over 6dB.
