We have imaged the unusual OH/IR object G 284-0.8 (Roberts 22) in the OH
transitions at 1612, 1665 and 1667 MHz using the Australia Telescope Compact
Array in Narrabri, NSW, Australia. The angular resolution of the OH images we
present here is 6 arcsec (12000 AU at a distance of 2 kpc). We find OH
emission, of extent 1.5 arcsec (2800 AU), located inside the optical bipolar
flow region (size 8 arcsec) discovered by Allen et al. (1980) and imaged
recently by Sahai et al. (1999) with the Hubble Space Telescope. We present
astrometry of Roberts 22, providing registration of the OH and Hubble Space
Telescope images to within ~0.35 arcsec. We describe the OH velocity field in
Roberts 22 and discuss the kinematic properties of the source and its
evolutionary status.
