The wide spread of mobiles as handheld devices leads to various innovative
applications that makes use of their ever increasing presence in our daily
life. One such application is location tracking and monitoring. This paper
proposes a prototype model for location tracking using Geographical Positioning
System (GPS) and Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) technology. The
system displays the object moving path on the monitor and the same information
can also be communicated to the user cell phone, on demand of the user by
asking the specific information via SMS. This system is very useful for car
theft situations, for adolescent drivers being watched and monitored by
parents. The result shows that the object is being tracked with a minimal
tracking error.
