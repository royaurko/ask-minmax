The Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) facility is a conventional neutrino
beam which produces muon neutrinos by focusing a beam of mesons into a long
evacuated decay volume. We have built four arrays of ionization chambers to
monitor the position and intensity of the hadron and muon beams associated with
neutrino production at locations downstream of the decay volume. This article
describes the chambers' construction, calibration, and commissioning in the
beam.
