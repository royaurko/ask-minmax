The paper discusses some examples of image processing applied to improve
optical satellite imagery of small craters (Kamil, Veevers, Haviland). The
examples show that image processing can be quite useful for further in-situ
researches, because the resultant imagery helps to have a better picture of the
crater shape and of the distribution of debris about it. The paper is also
disclosing an interesting underwater structure, with shape and size of a small
crater, located on the coast-line of Sudan.
