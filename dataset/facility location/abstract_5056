Predicting both the time and the location of human movements is valuable but
challenging for a variety of applications. To address this problem, we propose
an approach considering both the periodicity and the sociality of human
movements. We first define a new concept, Social Spatial-Temporal Event (SSTE),
to represent social interactions among people. For the time prediction, we
characterise the temporal dynamics of SSTEs with an ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving
Average) model. To dynamically capture the SSTE kinetics, we propose a Kalman
Filter based learning algorithm to learn and incrementally update the ARMA
model as a new observation becomes available. For the location prediction, we
propose a ranking model where the periodicity and the sociality of human
movements are simultaneously taken into consideration for improving the
prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on real data sets validate
our proposed approach.
