We report the first measurement of the transverse momentum dependence of
double spin asymmetries in semi-inclusive production of pions in deep inelastic
scattering off the longitudinally polarized proton. Data have been obtained
using a polarized electron beam of 5.7 GeV with the CLAS detector at the Thomas
Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab). A significant non-zero
$\sin2\phi$ single spin asymmetry was also observed for the first time
indicating strong spin-orbit correlations for transversely polarized quarks in
the longitudinally polarized proton. The azimuthal modulations of single spin
asymmetries have been measured over a wide kinematic range.
