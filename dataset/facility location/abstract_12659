The Sklyanin algebra $S_{\eta}$ has a well-known family of
infinite-dimensional representations $D(\mu)$, $\mu \in C^*$, in terms of
difference operators with shift $\eta$ acting on even meromorphic functions. We
show that for generic $\eta$ the coefficients of these operators have solely
simple poles, with linear residue relations depending on their locations. More
generally, we obtain explicit necessary and sufficient conditions on a
difference operator for it to belong to $D(\mu)$. By definition, the even part
of $D(\mu)$ is generated by twofold products of the Sklyanin generators. We
prove that any sum of the latter products yields a difference operator of van
Diejen type. We also obtain kernel identities for the Sklyanin generators. They
give rise to order-reversing involutive automorphisms of $D(\mu)$, and are
shown to entail previously known kernel identities for the van Diejen
operators. Moreover, for special $\mu$ they yield novel finite-dimensional
representations of $S_{\eta}$.
