The associated production of a J/{\psi} and a \pi-meson in antiproton-nucleon
annihilation is studied in the framework of QCD collinear factorization. In
this approach, a hard subprocess responsible for the production of the heavy
quark-antiquark pair factorizes from soft hadronic matrix elements, such as the
antiproton (nucleon) distribution amplitude and the nucleon-to-pion
(antiproton-to-pion) transition distribution amplitude. This reaction mechanism
should dominate the forward and backward kinematical regions, where the cross
sections are expected to be measurable in the set-up of the PANDA experiment at
the GSI-Fair facility.
