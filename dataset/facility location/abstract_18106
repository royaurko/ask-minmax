The nearby active galaxy IC 310, located in the outskirts of the Perseus
cluster of galaxies is a bright and variable multi-wavelength emitter from the
radio regime up to very high gamma-ray energies above 100 GeV. Originally, the
nucleus of IC 310 has been classified as a radio galaxy. However, studies of
the multi-wavelength emission showed several properties similarly to those
found from blazars as well as radio galaxies. In late 2012, we have organized
the first contemporaneous multi-wavelength campaign including radio, optical,
X-ray and gamma-ray instruments. During this campaign an exceptionally bright
flare of IC 310 was detected with the MAGIC telescopes in November 2012
reaching an averaged flux level in the night of up to one Crab above 1 TeV with
a hard spectrum over two decades in energy. The intra-night light curve showed
a series of strong outbursts with flux-doubling time scales as fast as a few
minutes. The fast variability constrains the size of the gamma-ray emission
regime to be smaller than 20% of the gravitational radius of its central black
hole. This challenges the shock acceleration models, commonly used to explain
gamma-ray radiation from active galaxies. Here, we will present more details on
the MAGIC data and discuss several possible alternative emission models.
