We show that the parameter space of axion-like particles can be severly
constrained using high-precision measurements of quasar polarisations. Robust
limits are derived from the measured bounds on optical circular polarisation
and from the distribution of linear polarisations of quasars. As an outlook,
this technique can be improved by the observation of objects located behind
clusters of galaxies, using upcoming space-borne X-ray polarimeters.
