The CELESTE atmospheric Cherenkov detector, running until June 2004 at the
Themis solar facility, has taken data on compact sources such as pulsars and
blazars. We will take stock of the experiment, in particular regarding the
latest improvements of the detector simulation and data analysis. These changes
provide us with a new analysis of old data with smaller uncertainties. We
present here the evidence for a weak signal from Mrk 501 in 2000-2001.
