Independently developed orbit determination software is used to analyze the
orbits of Pioneer 10 and 11 using Doppler data. The analysis takes into account
the gravitational fields of the Sun and planets using the latest JPL
ephemerides, accurate station locations, signal propagation delays (e.g., the
Shapiro delay, atmospheric effects), the spacecrafts' spin, and maneuvers. New
to this analysis is the ability to utilize telemetry data for spin, maneuvers,
and other on-board systematic effects. Using data that was analyzed in prior
JPL studies, the anomalous acceleration of the two spacecraft is confirmed. We
are also able to put limits on any secondary acceleration (i.e., jerk) terms.
The tools that were developed will be used in the upcoming analysis of recently
recovered Pioneer 10 and 11 Doppler data files.
