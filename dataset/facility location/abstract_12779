We show that the normal state transport properties of nano-scale granular
Aluminum films, near the metal to insulator transition, present striking
similarities with those of Kondo systems. Those include a negative
magneto-resistance, a minimum of resistance R at a temperature Tm in metallic
films, a logarithmic rise at low temperatures and a negative curvature of R(T)
at high temperatures. These normal state properties are interpreted in terms of
spin-flip scattering of conduction electrons by local magnetic moments,
possibly located at the metal/oxide interfaces. Their co-existence with the
enhanced superconductivity seen in these films is discussed.
