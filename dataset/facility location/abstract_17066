Candidate supernova remnants G23.5+0.1 and G25.5+0.0 were observed by
XMM-Newton in the course of a snap-shot survey of plerionic and composite SNRs
in the Galactic plane. In the field of G23.5+0.1, we detected an extended
source, ~3' in diameter, which we tentatively interpret as a pulsar-wind nebula
(PWN) of the middle-aged radio pulsar B1830-08. Our analysis suggests an
association between PSR B1830-08 and the surrounding diffuse radio emission. If
the radio emission is due to the SNR, then the pulsar must be significantly
younger than its characteristic age. Alternatively, the radio emission may come
from a relic PWN. In the field of G25.5+0.0, which contains the extended TeV
source HESS J1837-069, we detected the recently discovered young high-energy
pulsar J1838-0655 embedded in a PWN with extent of 1.3'. We also detected
another PWN candidate (AX J1837.3-0652) with an extent of 2' and unabsorbed
luminosity L_(2-10 keV) ~ 4 x 10^33 erg/s at d=7 kpc. The third X-ray source,
located within the extent of the HESS J1837-069, has a peculiar extended radio
counterpart, possibly a radio galaxy with a double nucleus or a microquasar. We
did not find any evidence of the SNR emission in the G25.5+0.0 field. We
provide detailed multiwavelength analysis and identifications of other field
sources and discuss robustness of the G25.5+0.0 and G23.5+0.1 classifications
as SNRs. (abstract abridged)
