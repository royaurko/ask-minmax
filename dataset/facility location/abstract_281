Location-based services gained much popularity through providing users with
helpful information with respect to their current location. The search and
recommendation of nearby locations or places, and the navigation to a specific
location are some of the most prominent location-based services. As a recent
trend, virtual location-based services consider webpages or sites associated
with a location as 'virtual locations' that online users can visit in spite of
not being physically present at the location. The presence of links between
virtual locations and the corresponding physical locations (e.g., geo-location
information of a restaurant linked to its website), allows for novel types of
services and applications which constitute virtual location-based services
(VLBS). The quality and potential benefits of such services largely depends on
the existence of websites referring to physical locations. In this paper, we
investigate the usefulness of linking virtual and physical locations. For this,
we analyze the presence and distribution of virtual locations, i.e., websites
referring to places, for two Irish cities. Using simulated tracks based on a
user movement model, we investigate how mobile users move through the Web as
virtual space. Our results show that virtual locations are omnipresent in urban
areas, and that the situation that a user is close to even several such
locations at any time is rather the normal case instead of the exception.
