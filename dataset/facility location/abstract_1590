NeXus is an international standard data format intended to reduce the need
for redundant software development efforts in the neutron and x-ray scattering
communities. As the NeXus standard matures it is starting to be used at
laboratories for storing raw data. The Manuel Lujan Jr. Neutron Scattering
Center (MLNSC) at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Intense Pulsed Neutron
Source (IPNS) at Argonne National Laboratory have been working with NeXus in an
effort to share data and software. MLNSC is now writing files compliant with
NeXus and the Integrated Spectral Analysis Workbench (ISAW) software from IPNS
is being used with this data. Problems can arise if the standard is interpreted
in different ways and information that belongs in the file is not accounted for
in the standard. This paper will discuss an inter-laboratory collaboration in
relation to a maturing data standard.
