We present in this paper an exhaustive compilation of all published data of
extragalactic Cepheids. We have checked every light curve in order to
characterize the different types of Cepheid and detect potential overtone
pulsators, or to estimate the quality of the data. This compilation of about
3000 photometric measurements will constitute a very useful tool for
astronomers involved for instance in the extragalactic distance scale.
