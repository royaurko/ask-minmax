In this paper we propose an approach to the implementation of controllers
with decentralized strategies triggering controller updates. We consider
set-ups with a central node in charge of the computation of the control
commands, and a set of not co-located sensors providing measurements to the
controller node. The solution we propose does not require measurements from the
sensors to be synchronized in time. The sensors in our proposal provide
measurements in an aperiodic way triggered by local conditions. Furthermore, in
the proposed implementation (most of) the communication between nodes requires
only the exchange of one bit of information (per controller update), which
could aid in reducing transmission delays and as a secondary effect result in
fewer transmissions being triggered.
