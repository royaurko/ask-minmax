The construction of initial-data sets representing binary black-hole
configurations in quasi-circular orbits is studied in the context of the
conformal-imaging formalism. An effective-potential approach for locating
quasi-circular orbits is outlined for the general case of two holes of
arbitrary size and with arbitrary spins. Such orbits are explicitly determined
for the case of two equal-sized nonrotating holes, and the innermost stable
quasi-circular orbit is located. The characteristics of this innermost orbit
are compared to previous estimates for it, and the entire sequence of
quasi-circular orbits is compared to results from the post-Newtonian
approximation. Some aspects of the numerical evolution of such data sets are
explored.
