We present initial results from a wide field photometric survey of the Fornax
dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy. The focus here is on a small overdensity of
stars located approximately 17 arcmin (670 pc in projection) from the centre of
Fornax. Based on imaging data in both V and I bands down to approximately V =
21, the dimensions of the feature are approximately 1.7 arcmin by 3.2 arcmin
(68 pc by 128 pc) with an average surface brightness of 25.8 mag/arcsec^2 in V.
A follow-up analysis using the deep B and R band data obtained by Stetson et
al. (1998) indicates that the overdensity is apparently dominated by a
relatively young stellar population with an age of approximately 2 Gyr, though
the current data do not rule out the presence of older stars. Our preferred
interpretation is that the overdensity represents shell structure in the Fornax
dSph galaxy, a phenomenon previously unseen in dwarf galaxies. The shell may be
the remnant of a merger with Fornax of a smaller, gas-rich system that occured
approximately 2 Gyr ago. The comparitively recent star formation seen in some
dSph and dE galaxies may then also be the result of infall of small relatively
gas-rich systems.
