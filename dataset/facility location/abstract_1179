Due to the potentially adverse effects of the generation of halo particles in
intense proton beams, it is imperative to have a clear understanding of the
mechanisms that can lead to halo formation for current and proposed high-
intensity linacs. To this end a theoretical model has been developed, which
indicates that protons under the combined influence of strong space charge
forces and periodic focussing in a linear transport channel can be kicked into
halo orbits. However, no experimental measurements of beam halo in proton beams
have yet been carried out. In this paper we report the progress of an effort to
carry out an experiment to measure beam-halo using the existing high- intensity
proton beam of the LEDA facility. A linear transport channel has been assembled
with the appropriate diagnostics for measuring the expected small beam
component in the beam halo as a function of beam parameters. The experiment is
based on the use of an array of high-dynamic-range wire and beam scrapers to
determine the halo and core profiles along the transport channel. Details of
the experimental design, the expected halo measurement properties will be
presented.
