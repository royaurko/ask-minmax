We present and interpret simultaneous new photometric and spectroscopic
observations of the peculiar magnetic white dwarf WD1953-011. The flux in the
V-band filter and intensity of the Balmer spectral lines demonstrate
variability with the rotation period of about 1.45 days. According to previous
studies, this variability can be explained by the presence of a dark spot
having a magnetic nature, analogous to a sunspot. Motivated by this idea, we
examine possible physical relationships between the suggested dark spot and the
strong-field magnetic structure (magnetic "spot", or "tube") recently
identified on the surface of this star. Comparing the rotationally-modulated
flux with the variable spectral observables related to the magnetic "spot" we
establish their correlation, and therefore their physical relationship.
Modeling the variable photometric flux assuming that it is associated with
temperature variations in the stellar photosphere, we argue that the
strong-field area and dark, low-temperature spot are comparable in size and
located at the same latitudes, essentially overlapping each other with a
possible slight longitudinal shift. In this paper we also present a new,
improved value of the star's rotational period and constrain the
characteristics of the thermal inhomogeneity over the degenerate's surface.
