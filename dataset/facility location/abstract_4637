We report laser emission from single, stationary, Rhodamine B-doped
glycerol/water microdroplets located on a superhydrophobic surface. In the
experiments, a pulsed, frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser operating at 532 nm was
used as the excitation source. The microdroplets ranged in diameter from a few
to 20 um. Lasing was achieved in the red-shifted portion of the dye emission
spectrum with threshold fluences as low as 750 J/cm2. Photobleaching was
observed when the microdroplets were pumped above threshold. In certain cases,
multimode lasing was also observed and attributed to the simultaneous lasing of
two modes belonging to different sets of whispering gallery modes.
