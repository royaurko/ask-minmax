We consider estimation in a particular semiparametric regression model for
the mean of a counting process with ``panel count'' data. The basic model
assumption is that the conditional mean function of the counting process is of
the form $E\{\mathbb{N}(t)|Z\}=\exp(\beta_0^TZ)\Lambda_0(t)$ where $Z$ is a
vector of covariates and $\Lambda_0$ is the baseline mean function. The ``panel
count'' observation scheme involves observation of the counting process
$\mathbb{N}$ for an individual at a random number $K$ of random time points;
both the number and the locations of these time points may differ across
individuals. We study semiparametric maximum pseudo-likelihood and maximum
likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters $(\beta_0,\Lambda_0)$ derived
on the basis of a nonhomogeneous Poisson process assumption. The
pseudo-likelihood estimator is fairly easy to compute, while the maximum
likelihood estimator poses more challenges from the computational perspective.
We study asymptotic properties of both estimators assuming that the
proportional mean model holds, but dropping the Poisson process assumption used
to derive the estimators. In particular we establish asymptotic normality for
the estimators of the regression parameter $\beta_0$ under appropriate
hypotheses. The results show that our estimation procedures are robust in the
sense that the estimators converge to the truth regardless of the underlying
counting process.
