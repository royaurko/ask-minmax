The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) is the first x-ray laser user facility
based upon a free electron laser (FEL). In addition to many other stringent
requirements, the LCLS XFEL requires extraordinary beam quality to saturate at
1.5 angstroms within a 100 meter undulator.[1] This new light source is using
the last kilometer of the three kilometer linac at SLAC to accelerate the beam
to an energy as high as 13.6 GeV and required a new electron gun and injector
to produce a very bright beam for acceleration. At the outset of the project it
was recognized that existing RF guns had the potential to produce the desired
beam but none had demonstrated it. This paper describes the analysis and design
improvements of the BNL/SLAC/UCLA s-band gun leading to achievement of the LCLS
performance goals.
