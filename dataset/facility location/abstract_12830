We propose to use social networking data to validate mobility models for
pervasive mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) and delay tolerant networks (DTNs).
The Random Waypoint (RWP) and Erdos-Renyi (ER) models have been a popular
choice among researchers for generating mobility traces of nodes and
relationships between them. Not only RWP and ER are useful in evaluating
networking protocols in a simulation environment, but they are also used for
theoretical analysis of such dynamic networks. However, it has been observed
that neither relationships among people nor their movements are random.
Instead, human movements frequently contain repeated patterns and friendship is
bounded by distance. We used social networking site Gowalla to collect, create
and validate models of human mobility and relationships for analysis and
evaluations of applications in opportunistic networks such as sensor networks
and transportation models in civil engineering. In doing so, we hope to provide
more human-like movements and social relationship models to researchers to
study problems in complex and mobile networks.
