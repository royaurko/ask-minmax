Evidence supporting the hypothesis of an invariant stellar Initial Mass
Function is strong and varied. The intra-cluster medium in rich clusters of
galaxies is one of the few contrary locations where recent interpretations of
the chemical abundances have favoured an IMF that is biased towards massive
stars, compared to the `normal' IMF. This interpretation hinges upon the
neglect of Type Ia supernovae to the ICM enrichment, and a particular choice of
the nucleosynthesis yields of Type II supernovae. We demonstrate here that when
one adopts yields determined empirically from observations of Galactic stars,
rather than the uncertain model yields, a self-consistent picture may be
obtained with an invariant stellar IMF, and about half of the iron in the ICM
being produced by Type Ia supernovae.
