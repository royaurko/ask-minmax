Magnetic null points can be located numerically in a potential field
extrapolation or their average density can be estimated from the Fourier
spectrum of a magnetogram. We use both methods to compute the null point
density from a quiet Sun magnetogram made with Hinode's NFI and from
magnetograms from SOHO's MDI in both its high-resolution and low-resolution
modes. All estimates of the super-chromospheric column density (z>1.5 Mm) agree
with one another and with the previous measurements: 0.003 null points per
square Mm of solar surface.
