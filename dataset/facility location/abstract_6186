In this paper,we have found the equations of motion of Generalized
Photogravitational restricted three body problem with Poynting-Robertson drag.
The problem is generalized in the sense that smaller primary is supposed to be
an oblate spheroid. The bigger primary is considered as radiating. The
equations of motion are affected by radiation pressure force oblateness and P-R
drag. We have located triangular equilibrium points in our problem. All
classical results involving photogravitational and oblateness in restricted
three body problem may be verified from this result.
