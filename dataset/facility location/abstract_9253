A five-dimensional Ricci-flat cosmological solution is studied by assuming
that the induced 4D matter contains two components: the usual fluid for dark
matter as well as baryons and a scalar field with an exponential potential for
dark energy. With use of the phase-plane analysis it is shown that there exist
two late-time attractors one of which corresponds to a universe dominated by
the scalar field alone and the other is a scaling solution in which the energy
density of the scalar field remains proportional to that of the dark matter. It
is furthermore shown that for this 5D scaling solution the universe expands
with the same rate as in the 4D FRW models and not relies on which 4D
hypersurface the universe is located in the 5D manifold.
