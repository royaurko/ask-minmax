NGC 6337 is a member of the rare group of planetary nebulae where a close
binary nucleus has been identified. The nebula's morphology and emission line
profiles are both unusual, particularly the latter. We present a thorough
mapping of spatially resolved, long-slit echelle spectra obtained over the
nebula that allows a detailed characterization of its complex kinematics. This
information, together with narrow band imagery is used to produce a three
dimensional model of the nebula using the code SHAPE. The 3-D model yields a
slowly expanding toroid with large density fluctuations in its periphery that
are observed as cometary knots. A system of bipolar expanding caps of low
ionization are located outside the toroid. In addition, an extended high
velocity and tenuous bipolar collimated outflow is found emerging from the core
and sharply bending in opposite directions, a behavior that cannot be accounted
for by pure magnetic launching and collimation unless the source of the outflow
is precessing or rotating, as could be expected from a close binary nucleus.
