The highly disturbed hot gas in elliptical galaxies, as revealed in many {\em
Chandra} X-ray images, implies a source of energy in the galactic nucleus. In
some elliptical galaxies faint X-ray ``ghost'' cavities appear without
corresponding radio lobes. It has been suggested that ghost cavities are caused
by short-lived activity with a timescale of $\sim 10^3-10^4$ years, but this is
difficult to understand within the popular paradigm of active galactic nuclei.
We suggest an episode model for ghost cavities, invoking captures of red giant
stars by the black hole located at the center of the elliptical galaxies at a
typical rate of $10^{-5}$yr$^{-1}$ per galaxy. The accretion of tidally
disrupted red giant stars onto the black hole powers activity in a timescale of
a few years. The total energy channeled into the jet/outflow during the cooling
time of the hot gas is $\sim 10^{56}$ erg, which is the typical work required
to form the observed cavities. In this scenario, the faint cavities are
produced by the feedback following accretion of the debris of the captured red
giant stars onto the black holes. We apply the present model to several
elliptical galaxies and find that it can explain the formation of the ghost
cavities. This model can be tested in the future by comparisons between radio
and X-ray observations.
