We have measured the temperature (0.1 <= T <= 15 K) and magnetic field (0 <=
B <= 12 T) dependences of longitudinal and Hall resistivities for the
p-Ge_0.93Si_0.07/Ge multilayers with different Ge layer widths 10 <= d_w <= 38
nm and hole densities p_s = (1-5)10^11 cm^-2. Two models for the long-range
random impurity potential (the model with randomly distributed charged centers
located outside the conducting layer and the model of the system with a spacer)
are used for evaluation of the impurity potential fluctuation characteristics:
the random potential amplitude, nonlinear screening length in vicinity of
integer filling factors nu = 1 and nu = 2 and the background density of state
(DOS). The described models are suitable for explanation of the unusually high
value of DOS at nu = 1 and nu = 2, in contrast to the short-range impurity
potential models. For half-integer filling factors the linear temperature
dependence of the effective QHE plateau-to-plateau transition width nu_0(T) is
observed in contrast to scaling behavior for systems with short-range disorder.
The finite T -> 0 width of QHE transitions may be due to an effective low
temperature screening of smooth random potential owing to Coulomb repulsion of
electrons.
