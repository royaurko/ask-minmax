The history and present status of informal asteroseismological network of
Asian observatories of Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Turkmenistan is
given. We give briefly the description of facilities of CAN sites, the
1994-1997 activity of CAN in international multisite asteroseismological
campaigns and further strategy of CAN. We call for close collaboration between
CAN and western groups in asteroseismology of roAp, delta Scuti and lambda
Bootis type stars.
