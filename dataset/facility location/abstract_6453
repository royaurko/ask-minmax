We introduce a new method of Bayesian wavelet shrinkage for reconstructing a
signal when we observe a noisy version. Rather than making the common
assumption that the wavelet coefficients of the signal are independent, we
allow for the possibility that they are locally correlated in both location
(time) and scale (frequency). This leads us to a prior structure which is
analytically intractable, but it is possible to draw independent samples from a
close approximation to the posterior distribution by an approach based on
Coupling From The Past.
