For some heavy-fermion compounds, it has been suggested that a
Fermi-surface-changing Lifshitz transition, which can be driven, e.g., by
varying an applied magnetic field, occurs inside the heavy- fermion regime.
Here we discuss, based on microscopic calculations, how the location of such a
transition can be influenced by carrier doping. Due to strong correlations, a
heavy band does not shift rigidly with the chemical potential. Intriguingly, we
find that the actual shift is determined by the interplay of heavy and
additional light bands crossing the Fermi level: doped carriers tend to
populate heavy and light bands equally, despite the fact that the latter
contribute a small density of states of excitations only. This invalidates
naive estimates of the transition shift based on the low-temperature specific
heat of the heavy Fermi liquid. We discuss applications of our results.
