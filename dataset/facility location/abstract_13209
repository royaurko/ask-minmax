We realize a nonlinear acoustic lens composed of a two-dimensional array of
sphere chains interfaced with water. The chains are able to support solitary
waves which, when interfaced with a linear medium, transmit compact pulses with
minimal oscillations. When focused, the lens is able to produce compact
pressure pulses of high amplitude, the "sound bullets". We demonstrate that the
focal point can be controlled via pre-compression of the individual chains, as
this changes the wave speed within them. The experimental results agree well
both spatially and temporally with analytical predictions over a range of focus
locations.
