We evaluate the constraints on anomalous trilinear gauge-boson couplings that
can be obtained from the study of electron-positron annihilation into $W$ pairs
at a facility with either the electron beam longitudinally polarized or both
electron and positron beams transversely polarized. The energy ranges
considered in the analysis are the ones relevant to the next-linear collider
and to LEP~200. We discuss the possibilities of a model independent analysis of
the general $CP$ conserving anomalous effective Lagrangian, as well as its
restriction to some specific models with reduced number of independent
couplings. The combination of observables with initial and final state
polarizations allows to separately constrain the different couplings and to
improve the corresponding numerical bounds.
