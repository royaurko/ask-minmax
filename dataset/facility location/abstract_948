One of the fundamental objectives of experiments with ultrarelativistic heavy
ions is to explore strongly interacting matter at high density and high
temperature. In this investigation we study in particular the information which
can be obtained by analyzing baryonic and mesonic resonances. The decay
products of these resonances carry information on the resonances properties at
the space time point of their decay. We especially investigate the percentage
of reconstructable resonances as a function of density for heavy ion collisions
in the energy range between $E_{lab}$ = 30 AGeV and $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 AGeV, the
energy domain between the future FAIR facility and the present RHIC collider.
