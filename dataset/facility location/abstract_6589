We consider a multivariate piecewise linear interpolation of a continuous
random field on a d-dimensional cube. The approximation performance is measured
by the integrated mean square error. Multivariate piecewise linear interpolator
is defined by N field observations on a locations grid (or design). We
investigate the class of locally stationary random fields whose local behavior
is like a fractional Brownian field in mean square sense and find the
asymptotic approximation accuracy for a sequence of designs for large N.
Moreover, for certain classes of continuous and continuously differentiable
fields we provide the upper bound for the approximation accuracy in the uniform
mean square norm.
