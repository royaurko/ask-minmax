We calculate the neutrino nucleus cross sections for charged lepton
production relevant for the experiments proposed with the stopped muon
neutrinos using neutron spallation source facility. The calculations are done
in local density approximation taking into account Pauli blocking, Fermi motion
effects and renormalization of weak transition strengths in the nuclear medium.
The effect of Coulomb distortion of the lepton produced in charge current
reactions is taken into account by using the Fermi function as well as in a
model where an effective momentum has been used for the lepton moving in the
local Coulomb field of the final nucleus. The numerical results for the
neutrino nucleus total cross sections averaged over Michel spectrum are
presented for various nuclei.
