Source localization by matched-field processing (MFP) generally involves
solving a number of computationally intensive partial differential equations.
This paper introduces a technique that mitigates this computational workload by
"compressing" these computations. Drawing on key concepts from the recently
developed field of compressed sensing, it shows how a low-dimensional proxy for
the Green's function can be constructed by backpropagating a small set of
random receiver vectors. Then, the source can be located by performing a number
of "short" correlations between this proxy and the projection of the recorded
acoustic data in the compressed space. Numerical experiments in a Pekeris ocean
waveguide are presented which demonstrate that this compressed version of MFP
is as effective as traditional MFP even when the compression is significant.
The results are particularly promising in the broadband regime where using as
few as two random backpropagations per frequency performs almost as well as the
traditional broadband MFP, but with the added benefit of generic applicability.
That is, the computationally intensive backpropagations may be computed offline
independently from the received signals, and may be reused to locate any source
within the search grid area.
