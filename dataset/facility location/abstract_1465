A southern hemisphere survey of methanol emission sources in two millimeter
wave transitions has been carried out using the ATNF Mopra millimetre
telescope. Sixteen emission sources have been detected in the 3(1)-4(0)A+
transition of methanol at 107 GHz, including six new sources exhibiting class
II methanol maser emission features. Combining these results with the similar
northern hemisphere survey, a total of eleven 107-GHz methanol masers have been
detected. A survey of the methanol emission in the 0(0)-1(-1)E transition at
108 GHz resulted in the detection of 16 sources; one of them showing maser
characteristics. This is the first methanol maser detected at 108 GHz,
presumably of class II. The results of LVG statistical equilibrium calculations
confirm the classification of these new sources as a class II methanol masers.
