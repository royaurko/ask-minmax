We establish a simple, explicit relation between the formalisms employed in
the treatments of polarization observables in deuteron two-body
electrodisintegration published by Arenh\"ovel, Leidemann, and Tomusiak in
Few-Body Systems {\bf 15}, 109 (1993) and the results of the present contributors
published in Phys.~Rev.~C {\bf 40}, 2479 (1989). We comment on the overlap
between the two sets of results.
