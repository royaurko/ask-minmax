Spin density wave (SDW) states at quarter-filling, which coexist with charge
density wave (CDW) states, have been examined where the critical temperature is
calculated for an extended Hubbard model with long range repulsive
interactions. Within the mean-field theory, it is shown that the first order
transition occurs with decreasing temperature for interactions located around
the boundary between SDW state and CDW state.
