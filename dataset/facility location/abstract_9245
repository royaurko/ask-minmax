Following Tancredi, Sanchez and Roig (2001)'s criteria of chaos, two ways of
setting initial velocities are used in the numerical surveys to explore the
possible chaotic and regular orbits for the disc-star-planet systems. We find
that the chaotic boundary does not depend much on the disc mass for Type I
initial condition, but can change a lot for different disc masses for Type II
initial condition. A few sample orbits are further studied. Both Poincare
surface of section and the Lyapounov Exponent Indicator are calculated and they
are consistent with each other. We also find that the influence from the disc
can change the locations of equilibrium points and the orbital behaviors for
both types of initial conditions. Because the chaotic orbits are less likely to
become the stable resonant orbits, we conclude that the proto-stellar disc
shall play important roles for the capture and depletion histories of resonant
orbits of both Asteroid Belt and Kuiper Belt during the formation of Solar
System.
