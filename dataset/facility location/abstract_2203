One-to-one correspondence between dual diagrams of dual resonance model and
QCD based color diagrams describing non vacuum exchanges in pi+ pi-, pi+- p, p
anti p interactions is discussed. Both for dual and color diagrams there are
state with quark-antiquark in t channel and state, in which only coherent quark
string exists, in s channel. There are no such dual diagrams in pp interaction.
Color diagram for pp interaction was found basing on principle of conformity.
Secondary hadrons spectrum, obtained from this diagram, has nucleon in its
central region. This effect may lead to increase of baryon chemical potential
in nucleus-nucleus collisions in facilities NICA and FAIR.
