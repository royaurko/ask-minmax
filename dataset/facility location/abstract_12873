Supply Chain coordination has become a critical success factor for Supply
Chain management (SCM) and effectively improving the performance of
organizations in various industries. Companies are increasingly located at the
intersection of one or more corporate networks which are designated by "Supply
Chain". Managing this chain is mainly based on an 'information sharing' and
redeployment activities between the various links that comprise it. Several
attempts have been made by industrialists and researchers to educate
policymakers about the gains to be made by the implementation of cooperative
relationships. The approach presented in this paper here is among the works
that aim to propose solutions related to information systems distributed Supply
Chains to enable the different actors of the chain to improve their
performance. We propose in particular solutions that focus on cooperation
between actors in the Supply Chain.
