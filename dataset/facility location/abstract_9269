We present Chandra observations of the massive star-forming region S106, a
prominent HII region in Cygnus, associated with an extended molecular cloud and
a young cluster. The nebula is excited by a single young massive star located
at the center of the molecular cloud and the embedded cluster. The prominence
of the cluster in the Chandra observation presented here confirms its youth and
allows some of its members to be studied in more detail. We detect X-ray
emission from the young massive central source S106 IRS 4, the deeply embedded
central object which drives the bipolar nebula with a mass loss rate
approximately 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than main sequence stars of
comparable luminosity. Still, on the basis of its wind momentum flux the X-ray
luminosity of S106 IRS 4 is comparable to the values observed in more evolved
(main sequence and giant) massive stars, suggesting that the same process which
is responsible for the observed X-ray emission from older massive stars is
already at work at these early stages.
