Active authentication is the problem of continuously verifying the identity
of a person based on behavioral aspects of their interaction with a computing
device. In this study, we collect and analyze behavioral biometrics data from
200subjects, each using their personal Android mobile device for a period of at
least 30 days. This dataset is novel in the context of active authentication
due to its size, duration, number of modalities, and absence of restrictions on
tracked activity. The geographical colocation of the subjects in the study is
representative of a large closed-world environment such as an organization
where the uncontributorized user of a device is likely to be an insider threat:
coming from within the organization. We consider four biometric modalities: (1)
text entered via soft keyboard, (2) applications used, (3) websites visited,
and (4) physical location of the device as determined from GPS (when outdoors)
or WiFi (when indoors). We implement and test a classifier for each modality
and organize the classifiers as a parallel binary decision fusion architecture.
We are able to characterize the performance of the system with respect to
intruder detection time and to quantify the contribution of each modality to
the overall performance.
