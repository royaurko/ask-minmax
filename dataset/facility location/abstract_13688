In this work we present the solution of the stellar spot problem using the
Kelvin-Stokes theorem. Our result is applicable for any given location and
dimension of the spots on the stellar surface. We present explicitely the
result up to the second degree in the limb darkening law. This technique can be
used to calculate very efficiently mutual photometric effects produced by
eclipsing bodies occulting stellar spots and to construct complex spot shapes.
