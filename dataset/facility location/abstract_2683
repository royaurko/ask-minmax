The distribution function of suprathermal ions is found to be self-similar
under conditions relevant to inertial confinement fusion hot-spots. By
utilizing this feature, interference between the hydro-instabilities and
kinetic effects is for the first time assessed quantitatively to find that the
instabilities substantially aggravate the fusion reactivity reduction. The ion
tail depletion is also shown to lower the experimentally inferred ion
temperature, a novel kinetic effect that may explain the discrepancy between
the exploding pusher experiments and rad-hydro simulations and contribute to
the observation that temperature inferred from DD reaction products is lower
than from DT at National Ignition Facility.
