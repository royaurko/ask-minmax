The Tawny-OWL library provides a fully-programmatic environment for ontology
building; it enables the use of a rich set of tools for ontology development,
by recasting development as a form of programming. It is built in Clojure - a
modern Lisp dialect, and is backed by the OWL API. Used simply, it has a
similar syntax to OWL Manchester syntax, but it provides arbitrary
extensibility and abstraction. It builds on existing facilities for Clojure,
which provides a rich and modern programming tool chain, for versioning,
distributed development, build, testing and continuous integration. In this
paper, we describe the library, this environment and the its potential
implications for the ontology development process.
