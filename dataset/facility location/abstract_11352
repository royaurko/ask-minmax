We present a homogeneous set of spectroscopic measurements secured with
4-meter class telescopes for a sample of 90 planetary nebulae (PNe) located in
the direction of the Galactic bulge. We derive their plasma parameters and
chemical abundances. For half of the objects this is done for the first time.
We discuss the accuracy of these data and compare it with other recently
published samples. We analyze various properties of PNe with emission-line
central stars in the Galactic bulge. Investigating the spectra we found that 7
of those PNe are ionized by Wolf-Rayet ([WR]) type stars of the very late (VL)
spectral class [WC 11] and 8 by weak emission-line (WEL) stars. From the
analysis we conclude that the PN central stars of WEL, VL and remaining [WR]
types form three, evolutionary unconnected forms of enhanced mass-loss among
central stars of PNe. [WR] PNe seem to be intrinsically brighter than other
PNe. Overall, we find no statistically significant evidence that the chemical
composition of PNe with emission-line central stars is different from that of
the remaining Galactic bulge PNe.
