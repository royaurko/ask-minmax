Elastic electromagnetic nucleon form factors have long provided vital
information about the structure and composition of these most basic elements of
nuclear physics. The form factors are a measurable and physical manifestation
of the nature of the nucleons' constituents and the dynamics that binds them
together. Accurate form factor data obtained in recent years using modern
experimental facilities has spurred a significant reevaluation of the nucleon
and pictures of its structure; e.g., the role of quark orbital angular
momentum, the scale at which perturbative QCD effects should become evident,
the strangeness content, and meson-cloud effects. We provide a succinct survey
of the experimental studies and theoretical interpretation of nucleon
electromagnetic form factors.
