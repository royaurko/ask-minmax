The mere location of a Beat Cepheid model in a Period Ratio vs. Period
diagram (Petersen diagram) puts very tight constraints on its metallicity Z.
The Beat Cepheid Peterson diagrams are revisited with linear nonadiabatic
turbulent convective models, and their accuracy as a probe for stellar
metallicity is evaluated. They are shown to be largely independent of the
helium content Y, and they are also only weakly dependent on the
mass-luminosity relation that is used in their construction. However, they are
found to show sensitivity to the relative abundances of the elements that are
lumped into the metallicity parameter Z. Rotation is estimated to have but a
small effect on the 'pulsation metallicities'. A composite Petersen diagram is
presented that allows one to read off upper and lower limits on the metallicity
Z from the measured period P0 and period ratio P1/P0.
