This article deals with the numerical calculation of eigenvalues of perturbed
periodic Schr\"odinger operators located in spectral gaps. Such operators are
encountered in the modeling of the electronic structure of crystals with local
defects, and of photonic crystals. The usual finite element Galerkin
approximation is known to give rise to spectral pollution. In this article, we
give a precise description of the corresponding spurious states. We then prove
that the supercell model does not produce spectral pollution. Lastly, we extend
results by Lewin and S\'er\'e on some no-pollution criteria. In particular, we
prove that using approximate spectral projectors enables one to eliminate
spectral pollution in a given spectral gap of the reference periodic
Sch\"odinger operator.
