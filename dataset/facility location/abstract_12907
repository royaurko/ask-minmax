A wide range of engineering design problems have been solved by the
algorithms that simulates collective intelligence in swarms of birds or
insects. The Artificial Bee Colony or ABC is one of the recent additions to the
class of swarm intelligence based algorithms that mimics the foraging behavior
of honey bees. ABC consists of three groups of bees namely employed, onlooker
and scout bees. In ABC, the food locations represent the potential candidate
solution. In the present study an attempt is made to generate the population of
food sources (Colony Size) adaptively and the variant is named as A-ABC. A-ABC
is further enhanced to improve convergence speed and exploitation capability,
by employing the concept of elitism, which guides the bees towards the best
food source. This enhanced variant is called E-ABC. The proposed algorithms are
validated on a set of standard benchmark problems with varying dimensions taken
from literature and on five engineering design problems. The numerical results
are compared with the basic ABC and three recent variant of ABC. Numerically
and statistically simulated results illustrate that the proposed method is very
efficient and competitive.
