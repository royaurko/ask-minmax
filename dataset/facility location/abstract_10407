We analyse the lower non trivial part of the spectrum of the generator of the
Glauber dynamics, which we consider a positive operator, for a d-dimensional
nearest neighbour Ising model with a bounded random potential. We prove
conjecture 1 in a paper by Albeverio et al.(referred as [AMSZ]) that is, for
sufficently large values of the temperature, the first band of the spectrum of
the generator of the process coincides with a closed non random segment of the
real line.
