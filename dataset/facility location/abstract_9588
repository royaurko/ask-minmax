We present a UBV CCD photometric study of four open clusters, NGC 7245, King
9, IC 166 and King 13, located between $l = 90^o - 135^o$. All are embedded in
a rich galactic field. NGC 7245 and King 9 are close together in the sky and
have similar reddenings. The distances and ages are: NGC 7245, 3.8$\pm$0.35 kpc
and 400 Myr; King 9 (the most distant cluster in this quadrant) 7.9$\pm$1.1 kpc
and 3.0 Gyr. King 13 is 3.1$\pm$0.3 kpc distant and 300 Myr old. King 9 and IC
166 (4.8$\pm$0.5 kpc distant & 1 Gyr old) may be metal poor clusters (Z=0.008),
as estimated from isochrone fitting. The average value of the distance of young
clusters from the galactic plane in the above longitude range and beyond 2 kpc
($-47\pm$16 pc, for 64 clusters), indicates that the young disk bends towards
the southern latitudes.
