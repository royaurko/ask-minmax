In this Letter we suggest a new method of manipulating individual molecules
with scanning probes using a "pick-up-and put-down" mode. We demonstrate that
the number of molecules picked up by the tip and deposited in a different
location can be controlled by adjusting the pulling velocity of the tip and the
distance of closest approach of the tip to the surface.
