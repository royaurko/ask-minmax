We have used deep high-resolution multiband images taken at the ESO Very
Large Telescope to identify the optical binary companion to the millisecond
pulsar (PSR J1911-5958A) located in the halo of the Galactic Globular Cluster
NGC6752. The object turns out to be a blue star whose position in the Color
Magnitude Diagram is consistent with the cooling sequence of a low mass
(M~0.17-0.20Mo), low metallicity Helium white dwarf (He-WD) at the cluster
distance. This is the second He-WD which has been found to orbit a millisecond
pulsar in GGCs. Curiously both objects have been found to lie on the same mass
He-WD cooling sequence. The anomalous position of PSR J1911-5958A with respect
to the globular cluster center (~6') suggested that this system has recently
(<1 Gyr) been ejected from the cluster core as the result of a strong dynamical
interaction. The data presented here allows to constrain the cooling age of the
companion within a fairly narrow range (~1.2-2.8 Gyr), therefore suggesting
that such dynamical encounter must have acted on an already recycled
millisecond pulsar.
