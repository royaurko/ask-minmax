This paper presents a design for scaleable space solar power systems based on
free-flying reflectors and module self-assembly. Lower system cost of
utility-scale space solar power is achieved by design independence of
yet-to-be-built in-space assembly or transportation infrastructure. Using
current and expected near-term technology, this study describe a design for
mid-term utility-scale power plants in geosynchronous orbits. High-level
economic considerations in the context of current and expected future launch
costs are given as well.
