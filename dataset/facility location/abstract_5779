The discovery of a gravitational lens candidate is reported. The quasars SDSS
J111611.73+411821.5 and SDSS J111610.68+411814.4 are recognized as two images
of the same object, being strongly lensed by the closer galaxy SDSS
J111611.03+411820.9. The source is located at a redshift of z~3, while the
redshift of the lens galaxy is z~0.25. The separation of the images is
large,~13 arcsec. Commonly used models of the mass distribution for the lens
galaxy with values of the parameters in the expected range describe the
positions and fluxes of the images.
