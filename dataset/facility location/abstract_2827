The new extremely large telescope projects need accurate evaluation of the
candidate sites. In this paper we present the astroclimatological comparison
between the Paranal Observatory, located on the coast of the Atacama Desert
(Chile), and the Observatorio del Roque de Los Muchachos (ORM), located in La
Palma (Canary Islands). We apply a statistical analysis using long term
databases from Paranal and Carlsberg Meridian Telescope (CAMC) weather
stations. Significant differences between the two analyzed sites have been
found.
