A terawatt tabletop laser wakefield acceleration source of relativistic
electrons has been developed in our Terawatt Ultrafast High Field Facility
(TUHFF). The preliminary results for ultrafast radiolysis of liquid water using
this femtosecond electron source are presented. A TUHFF based femtosecond x-ray
source is proposed. Thomson scattering of the accelerated electrons off a
counterpropagating terawatt laser beam will be used to generate keV x-ray
photons. The expected parameters of this x-ray source have been estimated. The
short pulse duration, high flux, and good collimation of the resulting x-ray
beam would be conducive for ultrafast time-resolved x-ray absorption studies of
short-lived transient species in gases, liquids, and solids. It is argued that
the solvation dynamics of Br atoms generated in photoinduced electron
detachment from aqueous bromide would make a convenient choice for the first
pump-probe experiment using this x-ray source.
