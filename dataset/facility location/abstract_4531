We study the trajectories followed by a particle subjected to weak noise when
escaping from the domain of attraction of a stable fixed point. If detailed
balance is absent, a _focus_ may occur along the most probable exit path,
leading to a breakdown of symmetry (if present). The exit trajectory
bifurcates, and the exit location distribution may become `skewed'
(non-Gaussian). The weak-noise asymptotics of the mean escape time are strongly
affected. Our methods extend to the study of skewed exit location distributions
in stochastic models without symmetry.
