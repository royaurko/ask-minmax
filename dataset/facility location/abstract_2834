We present new algorithms for $M$-estimators of multivariate scatter and
location and for symmetrized $M$-estimators of multivariate scatter. The new
algorithms are considerably faster than currently used fixed-point and related
algorithms. The main idea is to utilize a second order Taylor expansion of the
target functional and devise a partial Newton-Raphson procedure. In connection
with symmetrized $M$-estimators we work with incomplete $U$-statistics to
accelerate our procedures initially.
