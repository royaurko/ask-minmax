Invasive electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings of ten patients suffering
from focal epilepsy were analyzed using the method of renormalized entropy.
Introduced as a complexity measure for the different regimes of a dynamical
system, the feature was tested here for its spatio-temporal behavior in
epileptic seizures. In all patients a decrease of renormalized entropy within
the ictal phase of seizure was found. Furthermore, the strength of this
decrease is monotonically related to the distance of the recording location to
the focus. The results suggest that the method of renormalized entropy is a
useful procedure for clinical applications like seizure detection and
localization of epileptic foci.
