We study charmed and strange baryon resonances that are generated dynamically
within a unitary meson-baryon coupled-channel model which incorporates
heavy-quark spin symmetry. This is accomplished by extending the SU(3)
Weinberg-Tomozawa chiral Lagrangian to SU(8) spin-flavor symmetry and
implementing a strong flavor symmetry breaking. The model generates dynamically
resonances with negative parity in all the isospin, spin, and strange and charm
sectors that one can form from an s-wave interaction between pseudoscalar and
vector meson multiplets with $1/2^+$ and $3/2^+$ baryons. Our results are
compared with experimental data from several facilities as well as with other
theoretical models. Moreover, we obtain the properties of charmed pseudoscalar
and vector mesons in dense matter within this coupled-channel unitary effective
model by taking into account Pauli-blocking effects and meson self-energies in
a self-consistent manner. We obtain the open-charm meson spectral functions in
this dense nuclear environment, and discuss their implications on the formation
of $D$-mesic nuclei at FAIR energies.
