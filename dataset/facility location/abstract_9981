We report manipulation of a Kondo resonance originated from the spin-electron
interactions between a two-dimensional molecular assembly of TBrPP-Co molecules
and a Cu(111) surface at 4.6 K using a low temperature scanning tunneling
microscope. By manipulating nearest-neighbor molecules with a scanning
tunneling microscope tip we are able to tune the spin-electron coupling of the
center molecule inside a small hexagonal molecular assembly in a controlled
step-by-step manner. The Kondo temperature increases from 105 to 170 K with a
decreasing the number of nearest neighbor molecules from six to zero. This
Kondo temperature variation is originated from the scattering of surface
electrons by the molecules located at the edges of the molecular layer, which
reduces spin-electron coupling strength for the molecules inside the layer.
Investigations on different molecular arrangements indicate that the observed
Kondo resonance is independent on the molecular lattice.
