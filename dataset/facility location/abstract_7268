Higher Criticism is a recently developed statistic for non-Gaussian
detection, proposed in Donoho & Jin 2004. We find that Higher Criticism is
useful for two purposes. First, Higher Criticism has competitive detection
power, and non-Gaussianity is detected at the level 99% in the first year WMAP
data. We find that the Higher Criticism value of WMAP is outside the 99%
confidence region at a wavelet scale of 5 degrees (99.46% of Higher Criticism
values based on simulated maps are below the values for WMAP). Second, Higher
Criticism offers a way to locate a small portion of data that accounts for the
non-Gaussianity. Using Higher Criticism, we have successfully identified a ring
of pixels centered at (l\approx 209 deg, b\approx -57 deg), which seems to
account for the observed detection of non-Gaussianity at the wavelet scale of 5
degrees. Note that the detection is achieved in wavelet space first. Second, it
is always possible that a fraction of pixels within the ring might deviate from
Gaussianity even if they do not appear to be above the 99% confidence level in
wavelet space. The location of the ring coincides with the cold spot detected
in Vielva et al. 2004 and Cruz et al. 2005.
