Harvey, Hill, and Hill have found that unexpected interactions involving the
nucleon, photon, and weak gauge bosons at low energies emerge from gauging the
axial anomaly of QCD under the full electroweak symmetry of the Standard Model
(SM). In this contribution we consider how such interactions can be isolated
through a triple-product momentum correlation in neutron radiative beta-decay.
The correlation is both parity- and naively time-reversal-odd, so that it
vanishes in the Standard Model save for effects induced by final-state
interactions (FSI). Nevertheless, the correlation can be generated by sources
of CP violation beyond the Standard Model, and such couplings, being
spin-independent, are not constrained by the nonobservation of the neutron
electric dipole moment (EDM). We consider the sorts of limits on its strength
which can be determined at existing and anticipated facilities, as well as the
size of induced correlations from known FSI. We also briefly consider the
possibility of nuclear beta-decay studies as well as the prospects for
muon-induced reaction studies.
