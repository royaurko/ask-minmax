We measured the magnetic susceptibilities of Cu$_6$Ge$_6$O$_{18}$-xH$_2$O ($x
= 0 \sim 6$). Susceptibility above the antiferromagnetic (AF) transition
temperature ($T_{\rm N}$) agrees with susceptibility of the one-dimensional
Heisenberg $S = 1/2$ model with competing AF interactions. From the estimated
ratio between nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor AF exchange
interactions, the spin system is probably located near a boundary between spin
systems with gapless and gapped magnetic excitation. The value of $T_{\rm
N}/T_{\rm max}$, where $T_{\rm max}$ is temperature at which the susceptibility
is maximum, shows a unique dependence on $x$. The $x$ dependence can be
explained qualitatively by taking phase transition as a function of $x$ and the
effect of disorder into account.
