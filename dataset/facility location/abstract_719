The VST (VLT Survey Telescope) is a 2.6 m Alt-Az telescope to be installed at
Mount Paranal in Chile, in the European Southern Observatory (ESO) site. The
VST is a wide-field imaging facility planned to supply databases for the ESO
Very Large Telescope (VLT) science and carry out stand-alone observations in
the UV to I spectral range. This paper will focus mainly on control software
aspects, describing the VST software architecture in the context of the whole
ESO VLT control concept. The general architecture and the main components of
the control software will be described.
