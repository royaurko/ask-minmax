Current crowding in the bends of superconducting nano-structures not only
restricts measurable critical current in such structures but also redistributes
local probabilities for dark and light counts to appear. Using structures from
strips in the form of a square spiral which contain bends with the very same
curvature with respect to the directions of bias current and external magnetic
field, we have shown that dark counts as well as light counts at small photon
energies originate from areas around the bends. The minimum in the rate of dark
counts reproduces the asymmetry of the maximum critical current density as
function of the magnetic field. Contrary, the minimum in the rate of light
counts demonstrate opposite asymmetry. The rate of light counts become
symmetric at large currents and fields. Comparing locally computed absorption
probabilities for photons and the simulated threshold detection current we
found the approximate locations of areas near bends which deliver asymmetric
light counts. Any asymmetry is absent in Archimedean spiral structures without
bends.
