Crystalline Si substrates are studied for pressure induced phase
transformation under indentation at room temperature using Berkovich tip. Raman
scattering study is used for the identification of the transformed phases.
Raman line as well as area mapping are used for locating the phases in the
indented region. Calculation of pressure contours in the indented region is
used for understanding the phase distribution. We report here a comprehensive
study of all the phases of Si, reported so far, leading to possible
understanding of material properties useful for possible electromechanical
applications. As a major finding, distribution of amorphous phase in the
indented region deviates from the conventional wisdom of being in the central
region alone. We present phase mapping results for both Si(100) and Si(111)
substrates.
