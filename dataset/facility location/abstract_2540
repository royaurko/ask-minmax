We have examined the relationship between the velocity parameters of SiO
masers and the phase of the long period variable stars (LPVs) from which the
masers originate. The SiO spectra from the v=1, J=1-0 (43.122 GHz; hereafter
$J_{1\rightarrow0}$) and the v=1, J=2-1 (86.2434 GHz; hereafter
$J_{2\rightarrow1}$) transitions have been measured using the Mopra Telescope
of the Australia Telescope National Facility. One hundred twenty one sources
have been observed including 47 LPVs contained in the American Association of
Variable Star Observer Bulletin (2011). The epoch of maxima and the periods of
the LPVs are well studied. This database of spectra allows for phase dependent
comparisons and analysis not previously possible with such a large number of
sources observed almost simultaneously in the two transitions over a time span
of several years. The velocity centroids ($VCs$) and velocity ranges of
emission ($VRs$) have been determined and compared for the two transitions as a
function of phase. No obvious phase dependence has been determined for the $VC$
or $VR$. The results of this analysis are compared with past observations and
existing SiO maser theory.
