Plasma window is an advanced apparatus which can work as the interface
between vacuum and high pressure region. It can be used in many applications
which need atmosphere-vacuum interface, such as gas target, electron beam
welding, synchrotron radiation and spallation neutron source. A test bench of
plasma window is constructed in Peking University. A series of experiments and
corresponding parameter measurements have been presented in this article. The
experiment result indicates the feasibility of such a facility acting as an
interface between vacuum and high pressure region.
