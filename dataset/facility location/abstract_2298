The galactic neighborhood, extending from the Milky Way to redshifts of about
0.1, is our unique local laboratory for detailed study of galaxies and their
interplay with the environment. Such study provides a foundation of knowledge
for interpreting observations of more distant galaxies and their environment.
The Astro 2010 Science Frontier Galactic Neighborhood Panel identified four key
scientific questions: 1) What are the flows of matter and energy in the
circumgalactic medium? 2) What controls the mass-energy-chemical cycles within
galaxies? 3) What is the fossil record of galaxy assembly from first stars to
present? 4) What are the connections between dark and luminous matter? These
questions, essential to the understanding of galaxies as interconnected
complexes, can be addressed most effectively and/or uniquely in the galactic
neighborhood. The panel also highlighted the discovery potential of time-domain
astronomy and astrometry with powerful new techniques and facilities to greatly
advance our understanding of the precise connections among stars, galaxies, and
newly discovered transient events. The relevant needs for laboratory
astrophysics will be emphasized, especially in the context of supporting NASA
missions.
