The inclusive, inelastic eD scattering cross section has been measured with
the CLAS detector in Hall B of the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator
Facility (TJNAF). Combining these data and previously measured world data we
have extracted Nachtmann moments of the deuteron structure function F2 in the
region 0.4 < Q2 < 100 GeV2/c2. These results are published in hep-ex/0506004.
The purpose of the present CLAS-Note is to tabulate the CLAS deuteron F2 data.
A description of the data analysis is reported in hep-ex/0506004.
