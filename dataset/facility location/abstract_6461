In the framework of elastic theory, we study the vortex-lattice melting
transitions in magnesium diboride for magnetic fields both parallel and
perpendicular to the anisotropy axis. Using the parameters from experiments,
the vortex-lattice melting lines in the H-T diagram are located systematically
by various groups of Lindemann numbers and the anisotropic parameters. It is
observed that the theoretical result for the vortex melting with parallel and
perpendicular fields agrees well with the experimental data.
