A 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulation analysis of the energy
release for three different reconnection regimes is presented. The system under
investigation consists in a current-sheet located in a medium with a strong
density variation along the current layer: such system is modeled as it were
located in the high chromosphere/low solar corona as in the case of pre- flare
and coronal mass ejection (CME) configurations or in the aftermath of such
explosive phenomena. By triggering different magnetic-reconnection dynamics,
that is from a laminar slow evolution to a spontaneous non-steady turbulent
reconnection [1,2,3], we observe a rather different efficiency and temporal
behavior with regard to the energy fluxes associated with each of these
reconnection-driven evolutions. These discrepancies are fundamental
key-properties to create realistic models of the triggering mechanisms and
initial evolution of all those phenomena requiring fast (and high power)
magnetic reconnection events within the solar environment.
