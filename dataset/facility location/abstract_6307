We show that particular configurations of intense off-resonant laser beams
can give rise to an attractive 1/r interatomic potential between atoms located
well within the laser wavelength. Such a ``gravitational-like'' interaction is
shown to give stable Bose condensates that are self-bound (without an
additional trap) with unique scaling properties and measurably distinct
signatures.
