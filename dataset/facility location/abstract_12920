Neutron decay spectroscopy has become a successful tool to explore nuclear
properties of nuclei with the largest neutron-to-proton ratios. Resonances in
nuclei located beyond the neutron dripline are accessible by kinematic
reconstruction of the decay products. The development of two-neutron detection
capabilities of the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) at NSCL has opened up the
possibility to search for unbound nuclei which decay by the emission of two
neutrons. Specifically this exotic decay mode was observed in 16Be and 26O.
