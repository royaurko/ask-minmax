Over the past years several works have proposed access control models for XML
data where only read-access rights over non-recursive DTDs are considered. A
few amount of works have studied the access rights for updates. In this paper,
we present a general model for specifying access control on XML data in the
presence of update operations of W3C XQuery Update Facility. Our approach for
enforcing such updates specifications is based on the notion of query rewriting
where each update operation defined over arbitrary DTD (recursive or not) is
rewritten to a safe one in order to be evaluated only over XML data which can
be updated by the user. We investigate in the second part of this report the
secure of XML updating in the presence of read-access rights specified by a
security views. For an XML document, a security view represents for each class
of users all and only the parts of the document these users are able to see. We
show that an update operation defined over a security view can cause disclosure
of sensitive data hidden by this view if it is not thoroughly rewritten with
respect to both read and update access rights. Finally, we propose a security
view based approach for securely updating XML in order to preserve the
confidentiality and integrity of XML data.
