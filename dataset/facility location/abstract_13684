We present a detailed analysis of coherence creation in a four level double
lambda-like atomic system using a train of ultra-short few-cycle Gaussian
pulses. The effect of the Doppler broadening has been analyzed. It is possible
to create high coherence across all the velocity groups in the atomic ensemble
using pulses with low repetition frequency. The accumulation of coherence at
different radial locations within the atomic beam cross-section as a function
of the number of pulses in the train is also reported. We find that pulse train
with lower repetition frequencies are able to generate high and nearly uniform
coherence in a substantial part of the atomic system.
