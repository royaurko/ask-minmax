NOvA is a next generation neutrino oscillation experiment designed to search
for muon neutrino to electron neutrino oscillations by comparing electron
neutrino event rates in a Near Detector at Fermilab with the rates observed in
a large Far Detector at Ash River, Minnesota, 810 km from Fermilab. The
detectors are totally active, segmented, liquid scintillator detectors and are
located 14 mrad off the NuMI beam axis. The Far Detector has begun construction
and will begin taking data in early 2013. The experiment aims to measure the
neutrino mixing angle theta_13 and will push the search for electron neutrino
appearance beyond the current limits by more than an order of magnitude. For
non-zero theta_13, it is possible for NOvA to observe CP violation in neutrinos
and establish the neutrino mass hierarchy. The NOvA prototype near detector on
the surface (NDOS) began running at Fermilab in November and registered its
first neutrinos from the NuMI beam in December 2010. An overview and current
status of the experiment will be presented.
