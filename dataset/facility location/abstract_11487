A series of peculiar, visual alignments between the pyramids of the pharaohs
of the 4, 5 and 6 Egyptian dynasties exists. These alignments governed from the
very beginning the planning of the funerary monuments of successive kings and,
in some cases, led to establish building sites in quite inconvenient locations
from the technical viewpoint. Explaining the topography of these monuments
means therefore also investigating on their symbolic motivations: religion,
power, dynastic lineage and social context, as well as getting insights on the
skills of the ancient architects in astronomy and geometry. In the present
paper we focus on the relationships between the Old Kingdom pyramids at
Saqqara.
