Application of Micromegas for sampling calorimetry puts specific constraints
on the design and performance of this gaseous detector. In particular, uniform
and linear response, low noise and stability against high ionisation density
deposits are prerequisites to achieving good energy resolution. A
Micromegas-based hadronic calorimeter was proposed for an application at a
future linear collider experiment and three technologically advanced prototypes
of 1$\times$1 m$^{2}$ were constructed. Their merits relative to the
above-mentioned criteria are discussed on the basis of measurements performed
at the CERN SPS test-beam facility.
