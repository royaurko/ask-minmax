The relation between event horizons and trapping horizons is investigated in
a number of different situations with emphasis on their role in thermodynamics.
A notion of constant change is introduced that in certain situations allows the
location of the event horizon to be found locally. When the black hole is
accreting matter the difference in area between the two different horizons can
be many orders of magnitude larger than the Planck area. When the black hole is
evaporating the difference is small on the Planck scale. A model is introduced
that shows how trapping horizons can be expected to appear outside the event
horizon before the black hole starts to evaporate. Finally a modified
definition is introduced to invariantly define the location of the trapping
horizon under a conformal transformation. In this case the trapping horizon is
not always a marginally outer trapped surface.
