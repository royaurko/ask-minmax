We study a thick and Z_2 symmetric braneworld model with a non-minimally
coupled bulk scalar. Several analytic solutions are found. There are two
categories of the brane configuration: standard branes and deformed ones. The
former is just the same with the solutions in general relativity, whereas the
latter has negative effective energy densities in the location of the branes.
The question of stability under metric tensor perturbation is also
investigated, and there is no tachyon. We show that the gravity zero mode
(namely the 4D massless graviton) is the only one state that can be localized
on the branes. So Newtonian potential can be recovered in 4D space-time.
