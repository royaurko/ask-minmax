We study the gravitational lensing of high-redshift sources in a LCDM
universe. We have performed a series of ray-tracing experiments, and selected a
subsample of cases of strong lensing (multiple images, arcs, and Einstein
rings). For each case, we identify a massive galaxy that is primarily
responsible for lensing, and studied how the various density inhomogeneities
along the line of sight (other galaxies, background matter) affect the
properties of the image. The matter located near the lensing galaxy, and
physically associated with it, has a small effect. The background matter
increases the magnification by a few percents at most, while nearby galaxies
can increase it by up to about 10 percent. The effect on the image separation
is even smaller. The only significant effect results from the random alignment
of physically unassociated galaxies, which can increase the magnification by
factors of several, create additional images, and turn arcs into rings. We
conclude that the effect of environment on strong lensing in negligible in
general, and might be important only in rare cases. We show that our conclusion
does not depend on the radial density profile of the galaxies responsible for
lensing.
