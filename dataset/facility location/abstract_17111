HIZOA J0836-43is one of the most HI-massive galaxies in the local (z<0.1)
Universe. Not only are such galaxies extremely rare, but this "coelacanth"
galaxy exhibits characteristics -- in particular its active, inside-out stellar
disk-building -- that appear more typical of past (z ~ 1) star formation, when
large gas fractions were more common. Unlike most local giant HI galaxies, it
is actively star forming. Moreover, the strong infrared emission is not induced
by a merger event or AGN, as is commonly found in other local LIRGs. The galaxy
is suggestive of a scaled-up version of local spiral galaxies; its extended
star formation activity likely being fueled by its large gas reservoir and, as
such, can aid our understanding of star formation in systems expected to
dominate at higher redshifts. The multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic
observations that have led to these deductions will be presented. These include
NIR (J H K) and MIR (Spitzer; 3-24micron) imaging and photometry, MIR
spectroscopy, ATCA HI-interferometry and Mopra CO line emission observations.
But no optical data, as the galaxy is heavily obscured due to its location in
Vela behind the Milky Way.
