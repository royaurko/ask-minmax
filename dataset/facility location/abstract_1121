Within the Standard Model, starting with the most general mass matrices we
have used the facility of making weak basis transformations and have imposed
the condition of `naturalness' to carry out their analysis within the texture
zero approach. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that a particular set of
texture 4 zero quark mass matrices can be considered to be a unique viable
option for the description of quark mixing data.
