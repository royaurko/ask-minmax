We report an observation of a partially erupting prominence and associated
dynamical plasma processes based on observations recorded by the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The
prominence first goes through a slow rise (SR) phase followed by a fast rise
(FR). The slow rise phase started after a couple of small brightenings seen
toward the footpoints. At the turning point from SR to FR, the prominence had
already become kinked. The prominence shows strong brightening at the central
kink location during the start of FR. We interpret this as internal magnetic
reconnection occurring at a vertical current sheet forming between the two legs
of the erupting prominence (flux-rope). The brightening at the central kink
location is seen in all the EUV channels of AIA. The contributions of
differential emission at higher temperatures are larger compared to that for
typical coronal temperatures supporting a reconnection scenario at the central
kink location. The plasma above the brightening location gets ejected as a hot
plasmoid-like structure embedded in a CME, and those below drain down in the
form of blobs moving towards the Sun's surface. The unique time resolution of
the AIA has allowed all of these eruptive aspects, including SR-to-FR, kinking,
central current sheet formation, plasmoid-like eruption, and filament
"splitting", to be observed in a single event, providing strong and
comprehensive evidence in favour of the model of partially erupting flux ropes.
