The incidence of cementation processes on the acoustical properties of sands
is studied via molecular dynamics simulation techniques. In our simulations, we
consider samples with different degrees of compaction and cementing materials
with distinct elastic properties. The microstructure of cemented sands is taken
into account while adding cement at specific locations within the pores, such
as grain-to-grain contacts. Results show that acoustical properties of cemented
sands are strongly dependent on the amount of cement, its relative stiffness
with respect to the hosting medium, and its location within pores. Simulation
results are in good correspondence available experimental data and compare
favourably with some theoretical predictions for the sound velocity within a
range of cement saturation, porosity and confining pressure.
