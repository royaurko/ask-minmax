The VLT Survey Telescope (VST) is a 2.6m aperture, wide field, UV to I
facility, to be installed at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) on the
Cerro Paranal Chile. VST was primarily intended to complement the observing
capabilities of VLT with wide-angle imaging for detecting and
pre-characterising sources for further observations with the VLT.
