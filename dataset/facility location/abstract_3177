Background:The design of new nuclear reactors and transmutation devices
requires to reduce the present neutron cross section uncertainties of minor
actinides. Purpose: Reduce the $^{243}$Am(n,$\gamma$) cross section
uncertainty. Method: The $^{243}$Am(n,$\gamma$) cross section has been measured
at the n_TOF facility at CERN with a BaF$_{2}$ Total Absorption Calorimeter, in
the energy range between 0.7 eV and 2.5 keV. Results: The
$^{243}$Am(n,$\gamma$) cross section has been successfully measured in the
mentioned energy range. The resolved resonance region has been extended from
250 eV up to 400 eV. In the unresolved resonance region our results are
compatible with one of the two incompatible capture data sets available below
2.5 keV. The data available in EXFOR and in the literature has been used to
perform a simple analysis above 2.5 keV. Conclusions: The results of this
measurement contribute to reduce the $^{243}$Am(n,$\gamma$) cross section
uncertainty and suggest that this cross section is underestimated up to 25% in
the neutron energy range between 50 eV and a few keV in the present evaluated
data libraries.
