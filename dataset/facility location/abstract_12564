We compute the quark number susceptibilities in two flavor QCD for staggered
fermions by adding the chemical potential as a Lagrange multiplier for the
point-split number density term. Since lesser number of quark propagators are
required at any order, this method leads to faster computations. We propose a
subtraction procedure to remove the inherent undesired lattice terms and check
that it works well by comparing our results with the existing ones where the
elimination of these terms is analytically guaranteed. We also show that the
ratios of susceptibilities are robust, opening a door for better estimates of
location of the QCD critical point through the computation of the tenth and
twelfth order baryon number susceptibilities without significant additional
computational overload.
