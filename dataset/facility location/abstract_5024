This paper deals with monic orthogonal polynomial sequences (MOPS in short)
generated by a Geronimus canonical spectral transformation of a positive Borel
measure $\mu$, i.e., \begin{equation*} \frac{1}{(x-c)}d\mu (x)+N\delta (x-c),
\end{equation*} for some free parameter $N \in \mathbb{R}_{+}$ and shift $c$.
We analyze the behavior of the corresponding MOPS. In particular, we obtain
such a behavior when the mass $N$ tends to infinity as well as we characterize
the precise values of $N$ such the smallest (respectively, the largest) zero of
these MOPS is located outside the support of the original measure $\mu$. When
$\mu$ is semi-classical, we obtain the ladder operators and the second order
linear differential equation satisfied by the Geronimus perturbed MOPS, and we
also give an electrostatic interpretation of the zero distribution in terms of
a logarithmic potential interaction under the action of an external field. We
analyze such an equilibrium problem when the mass point of the perturbation $c$
is located outside of the support of $\mu$.
