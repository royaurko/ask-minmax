We consider the impact of oscillations on 1-200 TeV neutrinos expected from
RX J1713.7-3946. After a description of the nature of the source, we obtain a
prediction for the neutrino fluxes, based on the intense gamma ray flux first
seen by CANGAROO and recently measured by H.E.S.S. experiment. We study the
effect of 3 flavor oscillations in detail and consider the impact on the muon
flux induced by these high energy neutrinos, potentially observable by a
neutrino telescope located in the Northern hemisphere. A detector in the
Mediterranean with an effective area of 1 km^2 and unit detection efficiency
should be able to see a signal of about 10 muons per year.
