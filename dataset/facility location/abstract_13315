Recently it has been suggested that dark radiation in the form of axions
produced during the decay of string theory moduli fields could be responsible
for the soft x-ray excess in galaxy clusters. These soft X-ray photons come
about due to the conversion of these axions into photons in the magnetic fields
of the clusters. In this work we calculate the conversion of axionic dark
radiation into X-ray photons in the magnetic field of our own Galaxy. We
consider Delta N ~ 0.5 worth of dark radiation made up of axions with energy of
order 0.1-1 keV. We show that it is possible, if a little optimistic, to
explain the large regions of X-ray emission located above and below the centre
of the Galactic plane detected in the 3/4 keV ROSAT all sky map completely due
to the conversion of dark radiation into photons with an inverse axion-photon
coupling of M ~ 3e13 GeV and an axion mass of m < 1e-12 eV. Different parameter
values could explain both these features and the 3/4 keV X-ray background. More
conservatively, these X-ray observations are a good way to constrain such
models of axionic dark radiation.
