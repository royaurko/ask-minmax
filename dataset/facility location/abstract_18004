A new vision in multidimensional statistics is proposed impacting several
areas of application. In these applications, a set of noisy measurements
characterizing the repeatable response of a process is known as a realization
and can be seen as a single point in $\mathbb{R}^N$. The projections of this
point on the N axes correspond to the N measurements. The contemporary vision
of a diffuse cloud of realizations distributed in $\mathbb{R}^N$ is replaced by
a cloud in the shape of a shell surrounding a topological manifold. This
manifold corresponds to the process's stabilized-response domain observed
without the measurement noise. The measurement noise, which accumulates over
several dimensions, distances each realization from the manifold. The
probability density function (PDF) of the realization-to-manifold distance
creates the shell. Considering the central limit theorem as the number of
dimensions increases, the PDF tends toward the normal distribution N(
$\mu$,$\sigma$^2) where $\mu$ fixes the center shell location and $\sigma$
fixes the shell thickness. In vision, the likelihood of a realization is a
function of the realization-to-shell distance rather than the
realization-to-manifold distance. The demonstration begins with the work of
Claude Shannon followed by the introduction of the shell manifold and ends with
practical applications to monitoring equipment.
