We demonstrate that there is an inherent symmetry in the way high-overtone
stellar pulsations sample the core and the envelope, which can potentially lead
to an ambiguity in the asteroseismologically derived locations of internal
structures. We provide an intuitive example of the source of this symmetry by
analogy with a vibrating string. For the stellar case, we focus on the white
dwarf stars, establishing the practical consequences for high-order white dwarf
pulsations both analytically and numerically. In addition, we verify the effect
empirically by cross-fitting two different structural models, and we discuss
the consequences that this approximate symmetry may have for past and present
asteroseismological fits of the pulsating DBV, GD 358. Finally, we show how the
signatures of composition transition zones that are brought about by physically
distinct processes may be used to help alleviate this potential ambiguity in
our asteroseismological interpretation of the pulsation frequencies observed in
white dwarf stars.
