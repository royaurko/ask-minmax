At existing and planned neutrino factories (high energy and high intensity
neutrino beam facilities) precision studies of QCD in neutrino-nucleon
interactions are a realistic opportunity. We investigate charmonium production
in fixed target neutrino experiments. We find that $J/\psi$ production in
neutrino-nucleon collision is dominated by the color octet $^3S_1$ NRQCD matrix
element in a neutral current process, which is not accessible in photo or
leptoproduction. Neutrino experiments at a future Muon Collider will acquire
sufficient event rate to accurately measure color octet matrix element
contributions. The currently running high energy neutrino experiments, NOMAD
and NuTeV could also observe several such events.
