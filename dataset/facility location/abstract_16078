Background: A partially random target selection method was developed to
design and produce affinity reagents (target) to any protein query. It is based
on the recent concept of Proteomic Code (for review see Biro, 2007 [1]) which
suggests that significant number of amino acids in specifically interacting
proteins are coded by partially complementary codons. It means that the 1st and
3rd residues of codons coding many co-locating amino acids are complementary
but the 2nd may but not necessarily complementary: like 5'-AXG-3'/3'-CXT-5'
codon pair, where X is any nucleotide.
  Results: A mixture of 45 residue long, reverse, partially complementary
oligonucleotide sequences (target pool) were synthesized to selected epitopes
of query mRNA sequences. The 2nd codon residues were randomized. The target
oligonucleotide pool was inserted into vectors, expressed and the protein
products were screened for affinity to the query in Bacterial Two-Hybrid
System. The best clones were used for larger-scale protein syntheses and
characterization. It was possible to design and produce specific and with high
affinity reacting (Kd:100 nM) oligopeptide reagents to GAL4 query
oligopeptides.
  Conclusions: Second codon residue randomization is a promising method to
design and produce affinity peptides to any protein sequences. The method has
the potential to be a rapid, inexpensive, high throughput, non-immunoglobulin
based alternative to recent in vivo antibody generating procedures.
