Medicines exist for combating illnesses and drug stores provide an outlet for
consumers to gain access to these drugs. However, due to various factors such
as cost of production, accessibility and legal issues as well as distribution
factors, availability of these drugs at any location cannot be guaranteed at
all times. There is need for individuals and organizations such as hospitals to
be able to locate required drugs within given geographical vicinity. This is of
immense importance especially during emergencies, travel, and in cases where
the drugs are uncommon. This research work is aimed at solving this problem by
designing a system that integrates all drugstores. The integration of the drug
stores will be based on SOA concepts with web services via a central service
bus. The database systems of the drug stores will be integrated via a service
bus such that drugs can easily be searched for and the results will be
displayed based on its availability. Drugs can easily be searched for within
geographically distributed pharmaceutical databases as well as consumption of
drugs with relation to geographical locations can easily be monitored and
tracked. This will make it easy for health institutions to research on drug
consumption patterns across geographical areas and also control their usage.
