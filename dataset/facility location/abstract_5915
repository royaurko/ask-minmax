The quasiparticle decays due to electron-electron interaction in silicon are
studied by means of first-principles all-electron GW approximation. The
spectral function as well as the dominant relaxation mechanisms giving rise to
the finite life time of quasiparticles are analyzed. It is then shown that
these life times and quasiparticle energies can be used to compute the complex
dielectric function including many-body effects without resorting to empirical
broadening to mimic the decay of excited states. This method is applied for the
computation of the electron energy loss spectrum of silicon. The location and
line shape of the plasmon peak are discussed in detail.
