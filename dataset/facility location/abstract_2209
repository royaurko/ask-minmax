We have studied the one meson radiative tau decays: tau- -> nu(tau) pi-(K-)
gamma, computing the structure dependent contributions within a Lagrangian
approach based on the large-N(C) limit of QCD that ensures the proper
low-energy limit dictated by chiral symmetry. Upon imposing the short-distance
QCD constraints to the form-factors we are able to predict without any free
parameter the structure dependent radiation and, therefore, the relevant
observables for the decay tau- -> nu(tau) pi- gamma: the photon energy
spectrum, the invariant mass spectrum of the meson-photon system and the
integrated decay rate. We also discuss the remaining uncertainties in these
observables for the tau- -> nu(tau) K- gamma decay. According to our results,
the present facilities could detect these rare decays for the first time in the
near future allowing for a stringent test of our predictions.
