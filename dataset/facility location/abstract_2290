The Muon ATLAS Micromegas Activity (MAMMA) focuses on the development and
testing of large-area muon detectors based on the bulk-Micromegas technology.
These detectors are candidates for the upgrade of the ATLAS Muon System in view
of the luminosity upgrade of Large Hadron Collider at CERN (sLHC). They will
combine trigger and precision measurement capability in a single device. A
novel protection scheme using resistive strips above the readout electrode has
been developed. The response and sparking properties of resistive Micromegas
detectors were successfully tested in a mixed (neutron and gamma) high
radiation field supplied by the Tandem accelerator, at the N.C.S.R. Demokritos
in Athens. Monte-Carlo studies have been employed to study the effect of 5.5
MeV neutrons impinging on Micromegas detectors. The response of the Micromegas
detectors on the photons originating from the inevitable neutron inelastic
scattering on the surrounding materials of the experimental facility was also
studied.
