Detection of geometric features in digital images is an important exercise in
image analysis and computer vision. The Hough Transform techniques for
detection of circles require a huge memory space for data processing hence
requiring a lot of time in computing the locations of the data space, writing
to and searching through the memory space. In this paper we propose a novel and
efficient scheme for detecting circles in edge-detected grayscale digital
images. We use Ant-system algorithm for this purpose which has not yet found
much application in this field. The main feature of this scheme is that it can
detect both intersecting as well as non-intersecting circles with a time
efficiency that makes it useful in real time applications. We build up an ant
system of new type which finds out closed loops in the image and then tests
them for circles.
