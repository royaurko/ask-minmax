Our Galactic Center hosts over 10% of the known massive stars in the Galaxy.
The majority of these stars are located in three particularly massive clusters
that formed within the past 5 Myr. While these clusters are extraordinary,
their formation repesents about half of the total inferred star formation rate
in the Galactic Center. There is mounting evidence that the clusters are just
present-day examples of the hundreds of such similar clusters that must have
been created in the past, and whose stars now comprise the bulk of all stars
seen in the region. I discuss the massive stellar content in the Galactic
Center and present a new analysis that suggests that effects of continuous star
formation in the Galactic Center can be seen in the observed luminosity
functions newly-obtained HST/NICMOS and Gemini AO data.
