The giant radio galaxy M 87 is located at a distance of 16.7 Mpc and harbors
a super-massive black hole (6 billion solar masses) in its center. M 87 is one
of just three radio galaxies known to emit TeV gamma-rays. The structure of its
relativistic plasma jet, which is not pointing towards our line of sight, is
spatially resolved in X-ray (Chandra), optical and radio (VLA/VLBA)
observations. The mechanism and location of the TeV emitting region is one of
the least understood aspects of AGN. In spring 2008 and 2010, the three TeV
observatories VERITAS, MAGIC and H.E.S.S. detected two major TeV flares in
coordinated observations. Simultaneous high-resolution observations at other
wavelengths - radio (2008) and X-rays (2008/2010) - gave evidence that one of
the TeV flares was related to an event in the core region; however, no
common/repeated patterns could be identified so far. VERITAS continued to
monitor M 87 in 2011/2012. The results of these observations are presented.
