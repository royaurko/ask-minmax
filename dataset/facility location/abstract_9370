The DARWIN mission is an Infrared free flying interferometer mission based on
the new technique of nulling interferometry. Its main objective is to detect
and characterize other Earth-like planets, analyze the composition of their
atmospheres and their capability to sustain life, as we know it. DARWIN is
currently in definition phase. This PhD work that has been undertaken within
the DARWIN team at the European Space Agency (ESA) addresses two crucial
aspects of the mission. Firstly, a DARWIN target star list has been established
that includes characteristics of the target star sample that will be critical
for final mission design, such as, luminosity, distance, spectral
classification, stellar variability, multiplicity, location and radius of the
star. Constrains were applied as set by planet evolution theory and mission
architecture. Secondly, a number of alternative mission architectures have been
evaluated on the basis of interferometer response as a function of wavelength,
achievable modulation efficiency, number of telescopes and starlight rejection
capabilities. The study has shown that the core mission goals should be
achievable with a lower level of complexity as compared to the current baseline
configuration.
