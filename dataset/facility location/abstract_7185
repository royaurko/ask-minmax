We present the detection of He II sources in the Im galaxy NGC 1569 from HST
WFPC2 imagery. Out of the fifteen detections, seven were Wolf-Rayet stars, five
were stellar clusters with associated He II emission, and three were sources of
unknown origin. The detected Wolf-Rayet stars' colors and magnitudes are
similar to Large Magellanic Cloud late-type WN stars. The physical origin of
the other He II sources are discussed. We conclude that the equivalent of
51+/-19 WNL stars have been detected in NGC 1569, and we have estimated the
total Wolf-Rayet population in NGC 1569 as 78+/-51. These numbers are compared
with the Wolf-Rayet stellar populations in the SMC, LMC, Milky Way, and other
starburst galaxies relative to their luminosities, dynamical masses, and
ionized gas masses. Previous to this study, Wolf-Rayet stars in NGC 1569 were
not detected using ground-based imagery, but were only indicated through
longslit spectroscopy. This is the first time the exact locations of the
Wolf-Rayet stars in this nearby, well-studied, "post-starburst" galaxy have
been determined.
