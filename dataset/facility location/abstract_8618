The supernova remnant N157B (30 Dor B, SNR 0539-69.1, NGC 2060), located in
the Tarantula Nebula of the Large Magellanic Cloud, has long been considered a
possible Crab-like remnant. This hypothesis has been confirmed, quite
spectacularly, with the discovery of PSR J0537-6910, the remarkable 16 ms X-ray
pulsar in N157B. PSR J0537-6910 is the most rapidly spinning pulsar found to be
associated with a supernova remnant. Here we report our discovery and summarize
the properties of this pulsar and its supernova remnant.
