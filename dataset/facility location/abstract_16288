The Berlin Exoplanet Search Telescope II (BEST II) is a small wide
field-of-view photometric survey telescope system located at the Observatorio
Cerro Armazones, Chile. The high duty cycle combined with excellent observing
conditions and millimagnitude photometric precision makes this instrument
suitable for ground based support observations for the CoRoT space mission.
Photometric data of the CoRoT LRa02 target field collected between November
2008 and March 2009 were analysed for stellar variability. The presented
results will help in the future analysis of the CoRoT data, particularly in
additional science programs related to variable stars. BEST II observes
selected CoRoT target fields ahead of the space mission. The photometric data
acquired are searched for stellar variability, periodic variable stars are
identified with time series analysis of the obtained stellar light curves. We
obtained the light curves of 104335 stars in the CoRoT LRa02 field over 41
nights. Variability was detected in light curves of 3726 stars of which 350
showed a regular period. These stars are, with the exception of 5 previously
known variable stars, new discoveries.
