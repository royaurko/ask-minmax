The technical design of the PANDA experiment at the future FAIR facility next
to GSI is progressing. At the proposed anti-proton storage ring the
spectroscopy of double Lambda hypernuclei is one of the four main topics which
will be addressed by the Collaboration. The hypernuclear experiments require
(i) a dedicated internal target, (ii) an active secondary target of alternating
silicon and absorber material layers, (iii) high purity germanium (HPGe)
detectors, and (iv) a good particle identification system for low momentum
kaons. All systems need to operate in the presence of a high magnetic field and
a large hadronic background. The status of the detector developments for this
programme is summarized.
