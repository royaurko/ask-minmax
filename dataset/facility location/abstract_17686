The spectral structure underlying excitonic energy transfer in ultra-cold
Rydberg gases is studied numerically, in the framework of random matrix theory,
and via self-consistent diagrammatic techniques. Rydberg gases are made up of
randomly distributed, highly polarizable atoms that interact via strong dipolar
forces. Dynamics in such a system is fundamentally different from cases in
which the interactions are of short range, and is ultimately determined by the
spectral and eigenvector structure. In the energy levels' spacing statistics,
we find evidence for a critical energy that separates delocalized eigenstates
from states that are localized at pairs or clusters of atoms separated by less
than the typical nearest-neighbor distance. We argue that the dipole blockade
effect in Rydberg gases can be leveraged to manipulate this transition across a
wide range: As the blockade radius increases, the relative weight of localized
states is reduced. At the same time, the spectral statistics -- in particular,
the density of states and the nearest neighbor level spacing statistics --
exhibits a transition from approximately a 1-stable L\'evy to a Gaussian
orthogonal ensemble. Deviations from random matrix statistics are shown to stem
from correlations between interatomic interaction strengths that lead to an
asymmetry of the spectral density and profoundly affect localization
properties. We discuss approximations to the self-consistent Matsubara-Toyozawa
locator expansion that incorporate these effects.
