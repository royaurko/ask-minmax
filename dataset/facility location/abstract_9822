A new type of noised induced phase transitions is proposed. It occurs in
noisy systems with dynamical traps. Dynamical traps are regions in the phase
space where the regular forces are depressed substantially. By way of an
example, a simple oscillatory system {x,v} with additive white noise is
considered and its dynamics is analyzed numerically. The dynamical trap region
is assumed to be located near the x-axis where the velocity v of the system
becomes sufficiently low. The meaning of this assumption is discussed. The
observed phase transition is caused by the asymmetry in the residence time
distribution in the vicinity of zero value velocity. This asymmetry is due to a
cooperative effect of the random Langevin force in the trap region and the
regular force not changing the direction of action when crossing the trap
region.
