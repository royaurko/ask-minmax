Loki Patera is the most powerful volcano in the solar system. We have
obtained measurements of Loki's 3.5 micron brightness from NASA's Infrared
Telescope Facility (IRTF) and have witnessed a change from the periodic
behavior previously noted. While Loki brightened by a factor of several every
540 days prior to 2001, from 2001 through 2004 Loki remained at a constant,
medium brightness. We have constructed a quantitative model of Loki as a
basaltic lava lake whose solidified crust overturns when it becomes buoyantly
unstable. By altering the speed at which the overturn propagates across the
patera, we can match our groundbased brightness data. In addition, we can match
other data taken at other times and wavelengths. By slowing the propagation
speed dramatically, we can match the observations from 2001-2004. This slowing
may be due to a small change in volatile content in the magma.
