A semi-classical Monte Carlo model for studying three-dimensional carrier
dynamics in photoconductive switches is presented. The model was used to
simulate the process of photoexcitation in GaAs-based photoconductive antennas
illuminated with pulses typical of mode-locked Ti:Sapphire lasers. We analyzed
the power and frequency bandwidth of THz radiation emitted from these devices
as a function of bias voltage, pump pulse duration and pump pulse location. We
show that the mechanisms limiting the THz power emitted from photoconductive
switches fall into two regimes: when illuminated with short duration (<40 fs)
laser pulses the energy distribution of the Gaussian pulses constrains the
emitted power, while for long (>40 fs) pulses, screening is the primary
power-limiting mechanism. A discussion of the dynamics of bias field screening
in the gap region is presented. The emitted terahertz power was found to be
enhanced when the exciting laser pulse was in close proximity to the anode of
the photoconductive emitter, in agreement with experimental results. We show
that this enhancement arises from the electric field distribution within the
emitter combined with a difference in the mobilities of electrons and holes.
