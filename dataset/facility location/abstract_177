We analyze a set of full Stokes profile observations of the flaring active
region NOAA 10808 recorded with the Vector-Spectromagnetograph (VSM) of the
SOLIS facility. We aim to quantify transient and permanent changes in the
magnetic field and velocity field. The results are put in context with MDI
magnetograms and reconstructed RHESSI X-ray images. We find signs of
restructuring of the photospheric magnetic field during the flare close to the
polarity inversion line (PIL) at the flaring site. At two locations in the
umbra we encounter strong fields (approx. 3 kG), as inferred from the Stokes I
profiles which, however, exhibit a low polarization signal. During the flare we
observe in addition asymmetric Stokes V profiles at one of these sites. The
asymmetric Stokes V profiles appear co-spatial and co-temporal with a strong
apparent polarity reversal observed in MDI-magnetograms and a chromospheric
hard X-ray source. The two-component atmosphere fits of the asymmetric Stokes
profiles result in line-of-sight velocity differences in the range of approx.
12km/s to 14 km/s between the two components in the photosphere. Another
possibility is that local atmospheric heating is causing the observed
asymmetric Stokes V profile shape. In either case our analysis shows that a
very localized patch of approx. 5 arcsec in the photospheric umbra, co-spatial
with a flare footpoint, exhibits a sub-resolution fine structure.
