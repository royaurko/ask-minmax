In preparation for the planned linear collider TESLA, DESY is designing the
required buildings and facilities. The accelerator and infrastructure
components have to be allocated to buildings, and their required areas for
installation, operation and maintenance have to be determined.
Interdisciplinary working groups specify the project from different viewpoints
and need to develop a common vision as a precondition for an optimal solution.
A commercial requirements database is used as a collaborative tool, enabling
concurrent requirements specification by independent working groups. The
requirements database ensures long term storage and availability of the
emerging knowledge, and it offers a central platform for communication which is
available for all project members. It is successfully operating since summer
2002 and has since then become an important tool for the design team.
