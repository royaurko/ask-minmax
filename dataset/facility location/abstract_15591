This paper is part of a broader study whose main goal is the study of the
finite-energy spectral properties of the non-perturbative one-dimensional (1D)
Hubbard model and the evaluation of finite-energy correlation-function
expressions. Here we study the deviations from the ground state values of
double occupancy which result from creation or annihilation of holons, spinons,
and pseudoparticles. The band-momentum dependence of the obtained
double-occupancy spectra provides important information on the degree of
localization/delocalization of the real-space lattice electron site
distribution configurations associated with the pseudoparticles. We also study
the band-momentum, on-site electronic repulsion, and electronic density
dependence of the pseudoparticle energy bands. The shape of these bands plays
an important role in the finite-energy spectral properties of the model. Such a
shape defines the form of the lines in the momentum-energy/frequency plane
where the peaks and edges of the one-electron and two-electron spectral weight
of physical operators are located. Our findings are useful for the study of the
one-electron and two-electron spectral weight distribution of physical
operators.
