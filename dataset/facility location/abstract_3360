We describe the plans and objectives of the CEDAR project (Combined e-Science
Data Analysis Resource for High Energy Physics) newly funded by the PPARC
e-Science programme in the UK. CEDAR will combine the strengths of the well
established and widely used HEPDATA database of HEP data and the innovative
JetWeb data/Monte Carlo comparison facility, built on the HZTOOL package, and
will exploit developing grid technology. The current status and future plans of
both of these individual sub-projects within the CEDAR framework are described,
showing how they will cohesively provide (a) an extensive archive of Reaction
Data, (b) validation and tuning of Monte Carlo programs against these reaction
data sets, and (c) a validated code repository for a wide range of HEP code
such as parton distribution functions and other calculation codes used by
particle physicists. Once established it is envisaged CEDAR will become an
important Grid tool used by LHC experimentalists in their analyses and may well
serve as a model in other branches of science where there is a need to compare
data and complex simulations.
