We study the problem of finding a point of maximal electrostatic potential
inside an arbitrary triangle with homogeneous surface charge distribution. In
this article we show that such point is indeed unique and we derive several
synthetic and analytic relations for its location in the plane. Moreover, this
point satisfies the definition of a triangle center, different from any of 5622
currently known centers from Clark Kimberling's encyclopedia. Writing style is
slightly informal as the paper is targeted to a wide audience.
