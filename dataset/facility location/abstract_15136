We have studied the properties of an infrared cluster embedded in the gas and
dust of the southern part of the Carina Nebula (NGC 3372), where the probable
existence of current star formation has already been predicted. We used
mid-infrared (A & C bands) and near-infrared (J H K$_{\rm s}$) images from the
MSX and the 2MASS surveys respectively, combined with an optical H$_\alpha$
narrow-band filter image obtained at the CTIO. The infrared star cluster has at
least 17 members, and its parameters, radius and stellar density are in very
good agreement with high- to intermediate-mass star formation scenarios. The
detected IR sources have roughly the same intrinsic infrared excess determined
from their position in colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams, suggesting
that these objects could be related to pre-main sequence stars of high to
intermediate mass. Furthermore, we present a low-dispersion spectrum of LS 1883
(O9.5 V) star located near the centre of the IR cluster. The position of this
object in the colour-colour and colour-magnitude IR diagrams lies close to the
reddening vector of an ZAMS O9 V spectral type star, and it seems to be the
first star of this cluster to emerge. All these facts are consistent with the
current star-forming scenarios associated with highly embedded star clusters.
