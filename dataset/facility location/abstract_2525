We have developed an angle-resolved photoemission spectrometer with tunable
VUV laser as a photon source. The photon source is based on the fourth harmonic
generation of a near IR beam from a Ti:sapphire laser pumped by a CW green
laser and tunable between 5.3eV and 7eV. The most important part of the set-up
is a compact, vacuum enclosed fourth harmonic generator based on KBBF crystals,
grown hydrothermally in the US. This source can deliver a photon flux of over
10^14 photons/s. We demonstrate that this energy range is sufficient to measure
the kz dispersion in an iron arsenic high temperature superconductor, which was
previously only possible at synchrotron facilities.
