We propose a practical physical system for creation of a stationary
entanglement by dissipation without employing the environment engineering
techniques. The system proposed is composed of two perfectly distinguishable
atoms, through their significantly different transition frequencies, with only
one atom addressed by an external laser field. We show that the arrangement
would easily be realized in practice by trapping the atoms at the distance
equal to the quarter-wavelength of a standing-wave laser field and locating one
of the atoms at a node and the other at the successive antinode of the wave.
The undesirable dipole-dipole interaction between the atoms, that could be
large at this small distance, is adjusted to zero by a specific initial
preparation of the atoms or by a specific polarization of the atomic dipole
moments. Following this arrangement, we show that the dissipative relaxation
can create a stationary entanglement on demand by tuning the Rabi frequency of
the laser field to the difference between the atomic transition frequencies.
The laser field dresses the atom and we identify that the entangled state
occurs when the frequency of one of the Rabi sidebands of the driven atom tunes
to frequency of the undriven atom. It is also found that this system behaves as
a cascade open system where the fluorescence from the dressed atom drives the
other atom with no feedback.
