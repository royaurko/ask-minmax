By including Klein-Nishina effects, we generalize previous calculations of
the beaming pattern of photons produced by inverse Compton scattering. For an
isotropic distribution of soft photons upscattered by nonthermal electrons with
a power-law density distribution embedded in a plasma moving with relativistic
bulk speed we show that the observed radiation intensity is proportional to
D^(3+p), where D is the Doppler boosting factor, and p the electron
distribution index. This agrees with previous computations performed in the
Thomson limit, where the observed spectral index is a=(p-1)/2 and the beaming
pattern D^(4+2a). Independent of D, Klein-Nishina effects limit the location
of the peak energy of the observed spectral energy distribution such that
e_{peak} less than 1/e_0, where e_0 is the energy of the seed photons in units
of mc^2. Assuming that the seed photons originate in the broad line region, we
demonstrate that the GeV emission of blazars is significantly modified by
Klein-Nishina effects, the spectrum being softer than that calculated in the
Thomson limit. We further show that the change in spectral index of the inverse
Compton emission across the peak energy can exceed the value of 0.5 predicted
by computations performed in the Thomson limit. The model spectra agree with
OSSE and COMPTEL limits on this break without invoking the effects of
differential absorption at the edge of a gamma-ray photosphere.
