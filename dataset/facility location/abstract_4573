Recently in boson star models in framework of Brans-Dicke theory, three
possible definitions of mass have been identified, all identical in general
relativity, but different in scalar-tensor theories of gravity.It has been
conjectured that it's the tensor mass which peaks, as a function of the central
density, at the same location where the particle number takes its maximum.This
is a very important property which is crucial for stability analysis via
catastrophe theory. This conjecture has received some numerical support. Here
we give an analytical proof of the conjecture in framework of the generalized
scalar-tensor theory of gravity, confirming in this way the numerical
calculations.
