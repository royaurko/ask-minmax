The photoproduction of $\eta^{'}$-mesons from different nuclei has been
measured using the Crystal Barrel(CB)/TAPS detector system at the ELSA
accelerator facility in Bonn. Recent results on the in-medium properties of the
$\eta^{'}$-meson, derived from the transparency ratio measurements, are
presented. The absorption of the $\eta^{'}$-meson in nuclear matter is compared
to the properties of the other mesons ($\eta$ and $\omega$).
