High resolution (10 km/s) [N II] echelle spectra, sampled every 13 arcsec in
a 6 arcmin by 6 arcmin region around SN1987A were obtained on the CTIO 4m
telescope. The map shows a complicated velocity structure consistent with that
reported previously for the interstellar medium. Three components, heliocentric
velocity V_hel=265, 277 and 285 km/s are identified as N157C. The radius of
this large superbubble was found to expand at 10 km/s, with a lifetime of 6
million years and a total energy of 3x10^51 ergs determined from its radius and
velocity according to superbubble theory. The V_hel=235 km/s component
corresponds to the near side of 600 pc giant superbubble reported earlier. This
bubble is over 10 million years old, and has blown out of the LMC disk. Two
other components, V_hel=255 and 245 km/s are identified as the inner major
light echo ring (a double-shell structure) at about 130 pc in front of SN1987A.
There are also two high velocity components, 300 and 313 km/s, which are
possibly the far side of a superbubble in which SN1987A exploded. We also
notice that there are two components at 269 and 301 km/s within 20 arcsec of
SN1987A. These structures are probably due to the emission from the progenitor
star's red supergiant wind. We find that the time it took the SN1987A
progenitor to move to the current location 300 pc behind N157C is comparable to
the age of N157C as well as that of the progenitor itself.
