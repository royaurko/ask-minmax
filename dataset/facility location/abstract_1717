The Standard Model despite its well-known short comings is unlikely to yield
without offering stubborn resistance. There are compelling arguments that New
Physics lurks around the TeV scale. Continuing comprehensive studies of beauty,
$\tau$ and charm transitions can be instrumentalized to reveal it and shed
light on it. They are thus complementary to findings obtained at the LHC and
presumably essential in clarifying the true nature of that New Physics. A
Super-B facility seems to provide the cleanest environment for pursuing such an
ambitious program. I list desirable features of such a setup as well as
challenges for the accelerator and detector designs and for the theoretical
analysis.
