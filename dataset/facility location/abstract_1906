We present preliminary results of measurements of the quenching factor for Na
recoils in NaI(Tl) at room temperature, made at a dedicated neutron facility at
the University of Sheffield. Measurements have been performed with a 2.45 MeV
mono-energetic neutron generator in the energy range from 10 keV to 100 keV
nuclear recoil energy. A BC501A liquid scintillator detector was used to tag
neutrons. Cuts on pulse-shape discrimination from the BC501A liquid
scintillator detector and neutron time-of-flight were performed on pulses
recorded by a digitizer with a 2 ns sampling time. Measured quenching factors
range from 19% to 26%, in agreement with other experiments. From pulse-shape
analysis, a mean time of pulses from electron and nuclear recoils are compared
down to 2 keV electron equivalent energy.
