Isospin-mixing corrections for superallowed Fermi transitions in {\it
fp}-shell nuclei are computed within the framework of the shell model. The
study includes three nuclei that are part of the set of nine accurately
measured transitions as well as five cases that are expected to be measured in
the future at radioactive-beam facilities. We also include some new
calculations for $^{10}$C. With the isospin-mixing corrections applied to the
nine accurately measured $ft$ values, the conserved-vector-current hypothesis
and the unitarity condition of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix are
tested.
