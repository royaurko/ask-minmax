We consider two non-longitudinal Doppler Effect experiments. The first one
involves a stationary source of monochromatic light located at the origin O of
the K(XOY) inertial reference frame and an observer R who performs the
hyperbolic motion at a constant altitude. The second involves a stationary
observer located at the origin O and a monochromatic source of light that
performs the hyperbolic motion. In both cases we compare the relationship
between emission and reception times of the same light signal and the
relationship between the emission and the reception time intervals of two
successive light signals.
