We consider the asymmetric simple exclusion process in one dimension with
weak asymmetry (WASEP) and 0-1 step initial condition. Our interest are the
fluctuations of the time-integrated particle current at some prescribed spatial
location. One expects a crossover from Gaussian to Tracy-Widom distributed
fluctuations. The appropriate crossover scale is an asymmetry of order
$\epsilon^{-1/2}$, times of order $\epsilon^{-2}$, and a spatial location of
order $\epsilon^{-3/2}$. For this parameter window we obtain the limiting
distribution function of the integrated current in terms of an integral over
the difference of two Fredholm determinants. For large times, on the scale
$\epsilon^{-2}$, this distribution function converges to the one of
Tracy-Widom.
