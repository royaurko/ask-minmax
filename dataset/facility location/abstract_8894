The evidence for locating the High Velocity Clouds in the Local Group is
summarized and evaluated. Recent measurements of the H$\alpha$ surface
brightness and metallicity of a number of HVCs appear to be fatal to the
Galactic fountain as a significant contributor to the HVC phenomenon, but not
to the existence of the fountain itself. Observations of extragalactic
analogues to HVCs remain the {\it sine qua non} for deciding whether the Local
Group hypothesis is viable, but the constraints based on existing surveys
appear to be rather weak. MgII quasar absorption lines restrict how many HVC
analogues exist at intermediate redshift, depending on where these lines
originate. It is concluded that the evidence remains ambiguous, none of the
main hypotheses is fully consistent with all of the data, and the Local Group
hypothesis remains a viable explanation for the HVC phenomenon.
