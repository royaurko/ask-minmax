We report the discovery of a discrete hierarchy of micro-transitions
occurring in models of continuous and discontinuous percolation. The precursory
micro-transitions allow us to target almost deterministically the location of
the transition point to global connectivity. This extends to the class of
intrinsically stochastic processes the possibility to use warning signals
anticipating phase transitions in complex systems.
