The calibration of a model refers to the process by which one can estimate
some parameters by comparisons with observed data. Due to the dynamical nature
of the environment, variations between predicted and observed values occur.
Thus, the environmental parameters may vary due to random temperature changes,
time of discharge flow, time of the day, and other conditions. Such variations
can be minimized by identifying and optimizing some parameters of the transport
model, like the values of diffusion coefficients in x and y directions and the
kinetic parameter that describes the process of removing pollutants. This paper
presents results concerning the calibration of transport parameters for
two-dimensional problems of water quality (fecal coliform control) at Igap\'o I
Lake, located in Londrina, Paran\'a, Brazil. Thus, the
convection-diffusion-reaction equation, which describes mathematically the
process studied in this work, is resolved by a semidiscrete finite element
method (SUPG) which combines finite differences in time and finite elements in
space.
