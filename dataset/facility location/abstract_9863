We theoretically study the trapping time distribution and the efficiency of
the excitation energy transport in dendritic systems. Trapping of excitations,
created at the periphery of the dendrimer, on a trap located at its core, is
used as a probe of the efficiency of the energy transport across the dendrimer.
The transport process is treated as incoherent hopping of excitations between
nearest-neighbor dendrimer units and is described using a rate equation. We
account for radiative and non-radiative decay of the excitations while
diffusing across the dendrimer. We derive exact expressions for the Laplace
transform of the trapping time distribution and the efficiency of trapping and
analyze those for various realizations of the energy bias, number of dendrimer
generations, and relative rates for decay and hopping. We show that the
essential parameter that governs the trapping efficiency, is the product of the
on-site excitation decay rate and the trapping time (mean first passage time)
in the absence of decay.
