Understanding of star formation in the Universe is advancing through
submillimeter-wave observations of the Milky Way and other galaxies.
Technological constraints on such observations require a mixture of telescope
sizes and observational techniques. For some purposes, small submillimeter-wave
telescopes are more sensitive than large ones. The Antarctic Submillimeter
Telescope and Remote Observatory (AST/RO) is a small, wide-field instrument
located at an excellent observatory site. By observing the Milky Way and
Magellanic Clouds at arcminute resolution, it provides a context for
interpreting observations of distant galaxies made by large interferometric
telescopes. AST/RO also provides hands-on training in submillimeter technology
and allows testing of novel detector systems.
