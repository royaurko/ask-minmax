Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) models with updated physical inputs are
presented for selected assumptions about the chemical composition, covering the
ranges 0.6 < M/Mo < 1.2, 0.0001 < Z < 0.04, 0.23 < Y < 0.34.The HR diagram
location of the ZAMS as a function of Y and Z is discussed both in the
theoretical and in the observational HR diagrams, showing that the V magnitude
presents an increased dependence on Z to be taken into account when discussing
observational evidences. Analytical relations quantifying both these
dependences are derived. Implications for the galactic helium to heavier
elements enrichment are finally discussed.
