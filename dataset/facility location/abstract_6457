We present the catalog of 947 variable stars located in the field of view of
the Kepler satellite. The catalog is a result of the analysis of VI photometry
obtained during the first 17-month observations in the ASAS3-North station. The
variable stars we present are divided into eleven groups according to the
presented variability; the groups are briefly discussed. The catalog is
intended to be a source of information for target selection process and
follow-up programs.
