We report on experiments in which magnetically driven radiatively cooled
plasma jets were produced by a 1 MA, 250 ns current pulse on the MAGPIE pulsed
power facility. The jets were driven by the pressure of a toroidal magnetic
field in a ''magnetic tower'' jet configuration. This scenario is characterized
by the formation of a magnetically collimated plasma jet on the axis of a
magnetic ''bubble'', confined by the ambient medium. The use of a radial
metallic foil instead of the radial wire arrays employed in our previous work
allows for the generation of episodic magnetic tower outflows which emerge
periodically on timescales of ~30 ns. The subsequent magnetic bubbles propagate
with velocities reaching ~300 km/s and interact with previous eruptions leading
to the formation of shocks.
