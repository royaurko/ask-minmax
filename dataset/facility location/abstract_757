The Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND) at the Los Alamos Meson
Physics Facility sets bounds on neutrino oscillations in the appearance channel
nu_mu_bar --> nu_e_bar by searching for the signature of the reaction nu_e_bar
p --> e^+ n: an e$^+$ followed by a 2.2MeV gamma ray from neutron capture. Five
e^{+/-} -- gamma coincidences are observed in time with the LAMPF beam, with an
estimated background of 6.2 events. The 90\% confidence limits obtained are:
 Delta (m^2) < 0.07eV^2 for sin^2 (2theta) = 1, and sin^2(2theta) < 6 10^{-3}
for Delta (m^2) > 20 eV^2.
