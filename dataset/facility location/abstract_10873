The spatial scan statistic is widely used in epidemiology and medical studies
as a tool to identify hotspots of diseases. The classical spatial scan
statistic assumes the number of disease cases in different locations have
independent Poisson distributions, while in practice the data may exhibit
overdispersion and spatial correlation. In this work, we examine the behavior
of the spatial scan statistic when overdispersion and spatial correlation are
present, and propose a modified spatial scan statistic to account for that.
Some theoretical results are provided to demonstrate that ignoring the
overdispersion and spatial correlation leads to an increased rate of false
positives, which is verified through a simulation study. Simulation studies
also show that our modified procedure can substantially reduce the rate of
false alarms. Two data examples involving brain cancer cases in New Mexico and
chickenpox incidence data in France are used to illustrate the practical
relevance of the modified procedure.
