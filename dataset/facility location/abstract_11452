The structure of a single vortex in a FeAs superconductor is studied in the
framework of two formulations of superconductivity for the recently proposed
sign-reversed $s$ wave ($s^\pm$) scenario: {\it (i)} a continuum model taking
into account the existence of an electron and a hole band with a repulsive
local interaction between the two; {\it (ii)} a lattice tight-binding model
with two orbitals per unit cell and a next-nearest-neighbour attractive
interaction. In the first model, the local density of states (LDOS) at the
vortex centre, as a function of energy, exhibits a peak at the Fermi level,
while in the second model such LDOS peak is deviated from the Fermi level and
its energy depends on band filling. An impurity located outside the vortex core
has little effect on the LDOS peak, but an impurity close to the vortex core
can almost suppress it and modify its position.
