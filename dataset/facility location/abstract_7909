We report the results of a search for axions from the 14.4 keV M1 transition
from Fe-57 in the core of the sun using the axio-electric e?ect in TeO2
bolometers. The detectors are 5x5x5 cm3 crystals operated at about 10 mK in a
facility used to test bolometers for the CUORE experiment at the Laboratori
Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. An analysis of 43.65 kg d of data was made
using a newly developed low energy trigger which was optimized to reduce the
detectors energy threshold. An upper limit of 0.63 c kg-1 d-1 was established
at 95% C.L.. From this value, a lower bound at 95% C.L. was placed on the
Peccei-Quinn energy scale of fa >= 0.76 10**6 GeV for a value of S=0.55 for the
flavor-singlet axial vector matrix element. Bounds are given for the interval
0.15 < S < 0.55.
