Two possible options of polarized proton-antiproton collider at the future
HESR storage ring are considered. It is shown that the modifications of the
present HESR project which are needed to arrange for the polarized
proton-antiproton collisions are relatively moderate. An achievable luminosity
of 5x10^31 cm^-2 sec^-1 will provide a possibility to carry out experiments in
the CM energy range 10-30 GeV, a particularly interesting option for Drell-Yan
physics.
