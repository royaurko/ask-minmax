We examine the Markov properties of the three velocity components of a
turbulent flow generated by a DNS simulation of the flow around an airfoil
section. The spectral element code Nektar has been used to generate a well
resolved flow field around an fx79w-151a airfoil profile at a Reynolds number
of Re=5000 and an angle of attack of {\alpha} = 12{\deg}. Due to a homogeneous
geometry in the spanwise direction, a Fourier expansion has been used for the
third dimension of the simulation. In the wake of the profile the flow field
shows a von Karman street like behavior with the vortices decaying in the wake
which trigger a turbulent field. Time series of the 3D flow field were
extracted from the flow at different locations to analyze the stochastic
features. In particular the existence of Markov properties in the flow have
been shown for different cases in the surrounding of the airfoil. This is of
basic interest as it indicates that fine structures of turbulence can be
replaced by stochastic processes. Turbulent and Markovian scales are being
determined in the turbulent field and limits of standard Gaussian Langevin
processes are being determined by the reconstruction of a flow field in time
and space.
