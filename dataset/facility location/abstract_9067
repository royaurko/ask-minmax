Diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission is produced in interactions of cosmic
rays with gas and ambient photon fields and thus provides us with an indirect
measurement of cosmic rays in various locations in the Galaxy. The diffuse
gamma-ray continuum is more intense than expected both at energies below 200
keV and above 1 GeV. The existing models for the high-energy excess are
reviewed in the light of recent TeV gamma-ray measurements of both diffuse
emission and of discrete Galactic sources such as supernova remnants. I
specifically discuss whether particular classes of Galactic objects are
observable as EGRET gamma-ray sources, either by being found among the
unidentified EGRET sources or by contributing to the diffuse emission as
unresolved sources.
