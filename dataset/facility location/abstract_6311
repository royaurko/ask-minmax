It is shown, under the assumption of possibility to perform an arbitrary
local operation, that all nonlocal variables related to two or more separate
sites can be measured instantaneously, except for a finite time required for
bringing to one location the classical records from these sites which yield the
result of the measurement. It is a verification measurement: it yields reliably
the eigenvalues of the nonlocal variables, but it does not prepare the
eigenstates of the system.
