The concentration-dependent switching of the non-equilibrium depletion
interaction between obstacles in a gas flow of interacting Brownian particles
is presented. It is shown that this switching is caused by the blockade effect
for the gas particles. The nonlinear blockade effect is considerable near the
obstacle surface or for closely located obstacles. Screening of the gas flow
ahead of the obstacles is accompanied by formation of a compact jammed region
ahead of them with a pronounced step-like behavior of the gas density
distribution. With gas concentration increasing, the density perturbation
around obstacle (obstacle wake) can change its direction to the opposite taking
an unusual form with an extended dense region ahead of the obstacle and a
depleted localized one behind it. This wake switching leads to the sign change
of the effective non-equilibrium interaction between the obstacles, e.g., from
effective attraction to repulsion. It is shown that far from the obstacles the
asymptotic behaviors of the obstacle wakes and the non-equilibrium depletion
forces have multipole character associated with an anisotropic screened
Coulomb-like potential with a preferable direction of the anisotropy. The
results are obtained within the lattice gas model in the mean-field
approximation. The asymptotic behavior is described within the long-wavelength
approximation.
