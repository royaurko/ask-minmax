In this work, we identify 63 bona fide new candidates to T Tauri stars (TTSs)
in the Taurus-Auriga region using as baseline its ultraviolet excess. The
initial data set has been defined from the GALEX all sky survey (AIS). The
GALEX satellite obtained images in the near ultraviolet (NUV) and far
ultraviolet (FUV) bands where the TTSs show a prominent excess, compared with
main sequence or giants stars. GALEX AIS surveyed the Taurus-Auriga molecular
complex, as well as, a fraction of the California Nebula and the Perseus
complex; bright sources and the dark clouds themselves are avoided.
  The properties of the TTSs in the ultraviolet (GALEX), optical (UCAC4) and
infrared (2MASS) have been defined using as qualification sample the TTSs
observed with the International Ultraviolet Explorer. The candidates have been
identified by means of a mixed ultraviolet-optical-infrared excess set of
colors; it is found that the color-color diagram FUV-NUV versus J-K is ideally
suited for this purpose. From an initial sample of 163,313 bona-fide NUV
sources, a final list with 63 new candidates to TTSs in the region has been
produced. The search procedure has been validated by its ability to detect all
known TTSs in the area surveyed: 31 TTSs.
  Also, it is shown that the weak-lined TTSs are located in a well defined
stripe in the FUV-NUV versus J-K diagram. Moreover, we provide in this work a
list of TTSs photometric standards for future GALEX-based studies of the young
stellar population in star forming regions.
