We demonstrate experimentally an optical system for under-sampling several
bandwidth limited signals with carrier frequencies that are not known apriori
that can be located anywhere within a very broad frequency region between 0-18
GHz. The system is based on under-sampling asynchronously at three different
sampling rates. The pulses required for the under-sampling are generated by a
combination of an electrical comb generator and an electro-absorption
modulator. To reduce loss and improve performance the implementation of the
optical system is based on a wavelength division multiplexing technique. An
accurate reconstruction of both the phase and the amplitude of the signals was
obtained when two chirped signals generated simultaneously were sampled.
