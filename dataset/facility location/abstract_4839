Two faint X-ray pulsars, AX J1749.2-2725 and AX J1749.1-2733, located in the
direction to the Galactic Center, were studied in detail using data of
INTEGRAL, XMM-Newton and Chandra observatories in X-rays, the SOFI/NTT
instrument in infrared and the RTT150 telescope in optics. X-ray positions of
both sources were determined with the uncertainty better than ~1 arcsec, that
allowed us to identify their infrared counterparts. From the subsequent
analysis of infrared and optical data we conclude that counterparts of both
pulsars are likely massive stars of B0-B3 classes located behind the Galactic
Center at distances of 12-20 kpc, depending on the type, probably in further
parts of galactic spiral arms. In addition, we investigated the extinction law
towards the galactic bulge and found that it is significantly different from
standard one.
