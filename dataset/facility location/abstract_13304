The spin-3/2 Blume-Emery-Griffiths model on a honeycomb lattice is studied by
Monte Carlo simulations with the goal to determine phase diagrams for a range
of the model parameters and to investigate the nature of the phase transitions
between the respective phases. For positive values of the biquadratic to
bilinear interaction ratio $\alpha$, we find two ferromagnetically ordered
phases, F1 and F2, with the sublattice magnetizations (1/2,1/2) and (3/2,3/2),
respectively, and our results confirm the discontinuous character of the
order-disorder critical line as a function of the single-ion anisotropy
strength, predicted by the effective-field theory (EFT). For negative values of
$\alpha$, there is another ferrimagnetic (FRM) phase of the type (1/2,3/2),
located between F1 and F2. However, the step-like variation of the
order-disorder critical frontier obtained from EFT for large negative $\alpha$
is not reproduced and thus deemed artifact of the EFT approximation.
Finite-size scaling analysis performed at various points between the respective
identified phases gave the ratio of critical exponents $\gamma/\nu$ consistent
with the 2D Ising universality class, except in the vicinity of the boundary
intersection, where the results deviated from the standard values beyond the
measurement errors.
