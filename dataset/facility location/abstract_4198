The amplitude of the roughness-induced energetic disorder at the
metal/organic interface is calculated. It was found that for moderately rough
electrodes, the correction to the electrostatic image potential at the charge
location is small. For this reason, roughness-induced energetic disorder cannot
noticeably affect charge carrier injection, contrary to the recent reports.
