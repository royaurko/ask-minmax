X-ray computed tomography (CT) has an indispensable role in constructing 3D
images of objects made from light materials. However, limited by absorption
coefficients, X-rays cannot deeply penetrate materials such as copper and lead.
Here we show via simulation that muon beams can provide high resolution
tomographic images of dense objects and of structures within the interior of
dense objects. The effects of resolution broadening from multiple scattering
diminish with increasing muon momentum. As the momentum of the muon increases,
the contrast of the image goes down and therefore requires higher resolution in
the muon spectrometer to resolve the image. The variance of the measured muon
momentum reaches a minimum and then increases with increasing muon momentum.
The impact of the increase in variance is to require a higher integrated muon
flux to reduce fluctuations. The flux requirements and level of contrast needed
for high resolution muon computed tomography are well matched to the muons
produced in the pion decay pipe at a neutrino beam facility and what can be
achieved for momentum resolution in a muon spectrometer. Such an imaging system
can be applied in archaeology, art history, engineering, material
identification and whenever there is a need to image inside a transportable
object constructed of dense materials.
