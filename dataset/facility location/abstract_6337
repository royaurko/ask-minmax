In the present paper, we investigate the high-order harmonic generation (HHG)
from diatomic molecules with large internuclear distance using a strong field
approximation (SFA) model. We find that the hump and dip structure emerges in
the plateau region of the harmonic spectrum, and the location of this striking
structure is sensitive to the laser intensity. Our model analysis reveals that
two-center interference as well as the interference between different
recombination electron trajectories are responsible for the unusual enhanced or
suppressed harmonic yield at a certain order, and these interference effects
are greatly influenced by the laser parameters such as intensity.
