We perform theoretical studies of stretching of 20 proteins with knots within
a coarse grained model. The knot's ends are found to jump to well defined
sequential locations that are associated with sharp turns whereas in
homopolymers they diffuse around and eventually slide off. The waiting times of
the jumps are increasingly stochastic as the temperature is raised. Larger
knots do not return to their native locations when a protein is released after
stretching.
