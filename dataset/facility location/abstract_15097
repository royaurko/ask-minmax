We present a study on the central stars (CSs) of Planetary Nebulae (PNe)
observed in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with the Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph instrument on-board the HST. The stellar magnitudes have been
measured using broad-band photometry, and Zanstra analysis of the nebulae
provided the stellar temperatures. From the location of the CSs on the HR
diagram, and by comparing the observed CSs with current models of stellar
evolution, we infer the CSs masses. We examine closely the possibility of light
contamination in the bandpass from an unrecognized stellar companion, and we
establish strong constraints on the existence and nature of any binary
companion. We find an average mass of 0.63 Msun, which is similar to the mass
obtained for a sample of CSs in the LMC (0.65 Msun). However, the SMC and LMC
CS mass distributions differ slightly, the SMC sample lacking an
intermediate-mass stellar population (0.65 to 0.75 Msun). We discuss the
significance and possible reasons for the difference between the two mass
distributions. In particular, we consider the differences in the star formation
history between the clouds and the mass-loss rate dependence on metallicity.
