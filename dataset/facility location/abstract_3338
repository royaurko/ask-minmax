We present the first direct experimental evidence for the charge excess in
high energy particle showers predicted nearly 40 years ago by Askaryan. We
directed bremsstrahlung photons from picosecond pulses of 28.5 GeV electrons at
the SLAC Final Focus Test Beam facility into a 3.5 ton silica sand target,
producing electromagnetic showers several meters long. A series of antennas
spanning 0.3 to 6 GHz were used to detect strong, sub-nanosecond radio
frequency pulses produced whenever a shower was present. The measured electric
field strengths are consistent with a completely coherent radiation process.
The pulses show 100% linear polarization, consistent with the expectations of
Cherenkov radiation. The field strength versus depth closely follows the
expected particle number density profile of the cascade, consistent with
emission from excess charge distributed along the shower. These measurements
therefore provide strong support for experiments designed to detect high energy
cosmic rays and neutrinos via coherent radio emission from their cascades.
