We perform a survey of the Cr, Mn and Fe-K emission lines in young supernova
remnants (SNRs) with the Japanese X-ray astronomy satellite {\sl Suzaku}. The
Cr and/or Mn emission lines are detected in 3C\,397 and 0519-69.0 for the first
time. We also confirm the detection of these lines in Kepler, W49B, N103B and
Cas A. We derive the line parameters (i.e., the line centroid energy, flux and
equivalent width [EW]) for these six sources and perform a correlation analysis
for the line center energies of Cr, Mn and Fe. Also included in the correlation
analysis are Tycho and G344.7-0.1 for which the Cr, Mn and Fe-K line parameters
were available in the literature through {\sl Suzaku} observations. We find
that the line center energies of Cr correlates very well with that of Fe and
that of Mn. This confirms our previous findings that the Cr, Mn and Fe are
spatially co-located, share a similar ionization state, and have a common
origin in the supernova nucleo-synthesis. We find that the ratio of the EW of
the Cr emission line to that of Fe ($\EWR\equiv \EWCr/\EWFe$) provides useful
constraints on the SNR progenitors and on the SN explosion mechanisms: for SNRs
with $\EWR > 2%$, a type Ia origin is favored (e.g., N103B, G344.7-0.1, 3C\,397
and 0519-69.0); for SNRs with $\EWR < 2%$, they could be of either
core-collpase origin or carbon-deflagration Ia origin.
