Black hole binaries exhibit a wide range of variability phenomena, from
large-scale state changes to broadband noise and quasi-periodic oscillations,
but the physical nature of much of this variability is poorly understood. We
examine the variability properties of three GRMHD simulations of thin accretion
disks around black holes of varying spin, producing light curves and power
spectra as would be seen by observers. We find that the simulated power spectra
show a broad feature at high frequency, which increases in amplitude with the
inclination of the observer. We show that this high-frequency feature is a
product of the Doppler effect and that its location is a function of the mass
and spin of the black hole. This Doppler feature demonstrates that power
spectral properties of the accretion disk can be tied to, and potentially used
to determine, physical properties of the black hole.
