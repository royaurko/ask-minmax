Solar neutrons have been detected using the neutron monitor located at Mt.
Chacaltaya, Bolivia, in association with a large solar flare on November 24,
2000. This is the first detection of solar neutrons by the neutron monitor that
have been reported so far in solar cycle 23. The statistical significance of
the detection is 5.5 sigma. In this flare, the intense emission of hard X-rays
and gamma-rays has been observed by the Yohkoh Hard X-ray Telescope (HXT) and
Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), respectively. The production time of solar
neutrons is better correlated with those of hard X-rays and gamma-rays than
with the production time of soft X-rays. The observations of the solar neutrons
on the ground have been limited to solar flares with soft X-ray class greater
than X8 in former solar cycles. In this cycle, however, neutrons were detected
associated with an X2.3 solar flare on November 24, 2000. This is the first
report of the detection of solar neutrons on the ground associated with a solar
flare with its X-ray class smaller than X8.
