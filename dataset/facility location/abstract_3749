Chiron is a derivative of von-Neumann-Bernays-G\"odel (NBG) set theory that
is intended to be a practical, general-purpose logic for mechanizing
mathematics. Unlike traditional set theories such as Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) and
NBG, Chiron is equipped with a type system, lambda notation, and definite and
indefinite description. The type system includes a universal type, dependent
types, dependent function types, subtypes, and possibly empty types. Unlike
traditional logics such as first-order logic and simple type theory, Chiron
admits undefined terms that result, for example, from a function applied to an
argument outside its domain or from an improper definite or indefinite
description. The most noteworthy part of Chiron is its facility for reasoning
about the syntax of expressions. Quotation is used to refer to a set called a
construction that represents the syntactic structure of an expression, and
evaluation is used to refer to the value of the expression that a construction
represents. Using quotation and evaluation, syntactic side conditions, schemas,
syntactic transformations used in deduction and computation rules, and other
such things can be directly expressed in Chiron. This paper presents the syntax
and semantics of Chiron, some definitions and simple examples illustrating its
use, a proof system for Chiron, and a notion of an interpretation of one theory
of Chiron in another.
