Context: When massive stars exert a radiation pressure onto their environment
that is higher than their gravitational attraction, they launch a
radiation-pressure-driven outflow. It has been claimed that a radiative
Rayleigh-Taylor instability should lead to the collapse of the outflow cavity
and foster the growth of massive stars.
  Aims: We investigate the stability of idealized radiation-pressure-dominated
cavities, focusing on its dependence on the radiation transport approach for
the stellar radiation feedback.
  Methods: We compare two different methods for stellar radiation feedback:
gray flux-limited diffusion (FLD) and ray-tracing (RT). We also derive simple
analytical models to support our findings.
  Results: Only the FLD cases lead to prominent instability in the cavity
shell. The RT cases do not show such instability. The gray FLD method
underestimates the opacity at the location of the cavity shell and leads to
extended epochs of marginal Eddington equilibrium in the cavity shell, making
them prone to the radiative Rayleigh-Taylor instability. In the RT cases, the
radiation pressure exceeds gravity by 1-2 orders of magnitude. The radiative
Rayleigh-Taylor instability is then consequently suppressed.
  Conclusions: Treating the stellar irradiation in the gray FLD approximation
underestimates the radiative forces acting on the cavity shell. This can lead
artificially to situations that are affected by the radiative Rayleigh-Taylor
instability. The proper treatment of direct stellar irradiation by massive
stars is crucial for the stability of radiation-pressure-dominated cavities.
