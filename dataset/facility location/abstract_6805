In this study, we present CG Aur's photometric observations obtained in the
observing seasons 2011 and 2012, the first available multi-colour light curves.
Their shape indicates that the system is an Algol binary. The light curve
analyses reveal that CG Aur is a detached binary system with an effective
temperature difference between the components, approximately 1000 K. The first
estimate of the absolute dimensions of the components indicated that the system
locates on the main sequence in the HR diagram. The primary component is
slightly evolved from the ZAMS.
