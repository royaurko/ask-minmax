We used cosmological simulation with self-consistent radiative transfer to
investigate the physical nature of Lyman Limit systems at z=4. In agreement
with previous studies, we find that most of Lyman Limit systems are ionized by
the cosmological background, while higher column density systems seem to be
illuminated by the local sources of radiation. In addition, we find that most
of Lyman limit systems in our simulations are located within the virial radii
of galaxies with a wide range of masses, and are physically associated with
them (``bits and pieces'' of galaxy formation). While the finite resolution of
our simulations cannot exclude an existence of a second population of
self-shielded, neutral gas clouds located in low mass dark matter halos
(``minihalos''), our simulations are not consistent with ``minihalos''
dominating the total abundance of Lyman limit systems.
