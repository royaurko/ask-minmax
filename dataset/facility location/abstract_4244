We describe a statistical hypothesis test for the presence of a signal. The
test allows the researcher to fix the signal location and/or width a priori, or
perform a search to find the signal region that maximizes the signal. The
background rate and/or distribution can be known or might be estimated from the
data. Cuts can be used to bring out the signal.
