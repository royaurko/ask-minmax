The static gauge potential between heavy sources is computed from a recently
introduced non-critical bosonic string background. When the sources are located
at the infinity of the holographic coordinate, the linear dilaton behavior is
recovered, which means that the potential is exactly linear in the separation
between the sources. When the sources are moved towards the origin, a competing
overconfining cubic branch appears, which is however disfavored energetically.
