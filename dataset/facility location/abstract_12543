A powerful set of universal relations, centered on a quantity called the
contact, connects the strength of short-range two-body correlations to the
thermodynamics of a many-body system with delta-function interactions. We
report on measurements of the contact, using RF spectroscopy, for an $^{85}$Rb
atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). For bosons, the fact that contact
spectroscopy can be used to probe the gas on short timescales is useful given
the decreasing stability of BECs with increasing interactions. A complication
is the added possibility, for bosons, of three-body interactions. In
investigating this issue, we have located an Efimov resonance for $^{85}$Rb
atoms with loss measurements and thus determined the three-body interaction
parameter. In our contact spectroscopy, in a region of observable
beyond-mean-field effects, we find no measurable contribution from three-body
physics.
