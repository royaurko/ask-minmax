The physical mechanisms responsible for pulsar timing glitches are thought to
excite quasi-normal mode oscillations in their parent neutron star that couple
to gravitational wave emission. In August 2006, a timing glitch was observed in
the radio emission of PSR B0833-45, the Vela pulsar. At the time of the glitch,
the two co-located Hanford gravitational wave detectors of the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational-wave observatory (LIGO) were operational and
taking data as part of the fifth LIGO science run (S5). We present the first
direct search for the gravitational wave emission associated with oscillations
of the fundamental quadrupole mode excited by a pulsar timing glitch. No
gravitational wave detection candidate was found. We place Bayesian 90%
confidence upper limits of 6.3e-21 to 1.4e-20 on the peak intrinsic strain
amplitude of gravitational wave ring-down signals, depending on which spherical
harmonic mode is excited. The corresponding range of energy upper limits is
5.0e44 to 1.3e45 erg.
