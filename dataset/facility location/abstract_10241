We suggest simple models which produce the suitable fermion mass hierarchies
and flavor mixing angles based on the 6 dimensional N=1 supersymmetric SO(10)
grand unified theory compactified on a $T^2/(Z_2 \times Z_2')$ orbifold. We
introduce extra vector-like heavy fields in the extra dimensions, and the
suitable fermion mass hierarchies and flavor mixings are generated by
integrating out these heavy fields. We consider gaugino mediation and gauge
mediation supersymmetry breaking mechanisms and their flavor structures. The
experimental constraints of small flavor changing neutral currents suggest
where to locate the supersymmetry breaking brane in the gaugino mediation
mechanism. On the other hand, the SUSY breaking masses are highly degenerated
in the gauge mediation scenario, where the flavor changing neutral currents are
naturally suppressed as in the ordinal four dimensional gauge mediation models.
