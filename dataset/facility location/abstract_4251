The recent algorithm for five split tRNA-genes in N.equitans is new . It
locates missing tRNA-trp, tRNA-imet, tRNA-glu and tRNA-his . But the split
tRNA-trp(CCA) solution is anomalous ; the tRNA-imet lacks cognition elements
for aminoacylation . In view therefore we present here alternate non-split
composite solutions for tRNA-trp, tRNA-imet, tRNA-glu and tRNA-his .
