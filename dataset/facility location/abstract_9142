I present optical observations of the Blue Compact Dwarf Galaxy UM 462. The
images of this galaxy show several bright compact sources. A careful study of
these sources has revealed their nature of young Super Star Clusters. The ages
determined from the analysis of the stellar continuum and $H\alpha$ are between
few and few tens Myr. The total star formation taking place into the clusters
is about 0.05 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}/yr}$. The clusters seem to be located at the
edges of two large round-like structures, possibly shells originated in a
previous episode of star formation. The sizes of the shells compare well with
the ages of the clusters. Evidence for the presence of an evolved underlying
stellar population is found.
