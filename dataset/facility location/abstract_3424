With the new GSI High Current Injector, the beam pulse intensity will be
increased by more than two orders of magnitude. The high beam power and the
short stopping range at particle energies below 12 MeV/u can destroy
accelerator components even during a single beam pulse. Therefore, the
operation of the whole accelerator facility has required major changes in
hardware, software and operating strategy. A sophisticated beam diagnostic
system is indispensable for a safe operation. Preferably non-destructive
devices were installed. Destructive elements, e.g. beam stoppers, slits,
apertures, were improved in order to withstand the high beam power. Automatic
damage prevention was realised by beam loss monitors comparing and evaluating
very fast beam current transformer signals. Additionally, the component status
will be controlled permanently. For foil stripping at 11.4 MeV/u, a magnetic
beam sweeping system was installed Thereby, the hit area will be increased
during one 100 micro sec pulse. During operation, manual variation of
parameters has to be reduced. Set-up and automatic beam adjustment procedures
have to exclude uncontrolled beam loss. The versatility of the UNILAC is
enhanced by the possible three-beam operation on a pulse-to-pulse basis. Since
November 1999 the upgraded UNILAC is serving the experiments.
