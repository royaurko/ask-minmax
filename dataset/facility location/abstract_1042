Extension of near-field optical diffraction radiation (ODR) imaging to the 23
GeV beams at the proposed FACET facility at SLAC has been evaluated. The
beam-size sensitivity at the 10- to 20- \mu m sigma level based on a simple
model will be reported. Polarization effects are also seen to be important and
will be discussed. The comparisons to previous experimental results and the
modeling results indicate sufficient feasibility for planning of the
experiments in the coming year.
