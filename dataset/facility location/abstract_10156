We describe the design and operation of the RASNIK optical relative alignment
system designed for and installed on the CDF inner tracking detectors. The
system provides low-cost minute-by-minute alignment monitoring with submicron
precision. To reduce ambiguities, we modified the original three-element rasnik
design to a two-element one. Since the RASNIKs are located within 10--40 cm of
the beamline, the systems were built from low-mass and radiation-hard
components and are operated in a mode which reduces damage from radiation. We
describe the data-acquisition system, which has been running without
interruption since before the CDF detector was rolled into its collision hall
in March 2001. We evaluate what has been learned about sources of detector
motion from almost two years of RASNIK data and discuss possible improvements
to the system.
