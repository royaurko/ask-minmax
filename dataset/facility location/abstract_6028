We investigate in detail the special case of an infinitely thin static
cylindrical shell composed of counter-rotating photons on circular geodetical
paths separating two distinct parts of Minkowski spacetimes--one inside and the
other outside the shell--and compare it to a static disk shell formed by null
particles counter-rotating on circular geodesics within the shell located
between two sections of flat spacetime. One might ask whether the two cases are
not, in fact, merely one.
