A study of QCD at non-zero chemical potential, mu, and temperature, T, is
performed using the lattice technique. The transition temperature (between the
confined and deconfined phases) is determined as a function of mu and is found
to be in agreement with other work. In addition the variation of the pressure
and energy density with mu is obtained for small positive mu. These results are
of particular relevance for heavy-ion collision experiments.
