A novel Strict Friendliness Verification (SFV) scheme based on the integrated
key consisting of symmetric node identity, geographic location and round trip
response time between the sender and the receiver radio in MANET is proposed.
This key is dynamically updated for encryption and decryption of each packet to
resolve Wormhole attack and Sybil attack. Additionally, it meets the minimal
key lengths required for symmetric ciphers to provide adequate commercial
security. Furthermore, the foe or unfriendly node detection is found
significantly increasing with the lower number of symmetric IDs. This paper
presents the simulation demonstrating the performance of SFV in terms of
dynamic range using directional antenna on radios (or nodes), and the
performance in terms of aggregate throughput, average end to end delay and
packet delivered ratio.
