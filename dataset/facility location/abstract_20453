The nearby (distance~350-400 pc), rich Vela OB2 association, includes
$\gamma^2$ Velorum, one of the most massive binaries in the solar neighbourhood
and an excellent laboratory for investigating the formation and early evolution
of young clusters. Recent Gaia-ESO survey observations have led to the
discovery of two kinematically distinct populations in the young (10-15 Myr)
cluster immediately surrounding $\gamma^2$ Velorum. Here we analyse the results
of Gaia-ESO survey observations of NGC 2547, a 35 Myr cluster located two
degrees south of $\gamma^2$ Velorum. The radial velocity distribution of
lithium-rich pre-main sequence stars shows a secondary population that is
kinematically distinct from and younger than NGC 2547. The radial velocities,
lithium absorption lines, and the positions in a colour-magnitude diagram of
this secondary population are consistent with those of one of the components
discovered around $\gamma^2$ Velorum. This result shows that there is a young,
low-mass stellar population spread over at least several square degrees in the
Vela OB2 association. This population could have originally been part of a
cluster around $\gamma^2$ Velorum that expanded after gas expulsion or formed
in a less dense environment that is spread over the whole Vela OB2 region.
