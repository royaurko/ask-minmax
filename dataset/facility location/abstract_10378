We show that the hierarchy between the Planck and the weak scales can follow
from the tendency of gravitons and fermions to localize at different edges of a
thick double wall embedded in an $AdS_5$ spacetime without reflection symmetry.
This double wall is a stable BPS thick-wall solution with two sub-walls located
at its edges; fermions are coupled to the scalar field through Yukawa
interactions, but the the lack of reflection symmetry forces them to be
localized in one of the sub-walls. We show that the graviton zero-mode
wavefunction is suppressed in the fermion edge by an exponential function of
the distance between the sub-walls, and that the massive modes decouple so that
Newtonian gravity is recuperated.
