The Herschel Satellite and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) are two
very large sub-mm and far infrared (FIR) astronomy projects that are expected
to come into operation in this decade. This report contains descriptions of
these instruments, emphasising the overlaps in wavelength range and additional
complementarities.
  A short rationale for studying sub-mm and far infrared astronomy is given.
Following this, brief presentations of Herschel and ALMA are presented, with
references to more detailed documents and use cases. Emphasis is placed on the
synergies between these facilities, and the challenges of comparing data
produced using both. Specific examples of projects are given for a number of
areas of astronomical research where these facilities will lead to dramatic
improvements.
  This report is addressed to an audience of non-specialist astronomers who may
be interested in extending their areas of research by making use of Herschel
and ALMA instruments.
