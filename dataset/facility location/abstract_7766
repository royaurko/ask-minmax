We report the results of the measurement of the trigonometric parallax of an
H$_2$O maser source in \r22 with the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry
(VERA). The annual parallax was determined to be 0.314$\pm$0.070~mas,
corresponding to a distance of 3.18$^{+0.90}_{-0.66}$~kpc. Our results confirm
\r22 to be located in the Perseus arm. We computed the peculiar motion of \r22
to be $(U_{src}, V_{src}, W_{src}) = (4\pm4, -32\pm6, 8\pm6)$~\kms, where
$U_{src}$, $V_{src}$, and $W_{src}$ are directed toward the Galactic center, in
the direction of Galactic rotation and toward the Galactic north pole,
respectively. \r22, NGC\,7538 and Cepheus A lie along the same line of sight,
and are within 2$^{\circ}$ on the sky. Their parallax distances with which we
derived their absolute position in the Milky Way show that \r22 and \ngc~are
associated with the Perseus Arm, while \cepa~is located in the Local Arm. We
compared the kinematic distances of \iras, \ga, \gb, \gc, \gd, \cepa, \ngc,
\ge, \gf~and \r22~derived with flat and non-flat rotation curve with its
parallax distance and found the kinematic distance derived from the non-flat
rotation assumption ($-$5 to $-$39 \kms~lag) to be consistent with the parallax
distance.
