The capacity region of a channel consists of all achievable rate vectors.
Picking a particular point in the capacity region is synonymous with rate
allocation. The issue of fairness in rate allocation is addressed in this
paper. We review several notions of fairness, including max-min fairness,
proportional fairness and Nash bargaining solution. Their efficiencies for
general multiuser channels are discussed. We apply these ideas to the Gaussian
multiple access channel (MAC) and the Gaussian broadcast channel (BC). We show
that in the Gaussian MAC, max-min fairness and proportional fairness coincide.
For both Gaussian MAC and BC, we devise efficient algorithms that locate the
fair point in the capacity region. Some elementary properties of fair rate
allocations are proved.
