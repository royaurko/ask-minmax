The ground state solutions of a dilute Bose condensate with contact and
magnetic dipole-dipole interactions are examined. By lowering the value of the
scattering length, Goral et al. [cond-mat/9907308 and Phys. Rev. A {\bf 61},
051601 (2000)] numerically predict a region of unstable solutions, accompanied
by a neighborhood where the ground-state wave functions have internal
structure. On the contrary, we find that the dipolar condensate has an
intuitively-located stability region, and ground-state solutions near the
instability threshold which are absent any unusual structure.
