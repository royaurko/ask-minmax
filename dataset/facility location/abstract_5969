We study the penetration of the nonuniform magnetic field, created by a
magnetic dipole with out-of-plane magnetization, into a film heterostructure
composed of a type-II superconductor layer and a soft-magnet layer. In the
framework of the London approach, the energy of the magnetic dipole-vortex
interaction is derived and the critical value of the dipole moment for the
first appearance of a vortex in the superconducting constituent is found for
two cases of the layer ordering, namely when the dipole is located near the
superconducting or, respectively, the magnetic constituent.
