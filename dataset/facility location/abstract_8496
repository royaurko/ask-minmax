We have obtained evidence of gamma-ray emission above 1 TeV from PSR1706-44,
using a ground-based telescope of the atmospheric \v{C}erenkov imaging type
located near Woomera, South Australia. This object, a $\gamma$-ray source
discovered by the COS B satellite (2CG342-02), was identified with the radio
pulsar through the discovery of a 102 ms pulsed signal with the EGRET
instrument of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. The flux of the present
observation above a threshold of 1 TeV is $\bf \sim $ 1 $\cdot$ 10$^{-11}$
photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the
extrapolation from GeV energies. The analysis is not restricted to a search for
emission modulated with the 102 ms period, and the reported flux is for all
$\gamma$-rays from PSR1706-44, pulsed and unpulsed. The energy output in the
TeV region corresponds to about 10$^{-3}$ of the spin down energy loss rate of
the neutron star.
