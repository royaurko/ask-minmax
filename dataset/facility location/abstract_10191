We determine the location $\lambda_c$ of the mobility edge in the spectrum of
the hermitian Wilson operator in pure-gauge ensembles with plaquette, Iwasaki,
and DBW2 gauge actions. The results allow mapping a portion of the (quenched)
Aoki phase diagram. We use Green function techniques to study the localized and
extended modes. Where $\lambda_c>0$ we characterize the localized modes in
terms of an average support length and an average localization length, the
latter determined from the asymptotic decay rate of the mode density. We argue
that, since the overlap operator is commonly constructed from the Wilson
operator, its range is set by the value of $\lambda_c^{-1}$ for the Wilson
operator. It follows from our numerical results that overlap simulations
carried out with a cutoff of 1 GeV, even with improved gauge actions, could be
afflicted by unphysical degrees of freedom as light as 250 MeV.
