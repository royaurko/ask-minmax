We explore the close environment of active star-forming galaxies (ASF) in the
2dF. We find ASF galaxies to be the most likely population to inhabit extremely
close pairs located in low density regions. In addition, we find that ASF
galaxies in these pairs are almost entirely concentrated in the -20 < M_B < -19
magnitude range.
