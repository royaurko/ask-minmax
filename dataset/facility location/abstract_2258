We study, within phenomenological Lagrangian approach, the possibility that
the near-threshold peak found in the phi-photoproduction cross section is
caused by a resonance. We show that, by employing a J^P=3/2^- resonance with a
mass of 2.08 +/- 0.05 GeV and a width of 0.570 +/- 0.169 GeV, the LEPS data
which include new data on nine spin-density matrix elements can indeed be
described reasonably well. We also find that the ratio of helicity amplitudes
A_1/2/A_3/2 calculated from the resulting coupling constants differs in sign
from that of D13(2080). The resonance is further found to be able to improve
the theoretical description of omega photoproduction against a new set of data
if a large value for OZI evading parameter is assumed.
