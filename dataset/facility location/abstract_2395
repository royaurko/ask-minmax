A novel Mathematical Random Number Generator (MRNG) is presented here. In
this case, "mathematical" refers to the fact that to construct that generator
it is not necessary to resort to a physical phenomenon, such as the thermal
noise of an electronic device, but rather to a mathematical procedure. The MRNG
generates binary strings - in principle, as long as desired - which may be
considered genuinely random in the sense that they pass the statistical tests
currently accepted to evaluate the randomness of those strings. From those
strings, the MRNG also generates random numbers expressed in base 10. An MRNG
has been installed as a facility on the following web page:
http://www.appliedmathgroup.org. This generator may be used for applications in
tasks in: a) computational simulation of probabilistic-type systems, and b) the
random selection of samples of different populations. Users interested in
applications in cryptography can build another MRNG, but they would have to
withhold information - specified in section 5 - from people who are not
contributorized to decode messages encrypted using that resource.
