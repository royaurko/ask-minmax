A different compressive sensing framework, convolution with white noise
waveform followed by subsampling at fixed (not randomly selected) locations, is
studied in this paper. We show that its recoverability for sparse signals
depends on the coherence (denoted by mu) between the signal representation and
the Fourier basis. In particular, an n-dimensional signal which is S-sparse in
such a basis can be recovered with a probability exceeding 1-delta from any
fixed m~O(mu^2*S*log(n/delta)^(3/2)) output samples of the random convolution.
