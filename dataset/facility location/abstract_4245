Counterion distributions at charged soft membranes are studied using
perturbative analytical and simulation methods in both weak coupling
(mean-field or Poisson-Boltzmann) and strong coupling limits. The softer the
membrane, the more smeared out the counterion density profile becomes and
counterions pentrate through the mean-membrane surface location, in agreement
with anomalous scattering results. Membrane-charge repulsion leads to a
short-scale roughening of the membrane.
