Luminosities of many powerful blazars are strongly dominated by $\gamma$-rays
which most likely result from Comptonization of radiation produced outside a
jet. This observation sets certain constraints on composition and energetics of
the jet as well as the surrounding quasar environment. We study the dependence
of a Compton dominance on a jet magnetization (the magnetic-to-matter energy
flux) and on the location of the 'blazar zone'. Calculations are performed for
two geometries of broad-emission-line and hot-dust regions: spherical and
planar. The jet magnetization corresponding to the large observed Compton
dominance is found to be $\sim 0.1 (\theta_{\rm j} \Gamma)^2$ for spherical
geometries and $\sim 0.01 (\theta_{\rm j} \Gamma)^2$ for planar geometries,
where $\theta_{\rm j}$ is the jet half-opening angle and $\Gamma$ is the jet
Lorentz factor. This implies that jets in luminous blazars are matter dominated
and that this domination is particularly strong for the flattened geometry of
external radiation sources.
