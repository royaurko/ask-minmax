Using photometric and redshift data for the Virgo and Coma clusters, we
present evidence for a correlation between the light concentration of
elliptical galaxies (including dwarf ellipticals) and the local 3-D (i.e.
non-projected) density of the clusters: more concentrated ellipticals are
located in denser regions. The null hypothesis (i.e. the absence of any
relation) is rejected at a significance level better than 99.9%. In order to
explain the observed relation, a power law relating the galaxy light
concentration and the cluster 3-D density is proposed. We study how the
projection effects affect the form and dispersion of the data-points in the
light concentration-projected density diagram. The agreement between our model
and the observed data suggests that there is a paucity of dwarf elliptical
galaxies in the cluster central regions.
