It has been suggested in the literature that it may be possible to locate the
QCD critical end point using the Taylor series of thermodynamic variables about
the $\mu=0$ axis. Since the phase transition at the critical end point is
believed to be in the 3D Ising universality class, it would seem natural to
test this method with the Ising Model, for which the answer is already known.
The finding is that it is in fact possible to pinpoint the location of the
Ising critical point using Taylor coefficients.
