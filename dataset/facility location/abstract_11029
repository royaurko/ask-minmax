The Geopark Araripe, located in Northeastern Brazil, is the first UNESCO
Natural Park in the South hemisphere and a world-famous fossil deposit of the
Early Cretaceous period (approximately 120 million years). Fossilized fish
fauna in Geopark Araripe is found inside of sedimentary rocks in
three-dimensional forms. In the present study sedimentary rocks and fossil fish
Rhacolepis bucalis have been carefully analysed by means of X-ray powder
diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and termogravimetric analysis.
Mineralogical composition of the fossil fish was explained in terms of facts
occurred at the initial stages of the opening of the South Atlantic and the
oceanic hydrothermal phenomena (``black smoker'', ``white smoker'' and
warm-water events). The occurrence of organic substance was, for the first
time, evaluated in collapsed internal elements (intestinal and muscles) by
termogravimetric analysis.
