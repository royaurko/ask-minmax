We show that the well-known Hastings-McLeod solution to the second
Painlev\'{e} equation is pole-free in the region $\arg x \in
[-\frac{\pi}{3},\frac{\pi}{3}]\cup [\frac{2\pi}{3},\frac{ 4 \pi}{3}]$, which
proves an important special case of a general conjecture concerning pole
distributions of Painlev\'{e} transcedents proposed by Novokshenov. Our
strategy is to construct explicit quasi-solutions approximating the
Hastings-McLeod solution in different regions of the complex plane, and
estimate the errors rigorously. The main idea is very similar to the one used
to prove Dubrovin's conjecture for the first Painlev\'{e} equation, but there
are various technical improvements.
