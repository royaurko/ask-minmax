An angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy study was conducted on
BiSrCaCuZnO. A small amount of Zn substitution for Cu almost completely
suppresses the otherwise sharp spectral peak along the (0,0) to (pi,pi)
direction in BiSrCaCuZnO, while superconductivity with Tc as high as 83K
survives. This behavior contrasts markedly from that seen in cases where the
impurities are located off the CuO plane, as well as when the CuO planes are
underdoped. This effect is also accompanied by changes of low energy
excitations at (pi,0), near the anti-node position of the d-wave pairing state.
With Zn doping the size of the superconducting gap is significantly suppressed,
the width of the quasiparticle peak in the superconducting state becomes wider,
and the dip at higher binding energy is diminished. In addition, enhanced
temperature induced spectral changes also occur. We show intriguing systematic
lineshape changes with temperature that persist to a very high energy scale - a
result consistent with the idea that Zn enhances the local charge
inhomogeneity.
