We study the phase structure of the scalar field theory on fuzzy $\mathbb C
P^n$ in the large $N$ limit. Considering the theory as a hermitian matrix model
we compute the perturbative expansion of the kinetic term effective action
under the assumption of distributions being close to the semicircle. We show
that this model admits also a uniform order phase, corresponding to the
asymmetric one-cut distribution, and we find the phase boundary. We compute a
non-perturbative approximation to the effective action which enables us to
identify the disorder and the non-uniform order phases and the phase transition
between them. We locate the triple point of the theory and find an agreement
with previous numerical studies for the case of the fuzzy sphere.
