We describe the design, construction and measured performance of the Kitt
Peak Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph (KOSMOS) for the 4-m Mayall telescope
and the Cerro Tololo Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph (COSMOS) for the 4-m
Blanco telescope. These nearly identical imaging spectrographs are modified
versions of the OSMOS instrument; they provide a pair of new, high-efficiency
instruments to the NOAO user community. KOSMOS and COSMOS may be used for
imaging, long-slit, and multi-slit spectroscopy over a 100 square arcminute
field of view with a pixel scale of 0.29 arcseconds. Each contains two VPH
grisms that provide R~2500 with a one arcsecond slit and their wavelengths of
peak diffraction efficiency are approximately 510nm and 750nm. Both may also be
used with either a thin, blue-optimized CCD from e2v or a thick, fully
depleted, red-optimized CCD from LBNL. These instruments were developed in
response to the ReSTAR process. KOSMOS was commissioned in 2013B and COSMOS was
commissioned in 2014A.
