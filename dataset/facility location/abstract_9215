Regular monitoring of the SMC with RXTE has revealed a huge number of X-ray
pulsars. Together with discoveries from other satellites at least 45 SMC
pulsars are now known. One of these sources, a pulsar with a period of
approximately 7.8 seconds, was first detected in early 2002 and since discovery
it has been found to be in outburst nine times. The outburst pattern clearly
shows a period of 45.1 +/- 0.4 d which is thought to be the orbital period of
this system. Candidate outburst periods have also been obtained for nine other
pulsars and continued monitoring will enable us to confirm these. This large
number of pulsars, all located at approximately the same distance, enables a
wealth of comparative studies. In addition, the large number of pulsars found
(which vastly exceeds the number expected simply by scaling the relative mass
of the SMC and the Galaxy) reveals the recent star formation history of the SMC
which has been influenced by encounters with both the LMC and the Galaxy.
