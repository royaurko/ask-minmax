We present the first self-consistent model for the dynamics and the radiative
transfer occurring in bright X-ray pulsar accretion columns, with a special
focus on the role of the shock in energizing the emerging X-rays. The pressure
inside the accretion column of a luminous X-ray pulsar is dominated by the
photons, and consequently the equations describing the coupled
radiative-dynamical structure must be solved simultaneously. Spectral formation
in these sources is therefore a complex, nonlinear phenomenon. We obtain the
analytical solution for the Green's function describing the upscattering of
monochromatic radiation injected into the column from the thermal mound located
near the base of the flow. The Green's function is convolved with a Planck
distribution to model the X-ray spectrum resulting from the reprocessing of
blackbody photons produced in the thermal mound. These photons diffuse through
the infalling gas and eventually escape out the walls of the column, forming
the observed X-ray spectrum. We show that the resulting column-integrated,
phase-averaged spectrum has a power-law shape at high energies and a blackbody
shape at low energies, in agreement with the observational data for many X-ray
pulsars.
