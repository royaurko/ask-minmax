The phenomenological description of the neutral B meson system is proposed in
terms of the fundamental CP-violating observables and within a rephasing
invariant formalism. This generic formalism can select the time-dependent and
time-integrated asymmetries which provide the basic tools to discriminate the
different kinds of possible CP-violating effects in dedicated experimental
B-meson facilities.
