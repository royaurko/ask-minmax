In this paper we present a preliminary study on an general eigenvalue problem
for the so called $(p,2)$-Laplace operator on a smooth bounded domain under a
nonlinear Steklov type boundary condition, namely \begin{equation} \left\{
\begin{aligned} -\Delta_pu-\Delta u & =\lambda a(x)u \ \ \text{in}\ \Omega,\\
(|\nabla u|^{p-2}+1)\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial\nu} & =\lambda b(x)u \ \
\text{on}\ \partial\Omega . \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation} For positive
essentially bounded weights $a$ and $b$, we show that, for all $p>1$, the
eigenvalue set consists of an isolated null eigenvalue plus a continuous family
of eigenvalues located away from zero.
