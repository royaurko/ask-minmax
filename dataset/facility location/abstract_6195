Suppose $Y$ is a regular covering of a graph $X$ with covering transformation
group $\pi = \mathbb{Z}$. This paper gives an explicit formula for the $L^2$
zeta function of $Y$ and computes examples. When $\pi = \mathbb{Z}$, the $L^2$
zeta function is an algebraic function. As a consequence it extends to a
meromorphic function on a Riemann surface. The meromorphic extension provides a
setting to generalize known properties of zeta functions of regular graphs,
such as the location of singularities and the functional equation.
