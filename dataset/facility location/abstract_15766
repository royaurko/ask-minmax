We consider the critical spread-out contact process in $\Zd$ with $d\geq 1$,
whose infection range is denoted by $L\geq1$. The two-point function
$\tau_t(x)$ is the probability that $x\in\Zd$ is infected at time $t$ by the
infected individual located at the origin $o\in\Zd$ at time 0. We prove
Gaussian behavior for the two-point function with $L\geq L_0$ for some finite
$L_0=L_0(d)$ for $d>4$. When $d\leq 4$, we also perform a local mean-field
limit to obtain Gaussian behaviour for $\tau_{tT}$ with $t>0$ fixed and $T\to
\infty$ when the infection range depends on $T$ such that $L_T=LT^b$ for any
$b>(4-d)/2d$.
  The proof is based on the lace expansion and an adaptation of the inductive
approach applied to the discretized contact process. We prove the existence of
several critical exponents and show that they take on mean-field values. The
results in this paper provide crucial ingredients to prove convergence of the
finite-dimensional distributions for the contact process towards the canonical
measure of super-Brownian motion, which we defer to a sequel of this paper.
