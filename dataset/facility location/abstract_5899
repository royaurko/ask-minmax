We analyze the symmetry and the nodal structure of the superconducting order
parameter in a cubic ferromagnet, such as ZrZn$_2$. We demonstrate how the
order parameter symmetry evolves when the electromagnetic interaction of the
conduction electrons with the internal magnetic induction and the spin-orbit
coupling are taken into account. These interactions break the cubic symmetry
and lift the degeneracy of the order parameter. It is shown that the order
parameter which appears immediately below the critical temperature has two
components, and its symmetry is described by {\em co-representations} of the
magnetic point groups. This allows us to make predictions about the location of
the gap nodes.
