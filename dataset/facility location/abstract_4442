We better determine the spectral flux distribution of the supernova candidate
associated with GRB 970228 by modeling the spectral flux distribution of the
host galaxy of this burst, fitting this model to measurements of the host
galaxy, and using the fitted model to better subtract out the contribution of
the host galaxy to measurements of the afterglow of this burst. Furthermore, we
discuss why the non-detection of a SN1998bw-like component to the afterglow of
GRB 990510 does not necessarily imply that a SN is not associated with this
burst. Finally, we discuss how bursts can be used as beacons to locate SNe out
to redshifts of z = 4 - 5.
