The dynamics of two two-level dipole-dipole interacting atoms coupled to a
common electromagnetic bath and closely located inside a lossy cavity, is
reported. Initially injecting only one excitation in the two atoms-cavity
system, loss mechanisms asymptotically drive the matter sample toward a
stationary maximally entangled state. The role played by the closeness of the
two atoms with respect to such a cooperative behaviour is carefully discussed.
Stationary radiation trapping effects are found and transparently interpreted.
