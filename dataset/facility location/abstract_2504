A Geant4-based Python/C++ simulation and coding framework, which has been
developed and used in order to aid the R&D efforts for thermal neutron
detectors at neutron scattering facilities, is described. Built upon
configurable geometry and generator modules, it integrates a general purpose
object oriented output file format with meta-data, developed in order to
facilitate a faster turn-around time when setting up and analysing simulations.
Also discussed are the extensions to Geant4 which have been implemented in
order to include the effects of low-energy phenomena such as Bragg diffraction
in the polycrystalline support materials of the detector. Finally, an example
application of the framework is briefly shown.
