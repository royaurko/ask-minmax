Melanocytic nevi are benign proliferations that sometimes turn into malignant
melanoma in a way that is still unclear from the biochemical and genetic point
of view. Diagnostic and prognostic tools are then mostly based on dermoscopic
examination and morphological analysis of histological tissues. To investigate
the role of mechanics and geometry in the morpholgical dynamics of melanocytic
nevi, we study a computation model for cell proliferation in a layered
non-linear elastic tissue. Numerical simulations suggest that the morphology of
the nevus is correlated to the initial location of the proliferating cell
starting the growth process and to the mechanical properties of the tissue. Our
results also support that melanocytes are subject to compressive stresses that
fluctuate widely in the nevus and depend on the growth stage. Numerical
simulations of cells in the epidermis releasing matrix metalloproteinases
display an accelerated invasion of the dermis by destroying the basal membrane.
Moreover, we suggest experimentally that osmotic stress and collagen inhibit
growth in primary melanoma cells while the effect is much weaker in metastatic
cells. Knowing that morphological features of nevi might also reflect geometry
and mechanics rather than malignancy could be relevant for diagnostic purposes
