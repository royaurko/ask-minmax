We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of two close
quasar-quasar pairs found in the Large Bright Quasar Survey (LBQS) (Hewett et
al. 1995, AJ, 109, 1498). The two components of the 2153-2056 pair ($z=1.845$,
$\Delta\theta=7\farcs8$, $B=17.9$ and 21.3) have the same redshifts within the
relatively large uncertainty, $\Delta v_{A-B} =-1100\pm1500 km s^{-1}$, of the
observations. The quasars are most likely spatially coincident although the
possibility that the pair is the result of gravitational lensing cannot be
ruled out. The two components of 1148+0055 ($z=1.879$, $B=18.5$ and $z=1.409$,
$B=21.1$, $\Delta\theta=3\farcs9$) have disjoint redshifts and the pair has
attracted some attention in the context of gravitational lensing (e.g. Wampler
1997, ApJ, 476, L55) following the independent discovery of the pair by Surdej
and collaborators. Four close, $\Delta\theta \le10\farcs0$, quasar-quasar pairs
have now been discovered in the LBQS and we discuss the probability of
identifying pairs with disjoint redshifts and of locating spatially coincident
pairs from the systematic investigation of the well-defined quasar catalogue.
