Relativistic antiparticles can be created in high-energy nuclear
interactions; thus, detection of antiparticles in an astrophysical source can
tell us something remarkable about the underlying high-energy processes and
nuclear interactions. However, once created, the antiparticles remain a minor
fraction of their conjugant normal particles, so the detection of the
antiparticles represents a big science challenge. To address this challenge we
employ imaging and polarimetry of microwave radiation produced as the positrons
gyrate in the ambient magnetic field. The key property of the radiation used in
this method is that the oppositely charged particles, electrons and positrons,
produce radiation with opposite helicity, easily distinguishable by currently
operating radio facilities. Analysis of available spatially resolved microwave
data augmented by independent magnetic field measurements allows us to remotely
detect the relativistic positron component in several solar flares.
