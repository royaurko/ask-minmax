We have experimentally studied the electronic $3p\leftarrow 3s$ excitation of
Na atoms attached to $^3$He droplets by means of laser-induced fluorescence as
well as beam depletion spectroscopy. From the similarities of the spectra
(width/shift of absorption lines) with these of Na on $^4$He droplets, we
conclude that sodium atoms reside in a ``dimple'' on the droplet surface. The
experimental results are supported by Density Functional calculations at zero
temperature, which confirm the surface location of sodium on $^3$He droplets,
and provide a microscopic description of the ``dimple'' structure.
