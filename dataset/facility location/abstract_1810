We study the changes in the partial decay widths of excited charmonium states
into $D \bar{D}$, when the D meson mass decreases in nuclear matter, taking the
internal structure of the hadrons into account. Calculations within the 3P0
model for $\psi(3686)$ and $\psi(3770)$ imply that naive estimates of the
in-medium widths based only on phase space are grossly exaggerated. Due to
nodes in the wave functions, these states may even become narrow at high
densities, if the D meson mass is decreased by about 200 MeV. For the $\chi$
states, we generally expect stronger modifications of the widths. The relevance
of the $\chi$ widths for $J/\psi$ suppression in heavy ion collision is
discussed. These phenomena could be explored in experiments at the future
accelerator facility at GSI.
