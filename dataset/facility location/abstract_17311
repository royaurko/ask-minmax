A set of hydrodynamical models based on stellar evolutionary progenitors is
used to study the nature of SN 2011dh. Our modeling suggests that a large
progenitor star ---with R ~200 Rsun---, is needed to reproduce the early light
curve of SN 2011dh. This is consistent with the suggestion that the yellow
super-giant star detected at the location of the SN in deep pre-explosion
images is the progenitor star. From the main peak of the bolometric light curve
and expansion velocities we constrain the mass of the ejecta to be ~2 Msun, the
explosion energy to be E= 6-10 x 10^50 erg, and the 56Ni mass to be
approximately 0.06 Msun. The progenitor star was composed of a helium core of 3
to 4 Msun and a thin hydrogen-rich envelope of ~0.1 M_sun with a main sequence
mass estimated to be in the range of 12--15 Msun. Our models rule out
progenitors with helium-core masses larger than 8 Msun, which correspond to
M_ZAMS > 25 Msun. This suggests that a single star evolutionary scenario for SN
2011dh is unlikely.
