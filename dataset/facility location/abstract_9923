The macroscopic continuous approach of the mechanics of granular media
assumes that the whole system of discrete variables (contact locations, contact
forces,...) can be replaced by continuous field equations relating stress and
strain on macroscopic scale. On the contrary, recent approaches contest this
validity on the basis that microscopic studies show the existence of large
fluctuations of forces, of chains of forces,... This paper tries and
establishes the state of this question using recent works reported at Powders &
Grains 2001 which have studied the microscopic variables, their fluctuations
and their evolution. This paper shows that these results validate the
macroscopic approach despite the existence of these fluctuations. It concludes
that the representative elementary volume is of few grains most of the time,
except in some peculiar cases. Pacs # : 5.40 ; 45.70 ; 62.20 ; 83.70.Fn
