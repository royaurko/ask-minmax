The Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope
detected a gamma-ray source that is spatially consistent with the location of
Eta Carinae. This source has been persistently bright since the beginning of
the LAT survey observations (from 2008 August to 2009 July, the time interval
considered here). The gamma-ray signal is detected significantly throughout the
LAT energy band (i.e., up to ~100 GeV). The 0.1-100 GeV energy spectrum is well
represented by a combination of a cutoff power-law model (< 10 GeV) and a hard
power-law component (> 10 GeV). The total flux (> 100 MeV) is
$3.7^{+0.3}_{-0.1} \times 10^{-7}$ photons s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, with additional
systematic uncertainties of 10%, and consistent with the average flux measured
by AGILE (Tavani et al. 2009). The light curve obtained by Fermi is consistent
with steady emission. Our observations do not confirm the presence of a
gamma-ray flare in 2008 October as reported by Tavani et al. (2009), although
we cannot exclude that a flare lasting only a few hours escaped detection by
the Fermi LAT. We also do not find any evidence for gamma-ray variability that
correlates with the large X-ray variability of Eta Carinae observed during 2008
December and 2009 January. We are thus not able to establish an unambiguous
identification of the LAT source with Eta Carinae.
