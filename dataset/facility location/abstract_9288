The hypothetical photonic origin of the most energetic air shower detected by
the Fly's Eye experiment is discussed. The method used for the analysis is
based on Monte Carlo simulations including the effect of precascading of
ultra-high energy (UHE) photons in the geomagnetic field. The application of
this method to data expected from the Pierre Auger Observatory is discussed.
The importance of complementing the southern Auger location by a northern site
for UHE photon identification is pointed out.
