When observed with optical long-baseline interferometers (OLBI), components
of a binary star which are sufficiently separated produce their own
interferometric fringe packets; these are referred to as Separated Fringe
Packet (SFP) binaries. These SFP binaries can overlap in angular separation
with the regime of systems resolvable by speckle interferometry at single,
large-aperture telescopes and can provide additional measurements for
preliminary orbits lacking good phase coverage, help constrain elements of
already established orbits, and locate new binaries in the undersampled regime
between the bounds of spectroscopic surveys and speckle interferometry. In this
process, a visibility calibration star is not needed, and the separated fringe
packets can provide an accurate vector separation. In this paper, we apply the
SFP approach to {\omega} Andromeda, HD 178911, and {\xi} Cephei with the CLIMB
three-beam combiner at the CHARA Array. For these systems we determine
component masses and parallax of 0.963${\pm}$0.049 $M_{\odot}$ and
0.860${\pm}$0.051 $M_{\odot}$ and 39.54${\pm}$1.85 milliarcseconds (mas) for
{\omega} Andromeda, for HD 178911 of 0.802${\pm}$0.055 $M_{\odot}$ and
0.622${\pm}$0.053 $M_{\odot}$ with 28.26${\pm}$1.70 mas, and masses of
1.045${\pm}$0.031 $M_{\odot}$ and 0.408${\pm}$0.066 $M_{\odot}$ and
38.10${\pm}$2.81 mas for {\xi} Cephei.
