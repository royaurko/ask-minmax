The determination of the folding mechanisms of proteins is critical to
understand the topological change that can propagate Alzheimer and
Creutzfeld-Jakobs diseases, among others. The computational community has paid
considerable attention to this problem; however, the associated time scale,
typically on the order of milliseconds or more, represents a formidable
challenge. Ab initio protein folding from long molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations or ensemble dynamics is not feasible with ordinary computing
facilities and new techniques must be introduced. Here we present a detailed
study of the folding of a 16-residue beta-hairpin, described by a generic
energy model and using the activation-relaxation technique. From a total of 90
trajectories at 300 K, three folding pathways emerge. All involve a
simultaneous optimization of the complete hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding
interactions. The first two follow closely those observed by previous
theoretical studies. The third pathway, never observed by previous all-atom
folding, unfolding and equilibrium simulations, can be described as a reptation
move of one strand of the beta-sheet with respect to the other. This reptation
move indicates that non-native interactions can play a dominant role in the
folding of secondary structures. These results point to a more complex folding
picture than expected for a simple beta-hairpin.
