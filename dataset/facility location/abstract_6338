A measurement of the tau- --> K- pi0 nu_tau branching fraction has been made
using 230.2 fb-1 of data recorded by the BABAR detector at the PEP-II e+ e-
collider, located at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), at a center
of mass energy sqrt{s} close to 10.58 GeV. We measure BF(tau- --> K- pi0
nu_tau) = (0.416 +/- 0.003 (stat) +/- 0.018 (syst)) %.
