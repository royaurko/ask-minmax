We report the detection of a possible subsolar mass companion to the triple
young system TY CrA using the NACO instrument at the VLT UT4 during its
commissioning. Assuming for TY CrA a distance similar to that of the close
binary system HD 176386, the photometric spectral type of this fourth stellar
component candidate is consistent with an ~M4 star. We discuss the dynamical
stability of this possible quadruple system as well as the possible location of
dusty particles inside or outside the system.
