By using laboratory x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and hard x-ray
photoemission spectroscopy (HX-PES) at a synchrotron facility, we report an
empirical semi-quantitative relationship between the valence/core-level x-ray
photoemission spectral weight and electrical conductivity in
La_{1-x}Sr_{x}MnO_{3} as a function of x. In the Mn 2p_{3/2} HX-PES spectra, we
observed the shoulder structure due to the Mn^{3+} well-screened state.
However, the intensity at x=0.8 was too small to explain its higher electrical
conductivity than x=0.0, which confirms our recent analysis on the Mn 2p_{3/2}
XPS spectra. The near-Fermi level XPS spectral weight was found to be a measure
of the variation of electrical conductivity with x in spite of a far lower
energy resolution compared with the energy scale of the quasiparticle
(coherent) peak because of the concurrent change of the coherent and incoherent
spectral weight.
