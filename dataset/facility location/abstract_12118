Gas at intermediate temperature between the hot X-ray emitting coronal gas in
galaxies at the centers of galaxy clusters, and the much cooler optical line
emitting filaments, yields information on transport processes and plausible
scenarios for the relationship between X-ray cool cores and other galactic
phenomena such as mergers or the onset of an active galactic nucleus. Hitherto,
detection of intermediate temperature gas has proven elusive. Here, we present
FUV imaging of the "low excitation" emission filaments of M87 and show strong
evidence for the presence of CIV 1549 A emission which arises in gas at
temperature ~10^5K co-located with Halpha+[NII] emission from cooler ~10^4K
gas. We infer that the hot and cool phases are in thermal communication, and
show that quantitatively the emission strength is consistent with thermal
conduction, which in turn may account for many of the observed characteristics
of cool core galaxy clusters.
