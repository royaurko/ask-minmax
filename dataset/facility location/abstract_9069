In this paper we have solved the hydrodynamic equations governing the
spherically symmetric isothermal accretion (wind) onto (away from) compact
objects using various pseudo-Schwarzschild potentials.These solutions are
essentially one parameter solutions in a sense that all relevant dynamical as
well as thermodynamic quantities for such a flow could be obtained (with the
assumption of a one-temperature fluid) if {\it only one} flow parameter
(temperature of the flow $T$) is given. Also we have investigated the transonic
behaviour of such a flow and showed that for a given $T$, transitions from
subsonic to the supersonic branch of accretion (wind) takes place at different
locations depending on the potentials used to study the flow and we have
identified these transition zones for flows in various such potentials.
