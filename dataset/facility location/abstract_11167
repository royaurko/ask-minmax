The minimal Universal Extra Dimension (mUED) model respects the Kaluza-Klein
(KK) parity $(-1)^n$, where $n$ is the KK number. However, it is possible to
have interactions located at only one of the two fixed points of the
$S_1/\ztwo$ orbifold. Such asymmetric interactions violate the KK parity. This
kills the cold dark matter component of UED but also removes the upper bound on
the inverse compactification radius, and thus non-observation of the KK
excitations even at the Large Hadron Collider does not necessarily invalidate
the model. Apart from the decay of the lightest $n=1$ KK excitation, this leads
to collider signals which are markedly different from those in the mUED
scenario. The phenomenological consequences of such KK-parity violating terms
are explored.
