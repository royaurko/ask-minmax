In this paper, we show that the pattern of microlensing light curve anomalies
induced by multiple planets are well described by the superposition of those of
the single-planet systems where the individual planet-primary binary pairs act
as independent lens systems. Since the outer deviation regions around the
planetary caustics of the individual planets occur in general at different
locations, we find that the pattern of anomalies in these regions are hardly
affected by the existence of other planet(s). This implies that even if an
event is caused by a multiple planetary system, a simple single-planet lensing
model is good enough for the description of most anomalies caused by the source
passage of the outer deviation regions. Detection of the anomalies resulting
from the source trajectory passing both the outer deviation regions caused by
more than two planets will provide a new channel of detecting multiple planets.
