As part of a broader study of kaon photoproduction on deuterium, the $\gamma
n \to K^{+} \Sigma^{-} $ channel was investigated. The data were acquired at
Jefferson Lab using the CLAS detector and the Photon-Tagging Facility installed
in Hall B.
  The photon energy range covered was from 0.50 to 2.95 GeV. For the present
analysis, the $\gamma n \to K^{+} \Sigma^{-}$ channel was identified by
detecting the positive kaon in coincidence with both decay products of the
$\Sigma^-$ hyperon, $\pi^-$ and $n$. Preliminary differential cross--sections
are shown as a function of the invariant energy W and the kaon polar angle in
the center of mass system.
