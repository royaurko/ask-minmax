The production of K+ and K- mesons in elementary proton-proton collision has
been investigated at the Cooler Synchrotron COSY in Juelich. A high quality
proton beam with low emittance and small momentum spread permitted to study the
creation of these mesons very close to the kinematical threshold. The energy
dependence of the total cross section is investigated using internal beam
facilities providing a high accuracy particle momentum determination as well as
an external non-magnetic detection setup with a large geometrical acceptance.
The determination of the four-momentum vectors for all ejectiles of each
registered event gives the complete kinematical information allowing to study
the interaction of the outgoing particles. Results on the performed studies of
the pp --> pp K+ K-, pp --> p Lambda K+ and pp --> p Sigma0 K+ reactions will
be presented and their relevance to the interpretation of heavy ion collisions
will be discussed.
