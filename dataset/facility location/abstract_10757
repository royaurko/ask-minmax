A continuous geometric description of Bravais monocrystals with many
dislocations and secondary point defects created by the distribution of these
dislocations is proposed. Namely, it is distinguished, basing oneself on Kondo
and Kroners Gedanken Experiments for dislocated bodies, an anholonomic triad of
linearly independent vector fields. The triad defines local crystallographic
directions of the defective crystal as well as a continuous counterpart of the
Burgers vector for single dislocations. Next, the influence of secondary point
defects on the distribution of many dislocations is modeled by treating these
local crystallographic directions as well as Burgers circuits as those located
in such a Riemannian material space that becomes an Euclidean 3-manifold when
dislocations are absent. Some consequences of this approach are discussed.
