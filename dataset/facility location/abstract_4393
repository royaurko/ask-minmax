We report the discovery of an unexpected symmetry that correlates the spin of
all elementary particles (integer versus half-integer) with the geographic
location of their initial discovery. We find that this correlation is
apparently perfect ($R = 1$), with an {\em a priori} probability of $P =
1/65536$ corresponding to a roughly $4.32 \sigma$ deviation from a random
distribution.
