The Major Atmospheric Gamma ray Imaging Cherenkov Telescope (MAGIC) is in
commissioning phase and will start to become fully operative by the end of
2003. Located at El Roque de los Muchachos in La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain),
it has the largest reflector area (17 m diameter) of all the existing Cherenkov
telescopes. New technologies have been used to reduce the energy threshold for
gamma-ray detection to about 30 GeV. Due to its characteristics, the catalog of
very high energy sources will considerably increase with the MAGIC
observations, anticipating exciting results for the near future. An overview of
the telescope, its current status and first results, together with a highlight
of the scientific research is presented.
