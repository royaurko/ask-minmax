A one-dimensional electromagnetic problem of Sommerfeld precursor evolution,
resulting from a finite rise-time signal excitation in a dispersive Lorentz
medium is considered. The effect of the initial signal rate of growth as well
as of the medium dumping on the precursor shape and its magnitude is discussed.
The analysis applied is based on an approach employing uniform asymptotic
expansions. In addition, new approximate formulas are given for the location of
the distant saddle points which affect local frequency and dumping of the
precursor. The results obtained are illustrated numerically and compared with
the results known from the literature.
