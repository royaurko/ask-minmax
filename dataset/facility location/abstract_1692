In the present paper, the phenomenological model developed by the contributors in
previous papers has been used to evaluate the degradation induced by hadron
irradiation at the future accelerator facilities or by cosmic protons in high
resistivity silicon detectors. The damage has been analysed at the microscopic
(defects production and their evolution toward equilibrium) and at the
macroscopic level (changes in the leakage current of the p-n junction). The
rates of production of primary defects, as well as their evolution toward
equilibrium have been evaluated considering explicitly the type of the
projectile particle and its energy. Vacancy-interstitial annihilation,
interstitial migration to sink, complex (VP, VO, CiOi, CiCs) and divacancy
formation are taken into account for different initial silicon material. The
influence of these defects on the leakage detector current has been calculated
in the frame of the Schokley-Read-Hall model.
