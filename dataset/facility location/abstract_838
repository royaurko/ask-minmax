The reaction mechanisms best suited for the production of neutron-rich
nuclei, fragmentation and fission, are discussed. Measurements of the
production cross sections of reaction residues together with model calculations
allow to conclude about the expected production rates of neutron-rich isotopes
in future facilities.
