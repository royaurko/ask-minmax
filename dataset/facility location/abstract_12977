Inhomogeneous exact solutions of General Relativity with zero cosmological
constant have been used in the literature to challenge the \Lambda CDM model.
From one patch Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) models to axially symmetric
quasi-spherical Szekeres (QSS) Swiss-cheese models, some of them are able to
reproduce to a good accuracy the cosmological data. It has been shown in the
literature that a zero-\Lambda -LTB model with a central observer can be fully
determined by two data sets. We demonstrate that an axially symmetric
zero-\Lambda -QSS model with an observer located at the origin can be fully
reconstructed from three data sets, number counts, luminosity distance and
redshift drift. This is a first step towards a future demonstration involving
five data sets and the most general Szekeres model.
