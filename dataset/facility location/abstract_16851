Z CMa is a young binary system consisting of an Herbig primary and a FU Ori
companion. Both components seem to be surrounded by active accretion disks and
a jet was associated to the Herbig B0. In Nov. 2008, K. Grankin discovered that
Z CMa was exhibiting an outburst with an amplitude larger than any photometric
variations recorded in the last 25 years. To study the innermost regions in
which the outburst occurs and understand its origin, we have observed both
binary components with AMBER/VLTI across the Br{\gamma} emission line in Dec.
2009 in medium and high spectral resolution modes. Our observations show that
the Herbig Be, responsible for the increase of luminosity, also produces a
strong Br{\gamma} emission, and they allow us to disentangle from various
origins by locating the emission at each velocities through the line.
Considering a model of a Keplerian disk alone fails at reproducing the
asymmetric spectro-astrometric measurements, suggesting a major contribution
from an outflow.
