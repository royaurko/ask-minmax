DIAMOND is a new synchrotron light source currently being designed in the UK.
The control system for DIAMOND will be a site wide monitoring and control
system for the accelerators, beamlines and conventional facilities. Initial
work on the control system has selected EPICS as the basis for the control
system design. The requirements of the control system are presented. The
technical solutions being considered to interface EPICS to the equipment being
controlled are discussed together with the requirements for configuration and
management of a large EPICS installation. Options being considered for the
procurement, installation and commissioning of the control system are also
presented.
