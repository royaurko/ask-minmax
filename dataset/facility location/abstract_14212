We consider a bipartite stochastic block model on vertex sets $V_1$ and $V_2$
of size $n_1$ and $n_2$ respectively, with planted partitions in each, and ask
at what densities can spectral algorithms recover the partition of the smaller
vertex set. The model was recently used by Feldman et al. to give a unified
algorithm for random planted hypergraph partitioning and planted random k-SAT.
  When $n_2 \gg n_1$, multiple thresholds emerge. We show that the singular
vectors of the rectangular adjacency matrix exhibit a localization /
delocalization phase transition at edge density $p = \tilde \Theta(n_1^{-2/3}
n_2^{-1/3})$, giving recovery above the threshold and no recovery below.
Nevertheless, we propose a simple spectral algorithm, Diagonal Deletion SVD,
which recovers the partition at density $p = \tilde \Theta(n_1^{-1/2}
n_2^{-1/2})$.
  Finally, we locate a sharp threshold for detection of the partition, in the
sense of the results of Mossel, Neeman, Sly and Massouli\'e for the stochastic
block model. This gives the best known bounds for efficient recovery densities
in planted k-SAT and hypergraph partitioning as well as showing a barrier to
further improvement via the reduction to the bipartite block model.
