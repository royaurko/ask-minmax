We present Very Low Mass stellar models as computed including non-grey model
atmospheres for selected assumptions about the star metallicities. The role of
atmospheres is discussed and the models are compared with models based on the
Eddington approximation and with similar models appeared in the recent
literature. Theoretical predictions concerning both the HR diagram location and
the mass-luminosity relation are presented and discussed in terms of
expectations in selected photometric bands. Comparison with available
observational data concerning both galactic globular clusters and dwarfs in the
solar neighborhood reveals a satisfactory agreement together with the existence
of some residual mismatches.
