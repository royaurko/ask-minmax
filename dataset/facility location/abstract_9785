We present a comparative study of both the magnetic and magnetotransport
properties for two members of the perovskite solid solution LaNixCo1-xO3
(x=0.2, 0.6) located on opposite sides of the chemically induced
metal-to-insulator transition. LaNi0.6Co0.4O3 exhibits metallic behavior and
small but negative magnetoresistance, whereas LaNi0.2Co0.8O3 exhibits
semiconducting behavior and giant negative magnetoresistance at low
temperatures. On the other hand, we observe pronounced similarities in the
magnetic properties of both compounds. A consistent explanation regarding the
origin of the magnetoresistance in the two members of the solid solution is
provided.
