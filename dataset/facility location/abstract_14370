The effect of an external magnetic field in QCD phase diagram, namely, in the
the location of the critical end point (CEP) is investigated. Using the 2+1
flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with Polyakov loop, it is shown that when an
external magnetic field is applied its effect on the CEP depends on the
strength of the coupling. If the coupling depends on the magnetic field,
allowing for inverse magnetic catalysis, the CEP moves to lower chemical
potentials eventually disappearing, and the chiral restoration phase transition
is always of first order.
