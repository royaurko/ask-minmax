In multivariate or spatial extremes, inference for max-stable processes
observed at a large collection of locations is among the most challenging
problems in computational statistics, and current approaches typically rely on
less expensive composite likelihoods constructed from small subsets of data. In
this work, we explore the limits of modern state-of-the-art computational
facilities to perform full likelihood inference and to efficiently evaluate
high-order composite likelihoods. With extensive simulations, we assess the
loss of information of composite likelihood estimators with respect to a full
likelihood approach for some widely-used multivariate or spatial extreme
models, we discuss how to choose composite likelihood truncation to improve the
efficiency, and we also provide recommendations for practitioners.
