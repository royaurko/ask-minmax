The aim of this paper is to provide models for spatial extremes in the case
of stationarity. The spatial dependence at extreme levels of a stationary
process is modeled using an extension of the theory of max-stable processes of
de Haan and Pickands [Probab. Theory Related Fields 72 (1986) 477--492]. We
propose three one-dimensional and three two-dimensional models. These models
depend on just one parameter or a few parameters that measure the strength of
tail dependence as a function of the distance between locations. We also
propose two estimators for this parameter and prove consistency under domain of
attraction conditions and asymptotic normality under appropriate extra
conditions.
