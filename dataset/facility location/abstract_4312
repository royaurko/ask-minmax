The most famous geoglyphs of Peru are the "Nazca Lines". Considered as one of
the mysteries of the ancient world, they have been included among the UNESCO
World Heritage Sites. Located in a large region between the towns of Nazca and
Palpa, these lines create shapes of animals ranging in size up to 300 m. The
archaeological site is under investigation with remote science technologies.
