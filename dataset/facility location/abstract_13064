General properties of the transport of charge carriers (electrons and holes)
in disordered organic materials are discussed. It was demonstrated that the
dominant part of the total energetic disorder in organic material is usually
provided by the electrostatic disorder, generated by randomly located and
oriented dipoles and quadrupoles. For this reason this disorder is strongly
spatially correlated. Spatial correlation directly governs the field dependence
of the carrier drift mobility. Shape of the current transients, which is of
primary importance for a correct determination of the carrier mobility, is
considered. A notable feature of the electrostatic disorder is its modification
in the vicinity of the electrode, and this modification takes place without
modification of the structure of the material. It is shown how this phenomenon
affects characteristics of the charge injection. We consider also effect of
inter-charge interaction on charge transport.
