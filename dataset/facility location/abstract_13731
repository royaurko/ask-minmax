We experimentally study the spin dynamics of mesoscopic ensembles of
ultracold magnetic spin-3 atoms located in two separated wells of an optical
dipole trap. We use a radio-frequency sweep to selectively flip the spin of the
atoms in one of the wells, which produces two separated spin domains of
opposite polarization. We observe that these engineered spin domains are
metastable with respect to the long-range magnetic dipolar interactions between
the two ensembles. The absence of inter-cloud dipolar spin-exchange processes
reveals a classical behavior, in contrast to previous results with atoms loaded
in an optical lattice. When we merge the two subsystems, we observe
spin-exchange dynamics due to contact interactions which enable the first
determination of the s-wave scattering length of 52Cr atoms in the S=0
molecular channel a_0=13.5^{+11}_{-10.5}a_B (where a_B is the Bohr radius).
