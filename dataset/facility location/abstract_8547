We present the concept and preliminary design of the Galileo OH Subtracted
Spectrograph [GOHSS], a multifibre NIR spectrograph for faint objects. The
instrument represents a collaboration between the Institute of Astronomy,
Cambridge and the Observatories of Naples and Rome and will be a second-light
instrument for the 3.6m Galileo telescope located on La Palma. The NIR
spectrograph accomplishes OH night-sky suppression in a different way from the
hardware solution used by both OHS (Maihara etal) and COHSI (Piche' et al).
GOHSS provides a multiechelle design with software subtraction capable of
yielding ~28 spectra in J+H bands at a spectral resolution R~3000. Such a
resolution is the minimum necessary to reduce the impact of atmospheric OH
lines.
