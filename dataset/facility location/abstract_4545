We show the existence of an exact ground state in certain parameter regimes
of one-dimensional half-filled extended Hubbard model with site-off-diagonal
interactions. In this ground state, the bond-located spin correlation exhibits
a long-range order. In the case when the spin space is SU(2) symmetric, this
ground state degenerates with higher spin states including a fully
ferromagnetic state. We also discuss the relation between the exact
bond-ordered ground state and the critical bond-spin-density-wave phase.
