In July 2009, the leading spot of the active region NOAA11024 was observed
simultaneously and independently with the 'Goettingen' FPI at VTT and CRISP at
SST, i.e., at two different sites, telescopes, instruments and using different
spectral lines. The data processing and data analysis have been carried out
independently with different techniques. Maps of physical parameters retrieved
from 2D spectro-polarimetric data observed with 'Goettingen' FPI and CRISP show
an impressive agreement. In addition, the 'Goettingen' FPI maps also exhibit a
notable resemblance with simultaneous TIP (spectrographic) observations. The
consistency in the results demonstrates the excellent capabilities of these
observing facilities. Besides, it confirms the solar origin of the detected
signals, and the reliability of FPI-based spectro-polarimeters.
