We present new results of timing and single pulse measurements for 18 radio
pulsars discovered in 1993 - 1997 by the Penn State/NRL declination-strip
survey conducted with the 305-m Arecibo telescope at 430 MHz. Long-term timing
measurements have led to significant improvements of the rotational and the
astrometric parameters of these sources, including the millisecond pulsar, PSR
J1709+2313, and the pulsar located within the supernova remnant S147, PSR
J0538+2817. Single pulse studies of the brightest objects in the sample have
revealed an unusual "bursting" pulsar, PSR J1752+2359, two new drifting
subpulse pulsars, PSR J1649+2533 and PSR J2155+2813, and another example of a
pulsar with profile mode changes, PSR J1746+2540. PSR J1752+2359 is
characterized by bursts of emission, which appear once every 3-5 min. and decay
exponentially on a ~45 sec timescale. PSR J1649+2533 spends ~30% of the time in
a null state with no detectable radio emission.
