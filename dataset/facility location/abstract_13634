The penetrating ability of cosmic ray muons makes them an attractive probe
for imaging dense materials. Here, we describe experimental results from a new
technique that uses neutrons generated by cosmic-ray muons to identify the
presence of special nuclear material (SNM). Neutrons emitted from SNM are used
to tag muon-induced fission events in actinides and laminography is used to
form images of the stopping material. This technique allows the imaging of
SNM-bearing objects tagged using muon tracking detectors located above or to
the side of the objects, and may have potential applications in warhead
verification scenarios. During the experiment described here we did not attempt
to distinguish the type or grade of the SNM.
