We review a new approach to calculating transverse momentum distributions of
the Higgs and electroweak gauge bosons using the Soft-Collinear Effective
Theory. We derive a factorization theorem for transverse momentum distributions
in terms of newly-defined impact-parameter beam functions (iBFs) and an inverse
soft function (iSF). The iBFs correspond to completely unintegrated parton
distribution functions and provide interesting probes of momentum distributions
within nucleons. The numerical matching between the low and high transverse
momentum regions is improved in this approach with respect to standard
techniques. We present results for next-to-leading logarithmic resummation for
the Higgs and Z-boson distributions and give a comparison with Tevatron data.
