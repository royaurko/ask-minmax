Consistently superb observing conditions are crucial for achieving the
scientific objectives of a telescope. Submillimeter astronomy is possible only
at a few exceptionally dry sites, notably Mauna Kea, the Antarctic plateau, and
the Chajnantor region in the high Andes east of San Pedro de Atacama in
northern Chile. Long term measurements of 225 GHz and 350 \mu m atmospheric
transparency demonstrate all three locations enjoy significant periods of
excellent observing conditions. Conditions on the Chajnantor plateau and at the
South Pole are better more often than on Mauna Kea. Conditions are better
during winter and at night. Near the summit of Cerro Chajnantor, conditions are
better than on the Chajnantor plateau.
