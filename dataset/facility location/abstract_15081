We investigate the effects of rotation on the behavior of the helium burning
shell source in accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, in the context of the
single degenerate Chandrasekhar mass progenitor scenario for Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia). We model the evolution of helium accreting white dwarfs of initially
1 Msun, assuming four different constant accretion rates (2, 3, 5 and 10
times10^{-7} Msun/yr). In a one-dimensional approximation, we compute the mass
accretion and subsequent nuclear fusion of helium into carbon and oxygen, as
well as angular momentum accretion, angular momentum transport inside the white
dwarf, and rotationally induced chemical mixing. Our models show two major
effects of rotation: a) The helium burning nuclear shell source in the rotating
models is much more stable than in corresponding non-rotating models -- which
increases the likelihood of accreting white dwarfs to reach the stage of
central carbon ignition. This effect is mainly due to rotationally induced
mixing at the CO/He interface which widens the shell source, and due to the
centrifugal force lowering the density and degeneracy at the shell source
location. b) The C/O-ratio in the layers which experience helium shell burning
-- which may affect the energy of a SN Ia explosion -- is strongly decreased by
the rotationally induced mixing of alpha-particles into the carbon-rich layers.
We discuss implications of our results for the evolution of SNe Ia progenitors.
