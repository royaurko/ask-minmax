We present a generic API suitable for provision of highly generic storage
facilities that can be tailored to produce various individually customised
storage infrastructures. The paper identifies a candidate set of minimal
storage system building blocks, which are sufficiently simple to avoid
encapsulating policy where it cannot be customised by applications, and
composable to build highly flexible storage architectures. Four main generic
components are defined: the store, the namer, the caster and the interpreter.
It is hypothesised that these are sufficiently general that they could act as
building blocks for any information storage and retrieval system. The essential
characteristics of each are defined by an interface, which may be implemented
by multiple implementing classes.
