In context of increasing use of renewable sources, it is of importance to
correctly evaluate the actual sustainability of their implementation. Emergy
analysis is one of the possible methods useful for such an assessment. This
work aims to demonstrate how the emergy approach can be used to assess the
sustainability of wind energy resource in Europe. The Emergy Index of
Sustainability (EIS) and the Emergy Yield Ratio (EYR) are used to analyze 90
stations of European regions for three types of wind turbines. To do so, the
simplified Chou wind turbine model is used for different set of parameters as:
nominal power and size of the wind turbines, and cut-in and cut-out wind
speeds. Based on the calculation of the emergy indices, a mapping is proposed
to identify the most appropriate locations for an implementation of wind
turbines in European regions. The influence of the wind turbine type on the
sustainability is also analyzed, in link with the local wind resource. Thus, it
is concluded that the emergy sustainability indices are sensitive to the wind
turbine design parameters (size, cut-in and cut-out wind speed).
