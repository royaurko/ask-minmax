We discuss the ability of the GLAST Large Area Telescope (LAT) to identify,
resolve, and study the high energy gamma-ray sky. Compared to previous
instruments the telescope will have greatly improved sensitivity and ability to
localize gamma-ray point sources. The ability to resolve the location and
identity of EGRET unidentified sources is described. We summarize the current
knowledge of the high energy gamma-ray sky and discuss the astrophysics of
known and some prospective classes of gamma-ray emitters. In addition, we also
describe the potential of GLAST to resolve old puzzles and to discover new
classes of sources.
