The LHC is made of eight circular arcs interspaced with eight Long Straight
Sections (LSS). Most powering interfaces to the LHC are located in these
sections where the particle beams are focused and shaped for collision,
cleaning and acceleration. The LSSs are constituted of several unique cryogenic
devices and systems like electrical feed-boxes, standalone superconducting
magnets, superconducting links, RF cavities and final focusing superconducting
magnets. This paper presents the cryogenic commissioning and the main results
obtained during the first operation of the LHC Long Straight Sections.
