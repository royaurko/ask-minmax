We report on experimental and theoretical results for the photoionization of
Ag-like xenon ions, Xe$^{7+}$, in the photon energy range 95 to 145~eV. The
measurements were carried out at the Advanced Light Source at an energy
resolution of $\Delta$E = 65 meV with additional measurements made at $\Delta$E
= 28 meV and 39 meV. Small resonance features below the ground-state ionization
threshold, at about 106 eV, are due to the presence of metastable Xe$^{7+}
(4d^{10} 4f~^2{\rm F}^{\circ}_{5/2,7/2})$ ions in the ion beam. On the basis of
the accompanying theoretical calculations using the Dirac Atomic R-matrix Codes
(DARC), an admixture of only a few percent of metastable ions in the parent ion
beam is inferred, with almost 100\% of the parent ions in the $(4d^{10}5s
~^2{\rm S_{1/2}})$ ground level. The cross-section is dominated by a very
strong resonance associated with $4d \rightarrow 5f$ excitation and subsequent
autoionization. This prominent feature in the measured spectrum is the
$4d^95s5f ~^2{\rm P}^{\circ}$ resonance located at (122.139 $\pm$ 0.01)~eV. An
absolute peak cross-section of 1.2 Gigabarns was measured at 38 meV energy
resolution. The experimental natural width $\Gamma$ = 76 $\pm$ 3 meV of this
resonance compares well with the theoretical estimate of 88 meV obtained from
the DARC calculation with 249 target states. Given the complexity of the
system, overall satisfactory agreement between theory and experiment is
obtained for the photon energy region investigated.
