We resolve an existing question concerning the location of the mobility edge
for operators with a hopping term and a random potential on the Bethe lattice.
The model has been among the earliest studied for Anderson localization, and it
continues to attract attention because of analogies which have been suggested
with localization issues for many particle systems. We find that extended
states appear through disorder enabled resonances well beyond the energy band
of the operator's hopping term. For weak disorder this includes a Lifshits tail
regime of very low density of states.
