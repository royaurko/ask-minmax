We present a new analysis of a 9-day long XMM-Newton monitoring of the Narrow
Line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 766. We show that the strong changes in spectral
shape which occurred during this observation can be interpreted as due to Broad
Line Region clouds crossing the line of sight to the X-ray source. Within the
occultation scenario, the spectral and temporal analysis of the eclipses
provides precise estimates of the geometrical structure, location and physical
properties of the absorbing clouds. In particular, we show that these clouds
have cores with column densities of at least a few 10^23 cm^-2 and velocities
in the plane of the sky of the order of thousands km/s. The three different
eclipses monitored by XMM-Newton suggest a broad range in cloud velocities (by
a factor ~4-5). Moreover, two iron absorption lines clearly associated with
each eclipse suggest the presence of highly ionized gas around the obscuring
clouds, and an outflow component of the velocity spanning from 3,000 to 15,000
km/s
