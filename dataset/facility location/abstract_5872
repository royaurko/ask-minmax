We present various concepts and experimental procedures to produce
biepitaxial YBaCuO grain boundary Josephson junctions. The device properties
have an interesting phenomenology related in part to the possible influence of
"pai loops". The performance of our junctions and Superconducting Quantum
Interference Devices indicates significant improvement in the biepitaxial
technique. Further, we propose methods for fabricating circuits in which "0-"
and "pai-loops" are controllably located on the same chip.
