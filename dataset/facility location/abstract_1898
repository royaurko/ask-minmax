Propagation of intense laser beams is crucial for inertial confinement
fusion, which requires precise beam control to achieve the compression and
heating necessary to ignite the fusion reaction. The National Ignition Facility
(NIF), where fusion will be attempted, is now under construction. Control of
intense beam propagation may be ruined by laser beam self-focusing. We have
identified the maximum laser beam power that can propagate through fusion
plasma without significant self-focusing and have found excellent agreement
with recent experimental data, and suggest a way to increase that maximum by
appropriate choice of plasma composition with implication for NIF designs. Our
theory also leads to the prediction of anti-correlation between beam spray and
backscatter and suggests the indirect control of backscatter through
manipulation of plasma ionization state or acoustic damping.
