In many physical systems, dynamics is ruled by structures of atypical
chaoticity. These structures may occupy a very small volume in phase space and
can thus be very difficult to locate numerically. In this article, we review an
algorithm, the Lyapunov Weighted Dynamics, which efficiently reveals
trajectories of atypical chaoticity.
