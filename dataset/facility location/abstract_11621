We study the QCD phase diagram, in particular we study the critical points of
the two main QCD phase transitions, confinement and chiral symmetry breaking.
Confinement drives chiral symmetry breaking, and, due to the finite quark mass,
at small density both transitions are a crossover, while they are a first or
second order phase transition in large density. We study the QCD phase diagram
with a quark potential model including both confinement and chiral symmetry.
This formalism, in the Coulomb gauge hamiltonian formalism of QCD, is presently
the only one able to microscopically include both a quark-antiquark confining
potential and a vacuum condensate of quark-antiquark pairs. This model is able
to address all the excited hadrons, and chiral symmetry breaking, at the same
token. Our order parameters are the Polyakov loop and the quark mass gap. The
confining potential is extracted from the Lattice QCD data of the Bielefeld
group. We address how the quark masses affect the critical point location in
the phase diagram.
