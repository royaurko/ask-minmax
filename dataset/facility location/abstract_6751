In this short paper, we prove a well-posedness theorem for the massive wave
equation (with the mass satisfying the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound) on
asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces. The solution is constructed as a limit of
solutions to an initial boundary value problem with boundary at a finite
location in spacetime by finally pushing the boundary out to infinity. The
solution obtained is unique within the energy class (but non-unique if the
decay at infinity is weakened).
