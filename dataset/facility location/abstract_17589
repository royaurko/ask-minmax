Bright-rimmed clouds (BRCs), illuminated and shaped by nearby OB stars, are
potential sites of recent/ongoing star formation. Here we present an optical
and infrared photometric study of three BRCs: BRC 5, BRC 7 and BRC 39 to obtain
a census of the young stellar population, thereby inferring the star formation
scenario, in these regions. In each BRC, the Class I sources are found to be
located mostly near the bright rim or inside the cloud, whereas the Class II
sources are preferentially outside, with younger sources closer to the rim.
This provides strong support to sequential star formation triggered by
radiation driven implosion due to the UV radiation. Moreover, each BRC contains
a small group of young stars being revealed at its head, as the next-generation
stars. In particular, the young stars at the heads of BRC 5 and BRC 7 are found
to be intermediate/high mass stars, which, under proper conditions, may
themselves trigger further star birth, thereby propagating star formation out
to long distances.
