We present a description of the CL-based package XDSPRES, which aims at being
a complete reducing facility for cross-dispersed spectra taken with the Ohio
State Infrared Imager/Spectrometer, as installed at the SOAR telescope. This
instrument provides spectra in the range between 1.2um and 2.35um in a single
exposure, with resolving power of R ~ 1200. XDSPRES consists of two tasks,
namely xdflat and doosiris. The former is a completely automated code for
preparing normalized flat field images from raw flat field exposures. Doosiris
was designed to be a complete reduction pipeline, requiring a minimum of user
interaction. General steps towards a fully reduced spectrum are explained, as
well as the approach adopted by our code. The software is available to the
community through the web site http://www.if.ufrgs.br/~ruschel/software.
