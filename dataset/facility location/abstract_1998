We apply a coupled transport-hydrodynamics model to discuss the production of
multi-strange meta-stable objects in Pb+Pb reactions at the FAIR facility. In
addition to making predictions for yields of these particles we are able to
calculate particle dependent rapidity and momentum distributions. We argue that
the FAIR energy regime is the optimal place to search for multi-strange
baryonic object (due to the high baryon density, favouring a distillation of
strangeness). Additionally, we show results for strangeness and baryon density
fluctuations. Using the UrQMD model we calculate the strangeness seperation in
phase space which might lead to an enhanced production of MEMOs compared to
models that assume global thermalization.
