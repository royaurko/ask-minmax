In this paper we present a detailed study of the intra-cluster reddening
material in the young open clusters located around $l \sim 130^o$ using
colour-excess diagrams and two-colour diagrams. The study supports the
universality of the extinction curves for $\lambda \geq \lambda_J$, whereas for
shorter wavelengths the curve depends upon the value of the $R_{cluster}$
(total-to-selective absorption in the cluster region). The value of
$R_{cluster}$ in the case of NGC 654, NGC 869 and NGC 884 is found to be
normal, whereas the value of $R_{cluster}$ in the cluster regions NGC 1502 and
IC 1805 indicates an anomalous reddening law in these regions. It is also found
that the extinction process in the $U$ band in the case of NGC 663 seems to be
less efficient, whereas in the case of NGC 869 the process is more efficient.
