Spectral modeling of the large infrared excess in the Spitzer IRS spectra of
HD 172555 suggests that there is more than 10^19 kg of sub-micron dust in the
system. Using physical arguments and constraints from observations, we rule out
the possibility of the infrared excess being created by a magma ocean planet or
a circumplanetary disk or torus. We show that the infrared excess is consistent
with a circumstellar debris disk or torus, located at approximately 6 AU, that
was created by a planetary scale hypervelocity impact. We find that radiation
pressure should remove submicron dust from the debris disk in less than one
year. However, the system's mid-infrared photometric flux, dominated by
submicron grains, has been stable within 4 percent over the last 27 years, from
IRAS (1983) to WISE (2010). Our new spectral modeling work and calculations of
the radiation pressure on fine dust in HD 172555 provide a self-consistent
explanation for this apparent contradiction. We also explore the unconfirmed
claim that 10^47 molecules of SiO vapor are needed to explain an emission
feature at 8 um in the Spitzer IRS spectrum of HD 172555. We find that unless
there are 10^48 atoms or 0.05 Earth masses of atomic Si and O vapor in the
system, SiO vapor should be destroyed by photo-dissociation in less than 0.2
years. We argue that a second plausible explanation for the 8 um feature can be
emission from solid SiO, which naturally occurs in submicron silicate "smokes"
created by quickly condensing vaporized silicate.
