The Cluster Wideband Data instrument has been used to determine the locations
of auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) using very long baseline interferometry.
The technique involves cross-correlating individual AKR bursts from all six
Cluster baselines using time and frequency filtered waveforms. We report the
locations of over 1,700 individual AKR bursts during six observing epochs
between 10 July 2002 and 22 January 2003 when the Cluster constellation was
high above the southern or northern hemisphere. In general we find that the AKR
burst locations lie along magnetic field lines which map onto the nighttime
auroral zone as expected from previous AKR studies. The distribution of AKR
auroral footprint locations at each epoch had a overall spatial scale between
1000 - 2000 km, much larger than the positional uncertainty of an individual
AKR burst location magnetic footprint, but a small fraction of the auroral
oval. For two of the six epochs, there was a significant drift in the mean
location of AKR activity over a period of 1-2 hours. The drift was
predominantly in latitude at one epoch and in longitude at the other, with
average drift speed V ~ 80-90 m s-1 at the AKR emission location.
