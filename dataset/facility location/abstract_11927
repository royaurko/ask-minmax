We present a new method to search for heavy nuclei sources, on top of
background, in the Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray data. We apply it to the 69
events with energies E>55 EeV published by the Pierre Auger Collaboration. We
find a set of events for which the method reconstructs the source near the
Virgo galaxy cluster. The probability to have a comparable set of events in
some background is ~ 0.7 %. The reconstructed source is located at ~ 8.5
degrees from the active galaxy M87. The probability to reconstruct the source
at less than 10 degrees from M87 for data already containing a comparable set
of events is ~ 0.4 %. This may be a hint at the Virgo galaxy cluster as an
ultra-high energy heavy nuclei source. We discuss the capability of current and
near future experiments to test this possibility. Such a scenario gives a
self-consistent description of the Auger anisotropy and composition data at the
highest energies.
