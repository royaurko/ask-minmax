The 2D time dependent solution of thin accretion disk in a close binary
system have been presented on the equatorial plane around the Schwarzschild
black hole. To do that, the special part of the General Relativistic
Hydrodynamical(GRH) equations are solved using High Resolution Shock Capturing
(HRSC) schemes. The spiral shock waves on the accretion disk are modeled using
perfect fluid equation of state with adiabatic indices $\gamma = 1.05, 1.2$ and
5/3. The results show that the spiral shock waves are created for gammas except
the case $\gamma=5/3$. These results consistent with results from Newtonian
hydrodynamic code except close to black hole. Newtonian approximation does not
give good solution while matter closes to black hole. Our simulations
illustrate that the spiral shock waves are created close to black hole and the
location of inner radius of spiral shock wave is around $10M$ and it depends on
the specific heat rates. We also find that the smaller $\gamma$ is the more
tightly the spiral winds.
