The gravitational wave resonant detectors can be used as detectors of quark
nuggets, like nuclearites (nuclear matter with a strange quark). This search
has been carried out using data from two 2350 Kg, 2 K cooled, aluminum bar
detectors: NAUTILUS, located in Frascati (Italy), and EXPLORER, that was
located in CERN Geneva (CH). Both antennas are equipped with cosmic ray shower
detectors: signals in the bar due to showers are continuously detected and used
to characterize the antenna performances. The bar excitation mechanism is based
on the so called thermo-acoustic effect, studied on dedicated experiments that
use particle beams. This mechanism predicts that vibrations of bars are induced
by the heat deposited in the bar from the particle. The geometrical acceptance
of the bar detectors is 19.5 $\rm m^2$ sr, that is smaller than that of other
detectors used for similar searches. However, the detection mechanism is
completely different and is more straightforward than in other detectors. We
will show the results of ten years of data from NAUTILUS (2003-2012) and 7
years from EXPLORER (2003-2009). The experimental limits we obtain are of
interest because, for nuclearites of mass less than $10^{-4}$ grams, we find a
flux smaller than that one predicted considering nuclearites as dark matter
candidates.
