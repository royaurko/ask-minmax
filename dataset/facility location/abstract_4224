Gauged supergravities (in four and five dimensions) with eight supercharges
and with vector supermultiplets have a unique ultra-violet (UV) fixed point on
a given physical domain \cal M of the space of the scalar fields. We show that
in these models the infra-red (IR) fixed points are located on the boundary of
\cal M, where the space-time metric becomes singular.
