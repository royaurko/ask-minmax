We demonstrate that the application of any external uniform non-abelian gauge
background, no matter how small, leads to a greatly enhanced degeneracy. This
degeneracy is so large that even a non-abelian background field of
infinitesimal strength leads to a shocking change in the thermodynamics. The
critical temperature might be discontinuously depressed and an "avoided
critical point" will emerge. Similar models were previously employed to
describe the micropscopics of metallic glasses and correctly predicted the
locations of the structure factor peaks. We will compare one of the fitted
parameters in these plots (the magnitude of the "avoided critical temperature"
for each of the supercooled liquids) and demonstrate that, on average, these
might be well predicted by our microscopic picture. We find a generalized
version of the Mermin-Wagner inequality which connects the magnitude of the
order parameter (the absence of entropic effects) to the characteristic
relaxation times present in any system. We derive Vogel-Fulcher dynamics for a
multitude of glass models (including non-Abelian gauge backgrounds), and try to
fortify earlier ideas suggesting avoided critical dynamics.
