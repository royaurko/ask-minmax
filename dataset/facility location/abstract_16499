We present photometric observations of the dwarf nova 1RXS J053234.9+624755.
We performed a detailed analysis of the superoutburst that occurred in August
2009. We found the superhump period to be P_sh=0.057122(14)days. Based on the
O-C diagram we conclude that P_sh increased during the plateau at the rate of
dP_sh/dt=(9.24 +- 1.4) * 10^-5. Both the O-C analysis and evolution of the
superhumps light curve favour the model in which superhumps originate in a
variable source located in the vicinity of the hot spot. In addition, the
evolution of the light curve suggests that the superhump light source
approaches the disc plane as the superoutburst declines. Detailed analysis of
the superoutburst plateau phase enabled us to detect a signal which we
interpret as apsidal motion of the accretion disc. We detected additional
modulations during the final stage of the superoutburst characterized by
periods of 104s and 188s which we tentatively interpret as quasi periodic
oscillations. Estimations of A_0 and A_n are in agreement with the dependence
discovered by Smak (2010) between the amplitude of superhumps and the orbital
inclination.
