We demonstrate the existence of a spectrally narrow localized surface state,
the so-called optical Tamm state, at the interface between a 1D magnetophotonic
and non-magnetic photonic crystals. The state is spectrally located inside the
photonic band gaps of each of the photonic crystals comprising this
magnetophotonic structure. This state is associated with a sharp transmission
peak through the sample and is responsible for the substantial enhancement of
the Faraday rotation for the corresponding wavelength. The experimental results
are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions.
