Empirical probability models for BATSE GRB location errors are developed via
a Bayesian analysis of the separations between BATSE GRB locations and
locations obtained with the InterPlanetary Network (IPN). Models are compared
and their parameters estimated using 392 GRBs with single IPN annuli and 19
GRBs with intersecting IPN annuli. Most of the analysis is for the 4Br BATSE
catalog; earlier catalogs are also analyzed. The simplest model that provides a
good representation of the error distribution has 78% of the probability in a
`core' term with a systematic error of 1.85 degrees and the remainder in an
extended tail with a systematic error of 5.1 degrees, implying a 68% confidence
radius for bursts with negligible statistical uncertainties of 2.2 degrees.
There is evidence for a more complicated model in which the error distribution
depends on the BATSE datatype that was used to obtain the location. Bright
bursts are typically located using the CONT datatype, and according to the more
complicated model, the 68% confidence radius for CONT-located bursts with
negligible statistical uncertainties is 2.0 degrees.
