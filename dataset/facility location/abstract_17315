In this paper, we study the problem of moving $n$ sensors on a line to form a
barrier coverage of a specified segment of the line such that the maximum
moving distance of the sensors is minimized. Previously, it was an open
question whether this problem on sensors with arbitrary sensing ranges is
solvable in polynomial time. We settle this open question positively by giving
an $O(n^2 \log n)$ time algorithm. For the special case when all sensors have
the same-size sensing range, the previously best solution takes $O(n^2)$ time.
We present an $O(n \log n)$ time algorithm for this case; further, if all
sensors are initially located on the coverage segment, our algorithm takes
$O(n)$ time. Also, we extend our techniques to the cycle version of the problem
where the barrier coverage is for a simple cycle and the sensors are allowed to
move only along the cycle. For sensors with the same-size sensing range, we
solve the cycle version in $O(n)$ time, improving the previously best $O(n^2)$
time solution.
