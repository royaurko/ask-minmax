The zero-temperature TAP equations for the spin-1 Ghatak-Sherrington model
are investigated. The spin-glass energy density (ground state) is determined as
a function of the anisotropy crystal field $D$ for a large number of spins.
This allows us to locate a first-order transition between the spin-glass and
paramagnetic phases within a good accuracy. The total number of solutions is
also determined as a function of $D$.
