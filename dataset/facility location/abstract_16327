We analyze a class of Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise-Ratio (SINR) random
graphs. These random graphs arise in the modeling packet transmissions in
wireless networks. In contrast to previous studies on the SINR graphs, we
consider both a space and a time dimension. The spatial aspect originates from
the random locations of the network nodes in the Euclidean plane. The time
aspect stems from the random transmission policy followed by each network node
and from the time variations of the wireless channel characteristics. The
combination of these random space and time aspects leads to fluctuations of the
SINR experienced by the wireless channels, which in turn determine the
progression of packets in space and time in such a network. This paper studies
optimal paths in such wireless networks in terms of first passage percolation
on this random graph. We establish both "positive" and "negative" results on
the associated time constant. The latter determines the asymptotics of the
minimum delay required by a packet to progress from a source node to a
destination node when the Euclidean distance between the two tends to infinity.
The main negative result states that this time constant is infinite on the
random graph associated with a Poisson point process under natural assumptions
on the wireless channels. The main positive result states that when adding a
periodic node infrastructure of arbitrarily small intensity to the Poisson
point process, the time constant is positive and finite.
