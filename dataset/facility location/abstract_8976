We analyze the structural parameters of the largest-available sample of
spatially resolved extragalactic globular clusters. The images of M31 GCs were
found in a search of HST archival data, described in a companion paper. We
measure the ellipticities and position angles of the clusters and conclude that
the ellipticities are consistent with being caused by rotation. We find that
most clusters' surface brightness distributions are well-fit by two-dimensional
single-mass Michie-King models. A few clusters show possible power-law
distributions characteristic of core-collapse, but the spatial resolution is
not high enough to make definitive claims. As has been found for other
galaxies, the metal-rich clusters are slightly smaller than the metal-poor
clusters. There are strong correlations between structural properties of M31
GCs, as for Milky Way clusters, and the two populations are located close to
the same `fundamental plane' in parameter space.
