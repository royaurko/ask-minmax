In the context of a relativistic hot spot model, we investigate different
physical mechanisms to explain the behavior of quasi-periodic oscillations
(QPOs) from accreting black holes. The locations and amplitudes of the QPO
peaks are determined by the ray-tracing calculations presented in Schnittman &
Bertschinger (2004a): the black hole mass and angular momentum give the
geodesic coordinate frequencies, while the disk inclination and the hot spot
size, shape, and overbrightness give the amplitudes of the different peaks. In
this paper additional features are added to the existing model to explain the
broadening of the QPO peaks as well as the damping of higher frequency
harmonics in the power spectrum. We present a number of analytic results that
closely agree with more detailed numerical calculations. Four primary pieces
are developed: the addition of multiple hot spots with random phases, a finite
width in the distribution of geodesic orbits, Poisson sampling of the detected
photons, and the scattering of photons from the hot spot through a corona of
hot electrons around the black hole. Finally, the complete model is used to fit
the observed power spectra of both type A and type B QPOs seen in XTE
J1550-564, giving confidence limits on each of the model parameters.
