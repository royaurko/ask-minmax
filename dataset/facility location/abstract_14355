We consider the Hamiltonian $\hat {\mathrm{H}}_{\mu}$ of a system of three
identical particles(bosons) on the $d-$ dimensional lattice $\Z^d, d=1,2$
interacting via pairwise zero-range attractive potential $\mu<0$. We describe
precise location and structure of the essential spectrum of the Schr\"odinger
operator $H_\mu(K),K\in \T^d$ associated to $\hat {\mathrm{H}}_\mu$ and prove
the finiteness of the number of bound states of $H_\mu(K),K\in \T^d$ lying
below the bottom of the essential spectrum. Moreover, we show that bound states
decay exponentially at infinity and eigenvalues and corresponding bound states
of $H_\mu(K),K\in \T^d$ are regular as a function of center of mass
quasi-momentum $K\in \T^d$.
