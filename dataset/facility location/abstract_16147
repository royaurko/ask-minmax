The early steps of light response occur in the outer segment of rod and cone
photoreceptor. They involve the hydrolysis of cGMP, a soluble cyclic
nucleotide, that gates ionic channels located in the outer segment membrane. We
shall study here the rate by which cGMP is hydrolyzed by activated
phosphodiesterase (PDE). This process has been characterized experimentally by
two different rate constants $\beta_d$ and $\beta_{sub}$: $\beta_d$ accounts
for the effect of all spontaneously active PDE in the outer segment, and
$\beta_{sub}$ characterizes cGMP hydrolysis induced by a single light-activated
PDE. So far, no attempt has been made to derive the experimental values of
$\beta_d$ and $\beta_{sub}$ from a theoretical model, which is the goal of this
work. Using a model of diffusion in the confined rod geometry, we derive
analytical expressions for $\beta_d$ and $\beta_{sub}$ by calculating the flux
of cGMP molecules to an activated PDE site. We obtain the dependency of these
rate constants as a function of the outer segment geometry, the PDE activation
and deactivation rates and the aqueous cGMP diffusion constant. Our formulas
show good agreement with experimental measurements. Finally, we use our
derivation to model the time course of the cGMP concentration in a
transversally well stirred outer segment.
