Spectroscopic and photometric observations of the nearby Type Ia Supernova
(SN Ia) SN 2014J are presented. Spectroscopic observations were taken -8 to +10
d relative to B-band maximum, using FRODOSpec, a multi-purpose integral-field
unit spectrograph. The observations range from 3900 AA to 9000 AA. SN 2014J is
located in M82 which makes it the closest SN Ia studied in at least the last 28
years. It is a spectrosopically normal SN Ia with high velocity features. We
model the spectra of SN 2014J with a Monte Carlo (MC) radiative transfer code,
using the abundance tomography technique. SN 2014J is highly reddened, with a
host galaxy extinction of E(B-V)=1.2 (R_V=1.38). It has a $\Delta$m_15(B) of
1.08$\pm$0.03 when corrected for extinction. As SN 2014J is a normal SN Ia, the
density structure of the classical W7 model was selected. The model and
photometric luminosities are both consistent with B-band maximum occurring on
JD 2456690.4$\pm$0.12. The abundance of the SN 2014J behaves like other normal
SN Ia, with significant amounts of silicon (12% by mass) and sulphur (9% by
mass) at high velocities (12300 km s$^{-1}$) and the low-velocity ejecta
(v<6500 km s$^{-1}$) consists almost entirely of $^{56}$Ni.
