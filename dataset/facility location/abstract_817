This paper gives a short summary of some of the aspects of charmonium which
can be addressed at BES and CLEO-c and other $e^+e^-$ facilities. These topics
include the spectroscopy of charmonium states, radiative transitions, $e^+e^-$
widths, two-photon widths, hadron loop effects and open-flavor strong decays.
