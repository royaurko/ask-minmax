New deep, high-resolution H-alpha imagery from the UK Schmidt Telescope
(UKST) Unit's H-alpha survey of the Southern Galactic Plane reveals the
presence of a faint, highly circular, planetary nebula surrounding a very long
period variable star (now known as V1018 Sco), first discovered as a 1612-MHz
OH maser, OH 354.88-0.54. The nebular phase-lag distance, diameter, and radial
velocity are 3.2kpc, 0.3pc, and 13km/s, respectively. Combining the maser
attributes with near-, mid-, and far-infrared data and with our optical
spectrum of the ring we conclude that the object was an intermediate mass AGB
star (initial stellar mass >4Msun in which the fast wind has recently turned
on, ionizing previously shed circumstellar material. Hence, we speculate that
we may be witnessing a hitherto unobserved phase of PN evolution, in which a PN
has only recently started to form around a star that is unequivocally still in
its AGB
