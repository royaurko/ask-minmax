We introduce a modified model of random walk, and then develop two novel
clustering algorithms based on it. In the algorithms, each data point in a
dataset is considered as a particle which can move at random in space according
to the preset rules in the modified model. Further, this data point may be also
viewed as a local control subsystem, in which the controller adjusts its
transition probability vector in terms of the feedbacks of all data points, and
then its transition direction is identified by an event-generating function.
Finally, the positions of all data points are updated. As they move in space,
data points collect gradually and some separating parts emerge among them
automatically. As a consequence, data points that belong to the same class are
located at a same position, whereas those that belong to different classes are
away from one another. Moreover, the experimental results have demonstrated
that data points in the test datasets are clustered reasonably and efficiently,
and the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
