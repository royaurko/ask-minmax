Using an effective potential method we examine binary black holes where the
individual holes carry spin. We trace out sequences of quasi-circular orbits
and locate the innermost stable circular orbit as a function of spin. At large
separations, the sequences of quasi-circular orbits match well with
post-Newtonian expansions, although a clear signature of the simplifying
assumption of conformal flatness is seen. The position of the ISCO is found to
be strongly dependent on the magnitude of the spin on each black hole. At close
separations of the holes, the effective potential method breaks down. In all
cases where an ISCO could be determined, we found that an apparent horizon
encompassing both holes forms for separations well inside the ISCO.
Nevertheless, we argue that the formation of a common horizon is still
associated with the breakdown of the effective potential method.
