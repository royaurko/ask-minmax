In this thesis we focus on the construction of models in which a
supersymmetry breaking hidden sector is located on one fixed point of an extra
dimensional interval and the effects are gauge mediated across this interval to
the other fixed point where the supersymmetric standard model is located. We
use the formalism of current correlators to encode supersymmetry breaking
effects and explore flat, warped and deconstructed extra dimensions. We also
apply these techniques to models of metastable supersymmetry breaking in N = 1
Supersymmetric Quantum Chromodynamics.
