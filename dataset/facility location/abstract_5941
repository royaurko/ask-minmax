We report an ab initio study of the electric-field gradient tensor (EFG) at
Cd impurities located at both inequivalent cationic sites in the semiconductor
In2O3. Calculations were performed with the FLAPW method, that allows us to
treat the electronic structure of the doped system and the atomic relaxations
introduced by the impurities in the host lattice in a fully self-consistent
way. From our results for the EFG (in excellent agreement with the
experiments), it is clear that the problem of the EFG at impurities in In2O3
cannot be described by the point-charge model and antishielding factors.
