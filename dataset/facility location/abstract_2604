In this work we studied the trajectories, velocities and densities of ants
when egressing under controlled levels of stress produced by a chemical
repellent at different concentrations. We found that, unlike other animals
escaping under life-and-death conditions and pedestrian simulations, ants do
not produce a higher density zone near the exit door. Instead, ants are
uniformly distributed over the available space allowing for efficient
evacuations. Consequently, the faster-is-slower effect observed in ants (Soria
et al., 2012) is clearly of a different nature to that predicted by de social
force model. In the case of ants, the minimum evacuation time is correlated
with the lower probability of taking backward steps. Thus, as biological model
ants have important differences that make their use inadvisable for the design
of human facilities.
