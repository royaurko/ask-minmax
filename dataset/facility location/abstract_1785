The distribution of electromagnetic dipole strength in 92, 98, 100 Mo has
been investigated by photon scattering using bremsstrahlung from the new ELBE
facility. The experimental data for well separated nuclear resonances indicate
a transition from a regular to a chaotic behaviour above 4 MeV of excitation
energy. As the strength distributions follow a Porter-Thomas distribution much
of the dipole strength is found in weak and in unresolved resonances appearing
as fluctuating cross section. An analysis of this quasi-continuum - here
applied to nuclear resonance fluorescence in a novel way - delivers dipole
strength functions, which are combining smoothly to those obtained from
(g,n)-data. Enhancements at 6.5 MeV and at ~9 MeV are linked to the pygmy
dipole resonances postulated to occur in heavy nuclei.
