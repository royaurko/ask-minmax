We obtained new ROSAT HRI and optical observations in the field of the
Einstein X-ray source E 0336-248, which we use to identify it as a 19th
magnitude BL Lacertae object at z=0.251 with an X-ray luminosity of 10^45
erg/s. It is also a 14 mJy radio source at 20 cm. An emission-line galaxy at
z=0.043 that was previously considered a Seyfert identification for E 0336-248
is shown instead to be an unrelated, non-active H II region galaxy that lies 78
arcseconds from the X-ray source. The resolution of this historical case of
mistaken identity illustrates that discoveries of non-AGN emission-line
galaxies with high X-ray luminosity should be tested carefully. The properties
of E 0336-248 are similar to those of other X-ray selected BL Lacs, including
its location in an apparent group or cluster of galaxies. Somewhat unusual is
the weak contribution of nonstellar optical light relative to the starlight in
the spectrum of its host galaxy, which raises once again the possibility that
even high-luminosity BL Lac objects may be difficult to identify in X-ray
selected samples. We discuss a possible manifestation of this problem that
appeared in the recent literature.
