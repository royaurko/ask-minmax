We construct twisted instanton solutions of CP(n) models. Generically a
charge-k instanton splits into k(n+1) well-separated and almost static
constituents carrying fractional topological charges and being ordered along
the noncompact direction. The locations, sizes and charges of the constituents
are related to the moduli parameters of the instantons. We sketch how solutions
with fractional total charge can be obtained. We also calculate the fermionic
zero modes with quasi-periodic boundary conditions in the background of twisted
instantons for minimally and supersymmetrically coupled fermions. The zero
modes are tracers for the constituents and show a characteristic hopping. The
analytical findings are compared to results extracted from Monte-Carlo
generated and cooled configurations of the corresponding lattice models.
Analytical and numerical results are in full agreement and it is demonstrated
that the fermionic zero modes are excellent filters for constituents hidden in
fluctuating lattice configurations.
