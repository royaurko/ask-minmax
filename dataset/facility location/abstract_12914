Close-in super-Earths, with radii R = 2-5 R_Earth and orbital periods P < 100
days, orbit more than half, and perhaps nearly all Sun-like stars in the
universe. We use this omnipresent population to construct the minimum-mass
extrasolar nebula (MMEN), the circumstellar disk of solar-composition solids
and gas from which such planets formed, if they formed near their current
locations and did not migrate. In a series of back-of-the-envelope
calculations, we demonstrate how in-situ formation in the MMEN is fast,
efficient, and can reproduce many of the observed properties of close-in
super-Earths, including their gas-to-rock fractions. Testable predictions are
discussed.
