Person re-identification (re-id), an emerging problem in visual surveillance,
deals with maintaining entities of individuals whilst they traverse various
locations surveilled by a camera network. From a visual perspective re-id is
challenging due to significant changes in visual appearance of individuals in
cameras with different pose, illumination and calibration. Globally the
challenge arises from the need to maintain structurally consistent matches
among all the individual entities across different camera views. We propose
PRISM, a structured matching method to jointly account for these challenges. We
view the global problem as a weighted graph matching problem and estimate edge
weights by learning to predict them based on the co-occurrences of visual
patterns in the training examples. These co-occurrence based scores in turn
account for appearance changes by inferring likely and unlikely visual
co-occurrences appearing in training instances. We implement PRISM on single
shot and multi-shot scenarios. PRISM uniformly outperforms state-of-the-art in
terms of matching rate while being computationally efficient.
