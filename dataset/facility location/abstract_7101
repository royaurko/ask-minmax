We give a new reduction of a general diatomic molecular Hamiltonian, without
modifying it near the collision set of nuclei. The resulting effective
Hamiltonian is the sum of a smooth semiclassical pseudodifferential operator
(the semiclassical parameter being the inverse of the square-root of the
nuclear mass), and a semibounded operator localised in the elliptic region
corresponding to the nuclear collision set. We also study its behaviour on
exponential weights, and give several applications where molecular resonances
appear and can be well located.
