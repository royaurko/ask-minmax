Effective energy windows (Gamow windows) of astrophysical reaction rates for
(p,gamma), (p,n), (p,alpha), (alpha,gamma), (alpha,n), (alpha,p), (n,gamma),
(n,p), and (n,alpha) on targets with 10<=Z<=83 from proton- to neutron-dripline
are calculated using theoretical cross sections. It is shown that widely used
approximation formulas for the relevant energy ranges are not valid for a large
number of reactions relevant to hydrostatic and explosive nucleosynthesis. The
influence of the energy dependence of the averaged widths on the location of
the Gamow windows is discussed and the results presented in tabular form (also
