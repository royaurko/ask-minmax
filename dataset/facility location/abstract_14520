We have obtained spectra of the yellow giant S1040 in the open cluster M67
using the Goddard High-Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) and the Faint Object
Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. S1040 is a single-lined
spectroscopic binary with a 42.8d period that occupies a "red straggler"
position in the M67 color-magnitude diagram (CMD), 0.2 mag blueward of the
giant branch. A detection of S1040 at 1620 A with the Ultraviolet Imaging
Telescope provided evidence that the secondary is a hot white dwarf, and thus
that the anomalous location of S1040 in the CMD is likely due to a prior
episode of mass-transfer. Our GHRS spectrum shows a broad Ly alpha absorption
profile that confirms the white dwarf identification of the S1040 secondary. A
model atmosphere fit to the GHRS spectrum yields Teff = 16,160 K, log g = 6.7,
and a mass of 0.22 Msun, for an assumed cluster distance of 820 pc and
reddening of E(B-V) = 0.02. The unusually low mass derived for the white dwarf
implies that it must have a helium core, and that a mass-transfer episode must
have begun while the progenitor was on the lower giant branch. We construct a
plausible mass-transfer history for S1040 in which it originated as a short
(~2d) period binary, and evolved through a blue straggler phase to reach its
current state.
