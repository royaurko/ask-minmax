We report sensitive ATCA radio-continuum observations toward IRAS 15596-5301
and 16272-4837, two luminous objects (> 2x10^4 Lsun) thought to represent
massive star-forming regions in early stages of evolution (due to previously
undetected radio emission at the 1-sigma level of 2 mJy per beam). Also
reported are 1.2-millimeter continuum and a series of molecular-line
observations made with the SEST telescope. For IRAS 15596-5301, the
observations reveal the presence of three distinct compact radio-continuum
sources associated with a dense molecular core. We suggest that this core
contains a cluster of B stars which are exciting compact HII regions that are
in pressure equilibrium with the dense molecular surroundings. No radio
continuum emission was detected from IRAS 16272-4837 (3-sigma limit of 0.2
mJy). However, a dense molecular core has been detected. The high luminosity
and lack of radio emission from this massive core suggests that it hosts an
embedded young massive protostar that is still undergoing an intense accretion
phase. This scenario is supported by the observed characteristics of the line
profiles and the presence of a bipolar outflow detected from observations of
the SiO emission. We suggest that IRAS 16272-4837 is a bona fide massive star-
forming region in a very early evolutionary stage, being the precursor of an
ultra compact HII region.
