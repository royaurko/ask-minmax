A canonical ensemble algorithm is employed to study the phase diagram of $N_f
= 3$ QCD using lattice simulations. We lock in the desired quark number sector
using an exact Fourier transform of the fermion determinant. We scan the phase
space below $T_c$ and look for an S-shape structure in the chemical potential,
which signals the coexistence phase of a first order phase transition in finite
volume. Applying Maxwell construction, we determine the boundaries of the
coexistence phase at three temperatures and extrapolate them to locate the
critical point. Using an improved gauge action and improved Wilson fermions on
lattices with a spatial extent of $1.8 \fm$ and quark masses close to that of
the strange, we find the critical point at $T_E = 0.925(5) T_c$ and baryon
chemical potential $\mu_B^E = 2.60(8) T_c$.
