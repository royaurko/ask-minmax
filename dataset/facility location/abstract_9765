We investigate by Monte Carlo simulations the critical properties of the
three-dimensional bond-diluted Ising model. The phase diagram is determined by
locating the maxima of the magnetic susceptibility and is compared to
mean-field and effective-medium approximations. The calculation of the
size-dependent effective critical exponents shows the competition between the
different fixed points of the model as a function of the bond dilution.
