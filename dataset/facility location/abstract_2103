Recent data on the EMC effect from Jefferson Lab experiment E03103 suggest
that the nuclear dependence of the high x quark distribution may depend on the
local nuclear environment, rather than being a purely bulk effect. We briefly
discuss the analysis and results of the E03103 experiment focusing on the light
nuclei and high x region. In addition, we also discuss a future experiment at
the upgraded 12 GeV Jefferson Lab facility which will further investigate the
role of the local nuclear environment and the influence of detailed nuclear
structure on the modification of quark distributions.
