We present a list of 34 neglected entries from star cluster catalogues
located at relatively high galactic latitudes ($|b| >$ 15$^{\circ}$) which
appear to be candidate late stages of star cluster dynamical evolution.
Although underpopulated with respect to usual open clusters, they still present
a high number density contrast as compared to the galactic field. This was
verified by means of (i) predicted model counts from different galactic
subsystems in the same direction, and (ii) Guide Star Catalog equal solid angle
counts for the object and surrounding fields. This suggests that the objects
are physical systems, possibly star clusters in the process of disruption or
their fossil remains. The sample will be useful for followup studies in view of
verifying their physi cal nature.
