The Constellation X-ray Mission is a high throughput X-ray facility
emphasizing observations at high spectral resolution (E/\Delta E \sim
300-3000), and broad energy bandpass (0.25-40 keV). Constellation-X will
provide a factor of nearly 100 increase in sensitivity over current high
resolution X-ray spectroscopy missions. It is the X-ray astronomy equivalent of
large ground-based optical telescopes such as the Keck Observatory and the ESO
Very Large Telescope. When observations commence toward the end of next decade,
Constellation-X will address many fundamental astrophysics questions such as:
the formation and evolution of clusters of galaxies; constraining the baryon
content of the Universe; determining the spin and mass of supermassive black
holes in AGN; and probing strong gravity in the vicinity of black holes.
