We have studied neutron-rich carbon isotopes in terms of the shell model
employing a realistic effective hamiltonian derived from the chiral N3LOW
nucleon-nucleon potential. The single-particle energies and effective two-body
interaction have been both determined within the framework of the
time-dependent degenerate linked-diagram perturbation theory. The calculated
results are in very good agreement with the available experimental data,
providing a sound description of this isotopic chain toward the neutron
dripline. The correct location of the dripline is reproduced.
