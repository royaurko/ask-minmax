Many multiple testing procedures make use of the p-values from the individual
pairs of hypothesis tests, and are valid if the p-value statistics are
independent and uniformly distributed under the null hypotheses. However, it
has recently been shown that these types of multiple testing procedures are
inefficient since such p-values do not depend upon all of the available data.
This paper provides tools for constructing compound p-value statistics, which
are those that depend upon all of the available data, but still satisfy the
conditions of independence and uniformity under the null hypotheses. As an
example, a class of compound p-value statistics for testing for location shifts
is developed. It is demonstrated, both analytically and through simulations,
that multiple testing procedures tend to reject more false null hypotheses when
applied to these compound p-values rather than the usual p-values, and at the
same time still guarantee the desired type I error rate control. The compound
p-values, in conjunction with two different multiple testing methods, are used
to analyze a real microarray data set. Applying either multiple testing method
to the compound p-values, instead of the usual p-values, enhances their powers.
