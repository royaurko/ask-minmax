We investigated the electronic structure of multiferroic hexagonal RMnO3 (R =
Gd, Tb, Dy, and Ho) thin films using both optical spectroscopy and
first-principles calculations. Using artificially stabilized hexagonal RMnO3,
we extended the optical spectroscopic studies on the hexagonal multiferroic
manganite system. We observed two optical transitions located near 1.7 eV and
2.3 eV, in addition to the predominant absorption above 5 eV. With the help of
first-principles calculations, we attribute the low-lying optical absorption
peaks to inter-site transitions from the oxygen states hybridized strongly with
different Mn orbital symmetries to the Mn 3d3z2-r2 state. As the ionic radius
of the rare earth ion increased, the lowest peak showed a systematic increase
in its peak position. We explained this systematic change in terms of a
flattening of the MnO5 triangular bipyramid.
