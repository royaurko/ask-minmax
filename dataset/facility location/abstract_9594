We present an accurate X-ray position of the massive globular cluster G1 by
using XMM-Newton and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The X-ray emission of G1
has been detected recently with XMM-Newton. There are two possibilities for the
origin of the X-ray emission. It can be either due to accretion of the central
intermediate-mass black hole, or by ordinary low-mass X-ray binaries. The
precise location of the X-ray emission might distinguish between these two
scenarios. By refining the astrometry of the XMM-Newton and HST data, we
reduced the XMM-Newton error circle to 1.5". Despite the smaller error circle,
the precision is not sufficient to distinguish an intermediate-mass black hole
and luminous low-mass X-ray binaries. This result, however, suggests that
future Chandra observations may reveal the origin of the X-ray emission.
