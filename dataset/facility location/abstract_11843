We analyze individual pulses detected from RRAT J1819$-$1458. From April 2007
to April 2010, we carried out observations using the Nanshan 25-m radio
telescope of Urumqi Observatory at a central frequency of 1541.25 MHz. We
obtain a dispersion measure $DM=195.7\pm0.3$ pc cm^{-3} by analyzing all the
423 detected bursts. The tri-band pattern of arrival time residuals is
confirmed by a single pulse timing analysis. Twenty-seven bimodal bursts
located in the middle residual band are detected, and, profiles of two typical
bimodal bursts and two individual single-peak pulses are presented. We
determine the statistical properties of SNR and W$_{50}$ of bursts in different
residual bands. The W$_{50}$ variation with SNR shows that the shapes of bursts
are quite different from each other. The cumulative probability distribution of
intensity for a possible power law with index $\alpha=1.6\pm0.2$ is inferred
from the number of those bursts with $SNR\ge6$ and high intensities.
