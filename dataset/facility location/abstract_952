The use of existing Fermilab facilities to provide beams for two muon
experiments -- the Muon to Electron Conversion Experiment (Mu2e) and the New
g-2 Experiment -- is under consideration. Plans are being pursued to perform
these experiments following the completion of the Tevatron Collider Run II,
utilizing the beam lines and storage rings used today for antiproton
accumulation without considerable reconfiguration. Operating scenarios being
investigated and anticipated accelerator improvements or reconfigurations will
be presented.
