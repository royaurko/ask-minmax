We demonstrate that the form and location (not the size or spacing) of the
energetically preferred geometrical structure of the crystalline quark-hadron
mixed phase in a neutron star is very sensitive to finite size terms beyond the
surface term. We consider two independent approaches of including further
finite size terms, namely the multiple reflection expansion of the bag model
and an effective surface tension description. Thus care should be taken in any
model requiring detailed knowledge of these crystalline structures.
