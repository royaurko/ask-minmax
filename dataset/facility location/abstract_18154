Anonymous messaging platforms, such as Secret, Yik Yak, and Whisper, have
emerged as important social media tools for sharing one's thoughts without the
fear of being judged by friends, family, or the public. Further, anonymous
platforms like these are important in nations with contributoritarian governments,
where the right to free expression and sometimes the personal safety of the
contributor of the message depend on anonymity. Whether for fear of judgment or
personal endangerment, it is sometimes crucial to keep anonymous the identity
of the user who initially posted a sensitive message. In this paper, we
consider a global adversary who wishes to identify the contributor of a message; it
observes either a snapshot of the spread of a message at a certain time or
sampled timestamp metadata (or both). Recent advances in rumor source detection
show that existing messaging protocols are vulnerable against such an
adversary. We introduce a novel messaging protocol, which we call adaptive
diffusion, and show that under the snapshot adversarial model, it spreads the
messages fast and achieves a perfect obfuscation of the source when the
underlying contact network is an infinite regular tree. That is, all users with
the message are nearly equally likely to have been the origin of the message.
Under the timestamp-based adversary, we show that it achieves optimal
obfuscation asymptotically in the degree of the underlying regular tree.
Experiments on a sampled Facebook network demonstrate that adaptive diffusion
effectively hides the location of the source under both adversarial models,
even when the graph is finite, irregular and has cycles.
