The new 2-planetary system around HD169830 has been announced during the
XIX-th IAP Colloquium "Extrasolar Planets: Today & Tomorrow" (Paris, June 30 -
July 4, 2003) by the Geneva Extrasolar Planet Search team. We study the orbital
dynamics of this system in the framework of the $N$-body problem. The analysis
of its orbital stability is performed using the long-term integrations and the
fast indicators, the Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits and the
Frequency Map Analysis. The HD169830 appears to be located in a wide stable
region of the phase space. The ratio of the mean motions of the planets
HD169830b and c is between low-order mean motion resonances, 9:1 and 10:1. The
long-term integration of the coplanar configurations, conducted over 1Gyr,
reveals that the eccentricities of the companions vary with a large amplitude
about 0.4-0.5 but there is no sign of instability. The orbital parameters of
the planets resemble those of another 2-planetary system, around HD12661. Both
of them can be classified as hierarchical planetary systems. We investigate
whether these two exosystems are dynamically similar. Such similarities may be
important for finding out if the formation and subsequent orbital evolution of
exoplanetary systems obey common rules.
