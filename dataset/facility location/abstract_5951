A new law regarding structure of the earthquake networks is found. The
seismic data taken in California is mapped to a growing directed network. Then,
statistics of period in the network, which implies that after how many
earthquakes an earthquake returns to the initial location, is studied. It is
found that the period distribution obeys a power law, showing the fundamental
difficulty of statistical estimate of period.
