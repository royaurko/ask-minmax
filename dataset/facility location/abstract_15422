At present, the heliosphere is embedded in a warm low density interstellar
cloud that belongs to a cloud system flowing through the local standard of rest
with a velocity near ~18 km/s. The velocity structure of the nearest
interstellar material (ISM), combined with theoretical models of the local
interstellar cloud (LIC), suggest that the Sun passes through cloudlets on
timescales of < 10^3 - 10^4 yr, so the heliosphere has been, and will be,
exposed to different interstellar environments over time. By means of a
multi-fluid model that treats plasma and neutral hydrogen self-consistently,
the interaction of the solar wind with a variety of partially ionized ISM is
investigated, with the focus on low density cloudlets such as are currently
near the Sun. Under the assumption that the basic solar wind parameters
remain/were as they are today, a range of ISM parameters (from cold neutral to
hot ionized, with various densities and velocities) is considered. In response
to different interstellar boundary conditions, the heliospheric size and
structure change, as does the abundance of interstellar and secondary neutrals
in the inner heliosphere, and the cosmic ray level in the vicinity of Earth.
Some empirical relations between interstellar parameters and heliospheric
boundary locations, as well as neutral densities, are extracted from the
models.
