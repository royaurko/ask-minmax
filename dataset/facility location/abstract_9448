The motion of the solar system barycenter with respect to the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) induces a very large apparent dipole component into
the CMB brightness map at the 3 mK level. In this Letter we discuss another
kinematic effect of our motion through the CMB: the small shift in apparent
angular positions due to the aberration of light. The aberration angles are
only of order beta ~0.001, but this leads to a potentially measurable
compression (expansion) of the spatial scale in the hemisphere toward (away
from) our motion through the CMB. In turn, this will shift the peaks in the
acoustic power spectrum of the CMB by a factor of order 1 +/- beta. For current
CMB missions, and even those in the foreseeable future, this effect is small,
but should be taken into account. In principle, if the acoustic peak locations
were not limited by sampling noise (i.e., the cosmic variance), this effect
could be used to determine the cosmic contribution to the dipole term.
