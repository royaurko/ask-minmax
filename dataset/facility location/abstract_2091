The K^- induced production of Lambda(1405) in the K^- d to pi Sigma n
reaction is investigated having in mind the conditions of the DAFNE facility at
Frascati where kaons are obtained from the decay of slow moving phi mesons. We
find that the K^- d to Lambda(1405) n process favors the production of
Lambda(1405) initiated by the K^- p channel, which gives largest weight to the
higher mass Lambda(1405) appearing at 1420 MeV in chiral theories. We find that
the fastest kaons from the decay of the phi are well suited to see this
resonance, particularly if one selects forward going neutrons in the center of
mass, which reduce the contribution of single scattering and make the double
scattering dominate where the signal of the resonance appears clearer.
