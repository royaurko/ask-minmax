We utilise ground-based, balloon-born and satellite climatology data to
reconstruct site and season-dependent vertical profiles of precipitable water
vapour (PWV). We use these profiles to numerically solve radiative transfer
through the atmosphere, and derive atmospheric brightness temperature ($T_{\rm
atm}$) and optical depth ($\tau$) at the centimetre wavelengths.
  We validate the reconstruction by comparing the model column PWV, with
photometric measurements of PWV, performed in the clear sky conditions towards
the Sun. Based on the measurements, we devise a selection criteria to filter
the climatology data to match the PWV levels to the expectations of the clear
sky conditions.
  We apply the reconstruction to the location of the Polish 32-metre radio
telescope, and characterise $T_{\rm atm}$ and $\tau$ year-round, at selected
frequencies. We also derive the zenith distance dependence for these
parameters, and discuss shortcomings of using planar, single-layer, and
optically thin atmospheric model approximations, in continuum radio-source
flux-density measurement calibrations.
  We obtain PWV-$T_{\rm atm}$ and PWV-$\tau$ scaling relations in the clear sky
conditions, and constrain limits to which the actual $T_{\rm atm}$ and $\tau$
can deviate from those derived solely from the climatological data.
  Finally, we suggest a statistical method to detect clear sky that involves
ground-level measurements of relative humidity. The accuracy is tested using a
local climatological data. The method may be useful to constrain cloud cover in
cases when no other (and more robust) climatological data are available.
