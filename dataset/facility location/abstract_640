The materials engineering data base relevant to fusion irradiation is poorly
populated and it has long been recognized that a fusion spectrum neutron source
will be required, the facility IFMIF being the present proposal. Re- evaluation
of the regulatory approach for the EU proposed DEMO device shows that the
purpose of the source can be changed from lifetime equivalent irradiation
exposure to data generation at lower levels of exposure by adopting a defence
in depth strategy and regular component surveillance. This reduces the
specification of the source with respect to IFMIF allowing lower risk
technology solutions to be considered. A description of such a source, the
Facility for Fusion Neutron Irradiation Research, FAFNIR, is presented here
along with project timescales and costs.
