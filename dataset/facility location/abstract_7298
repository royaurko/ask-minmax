The recent revision of the solar chemical composition (Asplund, Grevesse and
Sauval 2005)is characterized by about 40 per cent decrease of C, N, O, Ne, Ar
abundances and by 20 percent decrease of Fe and some other metal abundances. We
tested the effect of these modifications on the instability of Beta Cephei
models. For the opacities, the newest OP data from the Opacity Project (Seaton
2005) were used. We show that the Beta Cephei instability domain in the
Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, when computed with new data for Z=0.012 (revised
solar value), is very similar to the instability domain computed earlier using
the OPAL opacities for the older solar composition with Z=0.02. Almost all
observed Beta Cephei variables are located within the instability domain. Two
effects are responsible for stronger instability when using the new data: (i)
Metal opacity bump in the OP case is located slightly deeper in the star than
that in the OPAL case, which results in more effective driving; (ii) at a fixed
Z value, the new Fe-group abundances are higher than the older ones because the
Z value is determined mainly by the abundances of C, N, 0, and Ne.
