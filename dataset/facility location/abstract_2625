This paper reviews the studies of solar photospheric magnetic field evolution
in active regions and its relationship to solar flares. It is divided into two
topics, the magnetic structure and evolution leading to solar eruptions and the
rapid changes of photospheric magnetic field associated with eruptions. For the
first topic, we describe the magnetic complexity, new flux emergence, flux
cancellation, shear motions, sunspot rotation, and magnetic helicity injection,
which may all contribute to the storage and buildup of energy and triggering of
solar eruptions. For the second topic, we concentrate on the observations of
rapid and irreversible changes of photospheric magnetic field associated with
flares, and the implication on the restructuring of three-dimensional magnetic
field. In particular, we emphasize the recent advances in observations of
photospheric magnetic field, as state-of-the-art observing facilities (such as
Hinode and Solar Dynamic Observatory) become available. The linkage between
observations and theories and future prospectives in this research area are
also discussed.
