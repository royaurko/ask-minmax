Third harmonic superconducting cavities have been designed and fabricated by
FNAL to minimise the energy spread along bunches in the FLASH facility at DESY.
A module, consisting of four nine-cell 3.9 GHz cavities, has been installed in
FLASH. The first measurement with beam excitation is presented, and the
comparisons to transmission measurement without beam and simulations are made.
Higher order modes (HOMs) are able to propagate to adjacent cavities through
attached beam tubes. Modes from 1.3 GHz cavities in the module nearby also
propagate into this module.
