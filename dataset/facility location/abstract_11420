Standard DNA melting curves record the separation of the two strands versus
temperature, but they do not provide any information on the location of the
opening. We introduce an experimental method which adds a new dimension to the
melting curves of short DNA sequences by allowing us to record the degree of
opening in several positions along the molecule all at once. This adds the
spatial dimension to the melting curves and allows a precise investigation of
the role of the base-pair sequence on the fluctuations and denaturation of the
DNA double helix. We illustrate the power of the method by investigating the
influence of an AT rich region on the fluctuations of neighboring domains.
