Geo-reactor models suggest the existence of natural nuclear reactors at
different deep-earth locations with loosely defined output power. Reactor
fission products undergo beta decay with the emission of electron
antineutrinos, which routinely escape the earth. Neutrino mixing distorts the
energy spectrum of the electron antineutrinos. Characteristics of the distorted
spectrum observed at the earth's surface could specify the location of a
geo-reactor, discriminating the models and facilitating more precise power
measurement. The existence of a geo-reactor with known position could enable a
precision measurement of the neutrino oscillation parameter delta-mass-squared.
