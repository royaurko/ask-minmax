We assess electrical brain dynamics before, during, and after one-hundred
human epileptic seizures with different anatomical onset locations by
statistical and spectral properties of functionally defined networks. We
observe a concave-like temporal evolution of characteristic path length and
cluster coefficient indicative of a movement from a more random toward a more
regular and then back toward a more random functional topology. Surprisingly,
synchronizability was significantly decreased during the seizure state but
increased already prior to seizure end. Our findings underline the high
relevance of studying complex systems from the view point of complex networks,
which may help to gain deeper insights into the complicated dynamics underlying
epileptic seizures.
