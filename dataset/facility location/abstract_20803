In this paper we present a framework for developing Lagrangean heuristics (heuristics based upon Lagrangean relaxation and subgradient optimisation) with respect to location problems. Computational results are given for four different location problems: p -median, uncapacitated warehouse location, capacitated warehouse location and capacitated warehouse location with single source constraints. These results indicate that the framework presented in this paper is robust , i.e. it gives good quality solutions for each of these different location problems.
