Using observations of rapidly rotating roAp star HD 12098, obtained with 6m
telescope of SAO RAS in 2005-2008 in nine rotational phases (0.001-0.817), and
code V. Tsymbal ROTATE we identified 3 lithium spots on the surface of star,
one of them coincided with the position of one magnetic pole and two others are
located near the other pole, symmetrically with respect to it. Perhaps magnetic
field of the star has a more complex structure than the dipole (Shavrina 2008).
Lithium abundance in the spots is greater than cosmic one. It can be explained
by diffusion of lithium in the presence of a magnetic field or by production of
lithium in the reactions of "spallation" on the surface of star near the
magnetic poles (see, for example, Goriely 2007). Enhanced lithium abundances
was also determined for other two slowly rotating Ap stars HR 465 and HD 965.
The analysis is performed using a synthetic spectrum method taking into account
magnetic splitting of lines by the SYNTHM code of Khan (2004).
