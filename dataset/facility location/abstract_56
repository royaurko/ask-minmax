The $k$-center problem is a classic facility location problem, where given an
edge-weighted graph $G = (V,E)$ one is to find a subset of $k$ vertices $S$,
such that each vertex in $V$ is "close" to some vertex in $S$. The
approximation status of this basic problem is well understood, as a simple
2-approximation algorithm is known to be tight. Consequently different
extensions were studied.
  In the capacitated version of the problem each vertex is assigned a capacity,
which is a strict upper bound on the number of clients a facility can serve,
when located at this vertex. A constant factor approximation for the
capacitated $k$-center was obtained last year by Cygan, Hajiaghayi and Khuller
[FOCS'12], which was recently improved to a 9-approximation by An, Bhaskara and
Svensson [arXiv'13].
  In a different generalization of the problem some clients (denoted as
outliers) may be disregarded. Here we are additionally given an integer $p$ and
the goal is to serve exactly $p$ clients, which the algorithm is free to
choose. In 2001 Charikar et al. [SODA'01] presented a 3-approximation for the
$k$-center problem with outliers.
  In this paper we consider a common generalization of the two extensions
previously studied separately, i.e. we work with the capacitated $k$-center
with outliers. We present the first constant factor approximation algorithm
with approximation ratio of 25 even for the case of non-uniform hard
capacities.
