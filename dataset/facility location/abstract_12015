We focus on the special parameter point $D=2J$ of the general spin-S
Blume-Capel model on the square lattice. The phase transition behaviors with
the temperature variation are discussed by the newly developed tensor
renormalization group method. For the case of the integer spin-S, the system
will undergo $S$ first-order phase transitions with the successive spontaneous
breaking of the magnetization $M=S,S-1,...0$. For the half-integer spin-S,
there are similar $S-1/2$ first order phase transition with $M=S,S-1,...1/2$
stepwise structure, in addition, there is a continuous phase transition due to
the spin-flip $Z_2$ symmetry breaking. For the first order phase transitions,
the location of the critical temperature is the same, independent of the value
of the spin-S. It is a different picture compared to the previous results
$T_c=0$.
