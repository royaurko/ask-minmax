The Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar PMN J2345-1555 is a bright gamma-ray source,
that recently underwent a flaring episode in the IR, UV and gamma-ray bands.
The flux changed quasi simultaneously at different frequencies, suggesting that
it was produced by a single population of emitting particles, hence by a single
and well localized region of the jet. While the overall Spectral Energy
Distribution (SED) before the flare was typical of powerful blazars (namely two
broad humps peaking in the far IR and below 100 MeV bands, respectively),
during the flare the peaks moved to the optical-UV and to energies larger than
1 GeV, to resemble low power BL Lac objects, even if the observed bolometric
luminosity increased by more than one order of magnitude. We interpret this
behavior as due to a change of the location of the emission region in the jet,
from within the broad line region, to just outside. The corresponding decrease
of the radiation energy density as seen in the comoving frame of the jet
allowed the relativistic electrons to be accelerated to higher energies, and
thus produce a "bluer" SED.
