The charge susceptibility of the two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model is
investigated using the diagram technique developed for the case of strong
correlations. In this technique, a power series in the hopping constant is
used. It is shown that once the Fermi level crosses one of the Hubbard subbands
a sharp peak appears in the momentum dependence of the static susceptibility.
With further departure from half-filling the peak transforms to a ridge around
the $\Gamma$ point. In the considered range $0\leq|1-\bar{n}|\alt 0.2$ of the
electron filling $\bar{n}$ the static susceptibility is finite which points to
the absence of the long-range charge ordering. However, for $|1-\bar{n}|\approx
0.12$ the susceptibility maxima are located halfway between the center and the
boundaries of the Brillouin zone. In this case an interaction of carriers with
tetragonal distortions can stabilize the charge density wave with the
wavelength of four lattice spacings, as observed experimentally in the
low-temperature tetragonal phase of lanthanum cuprates. In the range of
parameters inherent in cuprate perovskites the character of the susceptibility
evolution with $\bar{n}$ depends only weakly on the ratio of the
nearest-neighbor hopping constant to the Hubbard repulsion and on details of
the initial band structure. The location of the susceptibility maxima in the
Brillouin zone is mainly determined by the value of $\bar{n}$.
