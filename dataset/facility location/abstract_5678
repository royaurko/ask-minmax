EROS2 is a second generation microlensing experiment operating since mid-1996
at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) at La Silla (Chile). We present the
two year analysis from our microlensing search towards the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC) and report on the intensive observation of the caustic crossing
event MACHO-SMC-98-1 and the limit derived on t he location of the lens. We
also give preliminary results from our search towards the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC); 25 square degrees are being analyzed and two candidates have been
found. This allows us to set another limit on the halo mass fraction comprised
of compact objects.
