We use molecular dynamics computer simulations to calculate the frequency
dependence of the specific heat of a SiO_2 melt. The ions interact with the BKS
potential and the simulations are done in the NVE ensemble. We find that the
frequency dependence of the specific heat shows qualitatively the same behavior
as the one of structural quantities, in that at high frequencies a microscopic
peak is observed and at low frequencies an alpha-peak, the location of which
quickly moves to lower frequencies when the temperature is decreased.
