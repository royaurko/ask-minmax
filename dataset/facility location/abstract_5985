We demonstrate on-chip resonant driving of large cone-angle magnetization
precession of an individual nanoscale permalloy element. Strong driving is
realized by locating the element in close proximity to the shorted end of a
coplanar strip waveguide, which generates a microwave magnetic field. We used a
microwave frequency modulation method to accurately measure resonant changes of
the dc anisotropic magnetoresistance. Precession cone angles up to $9^{0}$ are
determined with better than one degree of resolution. The resonance peak shape
is well-described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.
