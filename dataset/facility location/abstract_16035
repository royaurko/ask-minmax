In quasi-two dimensional Ce(Ir,Rh)In$_5$ system, it has been suggested that
the phase diagram contains two distinct domes with different heavy fermion
superconducting states. We here report the systematic pressure dependence of
the electron transport properties in the normal state of
CeRh$_{0.2}$Ir$_{0.8}$In$_{5}$ and CeIrIn$_{5}$, which locates in first and
second superconducting dome, respectively. We observed non-Fermi liquid
behavior at low temperatures in both compounds, including non-quadratic
$T-$dependence of the resistivity, large enhancement of the Hall coefficient,
and the violation of the Kohler's rule in the magnetoresistance. We show that
the cotangent of Hall angle $\cot \Theta_H$ varies as $T^2$, and the
magnetoresistance is quite well scaled by the Hall angle as $\Delta
\rho_{xx}/\rho_{xx}\propto \tan^2\Theta_H$. The observed transport anomalies
are common features of Ce$M$In$_{5}$ ($M$=Co, Rh, and Ir) and high-$T_c$
cuprates, suggesting that the anomalous transport properties observed in
CeIrIn$_{5}$ are mainly governed by the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations,
not by the Ce-valence fluctuations which has been proposed to be the possible
origin for the second superconducting dome.
