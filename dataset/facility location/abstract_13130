Imaging techniques give a fundamental support to medical diagnostics during
the pathology discovery as well as for the characterization of biological
structures. The imaging methods involve electromagnetic waves in a frequency
range that spans from some Hz to GHz and over. Most of these methods involve
scanning of wide human body areas even if only small areas need to be analyzed.
In this paper, a numerical method to evaluate the shape of micro-structures for
application in the medical ?field, with a very low invasiveness for the human
body, is proposed. A flexible thin-wire antenna radiates the VHF waves and
then, by measuring the spatial magnetic ?field distribution it is possible to
reconstruct the micro-structures image by estimating the location of the
antenna against a sensors panel. The typical inverse problem described above is
solved numerically, and ?first simulation results are presented in order to
show the validity and the robustness of the proposed approach.
