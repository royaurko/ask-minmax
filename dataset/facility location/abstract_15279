We combine a FUSE sample of OVI absorbers (z < 0.15) with a database of 1.07
million galaxy redshifts to explore the relationship between absorbers and
galaxy environments. All 37 absorbers with N(OVI) > 10^{13.2} cm^-2 lie within
800 h_70^-1 kpc of the nearest galaxy, with no compelling evidence for OVI
absorbers in voids. The OVI absorbers often appear to be associated with
environments of individual galaxies. Gas with 10 +/- 5% of solar metallicity
(OVI and CIII) has a median spread in distance of 350-500 kpc around L*
galaxies and 200-270 kpc around 0.1 L* galaxies (ranges reflect uncertain
metallicities of gas undetected in Lya absorption). In order to match the OVI
line frequency, dN/dz = 20 for N(OVI) > 10^{13.2} cm^-2, galaxies with L < 0.1
L* must contribute to the cross section. The Lya absorbers with N(HI) >
10^{13.2} cm^-2 cover ~50% of the surface area of typical galaxy filaments.
Two-thirds of these show OVI and/or CIII absorption, corresponding to a 33-50%
covering factor at 0.1 Z_sun and suggesting that metals are spread to a maximum
distance of 800 kpc, within typical galaxy supercluster filaments.
Approximately 50% of the OVI absorbers have associated Lya line pairs with
separations Delta V = 50-200 km/s. These pairs could represent shocks at the
speeds necessary to create copious OVI, located within 100 kpc of the nearest
galaxy and accounting for much of the two-point correlation function of low-z
Lya forest absorbers.
