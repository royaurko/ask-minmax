This paper extends the notion of the $\la$-coalescent of Pitman (1999) to the
spatial setting. The partition elements of the spatial $\Lambda$-coalescent
migrate in a (finite) geographical space and may only coalesce if located at
the same site of the space. We characterize the $\Lambda$-coalescents that come
down from infinity, in an analogous way to Schweinsberg (2000). Surprisingly,
all spatial coalescents that come down from infinity, also come down from
infinity in a uniform way. This enables us to study space-time asymptotics of
spatial $\Lambda$-coalescents on large tori in $d\ge 3$ dimensions. Our results
generalize and strengthen those of Greven et al. (2005), who studied the
spatial Kingman coalescent in this context.
