We have studied the alpha decays of 214Po into 210Pb and of 212Po into 208Pb
tagged by the coincidence with the preceding beta decays from 214Bi and 212Bi,
respectively. The employed 222Rn, 232Th, and 220Rn sources were sealed inside
quartz vials and inserted in the Counting Test Facility at the underground Gran
Sasso National Laboratory in Italy. We find that the mean lifetime of 214Po is
(236.00 +- 0.42(stat) +- 0.15(syst)) \mu s and that of 212Po is (425.1 +-
0.9(stat) +- 1.2(syst)) ns. Our results, obtained from data with
signal-to-background ratio larger than 1000, reduce the overall uncertainties
and are compatible with previous measurements.
