HII regions are the ionized spheres surrounding high-mass stars. They are
ideal targets for tracing Galactic structure because they are predominantly
found in spiral arms and have high luminosities at infrared and radio
wavelengths. In the Green Bank Telescope HII Region Discovery Survey (GBT HRDS)
we found that >30% of first Galactic quadrant HII regions have multiple
hydrogen radio recombination line (RRL) velocities, which makes determining
their Galactic locations and physical properties impossible. Here we make
additional GBT RRL observations to determine the discrete HII region velocity
for all 117 multiple-velocity sources within 18deg. < l < 65deg. The
multiple-velocity sources are concentrated in the zone 22deg. < l < 32deg.,
coinciding with the largest regions of massive star formation, which implies
that the diffuse emission is caused by leaked ionizing photons. We combine our
observations with analyses of the electron temperature, molecular gas, and
carbon recombination lines to determine the source velocities for 103 discrete
H II regions (88% of the sample). With the source velocities known, we resolve
the kinematic distance ambiguity for 47 regions, and thus determine their
heliocentric distances.
