We study how a randomness of either boson or fermion site energies affects
the superconducting phase of the boson fermion model. We find that, contrary to
what is expected for s-wave superconductors, the non-magnetic disorder is
detrimental to the s-wave superconductivity. However, depending in which
subsystem the disorder is located, we can observe different channels being
affected. Weak disorder of the fermion subsystem is responsible mainly for
renormalization of the single particle density of states while disorder in the
boson subsystem directly leads to fluctuation of the strength of the effective
pairing between fermions.
