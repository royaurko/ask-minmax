Transcription factors are short stretches of DNA (or $k$-mers) mainly located
in promoters sequences that enhance or repress gene expression. With respect to
an initial distribution of letters on the DNA alphabet, Behrens and Vingron
consider a random sequence of length $n$ that does not contain a given $k$-mer
or word of size $k$. Under an evolution model of the DNA, they compute the
probability $\mathfrak{p}_n$ that this $k$-mer appears after a unit time of 20
years. They prove that the waiting time for the first apparition of the $k$-mer
is well approximated by $T_n=1/\mathfrak{p}_n$. Their work relies on the
simplifying assumption that the $k$-mer is not self-overlapping. They observe
in particular that the waiting time is mostly driven by the initial
distribution of letters.
  Behrens et al. use an approach by automata that relaxes the assumption
related to words overlaps. Their numerical evaluations confirms the validity of
Behrens and Vingron approach for non self-overlapping words, but provides up to
44% corrections for highly self-overlapping words such as $\mathtt{AAAAA}$. We
devised an approach of the problem by clump analysis and generating functions;
this approach leads to prove a quasi-linear behaviour of $\mathfrak{p}_n$ for a
large range of values of $n$, an important result for DNA evolution. We present
here this clump analysis, first by language decomposition, and next by an
automaton construction; finally, we describe an equivalent approach by
construction of Markov automata.
