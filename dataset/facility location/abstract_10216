Properties of scalar--isoscalar mesons in a mass range from pi-pi threshold
up to 1800 MeV are analysed using an unitary model with separable interactions
in three decay channels: pi-pi, K-anti K and an effective 2pi-2pi. Different
solutions are obtained by fitting pi-pi and K-anti K data. Analytical structure
of the meson-meson multichannel amplitudes is studied with a special emphasis
on the important role played by the S-matrix zeroes. The dependence of the
positions of S-matrix singularities on the interchannel coupling strength is
investigated. Poles, located in the complex energy plane not too far from the
physical region, are interpreted as scalar resonances: a wide f0(500), a narrow
f0(980) and a relatively narrow f0(1400). In all our solutions two resonances,
lying on different sheets, in the energy region between 1300 MeV and 1500 MeV
are found. These states may be compared with the resonances f0(1370) and
f0(1500) seen in the experiments at CERN. Total, elastic and inelastic channel
cross sections, branching ratios and coupling constants are evaluated and
compared with available data.
