We present preliminary results on a single field observed by WHAT, a
small-aperture short focal length automated telescope with an 8.2 deg x 8.2 deg
field of view, located at the Wise Observatory. The system is similar to the
members of HATNet (http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~gbakos/HAT/) and is aimed at
searching for transiting extrasolar planets and variable objects. With 5 min
integration time, the telescope achieved a precision of a few mmag for the
brightest objects. We detect variables with amplitudes less than 0.01 mag. All
152 periodic variables are presented at http://wise-obs.tau.ac.il/~amit/236/ .
