We extend the analysis of the deeply virtual Compton scattering process to
the weak interaction sector in the generalized Bjorken limit. The virtual
Compton scattering amplitudes for the weak neutral and charged currents are
calculated at the leading twist within the framework of the nonlocal light-cone
expansion via coordinate space QCD string operators. Using a simple model, we
estimate cross sections for neutrino scattering off the nucleon, relevant for
future high intensity neutrino beam facilities.
