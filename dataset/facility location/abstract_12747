The accurate but expensive product of geminals ansatz may be approximated by
a geminal power, but this approach sacrifices size consistency. Here we show
both analytically and numerically that a size consistent form very similar to
the product of geminals can be recovered using a network of location specific
Jastrow factors. Upon variational energy minimization, the network creates
particle number projections that remove the charge fluctuations responsible for
size inconsistency. This polynomial cost approach captures strong many-electron
correlations, giving a maximum error of just 1.8 kcal/mol during the
double-bond dissociation of H2O in an STO-3G atomic orbital basis.
