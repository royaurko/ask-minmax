Far red spectra for 22 stars in the Camelopardalis and the northern Perseus
dark clouds, suspected to be pre-main-sequence objects (YSOs), are obtained.
This evolutionary status is confirmed for ten stars located in the dust and
molecular cloud close to the high-mass protostar GL 490, four stars near the H
II region Sh2-205 and one star in the dark cloud TGU 1041. All of these objects
exhibit emission in the H alpha line and some of them emission in the O I and
Ca II lines. The spectral energy distributions, equivalent widths of the
emission lines and approximate spectral classes are determined. Evolutionary
stages of the stars are estimated from 2MASS, IRAS and MSX infrared photometry.
Now we have spectral confirmation of the YSO status for 14 stars in the GL 490
area and 8 stars at Sh2-205. Their spectral types are from A to K, but most of
them are either Herbig Ae stars or intermediate objects between T Tauri type
and Herbig stars. Both these star forming regions are located near the outer
edge of the Local arm at a distance of 900 pc.
