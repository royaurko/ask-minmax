In this Letter, we report on a low-resolution spectroscopic survey for
Li-rich K giants among 2000 low mass (M <= 3 Msun) giants spanning the
luminosity range from below to above the luminosity of the clump. Fifteen new
Li-rich giants including four super Li-rich K giants (A(Li) >= 3.2) were
discovered. A significant finding is that there is a concentration of Li-rich K
giants at the luminosity of the clump or red horizontal branch. This new
finding is partly a consequence of the fact that our low-resolution survey is
the first large survey to include giants well below and above the RGB bump and
clump locations in the HR diagram. Origin of the lithium enrichment may be
plausibly attributed to the conversion of 3He via 7Be to 7Li by the
Cameron-Fowler mechanism but the location for onset of the conversion is
uncertain. Two possible opportunities to effect this conversion are discussed:
the bump in the first ascent of the red giant branch (RGB) and the He-core
flash at the tip of the RGB. The finite luminosity spread of the Li-rich giants
serves to reject the idea that Li enhancement is, in general, a consequence of
a giant swallowing a large planet.
