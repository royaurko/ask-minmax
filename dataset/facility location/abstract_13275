We summarize the properties of the new periodic, small amplitude, variable
stars recently discovered in the open cluster NGC 3766. They are located in the
region of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram between \delta\ Sct and slowly
pulsating B stars, a region where no sustained pulsation is predicted by
standard models. The origin of their periodic variability is currently unknown.
We also discuss how the Gaia mission, to be launched at the end of 2013, can
contribute to our knowledge of those stars.
