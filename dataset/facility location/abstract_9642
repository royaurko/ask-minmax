We investigate the critical behavior of the two-dimensional 8-state Potts
model with an aperiodic distribution of the exchange interactions between
nearest-neighbor rows. The model is studied numerically through intensive Monte
Carlo simulations using the Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm. The transition
point is located through duality relations, and the critical behavior is
investigated using FSS techniques at criticality. For strong enough
fluctuations of the aperiodic sequence under consideration, a second order
phase transition is found. The exponents $\beta/\nu$ and $\gamma /\nu$ are
obtained at the new fixed point.
