We present simultaneous Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR ) and
Suzaku observations of the X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 in the hard state. This is
the first time this state has been observed in Cyg X-1 with NuSTAR, which
enables us to study the reflection and broad-band spectra in unprecedented
detail. We confirm that the iron line cannot be fit with a combination of
narrow lines and absorption features, and instead requires a relativistically
blurred profile in combination with a narrow line and absorption from the
companion wind. We use the reflection models of Garcia et al. (2014) to
simultaneously measure the black hole spin, disk inner radius, and coronal
height in a self-consistent manner. Detailed fits to the iron line profile
indicate a high level of relativistic blurring, indicative of reflection from
the inner accretion disk. We find a high spin, a small inner disk radius, and a
low source height, and rule out truncation to greater than three gravitational
radii at the 3{\sigma} confidence level. In addition, we find that the line
profile has not changed greatly in the switch from soft to hard states, and
that the differences are consistent with changes in the underlying reflection
spectrum rather than the relativistic blurring. We find that the blurring
parameters are consistent when fitting either just the iron line or the entire
broad-band spectrum, which is well modelled with a Comptonized continuum plus
reflection model.
