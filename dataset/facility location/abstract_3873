The current CMS silicon pixel detector as the innermost component of the CMS
experiment is performing well at LHC design luminosity, but would be subject to
severe inefficiencies at LHC peak luminosities of 2x10e34 cm^-2 s^-1.
  Therefore, an upgrade of the CMS pixel detector is planned, including a new
readout chip. The chip design comprises additional on-chip buffer cells as well
as high-speed data links and low-threshold comparators in the pixel cells. With
these changes the upgraded pixel detector will be able to maintain or even
improve the efficiency of the current detector at the increased requirements
imposed by high luminosities and pile-up.
  The effects of these design changes on e.g. position resolution and charge
collection efficiency were studied in detail using a precision tracking
telescope at the DESY test beam facilities. The high telescope track resolution
enables precise studies of tracking efficiency, charge sharing and collection
even within single pixel cells of the device under test.
  This publication focuses on the improved performance and capabilities of the
new pixel readout chip and summarizes results from test beam campaigns with
both unirradiated and irradiated devices. The functionality of the chip design
with its improved charge threshold, redesigned data transmission and buffering
scheme has been verified.
