The Multi-Epoch Nearby Cluster Survey (MENeaCS) has discovered twenty-three
cluster Type Ia supernovae (SNe) in the 58 X-ray selected galaxy clusters (0.05
< z < 0.15) surveyed. Four of our SN Ia events have no host galaxy on close
inspection, and are likely intracluster SNe. Deep image stacks at the location
of the candidate intracluster SNe put upper limits on the luminosities of faint
hosts, with M_{r} > -13.0 mag and M_{g} > -12.5 mag in all cases. For such
limits, the fraction of the cluster luminosity in faint dwarfs below our
detection limit is <0.1%, assuming a standard cluster luminosity function. All
four events occurred within ~600 kpc of the cluster center (projected), as
defined by the position of the brightest cluster galaxy, and are more centrally
concentrated than the cluster SN Ia population as a whole. After accounting for
several observational biases that make intracluster SNe easier to discover and
spectroscopically confirm, we calculate an intracluster stellar mass fraction
of 0.16^{+0.13}_{-0.09} (68% CL) for all objects within R_{200}. If we assume
that the intracluster stellar population is exclusively old, and the cluster
galaxies themselves have a mix of stellar ages, we derive an upper limit on the
intracluster stellar mass fraction of <0.47 (84% one-sided CL). When combined
with the intragroup SNe results of McGee & Balogh, we confirm the declining
intracluster stellar mass fraction as a function of halo mass reported by
Gonzalez and collaborators. (Abridged)
