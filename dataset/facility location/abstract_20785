Volume 2337 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 240-257 Date: 21 May 2002 An Improved Approximation Algorithm for the Metric Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem MaximÂ Sviridenko Affiliated with IBM T. J. Watson Research Center We design a new approximation algorithm for the metric uncapacitated facility location problem. This algorithm is of LP rounding type and is based on a rounding technique developed in [ 5 , 6 , 7 ].
