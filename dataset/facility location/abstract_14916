We present the results of an SiO maser survey for color-selected IRAS sources
in the area 40 < l < 70 and |b| < 10 in the SiO J=1-0, v=1 and 2 transitions.
We detected 134 out of 272 observed sources in SiO masers; 127 were new
detections. A systematic difference in the detection rates between SiO and OH
maser searches was found. Especially, in the color ranges with
log(F_{25}/F_{12}) smaller than -0.1, the detection rate of the SiO masers is
significantly higher than that of OH masers. We found a possible kinematic
influence of the galactic arm on the distribution of SiO maser sources. It was
found that the velocity dispersion of SiO maser sources tends to decrease with
the galactocentric distance. Using the present and previous data of SiO maser
surveys, we found that the local velocity gradient of the rotational velocity
of the Galaxy is consistent with the values obtained from other kinds of disk
population stars within a statistical uncertainty. The Oort's constants, "A"
and "B", were computed from the gradient of the rotation curve for the present
data, and were consistent with the IAU standard values. In addition, in order
to check the reliability of IRAS positions, we observed toward the MSX
positions for 5 MSX counterparts, which are located more than 20" away (but
within 60") from IRAS positions. We detected all of these 5 sources in SiO
masers.
