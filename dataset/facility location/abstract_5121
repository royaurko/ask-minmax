Everyday a huge amount of data is generated in Cloud Computing. The
maintenance of this electronic data needs some extremely efficient services.
There is a need to properly collect this data, check for its authenticity and
develop proper backups is needed. The Objective of this paper is to provide
Response Server, some solution for the backup of data and its restoration,
using the Cloud. Thecollection of the data is to be done from the client and
then the data should be sent to a central location. This process is a platform
independent one. The data can then be used as required. The Remote Backup
Server facilitates the collection of information from any remote location and
provides services to recover the data in case of loss. The authentication of
the user is done by using the Asymmetric key algorithm which will in turn leads
to the authentication of the data.
