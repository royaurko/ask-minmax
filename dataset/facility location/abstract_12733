Digital watermarking system is a paramount for safeguarding valuable
resources and information. Digital watermarks are generally imperceptible to
the human eye and ear. Digital watermark can be used in video, audio and
digital images for a wide variety of applications such as copy prevention right
management, authentication and filtering of internet content. The proposed
system is able to protect copyright or owner identification of digital media,
such as audio, image, video, or text. The system permutated the watermark and
embed the permutated watermark into the wavelet coefficients of the original
image by using a key. The key is randomly generated and used to select the
locations in the wavelet domain in which to embed the permutated watermark.
Finally, the system combines the concept of cryptography and digital
watermarking techniques to implement a more secure digital watermarking system.
