We consider the problem of estimating the distance, or range, between two
locations by measuring the phase of a sinusoidal signal transmitted between the
locations. This method is only capable of unambiguously measuring range within
an interval of length equal to the wavelength of the signal. To address this
problem signals of multiple different wavelengths can be transmitted. The range
can then be measured within an interval of length equal to the least common
multiple of these wavelengths. Estimation of the range requires solution of a
problem from computational number theory called the closest lattice point
problem. Algorithms to solve this problem require a basis for this lattice.
Constructing a basis is non-trivial and an explicit construction has only been
given in the case that the wavelengths can be scaled to pairwise relatively
prime integers. In this paper we present an explicit construction of a basis
without this assumption on the wavelengths. This is important because the
accuracy of the range estimator depends upon the wavelengths. Simulations
indicate that significant improvement in accuracy can be achieved by using
wavelengths that cannot be scaled to pairwise relatively prime integers.
