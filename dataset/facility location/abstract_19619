We present precise phase-connected pulse timing solutions for 16
gamma-ray-selected pulsars recently discovered using the Large Area Telescope
(LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope plus one very faint radio pulsar
(PSR J1124-5916) that is more effectively timed with the LAT. We describe the
analysis techniques including a maximum likelihood method for determining pulse
times of arrival from unbinned photon data. A major result of this work is
improved position determinations, which are crucial for multi-wavelength follow
up. For most of the pulsars, we overlay the timing localizations on X-ray
images from Swift and describe the status of X-ray counterpart associations. We
report glitches measured in PSRs J0007+7303, J1124-5916, and J1813-1246. We
analyze a new 20 ks Chandra ACIS observation of PSR J0633+0632 that reveals an
arcminute-scale X-ray nebula extending to the south of the pulsar. We were also
able to precisely localize the X-ray point source counterpart to the pulsar and
find a spectrum that can be described by an absorbed blackbody or neutron star
atmosphere with a hard powerlaw component. Another Chandra ACIS image of PSR
J1732-3131 reveals a faint X-ray point source at a location consistent with the
timing position of the pulsar. Finally, we present a compilation of new and
archival searches for radio pulsations from each of the gamma-ray-selected
pulsars as well as a new Parkes radio observation of PSR J1124-5916 to
establish the gamma-ray to radio phase offset.
