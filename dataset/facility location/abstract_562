A mega-tramway based on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java is
proposed to span Sunda Strait. The Java-Sumatra Aerial Mega-Tramway (JSAMT)
will be self-elevating and will regularly and cheaply launch passengers and
cargoes via two conveyor belt-like facilities using standard winged shipping
containers like those currently used by international trucking and ocean
shipping industries that are volplaned across the Sunda Strait. The JSAMT will
be a self-sustaining toll facility free of any requirement for international
loans or funding guarantees for its construction. Its existence will remove any
immediate need for an expensive to dig/maintain Nusantara Tunnel. We offer the
formative basic technical specifications for the JSAMT and indicate some of the
physical and cultural geographical facts underpinning our macro-engineering
proposal; offshoots of a perfected and tested JSAMT may be installed at Palk
Strait between India and Sri Lanka, the Gibraltar Strait and the Bering Strait
by mid-21st Century.
