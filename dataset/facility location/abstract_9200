The CCD magnitudes in Johnson $UBV$ and Cousins $RI$ photometric passbands
for the afterglow of the long duration GRB 030226 are presented. Upper limits
of a few mJy to millimeter wave emission at the location of optical are
obtained over the first two weeks. The optical data presented here, in
combination with other published data on this afterglow, show an early $R$ band
flux decay slope of 0.77$\pm$0.04, steepening to 2.05$\pm$0.04 about
0.65$\pm$0.03 day after the burst. Interpreted as the ``jet break'', this
indicates a half opening angle of $\sim 3.2$ degree for the initial ejection,
for an assumed ambient density of $\sim 1 {\rm cm}^{-3}$. Broadband spectra
show no appreciable evolution during the observations, and indicate the
presence of synchrotron cooling frequency $\nu_c$ near the upper edge of the
optical band. From the broadband spectra we derive an electron energy
distribution index $p = 2.07\pm0.06$ and an intrinsic extinction $E(B -
V)\sim0.17$. Millimeter upper limits are consistent with these derived
parameters.
