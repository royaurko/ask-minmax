We present near-IR Colour-Magnitude diagrams and physical parameters for a
sample of 12 galactic globular clusters located toward the inner Bulge region.
For each cluster we provide measurements of the reddening, distance,
photometric metallicity, luminosity of the horizontal branch red clump, and of
the red giant branch bump and tip. The sample discussed here together with that
presented in Valenti, Ferraro & Origlia (2007) represent the largest
homogeneous catalog of Bulge globular clusters (comprising ~ 80% of the entire
Bulge cluster population) ever studied. The compilation is available in
electronic form on the World Wide Web (http://www.bo.astro.it/~GC/ir_archive)
