The lowest 3 tune-out wavelengths of the four alkaline-earth atoms, Be, Mg,
Ca and Sr are determined from tabulations of matrix elements produced from
large first principles calculations. The tune-out wavelengths are located near
the wavelengths for $^3P^o_1$ and $^1P^o_1$ excitations. The measurement of the
tune-out wavelengths could be used to establish a quantitative relationship
between the oscillator strength of the transition leading to existence of the
tune-out wavelength and the dynamic polarizability of the atom at the tune-out
frequency. The longest tune-out wavelengths for Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and Yb are
454.9813 nm, 457.2372 nm, 657.446 nm, 689.200 nm, 788.875 nm and 553.00 nm
respectively.
