We present a detailed analysis of the magnetic field structure found in
general relativistic 3D MHD simulations of accreting tori in the Kerr metric
with different black hole spins. Among the properties analyzed are the field
strength as a function of position and black hole spin, the shapes of field
lines, the degree to which they connect different regions, and their degree of
tangling. We investigate prior speculations about the structure of the magnetic
fields and discuss how frequently certain configurations are seen in the
simulations. We also analyze the distribution of current density, with a view
toward identifying possible locations for magnetic energy dissipation.
