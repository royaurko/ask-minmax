We consider a possibility to use the solar neutrinos for studies of small
scale structures of the Earth and for geological research. Effects of thin
layers of matter with density contrast on oscillations of Beryllium neutrinos
inside the Earth are studied. We find that change of the $^7Be$ neutrino flux
can reach 0.1 % for layers with density of oil and size 20 km. Problems of
detection are discussed. Hypothetical method would consist of measuring the
$^7Be -$ flux by, {\it e.g.}, large deep underwater detector$-$submarine which
could change its location.
