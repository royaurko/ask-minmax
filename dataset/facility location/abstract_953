The Telescopi ROBotic de ARas (TROBAR) is a new robotic facility built at
Aras de Los Olmos (Valencia-Spain). This is a 60cm telescope equipped with a
4kx4k optical camera, corresponding to 30x30 arcmin2 FoV, and it will be
primarily used for a systematic search of Ha emitting stars in the Galactic
Plane to a depth of ~14mag. Both data acquisition and reduction will be
performed automatically. The robotization of data acquisition is now entering
its final phase while the development of the data reduction pipeline has just
started.
