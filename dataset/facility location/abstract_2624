Within the theory of vacuum creation of an $e^{+}e^{-}$ - plasma in the
strong electric fields acting in the focal spot of counter-propagating laser
beams we compare predictions on the basis of different WKB-type approximations
with results obtained in the framework of a strict kinetic approach. Such a
comparison demonstrates a considerable divergence results. We analyse some
reasoning for this observation and conclude that WKB-type approximations have
an insufficient foundation for QED in strong nonstationary fields. The results
obtained in this work on the basis of the kinetic approach are most optimistic
for the observation of an $e^{+}e^{-}$ - plasma in the range of optical and
x-ray laser facilities. We discuss also the influence of unphysical features of
non-adiabatic field models on the reliability of predictions of the kinetic
theory.
