By investigating a parity and time-reversal (PT) symmetric, $N$-site lattice
with impurities $\pm i\gamma$ and hopping amplitudes $t_0 (t_b)$ for regions
outside (between) the impurity locations, we probe the origin of maximal
PT-symmetry breaking that occurs when the impurities are nearest neighbors.
Through a simple and exact derivation, we prove that the critical impurity
strength is equal to the hopping amplitude between the impurities,
$\gamma_c=t_b$, and the simultaneous emergence of $N$ complex eigenvalues is a
robust feature of any PT-symmetric hopping profile. Our results show that the
threshold strength $\gamma_c$ can be widely tuned by a small change in the
global profile of the lattice, and thus have experimental implications.
