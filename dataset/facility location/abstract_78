The Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) will drift away from the Earth
at about 0.1 AU/yr. Microlensing events will therefore have different
characteristics as seen from the satellite and the Earth. From the difference,
it is possible in principle to measure v-tilde, the transverse velocity of the
lens projected onto the observer plane. Since v-tilde has very different values
for different populations (disk, halo, Large Magellanic Cloud), such
measurements could help identify the location, and hence the nature, of the
lenses. I show that the method previously developed by Gould for measuring such
satellite parallaxes fails completely in the case of SIRTF: it is overwhelmed
by degeneracies which arise from fact that the Earth and satellite observations
are in different band passes. I develop a new method which allows for
observations in different band passes and yet removes all degeneracies. The
method combines a purely ground-based measurement of the "parallax asymmetry"
with a measurement of the delay between the time the event peaks at the Earth
and satellite. In effect, the parallax asymmetry determines the component of
v-tilde in the Earth-Sun direction, while the delay time measures the component
of v-tilde in the direction of the Earth's orbit.
