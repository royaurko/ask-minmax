We have observed beta+-delayed alpha and p-alpha emission from the
proton-rich nucleus 21Mg produced at the ISOLDE facility at CERN. The
assignments were cross-checked with a time distribution analysis. This is the
third identified case of beta-p-alpha emission. We discuss the systematic of
beta-delayed particle emission decays, show that our observed decays fit
naturally into the existing pattern, and argue that the patterns are to a large
extent caused by odd-even effects.
