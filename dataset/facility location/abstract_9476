We studied the evolution of isolated strange stars synthetically, considering
the influence of {\it r-}mode instability. Our results show that the cooling of
strange stars with non-ultra strong magnetic fields is delayed by the heating
due to the {\it r-}modes damping during million years, while the spin-down of
the stars is dominated by gravitational radiation. Especially for the strange
stars in a possible existing color-flavor locked phase, the effect of the {\it
r-}mode instability on the evolution of the stars becomes extremely important
since the viscosity, the neutrino emissivity, and the specific heat involving
paring quarks are blocked. It leads to the cooling of these color
superconducting stars is very slow, and the stars can remain high temperature
within million years differing completely from previous understanding. In this
case, a strange star in color-flavor locked phase can be located at the bottom
of its {\it r-}mode instability window for a long time, but does not spin down
to a very low frequency within hours.
