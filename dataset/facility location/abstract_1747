We report the first measurement of the neutron electric form factor $G_E^n$
via $\vec{d}(\vec{e},e'n)p$ using a solid polarized target. $G_E^n$ was
determined from the beam-target asymmetry in the scattering of longitudinally
polarized electrons from polarized deuterated ammonia, $^{15}$ND$_3$. The
measurement was performed in Hall C at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator
Facility (TJNAF) in quasi free kinematics with the target polarization
perpendicular to the momentum transfer. The electrons were detected in a
magnetic spectrometer in coincidence with neutrons in a large solid angle
segmented detector. We find $G_E^n = 0.04632\pm0.00616 (stat.)
  \pm0.00341 (syst.)$ at $Q^2 = 0.495$ (GeV/c)$^2$.
