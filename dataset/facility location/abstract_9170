We have carried out narrow band imaging targeted at the Lya line of emitters
associated with radio galaxies at 2 < z < 5. Subsequent spectroscopy has
confirmed the identity of > 120 Lya emitters and led to the discovery of six
proto-clusters up to z = 4.1 with velocity dispersions between 300 and 1000
km/s. The number of emission line galaxies in the observed fields is four to
fifteen times higher than in blank fields. These results strongly support the
idea that high redshift radio galaxies are the progenitors of central brightest
cluster galaxies located in the progenitors of clusters of galaxies.
