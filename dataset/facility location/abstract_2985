We study synchronization of low-dimensional ($d=2,3,4$) chaotic piecewise
linear maps. For Bernoulli maps we find Lyapunov exponents and locate the
synchronization transition, that numerically is found to be discontinuous
(despite continuously vanishing Lyapunov exponent(s)). For tent maps, a limit
of stability of the synchronized state is used to locate the synchronization
transition that numerically is found to be continuous. For nonidentical tent
maps at the partial synchronization transition, the probability distribution of
the synchronization error is shown to develop highly singular behavior. We
suggest that for nonidentical Bernoulli maps (and perhaps some other
discontinuous maps) partial synchronization is merely a smooth crossover rather
than a well defined transition. More subtle analysis in the $d=4$ case locates
the point where the synchronized state becomes stable. In some cases, however,
a riddled basin attractor appears, and synchronized and chaotic behaviors
coexist. We also suggest that similar riddling of a basin of attractor might
take place in some extended systems where it is known as stable chaos.
