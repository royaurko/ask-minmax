Spitzer IRS spectroscopy supports the interpretation that BP Piscium, a gas
and dust enshrouded star residing at high Galactic latitude, is a first-ascent
giant rather than a classical T Tauri star. Our analysis suggests that BP
Piscium's spectral energy distribution can be modeled as a disk with a gap that
is opened by a giant planet. Modeling the rich mid-infrared emission line
spectrum indicates that the solid-state emitting grains orbiting BP Piscium are
primarily composed of ~75 K crystalline, magnesium-rich olivine; ~75 K
crystalline, magnesium-rich pyroxene; ~200 K amorphous, magnesium-rich
pyroxene; and ~200 K annealed silica ('cristobalite'). These dust grains are
all sub-micron sized. The giant planet and gap model also naturally explains
the location and mineralogy of the small dust grains in the disk. Disk shocks
that result from disk-planet interaction generate the highly crystalline dust
which is subsequently blown out of the disk mid-plane and into the disk
atmosphere.
