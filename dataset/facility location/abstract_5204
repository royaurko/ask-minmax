The Garching-Bonn Deep Survey (GaBoDS) is a virtual 12 square degree cosmic
shear and cluster lensing survey, conducted with the WFI@2.2m MPG/ESO telescope
at La Silla. It consists of shallow, medium and deep random fields taken in
R-band in subarcsecond seeing conditions at high galactic latitude. A
substantial amount of the data was taken from the ESO archive, by means of a
dedicated ASTROVIRTEL program.
  In the present work we describe the main characteristics and scientific goals
of GaBoDS. Our strategy for mining the ESO data archive is introduced, and we
comment on the Wide Field Imager data reduction as well. In the second half of
the paper we report on clusters of galaxies found in the background of NGC 300,
a random archival field. We use weak gravitational lensing and the red cluster
sequence method for the selection of these objects. Two of the clusters found
were previously known and already confirmed by spectroscopy. Based on the
available data we show that there is significant evidence for substructure in
one of the clusters, and an increasing fraction of blue galaxies towards larger
cluster radii. Two other mass peaks detected by our weak lensing technique
coincide with red clumps of galaxies. We estimate their redshifts and masses.
