In this paper, we consider three-dimensional dynamical systems, as for
example the Lorenz model. For these systems, we introduce a method for
obtaining families of two-dimensional surfaces such that trajectories cross
each surface of the family in the same direction. For obtaining these surfaces,
we are guided by the integrals of motion that exist for particular values of
the parameters of the system. Nonetheless families of surfaces are obtained for
arbitrary values of these parameters. Only a bounded region of the phase space
is not filled by these surfaces. The global attractor of the system must be
contained in this region. In this way, we obtain information on the shape and
location of the global attractor. These results are more restrictive than
similar bounds that have been recently found by the method of Lyapunov
functions.
