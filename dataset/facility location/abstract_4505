We present the results of optical and near-IR spectroscopic and near-IR
photometric observations of the emission-line stars Hen3-298 and Hen3-303.
Strong emission in the H-alpha line is found in both objects. The presence of
Fe II and [O I] emission lines in the spectrum of Hen3-298 indicates that it is
a B[e] star. The double-peaked CO line profiles, found in the infrared spectrum
of Hen3-298, along with the optical line profiles suggest that the star is
surrounded by a rotating circumstellar disk. Both objects also show infrared
excesses, similar to those of B[e] stars. The radial velocities of the
absorption and emission lines as well as a high reddening level suggest that
the objects are located in the Norma spiral arm at a distance of 3-4.5 kpc. We
estimated a luminosity of log (L/L_sun) ~ 5.1 and a spectral type of no earlier
than B3 for Hen3-298. Hen3-303 seems to be a less luminous B-type object (log
(L/L_sun) ~ 4.3), located in the same spiral arm.
