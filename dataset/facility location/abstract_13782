The properties of galaxies depend on their environment: red, passive
elliptical galaxies are usually located in denser environments than blue,
star-forming spiral galaxies. This difference in galaxy populations can be
detected at all scales from groups of galaxies to superclusters. In this paper,
we will discuss the effect of the large-scale environment on galaxies. Our
results suggest that galaxies in superclusters are more likely to be passive
than galaxies in voids even when they belong to groups with the same richness.
In addition, the galaxies in superclusters are also affected by the morphology
of the supercluster: filament-type superclusters contain relatively more red,
passive galaxies than spider-type superclusters. These results suggest that the
evolution of a galaxy is not determined by its local environment alone, but the
large-scale environment also affects.
