We use a stellar binary population synthesis code to find the lifetimes and
velocities of several types of possible GRB progenitors: double neutron stars,
black hole neutron stars, black hole white dwarfs, helium star mergers.
Assuming that they are born in different types of galaxies we compute their
spatial distribution and compare it with the observed locations of GRB
afterglows within their hosts. We discuss constraints on the compact object
merger model of GRBs imposed by this comparison and find that the observations
of afterglows and their host galaxies appear inconsistent with the GRB compact
object merger model.
