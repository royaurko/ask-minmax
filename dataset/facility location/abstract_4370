Recently Braga and Mello conjectured that for a given natural number n there
is a piecewise linear system with two zones in the plane with exactly n limit
cycles. In this paper we prove a result from which the conjecture is an
immediate consequence. Several explicit examples are given where location and
stability of limit cycles are provided.
