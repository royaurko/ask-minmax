We investigate recurrence and transience of Branching Markov Chains (BMC) in
discrete time. Branching Markov Chains are clouds of particles which move
(according to an irreducible underlying Markov Chain) and produce offspring
independently. The offspring distribution can depend on the location of the
particle. If the offspring distribution is constant for all locations, these
are Tree-Indexed Markov chains in the sense of \cite{benjamini94}. Starting
with one particle at location $x$, we denote by $\alpha(x)$ the probability
that $x$ is visited infinitely often by the cloud. Due to the irreducibility of
the underlying Markov Chain, there are three regimes: either $\alpha(x) = 0$
for all $x$ (transient regime), or $0 < \alpha(x) < 1$ for all $x$ (weakly
recurrent regime) or $\alpha(x) = 1$ for all $x$ (strongly recurrent regime).
We give classification results, including a sufficient condition for transience
in the general case.
 If the mean of the offspring distribution is constant, we give a criterion for
transience involving the spectral radius of the underlying Markov Chain and the
mean of the offspring distribution.
