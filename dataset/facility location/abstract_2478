We summarize the latest achievements about the extraction of the transversity
parton distribution and proton tensor charge based on an analysis of pion-pair
production in deep-inelastic scattering off transversely polarized targets.
Recently released data for proton and deuteron targets by HERMES and COMPASS
allow for a flavor separation of the valence components of transversity. At
variance with the Collins effect, this extraction is performed in the framework
of collinear factorization and relies on di-hadron fragmentation functions. The
latter have been taken from the first recent analysis of the semi-inclusive
production of two pion pairs in back-to-back jets in e+e- annihilation. We also
comment on the possibility of isolating new azimuthally asymmetric correlations
of opposite pion pairs, which could arise when a fragmenting quark crosses
parity-odd domains localized in Minkowski space-time and induced by the
topologically nontrivial QCD background (the so-called \theta\ vacuum).
