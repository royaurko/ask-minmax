The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is a next-generation radio telescope
currently under construction in the remote Western Australia Outback. Raw data
will be generated continuously at 5GiB/s, grouped into 8s cadences. This high
throughput motivates the development of on-site, real time processing and
reduction in preference to archiving, transport and off-line processing. Each
batch of 8s data must be completely reduced before the next batch arrives.
Maintaining real time operation will require a sustained performance of around
2.5TFLOP/s (including convolutions, FFTs, interpolations and matrix
multiplications). We describe a scalable heterogeneous computing pipeline
implementation, exploiting both the high computing density and FLOP-per-Watt
ratio of modern GPUs. The architecture is highly parallel within and across
nodes, with all major processing elements performed by GPUs. Necessary
scatter-gather operations along the pipeline are loosely synchronized between
the nodes hosting the GPUs. The MWA will be a frontier scientific instrument
and a pathfinder for planned peta- and exascale facilities.
