We report on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of ultrananocrystalline
diamond (UNCD) materials produced by detonation technique. Analysis of the 13C
and 1H NMR spectra, spin-spin and spin-lattice relaxation times in purified
UNCD samples is presented. Our measurements show that UNCD particles consist of
a diamond core that is partially covered by a sp2-carbon fullerene-like shell.
The uncovered part of outer diamond surface comprises a number of hydrocarbon
groups that saturate the dangling bonds. Our findings are discussed along with
recent calculations of the UNCD structure. Significant increase in the
spin-lattice relaxation rate (in comparison with that of natural diamond), as
well as stretched exponential character of the magnetization recovery, are
attributed to the interaction of nuclear spins with paramagnetic centers which
are likely fabrication-driven dangling bonds with unpaired electrons. We show
that these centers are located mainly at the interface between the diamond core
and shell.
