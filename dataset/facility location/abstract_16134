Fragment properties of hot fragmenting sources of similar sizes produced in
central and semi-peripheral collisions are compared in the excitation energy
range 5-10 AMeV. For semi-peripheral collisions a method for selecting compact
quasi-projectiles sources in velocity space similar to those of fused systems
(central collisions) is proposed. The two major results are related to
collective energy. The weak radial collective energy observed for
quasi-projectile sources is shown to originate from thermal pressure only. The
larger fragment multiplicity observed for fused systems and their more
symmetric fragmentation are related to the extra radial collective energy due
to expansion following a compression phase during central collisions. A first
attempt to locate where the different sources break in the phase diagram is
proposed.
