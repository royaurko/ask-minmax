The LOw Frequency ARray - LOFAR - is a new radio interferometer designed with
emphasis on flexible digital hardware instead of mechanical solutions. The
array elements, so-called stations, are located in the Netherlands and in
neighbouring countries. The design of LOFAR allows independent use of its
international stations, which, coupled with a dedicated backend, makes them
very powerful telescopes in their own right. This backend is called the
Advanced Radio Transient Event Monitor and Identification System (ARTEMIS). It
is a combined software/hardware solution for both targeted observations and
real-time searches for millisecond radio transients which uses Graphical
Processing Unit (GPU) technology to remove interstellar dispersion and detect
millisecond radio bursts from astronomical sources in real-time.
