Recently, superconductivity in PuCoGa5 was discovered. It has the same
crystal structure as CeMIn5(M=Ir, Co, Rh). The electron correlation in PuCoGa5
is estimated to be weak compared with CeMIn5, and the filling number of
electrons is considered to be far from 0.5/spin in the band which plays an
important role in realizing the superconductivity. Nevertheless, the
superconducting transition temperature Tc in PuCoGa5 is almost by an order of
magnitude higher than that in CeMIn5. In order to explain the superconductivity
with high Tc, we adopt the periodic Anderson model and calculate Tc by solving
the Dyson-Gor'kov equation derived by the third order perturbation theory with
respect to U. By this calculation, we indicate that the superconducting state
of PuCoGa5 is a d-wave pairing state, and show that the good location of two
Fermi surfaces results in the high Tc in PuCoGa5.
