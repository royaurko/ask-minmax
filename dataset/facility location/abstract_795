Recently we considered the electromagnetic decays of the orbitally-excited
SU(6) 70-plet baryons in large-N_c QCD, fitting to the helicity amplitudes
measured in photoproduction experiments. Using the results of this analysis, we
predict the helicity amplitudes for the decays N^* \to \Delta\gamma and
\Delta^* \to \Delta\gamma. These decays can be studied at a number of new
experimental facilities, and thus provide another nontrivial test of the lowest
order large-N_c predictions.
