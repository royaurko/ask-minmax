We present detections of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect (SZE) at 150GHz and
275GHz for the X-ray luminous z=0.299 cluster 1E0657-67. These observations
were obtained as part of an X-ray, weak lensing, and SZE survey of nearby X-ray
bright clusters. The SZE maps were made with the ACBAR (150, 210, 275 GHz)
bolometer array installed at the Viper telescope located at the South Pole. We
also present preliminary results from a blind SZE cluster survey.
