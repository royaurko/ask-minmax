An extended investigation of the electronic phase diagram of FeSe$_{1-x}$ up
to pressures of $p\simeq2.4$\,GPa by means of ac and dc magnetization, zero
field muon spin rotation (ZF $\mu$SR), and neutron diffraction is presented. ZF
$\mu$SR indicates that at pressures $p\geq0.8$\,GPa static magnetic order
occurs in FeSe$_{1-x}$ and occupies the full sample volume for $p\gtrsim
1.2$\,GPa. ac magnetization measurements reveal that the superconducting volume
fraction stays close to 100% up to the highest pressure investigated. In
addition, above $p\geq1.2$\,GPa both the superconducting transition temperature
$T_{\rm c}$ and the magnetic ordering temperature $T_{\rm N}$ increase
simultaneously, and both superconductivity and magnetism are stabilized with
increasing pressure. Calculations indicate only one possible muon stopping site
in FeSe$_{1-x}$, located on the line connecting the Se atoms along the
$c$-direction. Different magnetic structures are proposed and checked by
combining the muon stopping calculations with a symmetry analysis, leading to a
similar structure as in the LaFeAsO family of Fe-based superconductors.
Furthermore, it is shown that the magnetic moment is pressure dependent and
with a rather small value of $\mu\approx 0.2\,\mu_B$ at $p\simeq2.4$\,GPa.
