BOREXINO, a real-time device for low energy neutrino spectroscopy is nearing
completion of construction in the underground laboratories at Gran Sasso, Italy
(LNGS). The experiment's goal is the direct measurement of the flux of 7Be
solar neutrinos of all flavors via neutrino-electron scattering in an
ultra-pure scintillation liquid. Seeded by a series of innovations which were
brought to fruition by large scale operation of a 4-ton test detector at LNGS,
a new technology has been developed for BOREXINO. It enables sub-MeV solar
neutrino spectroscopy for the first time. This paper describes the design of
BOREXINO, the various facilities essential to its operation, its spectroscopic
and background suppression capabilities and a prognosis of the impact of its
results towards resolving the solar neutrino problem. BOREXINO will also
address several other frontier questions in particle physics, astrophysics and
geophysics.
