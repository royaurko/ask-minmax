Growing and studying large Coulomb crystals, composed of tens to hundreds of
thousands of ions, in linear quadrupole ion traps presents new challenges for
trap implementation. We consider several trap designs, first comparing the
total driven micromotion amplitude as a function of location within the
trapping volume; total micromotion is an important point of comparison since it
can limit crystal size by transfer of radiofrequency drive energy into thermal
energy. We also compare the axial component of micromotion, which leads to
first-order Doppler shifts along the preferred spectroscopy axis in precision
measurements on large Coulomb crystals. Finally, we compare trapping potential
anharmonicity, which can induce nonlinear resonance heating by shifting normal
mode frequencies onto resonance as a crystal grows. We apply a non-deforming
crystal approximation for simple calculation of these anharmonicity-induced
shifts, allowing a straightforward estimation of when crystal growth can lead
to excitation of different nonlinear heating resonances. In the axial
micromotion and anharmonicity points of comparison, we find significant
differences between the compared trap designs, with an original rotated-endcap
trap performing slightly better than the conventional in-line endcap trap.
