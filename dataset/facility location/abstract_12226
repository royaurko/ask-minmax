This paper describes design of the trajectory and analysis of the stability
of collinear point $L_2$ in the Sun-Earth system. The modified restricted three
body problem with additional gravitational potential from the belt is used as
the model for the Sun-Earth system. The effect of radiation pressure of the Sun
and oblate shape of the Earth are considered. The point $L_2$ is asymptotically
stable upto a specific value of time $t$ correspond to each set of values of
parameters and initial conditions. The results obtained from this study would
be applicable to locate a satellite, a telescope or a space station around the
point $L_2$.
