Hawking evaporation of Klein-Gordon and Dirac particles in a non-stationary
Kerr-Newman space-time is investigated by using a method of generalized
tortoise coordinate transformation. The location and the temperature of the
event horizon of a non-stationary Kerr-Newman black hole are derived. It is
shown that the temperature and the shape of the event horizon depend not only
on the time but also on the angle. However, the Fermionic spectrum of Dirac
particles displays a new spin-rotation coupling effect which is absent from
that of Bosonic distribution of scalar particles. The character of this effect
is its obvious dependence on different helicity states of particles spin-1/2.
