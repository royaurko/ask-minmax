It is shown that a nearest nieghbor Square Well (SW) potential leads to
singular behavior in first order. A solution of the first-order perturbative PY
equation for an attractive nearest neighbor square well of width less than the
core diameter reveals singular behavior. Neither the width of the well nor the
depth of the well affects the location of the singularity in the inverse
isothermal compressibility. The analysis is carried out in one dimension.
