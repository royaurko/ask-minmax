A data depth measures the centrality of a point with respect to an empirical
distribution. Postulates are formulated, which a depth for functional data
should satisfy, and a general approach is proposed to construct multivariate
data depths in Banach spaces. The new approach, mentioned as Phi-depth, is
based on depth infima over a proper set Phi of R^d-valued linear functions.
Several desirable properties are established for the Phi-depth and a
generalized version of it. The general notions include known functional data
depths, such as the band depth and graph depths of Lopez-Pintado and Romo, and
many new ones as special cases. In particular a location-slope depth and a
principal component depth are introduced.
