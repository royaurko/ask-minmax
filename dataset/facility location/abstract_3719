Given the considerable percentage of stars that are members of binaries or
stellar multiples in the Solar neighborhood, it is expected that many of these
binaries host planets, possibly even habitable ones. The discovery of a
terrestrial planet in the alpha Centauri system supports this notion. Due to
the potentially strong gravitational interaction that an Earth-like planet may
experience in such systems, classical approaches to determining habitable
zones, especially in close S-Type binary systems, can be rather inaccurate.
Recent progress in this field, however, allows to identify regions around the
star permitting permanent habitability. While the discovery of alpha Cen Bb has
shown that terrestrial planets can be detected in solar-type binary stars using
current observational facilities, it remains to be shown whether this is also
the case for Earth analogues in habitable zones. We provide analytical
expressions for the maximum and RMS values of radial velocity and astrometric
signals, as well as transit probabilities of terrestrial planets in such
systems, showing that the dynamical interaction of the second star with the
planet may indeed facilitate the planets detection. As an example, we discuss
the detectability of additional Earth-like planets in the averaged, extended,
and permanent habitable zones around both stars of the alpha Centauri system.
