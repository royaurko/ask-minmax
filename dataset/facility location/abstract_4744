A soft-wall warped extra dimension allows one to relax the tight constraints
imposed by electroweak data in conventional Randall-Sundrum models. We
investigate a setup, where the lepton flavour structure of the Standard Model
is realised by split fermion locations. Bulk fermions with general locations
are not analytically tractable in a soft-wall background, so we follow a
numerical approach to perform the Kaluza-Klein reduction. Lepton flavour
violation is induced by the exchange of Kaluza-Klein gauge bosons. We find that
rates for processes such as muon-electron conversion are significantly reduced
compared to hard-wall models, allowing for a Kaluza-Klein scale as low as 2
TeV. Accommodating small neutrino masses forces one to introduce a large
hierarchy of scales into the model, making pressing the question of a suitable
stabilisation mechanism.
