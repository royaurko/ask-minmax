The locations of supernovae in the local stellar and gaseous environment in
galaxies contain important clues to their progenitor stars. As part of a
program to study the environments of supernovae using Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) imaging data, we have examined the environment of the Type II-L SN 1979C
in NGC 4321 (M100). We place more rigorous constraints on the mass of the SN
progenitor, which may have had a mass M \approx 17--18 M_sun. Moreover, we have
recovered and measured the brightness of SN 1979C, m=23.37 in F439W (~B;
m_B(max) = 11.6), 17 years after explosion. .
