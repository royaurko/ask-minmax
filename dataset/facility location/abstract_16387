The \emph{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT) discovered a new gamma-ray source
near the Galactic plane, \object{Fermi J0109+6134}, when it flared brightly in
2010 February. The low Galactic latitude (b =-1.2\degr) indicated that the
source could be located within the Galaxy, which motivated rapid
multi-wavelength follow-up including radio, optical, and X-ray observations. We
report the results of analyzing all 19 months of LAT data for the source, and
of X-ray observations with both \emph{Swift} and the \emph{Chandra X-ray
Observatory}. We determined the source redshift, z =0.783, using a Keck LRIS
observation. Finally, we compiled a broadband spectral energy distribution
(SED) from both historical and new observations contemporaneous with the 2010
February flare. The redshift, SED, optical line width, X-ray absorption, and
multi-band variability indicate that this new GeV source is a blazar seen
through the Galactic plane. Because several of the optical emission lines have
equivalent width >5\AA, this blazar belongs in the flat-spectrum radio quasar
category.
