The electron scattering region (ESR) is one of important ingredients in
Seyfert nuclei because it makes possible to observe the hidden broad line
region (hereafter HBLR) in some type 2 Seyfert nuclei (hereafter S2s). However,
little is known about its physical and geometrical properties. Using the number
ratio of S2s with and without HBLR, we investigate statistically where the ESR
is in Seyfert nuclei. Our analysis suggests that the ESR is located at radius
between $\sim$ 0.01 pc and $\sim$ 0.1 pc from the central engine. We also
discuss a possible origin of the ESR briefly.
