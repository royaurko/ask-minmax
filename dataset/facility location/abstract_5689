We present the results of new 3D TIGER spectroscopic observations and
archived HST/WFPC2 and NICMOS images of the central region of M 104. The
[NII]+Ha images reveal the presence of a nuclear spiral structure, and the
gaseous kinematics in the central arcsecond shows evidence for kinematical
decoupling of the central peak. A straight nuclear dust lane, with a weak
symmetric counterpart, is seen in the V-I and V-H colour maps. These results
hint for the presence of a strong nuclear bar, that would be located inside the
inner Linblad resonance of the large-scale bar discussed by Emsellem (1995).
