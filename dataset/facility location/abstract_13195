Cloud computing is a new computing paradigm which allows sharing of resources
on remote server such as hardware, network, storage using internet and provides
the way through which application, computing power, computing infrastructure
can be delivered to the user as a service. Cloud computing unique attribute
promise cost effective Information Technology Solution (IT Solution) to the
user. All computing needs are provided by the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and
they can be increased or decreased dynamically as required by the user. As data
and Application are located at the server and may be beyond geographical

objective of this paper is to explore the key issues of cloud computing which
is delaying its adoption.
