The usage of a Crystalline Undulator (CU) has been identified as a promising
solution for generating powerful and monochromatic $\gamma$-rays. A CU was
fabricated at SSL through the grooving method, i.e., by the manufacturing of a
series of periodical grooves on the major surfaces of a crystal. The CU was
extensively characterized both morphologically via optical interferometry at
SSL and structurally via X-ray diffraction at ESRF. Then, it was finally tested
for channeling with a 400 GeV/c proton beam at CERN. The experimental results
were compared to Monte Carlo simulations. Evidence of planar channeling in the
CU was firmly observed. Finally, the emission spectrum of the positron beam
interacting with the CU was simulated for possible usage in currently existing
facilities.
