We construct a spinning closed string solution in AdS_5 x S^5 which is folded
in the radial direction and has two equal spins in AdS_5 and a spin in S^5. The
energy expression of the three-spin solution specified by the folding and
winding numbers for the small S^5 spin shows a logarithmic behavior and a
one-third power behavior of the large total AdS_5 spin, in the long string and
in the short string located near the boundary of AdS_5 respectively. It
exhibits the non-regular expansion in the 't Hooft coupling constant, while it
takes the regular one when the S^5 spin becomes large.
