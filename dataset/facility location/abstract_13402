Quantification of sputter depth profiles is frequently done by fitting the
convolution integral over concentration and depth resolution function. For a
thin delta layer, there exist analytical solutions. The analytical depth
resolution functions of two popular approaches, that of the MRI model and that
of Dowsett and coworkers are compared. It is concluded that the analytical
depth resolution function of the MRI model gives the correct location of a
buried delta layer with respect to the measured profile, and a clear
description of the information depth in AES, XPS and SIMS. Both analytical
solutions can be extended to larger layer thickness. But they are less flexible
with respect to physical parameters which are not constant with concentration
or sputtered depth, such as detection sensitivity, atomic mixing, roughness or
preferential sputtering. For these cases, numerical solutions have to be used.
