We report a study of cloud cover over Indonesia based on meteorological
satellite data, spanning over the past 15 years (from 1996 to 2010) in order to
be able to select a new astronomical site capable to host a multi-wavelength
astronomical observatory. High spatial resolution of meteorological satellite
data acquired from {\it Geostationary Meteorological Satellite 5} ({\it GMS
5}), {\it Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 9} ({\it GOES 9}),
and {\it Multi-functional Transport Satellite-1R} ({\it MTSAT-1R}) are used to
derive yearly average clear fractions over the regions of Indonesia. This
parameter is determined from temperature measurement of the IR3 channel (water
vapor, 6.7 $\mu$m) for high altitude clouds (cirrus) and from the IR1 channel
(10.7 $\mu$m) for lower altitude clouds. Accordingly, an algorithm is developed
to detect the corresponding clouds. The results of this study are then adopted
to select the best possible sites in Indonesia to be analysed further by
performing in situ measurements planned for the coming years. The results
suggest that regions of East Nusa Tenggara, located in south-eastern part of
Indonesia, are the most promising candidates for such an astronomical site.
Yearly clear sky fraction of this regions may reach better than 70 per cent
with an uncertainty of 10 per cent.
