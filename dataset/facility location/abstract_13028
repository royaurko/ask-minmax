The Frame-Stewart algorithm for the 4-peg variant of the Tower of Hanoi,
introduced in 1941, partitions disks into intermediate towers before moving the
remaining disks to their destination. Algorithms that partition the disks have
not been proven to be optimal, although they have been verified for up to 30
disks. This paper presents a dynamic programming approach to this algorithm,
using tabling in B-Prolog. This study uses a variation of the problem,
involving configurations of disks, in order to contrast the tabling approach
with the approaches utilized by other solvers. A comparison of different
partitioning locations for the Frame-Stewart algorithm indicates that, although
certain partitions are optimal for the classic problem, they need to be
modified for certain configurations, and that random configurations might
require an entirely new algorithm.
