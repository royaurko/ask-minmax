The windows can be responsible for unnecessary energy consumption in a
building, if incorrectly designed, shadowed or oriented. Considering an annual
thermal comfort assessment of a space, if windows are over-dimensioned, they
can contribute to the increase of the heating needs due to heat losses, and
also to the increase of cooling needs due to over-exposure to solar radiation.
When under-dimensioned, the same space may benefit from reduced heat losses
through the glazing surface but does not benefit from solar radiation gains.
Therefore, it is important to find the optimum design that minimizes both the
heating and cooling needs. This paper presents a parametric study of window
type (single, double and triple glazing), orientation and opening size, located
in the city of Coimbra, Portugal. An annual and a seasonal assessment were
done, in order to obtain the set of optimum values around 360 degree
orientation.
