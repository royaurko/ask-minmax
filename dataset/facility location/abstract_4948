By employing T-matrix approach, we investigate a nonmagnetic impurity located
on the surface of three-dimensional topological insulators, where the time
reversal symmetry is preserved. It is shown that the images of the local
density of states (LDOS) around the single impurity have the dip-hump
structures with six-fold symmetry at different bias voltages. The peaks are
produced by quasiparticle interference while the local minima at the
backscattering wave vectors are due to the absence of backscatterings. With
increasing the bias voltage, the peaks and dips move forward to the location of
the impurity. These dips at the backscattering wave vectors in the LDOS spectra
can be regarded as a signature of the time reversal symmetry in the topological
surface states, which could be observed by scanning tunneling microscopy.
