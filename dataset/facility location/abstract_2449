Presented here are the results of a broadband spectral line survey of the Sgr
B2(N) - LMH region from 260 - 286 GHz using the Caltech Submillimeter
Observatory. The data were taken over the course of a single night (May 26,
2013) during the course of science testing of the remote observational
capabilities of the facility. The data are freely available to public both as
raw, double-side band observational data and as a minimally-reduced ascii
spectrum. The procedural scripts used for the preliminary data reduction using
CLASS are provided as well. The observational parameters and preliminary data
reduction procedures are detailed. Finally, we provide instructions for
accessing the data as well as comment on the robustness of the preliminary
reduction.
