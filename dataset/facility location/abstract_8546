Though it is agreed that the post-bounce, pre-explosion cores of massive
stars are unstable to transonic, Rayleigh-Taylor-like instabilities, the role
convective motions may play in igniting the supernova explosion itself is not
yet clear. Whatever that role, the morphology and nucleosynthetic yields of the
explosion, the recoil of the protoneutron star, the spatial distribution of
fresh $^{56}$Ni, and the gravitational wave and neutrino signatures of the
event will be affected in interesting ways. I review a subset of the issues
raised by the new paradigm and some of the technical obstacles that remain. I
focus on neutrino transfer, the role of progenitor structure, kick mechanisms,
and the location and potential consequence of various hydrodynamic
instabilities.
