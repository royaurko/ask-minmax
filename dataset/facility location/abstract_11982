VERITAS is an array of four 12-m diameter imaging atmospheric-Cherenkov
telescopes located in southern Arizona. Its aim is to study the very high
energy (VHE: E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray emission from astrophysical objects. In
addition to the study of blazars, the VERITAS extragalactic science program
develops a comprehensive observational program of extragalactic non-blazar
sources. The study of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is intensively pursued
through the large MWL observational campaign on non-blazar radio galaxies. The
success of these MWL campaigns has for the first time provided insights to the
inner structures of jets responsible for gamma-ray emission. The problem of the
origin and acceleration of ultra-high energy cosmic rays is pursued through the
observation of the starburst galaxy M 82, whose detection at VHE delivers
important insights on the possible acceleration mechanisms. Finally,
investigation of globular clusters places important limits on the millisecond
pulsar contribution to their addressed gamma-ray emission. The VERITAS
extragalactic non-blazar science program and its results are presented.
