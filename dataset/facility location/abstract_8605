The Hubble Space Telescope has been used to obtain WFPC2 (V,I) photometry for
a large sample of stars in the outer halo of the giant elliptical NGC 5128 (d =
4 Mpc). The globular cluster N5128-C44, at the center of the Planetary Camera
field, is well enough resolved to permit the construction of a color-magnitude
diagram (CMD) for it which covers the brightest two magnitudes of the giant
branch. The CMD is consistent with that of a normal old, moderately
low-metallicity ([Fe/H] = -1.30 globular cluster, distinctly more metal-poor
than most of the field halo stars at the same projected location (which average
[Fe/H] ~ -0.5). This is the most distant globular cluster in which direct
color-magnitude photometry has been achieved to date, and the first one
belonging to a giant E galaxy.
