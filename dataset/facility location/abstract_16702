Similarity matching and join of time series data streams has gained a lot of
relevance in today's world that has large streaming data. This process finds
wide scale application in the areas of location tracking, sensor networks,
object positioning and monitoring to name a few. However, as the size of the
data stream increases, the cost involved to retain all the data in order to aid
the process of similarity matching also increases. We develop a novel framework
to addresses the following objectives. Firstly, Dimension reduction is
performed in the preprocessing stage, where large stream data is segmented and
reduced into a compact representation such that it retains all the crucial
information by a technique called Multi-level Segment Means (MSM). This reduces
the space complexity associated with the storage of large time-series data
streams. Secondly, it incorporates effective Similarity Matching technique to
analyze if the new data objects are symmetric to the existing data stream. And
finally, the Pruning Technique that filters out the pseudo data object pairs
and join only the relevant pairs. The computational cost for MSM is O(l*ni) and
the cost for pruning is O(DRF*wsize*d), where DRF is the Dimension Reduction
Factor. We have performed exhaustive experimental trials to show that the
proposed framework is both efficient and competent in comparison with earlier
works.
