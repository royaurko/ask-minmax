We present results from the XMM-Newton observation of the non-cooling flow
cluster A1060. Large effective area of XMM-Newton enables us to investigate the
nature of this cluster in unprecedented detail. From the observed surface
brightness distribution, we have found that the gravitational mass distribution
is well described by the NFW profile but with a central density slope of ~1.5.
We have undoubtedly detected a radial temperature decrease of as large as ~30%
from the center to the outer region (r ~13'), which seems much larger than that
expected from the temperature profile averaged over nearby clusters. We have
established that the temperature of the region ~7' southeast of the center is
higher than the azimuthally averaged temperature of the same radius by ~20%.
Since the pressure of this region already reaches equilibrium with the
environment, the temperature structure can be interpreted as having been
produced between 4*10^7 yr (the sound-crossing time) and 3*10^8 yr (the thermal
conduction time) ago. We have found that the high-metallicity blob located at
\~1.'5 northeast of NGC 3311 is more extended and its iron mass of 1.9*10^7
M_solar is larger by an order of magnitude than estimated from our Chandra
observation. The amount of iron can still be considered as being injected
solely from the elliptical galaxy NGC3311.
