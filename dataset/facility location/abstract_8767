We present a study of Jovian Trojan objects detected serendipitously during
the course of a sky survey conducted at the University of Hawaii 2.2-meter
telescope. We used a 8192 x 8192 pixel charge-coupled device (CCD) mosaic to
observe 20 deg^2 at locations spread over the L4 Lagrangian swarm and reached a
limiting magnitude V = 22.5 mag (50% of maximum detection efficiency).
Ninety-three Jovian Trojans were detected with radii 2 - 20 km (assumed albedo
0.04). Their differential magnitude distribution has a slope of 0.40 +/- 0.05
corresponding to a power law size distribution index 3.0 +/- 0.3 (1-sigma). The
total number of L4 Trojans with radii > 1 km is of order 1.6 x 10^5 and their
combined mass (dominated by the largest objects) is ~ 10^{-4} M_{Earth}. The
bias-corrected mean inclination is 13.7 +/- 0.5 deg. We also discuss the size
and spatial distribution of the L4 swarm.
