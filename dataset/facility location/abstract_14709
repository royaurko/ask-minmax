We have studied the UV extinction properties along 30 Galactic sightlines
using data from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) archive that have
never been previously examined. These distant (d > 1 kpc) sightlines were
selected to investigate the distribution and physical conditions of gas located
in low density regions of the Galactic disk and halo. The average densities
along these sightlines are extremely low. It is likely that they are dominated
by the warm intercloud medium and have little contribution from the cold cloud
medium. We find that a subsample of these sightlines has extinction curves with
weak bumps and very steep far-UV extinction reminiscent of the Magellanic
clouds. These sightlines all lie in the region bounded by 325 < l < 0 and -5 >
b > -11. The gas along these sightlines shows forbidden velocities which may
indicate that the dust has been subject to shocks. This type of low density
sightline may mimic the environments found in the Magellanic Clouds. Large
values of N(Ca II)/N(Na I) indicating low depletion are associated with steep
far-UV extinction. A possible correlation exists between decreasing bump
strength and increasing far-UV steepness for extinction curves in the Galaxy
and the Magellanic Clouds.
