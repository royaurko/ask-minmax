The present Report concerns the current status of the Italian Tau/Charm
accelerator project and in particular discusses the issues related to the
lattice design, to the accelerators systems and to the associated conventional
facilities. The project aims at realizing a variable energy Flavor Factory
between 1 and 4.6 GeV in the center of mass, and succeeds to the SuperB project
from which it inherits most of the solutions proposed in this document. The
work comes from a cooperation involving the INFN Frascati National Laboratories
accelerator experts, the young newcomers, mostly engineers, of the Cabibbo Lab
consortium and key collaborators from external laboratories.
