In this paper we address the consumption of energy by astronomers while
performing their professional duties. Although we find that astronomy uses a
negligible fraction of the US energy budget, the rate at which energy is
consumed by an average astronomer is similar to that of a typical high-flying
businessperson. We review some of the ways in which astronomers are already
acting to reduce their energy consumption. In the coming decades, all citizens
will have to reduce their energy consumption to conserve fossil fuel reserves
and to help avert a potentially catastrophic change in the Earth's climate. The
challenges are the same for astronomers as they are for everyone: decreasing
the distances we travel and investing in energy-efficient infrastructure. The
high profile of astronomy in the media, and the great public interest in our
field, can play a role in promoting energy-awareness to the wider population.
Our specific recommendations are therefore to 1) reduce travel when possible,
through efficient meeting organization, and by investing in high-bandwidth
video conference facilities and virtual-world software, 2) create
energy-efficient observatories, computing centers and workplaces, powered by
sustainable energy resources, and 3) actively publicize these pursuits.
