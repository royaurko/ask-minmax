In this paper, we theoretically show that a broadband resonant enhancement of
emission may occur for infrared sources located in a polaritonic wire medium.
The reason of this enhancement is overlapping of two topological transitions of
the wave dispersion in the medium. The first topological transition has been
recently revealed as an effect inherent to polaritonic wire media. The second
one was theoretically uncovered in another material. In this work we reveal it
for wire media and prove the possibility to combine both these transitions with
the purpose to obtain the broadband resonant Purcell factor. We compare the
results obtained for two orientations of a subwavelength electric dipole
embedded into wire medium -- that along the optical axis and that perpendicular
to it -- and report on the resonant isotropic radiation enhancement. Also, we
reveal the enhancement of radiation to free space from a finite sample of the
wire medium.
