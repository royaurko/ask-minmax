Poorly understood feedback processes associated with highly-luminous black
hole accretion in quasars may dramatically affect the properties of their host
galaxies. We search for the effect of quasar feedback on surrounding gas using
Planck maps of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZ). By stacking tSZ
Compton-y maps centered on the locations of 26,686 spectroscopic quasars from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we detect a strong but unresolved tSZ Compton-y
signal at >5 sigma significance that likely originates from a combination of
virialized halo atmosphere gas and quasar feedback effects. We show that the
feedback contribution to our detected quasar tSZ signal is likely to dominate
over virialized halo gas by isolating the feedback tSZ component for high- and
low-redshift quasars. We find that this quasar tSZ signal also scales with
black hole mass and bolometric luminosity, all consistent with general
expectations of quasar feedback. We estimate the mean angularly-integrated
Compton-y of quasars at z~1.5 to be 3.5x10^-6 Mpc^2, corresponding to mean
total thermal energies in feedback and virialized halo gas of 1.1(+/- 0.2) x
10^62 erg, and discuss the implications for quasar feedback. If confirmed, the
large total thermal feedback energetics we estimate of 5% (+/-1% statistical
uncertainty) of the black hole mass will have important implications for the
effects of quasar feedback on the host galaxy, as well as the surrounding
intergalactic medium.
