We present a statistical analysis of network and internetwork properties in
the photosphere and the chromosphere. For the first time we simultaneously
observed (a) the four Stokes parameters of the photospheric iron line pair at
630.2 nm and (b) the intensity profile of the Ca II H line at 396.8 nm. The
vector magnetic field was inferred from the inversion of the iron lines. We aim
at an understanding of the coupling between photospheric magnetic field and
chromospheric emission.
