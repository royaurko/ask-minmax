We have developed the Model Master (MM) language for describing spreadsheets,
and tools for converting MM programs to and from spreadsheets. The MM
decompiler translates a spreadsheet into an MM program which gives a concise
summary of its calculations, layout, and styling. This is valuable when trying
to understand spreadsheets one has not seen before, and when checking for
errors. The MM compiler goes the other way, translating an MM program into a
spreadsheet. This makes possible a new style of development, in which
spreadsheets are generated from textual specifications. This can reduce error
rates compared to working directly with the raw spreadsheet, and gives
important facilities for code reuse. MM programs also offer advantages over
Excel files for the interchange of spreadsheets.
