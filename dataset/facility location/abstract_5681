We develop a physical model of the zodiacal cloud incorporating the real dust
sources of asteroidal, cometary, and kuiperoidal origin. Using the inferred
distribution of the zodiacal dust, we compute its thermal emission and
scattering at several wavelengths (1.25, 5, and 20 $\mu$m) as a function of
NGST location assumed to be at 1 AU or 3 AU. Areas on the sky with a minimum of
zodiacal light are determined.
