This paper presents the nearest neighbor value (NNV) algorithm for high
resolution (H.R.) image interpolation. The difference between the proposed
algorithm and conventional nearest neighbor algorithm is that the concept
applied, to estimate the missing pixel value, is guided by the nearest value
rather than the distance. In other words, the proposed concept selects one
pixel, among four directly surrounding the empty location, whose value is
almost equal to the value generated by the conventional bilinear interpolation
algorithm. The proposed method demonstrated higher performances in terms of
H.R. when compared to the conventional interpolation algorithms mentioned.
