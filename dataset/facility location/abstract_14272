Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) study of magnetic anisotropy is presented for
thin layers of IV-VI diluted magnetic semiconductor Ge1-xMn xTe with x=0.14
grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on KCl (001) substrate with a thin PbTe
buffer. Analysis of the angular dependence of the FMR resonant field reveals
that an easy magnetization axis is located near to the normal to the layer
plane and is controlled by two crystal distortions present in these
rhombohedral Ge1-xMnxTe layers: the ferroelectric distortion with the relative
shift of cation and anion sub-lattices along the [111] crystal direction and
the biaxial in-plane, compressive strain due to thermal mismatch.
