We report the discovery of a new O-type double-lined spectroscopic binary
with a short orbital period of 1.4 days. We find the primary component of this
binary, FO 15, to have an approximate spectral type O5.5Vz, i.e. a
Zero-Age-Main-Sequence star. The secondary appears to be of spectral type
O9.5V. We have performed a numerical model fit to the public ASAS photometry,
which shows that FO 15 is also an eclipsing binary. We find an orbital
inclination of ~ 80 deg. From a simultaneous light-curve and radial velocity
solution we find the masses and radii of the two components to be 30 +/- 1 and
16 +/- 1 solar masses and 7.5 +/- 0.5 and 5.3 +/- 0.5 solar radii. These radii,
and hence also the luminosities, are smaller than those of normal O-type stars,
but similar to recently born ZAMS O-type stars. The absolute magnitudes derived
from our analysis locate FO 15 at the same distance as Eta Carinae. From
Chandra and XMM X-ray images we also find that there are two close X-ray
sources, one coincident with FO 15 and another one without optical counterpart.
This latter seems to be a highly variable source, presumably due to a
pre-main-sequence stellar neighbour of FO 15.
