Available recommender systems mostly provide recommendations based on the
users preferences by utilizing traditional methods such as collaborative
filtering which only relies on the similarities between users and items.
However, collaborative filtering might lead to provide poor recommendation
because it does not rely on other useful available data such as users locations
and hence the accuracy of the recommendations could be very low and
inefficient. This could be very obvious in the systems that locations would
affect users preferences highly such as movie recommender systems. In this
paper a new location-based movie recommender system based on the collaborative
filtering is introduced for enhancing the accuracy and the quality of
recommendations. In this approach, users locations have been utilized and take
in consideration in the entire processing of the recommendations and peer
selections. The potential of the proposed approach in providing novel and
better quality recommendations have been discussed through experiments in real
datasets.
