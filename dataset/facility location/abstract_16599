RF sensor networks are wireless networks that can localize and track people
(or targets) without needing them to carry or wear any electronic device. They
use the change in the received signal strength (RSS) of the links due to the
movements of people to infer their locations. In this paper, we consider
real-time multiple target tracking with RF sensor networks. We perform radio
tomographic imaging (RTI), which generates images of the change in the
propagation field, as if they were frames of a video. Our RTI method uses RSS
measurements on multiple frequency channels on each link, combining them with a
fade level-based weighted average. We describe methods to adapt machine vision
methods to the peculiarities of RTI to enable real time multiple target
tracking. Several tests are performed in an open environment, a one-bedroom
apartment, and a cluttered office environment. The results demonstrate that the
system is capable of accurately tracking in real-time up to 4 targets in
cluttered indoor environments, even when their trajectories intersect multiple
times, without mis-estimating the number of targets found in the monitored
area. The highest average tracking error measured in the tests is 0.45 m with
two targets, 0.46 m with three targets, and 0.55 m with four targets.
