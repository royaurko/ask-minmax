A seismic array has been deployed at the Sanford Underground Research
Facility in the former Homestake mine, South Dakota, to study the underground
seismic environment. This includes exploring the advantages of constructing a
third-generation gravitational-wave detector underground. A major noise source
for these detectors would be Newtonian noise, which is induced by fluctuations
in the local gravitational field. The hope is that a combination of a low-noise
seismic environment and coherent noise subtraction using seismometers in the
vicinity of the detector could suppress the Newtonian noise to below the
projected noise floor for future gravitational-wave detectors. In this paper,
we use Wiener filtering techniques to subtract coherent noise in a seismic
array in the frequency band 0.05 -- 1\,Hz. This achieves more than an order of
magnitude noise cancellation over a majority of this band. We show how this
subtraction would benefit proposed future low-frequency gravitational wave
detectors. The variation in the Wiener filter coefficients over the course of
the day, including how local activities impact the filter, is analyzed. We also
study the variation in coefficients over the course of a month, showing the
stability of the filter with time. How varying the filter order affects the
subtraction performance is also explored. It is shown that optimizing filter
order can significantly improve subtraction of seismic noise, which gives hope
for future gravitational-wave detectors to address Newtonian noise.
