We present Spitzer high spectral resolution IRS spectroscopy of three
positions in the carbon-rich outflow of post-AGB star HD 44179, better known as
the Red Rectangle. Surprisingly, the spectra show some strong unknown
mid-infrared resonances, in the 13-20 micron range. The shape and position of
these resonances varies with position in the nebula, and are not correlated
with the PAH features. We conclude these features are due to oxygen-rich
minerals, located in a region which is believed to be predominantly
carbon-rich. We provide possible explanations for the presence of oxygen-rich
dust in the carbon-rich outflows. Simple Mg-Fe-oxides are suggested as carriers
of these unidentified features.
