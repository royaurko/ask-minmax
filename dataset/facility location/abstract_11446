Radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation has transformed treatment for
tachyarrhythmias and has become first-line therapy for some tachycardias. The
precise localization of the arrhythmogenic site and the positioning of the RF
catheter over that site are problematic: they can impair the efficiency of the
procedure and are time consuming (several hours). Electroanatomic mapping
technologies are available that enable the display of the cardiac chambers and
the relative position of ablation lesions. However, these are expensive and use
custom-made catheters. The proposed methodology makes use of standard catheters
and inexpensive technology in order to create a 3D volume of the heart chamber
affected by the arrhythmia. Further, we propose a novel method that uses a
priori 3D information of the mapping catheter in order to estimate the 3D
locations of multiple electrodes across single view C-arm images. The monoplane
algorithm is tested for feasibility on computer simulations and initial canine
data.
