We study the gauge dynamics of an SO(4)-gauge theory with two Dirac Wilson
fermions transforming according to the vector representation of the gauge
group. We determine the lattice phase diagram by locating the strong coupling
bulk phase transition line and the zero PCAC mass line. We present results for
the spectrum of the theory. In particular we measure the pseudoscalar, vector
and axial meson masses. The data are consistent with a chiral symmetry breaking
scenario rather than a conformal one. When used to break the electroweak
symmetry dynamically the model leads to a natural dark matter candidate.
