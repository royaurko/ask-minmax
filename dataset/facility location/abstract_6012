We prove the existence of a family of initial data for the Einstein vacuum
equation which can be interpreted as the data for two Kerr-like black holes in
arbitrary location and with spin in arbitrary direction. When the mass
parameter of one of them is zero, this family reduces exactly to the Kerr
initial data. The existence proof is based on a general property of the Kerr
metric which can be used in other constructions as well. Further
generalizations are also discussed.
