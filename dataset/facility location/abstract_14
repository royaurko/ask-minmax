In this paper we apply theoretical and practical results from facility
location theory to the problem of community detection in networks. The result
is an algorithm that computes bounds on a minimization variant of local
modularity. We also define the concept of an edge support and a new measure of
the goodness of community structures with respect to this concept. We present
preliminary results and note that our methods are massively parallelizable.
