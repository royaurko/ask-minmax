We analyze albedo data obtained using the Herschel Space Observatory that
reveal the existence of two distinct types of surface among midsized
transneptunian objects. A color-albedo diagram shows two large clusters of
objects, one redder and higher albedo and another darker and more neutrally
colored. Crucially, all objects in our sample located in dynamically stable
orbits within the classical Kuiper belt region and beyond are confined to the
bright-red group, implying a compositional link. Those objects are believed to
have formed further from the Sun than the dark-neutral bodies. This
color-albedo separation is evidence for a compositional discontinuity in the
young solar system.
