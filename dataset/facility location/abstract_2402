By comparison with high-resolution synchrotron x-ray experimental results, we
assess several theoretical treatments for the bound-free (core-electron)
contribution to x-ray Thomson scattering (i.e., also known as nonresonant
inelastic x-ray scattering). We identify an often overlooked source of
systematic error in the plane- wave form factor approximation (PWFFA) used in
the inference of temperature, ionization state, and free electron density in
some laser-driven compression studies of warm dense matter. This error is due
to a direct violation of energy conservation in the PWFFA. We propose an
improved practice for the bound-free term that will be particularly relevant
for XRTS experiments performed with somewhat improved energy resolution at the
National Ignition Facility or the Linac Coherent Light Source. Our results
raise important questions about the accuracy of state variable determination in
XRTS studies, given that the limited information content in low-resolution XRTS
spectra does not strongly constrain the models of electronic structure being
used to fit the spectra.
