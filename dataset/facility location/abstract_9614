We have developed an exact method to calculate the vortex-antivortex
interaction energy in the anisotropic 3D-XY model. For this calculation, dual
transformation which is already known for the 2D XY-model was extended. We
found an explicit form of this interaction energy as a function of the
anisotropic ratio and the separation $r$ between the vortex and antivortex
located on the same layer. The form of interaction energy is $\ln r$ at the
small $r$ limi t but is proportional to $r$ at the opposite limit. This form of
interaction energ y is consistent with the upper bound calculation using the
variational method by Cataudella and Minnhagen.
