We present our analysis of Kepler observations of 29 RR Lyrae stars, based on
138-d of observation. We report precise pulsation periods for all stars. Nine
of these stars had incorrect or unknown periods in the literature. Fourteen of
the stars exhibit both amplitude and phase Blazhko modulations, with Blazhko
periods ranging from 27.7 to more than 200 days. For V445 Lyr, a longer
secondary variation is also observed in addition to its 53.2-d Blazhko period.
The unprecedented precision of the Kepler photometry has led to the discovery
of the the smallest modulations detected so far. Moreover, additional
frequencies beyond the well-known harmonics and Blazhko multiplets have been
found. These frequencies are located around the half-integer multiples of the
main pulsation frequency for at least three stars. In four stars, these
frequencies are close to the first and/or second overtone modes. The amplitudes
of these periodicities seem to vary over the Blazhko cycle. V350 Lyr, a
non-Blazhko star in our sample, is the first example of a double mode RR Lyrae
star that pulsates in its fundamental and second overtone modes.
