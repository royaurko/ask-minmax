Results of analysis of RXTE observations of strongly absorbed X-ray sources
IGR J16318-4848 and IGR J16358-4726 are presented. Careful subtraction of
Galactic ridge emission contribution to the observed spectra of RXTE/PCA
allowed us to obtain the spectra of the sources in 3-25 keV energy band.
Spectra of the sources cold be well described by a power law with
photoabsorption. It is shown that the value of absorption column in the case of
RXTE observation of IGR J16318-4848 performed on March 14.1, 2003 is somewhat
higher that that obtained by XMM observatory on Feb 10.7 2003. This could imply
that the source has variable absorption, presumably connected with an orbital
phase of the binary system. It is noted, that all three X-ray sources,
discovered by INTEGRAL observatory in the sky region of (l,b)~(336,0) (IGR
J16318-4848, IGR J16320-4751 and IGR J16358-4726) have large intrinsic
photoabsorption and could be high mass X-ray binaries. This hypothesis has
indirect support from the fact that their are located close to the Norma spiral
arm tangent, i.e. in the region of enhanced concentrations of young massive
stars. If they are reside within this spiral arm some rough estimation of the
sources distance could be made -- D~6-8 kpc.
