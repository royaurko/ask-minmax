WIYN/HYDRA spectra in the Li 6708 Angstrom region have been obtained for 332
probable members of the old open cluster, NGC 6819. Preliminary analysis shows
a pattern of Li depletion from the top of the turnoff to the base of the giant
branch. Starting one magnitude below the level of the clump, all brighter
giants have A(Li) below 1.0, with most having upper limits below 0.5. Star
W007017, located BELOW the first-ascent red giant bump is Li-rich with A(Li) =
2.3. As a highly probable single-star astrometric and radial-velocity cluster
member, its discrepant asteroseismic membership could be a by-product of the
processes that triggered Li-enhancement. Its color-magnitude diagram location
is consistent with only one proposed enhanced mixing process among first-ascent
red giants.
