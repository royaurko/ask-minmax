The reaction gamma p --> K0 Sigma+ was measured in the photon energy range
from threshold up to 2.6 GeV with the SAPHIR detector at the electron stretcher
facility, ELSA, in Bonn. Results are presented on the reaction cross section
and the polarization of the Sigma+ as a function of the kaon production angle
in the centre-of-mass system, cos(Theta_K^{c.m.}), and the photon energy. The
cross section is lower and varies less with photon energy and kaon production
angle than that of gamma p --> K+ Sigma0. The Sigma+ is polarized predominantly
at cos(Theta_K^{c.m.}) \approx 0. The data presented here are more precise than
previous ones obtained with SAPHIR and extend the photon energy range to higher
values. They are compared to isobar model calculations.
