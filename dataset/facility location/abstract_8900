The core collapse of a massive star in the Milky Way will produce a neutrino
burst, intense enough to be detected by existing underground detectors. The
AMANDA neutrino telescope located deep in the South Pole ice can detect MeV
neutrinos by a collective rate increase in all photo-multipliers on top of dark
noise. The main source of light comes from positrons produced in the
CC-reaction of anti-electron neutrinos on free protons $\antinue + p \to e^+ +
n$. This paper describes the first supernova search performed on the full sets
of data taken during 1997 and 1998 (215 days of live time) with 302 of the
detector's optical modules. No candidate events resulted from this search. The
performance of the detector is calculated, yielding a 70% coverage of the
Galaxy with one background fake per year with 90% efficiency for the detector
configuration under study. An upper limit at the 90% c.l. on the rate of
stellar collapses in the Milky Way is derived, yielding 4.3 events per year. A
trigger algorithm is presented and its performance estimated. Possible
improvements of the detector hardware are reviewed.
