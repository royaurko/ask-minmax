We investigate the Hubbard model on a two-dimensional square lattice by the
perturbation expansion to the fourth order in the on-site Coulomb repulsion U.
Numerically calculating all diagrams up to the fourth order in self-energy, we
examine the convergence of perturbation series in the lattice system. We
indicate that the coefficient of each order term rapidly decreases as in the
impurity Anderson model for T > 0.1t in the half-filled case, but it holds in
the doped case even at lower temperatures. Thus, we can expect that the
convergence of perturbation expansion in U is very good in a wide parameter
region also in the lattice system, except for T < 0.1t in the half-filled case.
We next calculate the density of states in the fourth-order perturbation. In
the half-filled case, the shape in a moderate correlation regime is quite
different from the three peak structure in the second-order perturbation.
Remarkable upper and lower Hubbard bands locate at w = +(-)U/2, and a pseudogap
appears at the Fermi level w=0. This is considered as the precursor of the
Mott-Hubbard antiferromagnetic structure. In the doped case, quasiparticles
with very heavy mass are formed at the Fermi level. Thus, we conclude that the
fourth-order perturbation theory overall well explain the asymptotic behaviors
in a strong correlation regime.
