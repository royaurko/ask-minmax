In this paper, we aim to determine the location information of a node
deployed in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). We estimate the position of an
unknown source node using localization based on linear approach on a single
simulation platform. The Cramer Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for position estimate is
derived first and the four linear approaches namely Linear Least Squares (LLS),
Subspace Approach (SA), Weighted Linear Least Squares (WLLS) and Two-step WLS
have been derived and presented. Based on the simulation study the results have
been compared. The simulation results show that the Two- step WLS approach is
having higher localization accuracy.
