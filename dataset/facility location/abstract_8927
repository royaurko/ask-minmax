We present VLBA observations at 15 GHz of ten GHz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) radio
sources. The cores are often difficult or impossible to locate. When likely
cores are found, they account for a small fraction of the flux density in GPS
galaxies - around or below 2%, while in GPS quasars they can account for more
than 20% of the total flux density. We detect low polarization in the GPS
sources -- i.e., typically less than a few percent and often less than one
percent. This establishes that low polarization in the parsec scale structure
is an important defining characteristic of the GPS sources. The dichotomy in
the radio morphology versus optical identification, i.e., galaxies are
symmetric and quasars are not, is basically confirmed from these new data,
which also indicate that the radio emission from GPS quasars is dominated by a
jet, with often a weak or hidden core, suggesting they are at moderate angles
to the line of sight, and so are only moderately beamed.
