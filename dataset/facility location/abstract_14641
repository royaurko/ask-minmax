We present preliminary results from two observations of the radio galaxy
Centaurus A performed by the BeppoSAX satellite. We did not detect any spectral
variation of the nuclear continuum in spite of the long-term flux change (by a
factor 1.3) between the two observations. At both epochs, the nuclear
point-like emission was well fitted with a strongly absorbed power law with an
exponential cutoff at high energies (E_cutoff>200 keV). We also observed a
significant flux variation of the iron line between the two observations. The
flux of the line and of the continuum changed in the opposite sense. The line
is more intense at the first epoch, when the nuclear source was at the lower
intensity level. The implied delay between the continuum and line variations
strongly suggests that the cold material responsible for the iron line
production is not located very near to the primary X-ray source. There is also
evidence that the line profile changed between the two epochs, being broader
and slightly blueshifted when the source was fainter. It is possible that the
emission feature is a blend of cold and ionized iron lines produced in separate
regions surrounding the nuclear source.
