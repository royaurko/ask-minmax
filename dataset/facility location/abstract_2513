The use of transverse electric (TE) waves has proved to be a powerful,
noninvasive method for estimating the densities of electron clouds formed in
particle accelerators. Results from the plasma simulation program VORPAL have
been a useful guide for experimental studies related to this method, which have
been performed at various accelerator facilities. This paper provides results
of the simulation and modeling work done in conjunction with experimental
efforts carried out at CesrTA. The discussion starts from the phase shift
induced by electron clouds in the transmission of the wave, followed by the
effect of reflections along the beam-pipe, the simulation of the resonant wave
method and the effects of external magnetic fields, namely dipoles and
wigglers. A derivation of the dispersion relationship of wave propagation for
arbitrary geometries in field free regions with a uniform cloud density is also
provided.
