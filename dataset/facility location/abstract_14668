We suggest that an extreme Kerr black hole with a mass $\sim 10^6M_\odot$, a
dimensionless angular momentum $A\sim 1$ and a marginal stable orbital radius
$r_{ms}\sim 3r_s\sim 10^{12}M_6 cm$ located in a normal galaxy, may produced a
Gamma-ray Burst by capturing and disrupting a star. During this period, a
transient accretion disk is formed and a strong transient magnetic field $\sim
2.4\times 10^9M_6^{-1/2}$ Gauss, lasting for $r_{ms}/c\sim 30 M_6 s$, may be
produced in the inner boundary of the accretion disk. A large amount of
rotational energy of the black hole is extracted and released in the ultra
relativistic jet with a bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ larger than $10^3$ via
Blandford-Znajek process.
  The relativistic jet energy can be converted into $\gamma$-ray radiation via
internal shock mechanism. The gamma-ray burst (GRB) duration should be the same
as that of the life time of the strong transient magnetic field. The maximum
number of sub-bursts is estimated to be $r_{ms}/h\sim (10 - 10^2)$ because the
disk material is likely broken into pieces with the size about the thickness of
the disk $h$ at the cusp ($2r_s\le r \le 3r_s$). The shortest rising time of
the burst estimated from this model is $\sim h/\Gamma c\sim 3\times
10^{-4}\Gamma^{-1}_3(h/r)_{-2}M_6$ s. The model gamma-ray burst density rate is
also estimated.
