Laser acceleration promises innovation in particle beam therapy of cancer
where an ultra-compact accelerator system for cancer beam therapy can become
affordable to a broad range of patients. This is not feasible without the
introduction of a technology that is radically different from the conventional
accelerator-based approach. The laser acceleration method provides many
enhanced capabilities for the radiation oncologist. It reduces the overall
system size and weight by more than one order of magnitude. The characteristics
of the particle beams (protons) make them suitable for a class of therapy that
might not be possible with the conventional accelerator, such as the ease for
changing pulse intensity, the focus spread, the pinpointedness, and the dose
delivery in general. A compact, uncluttered system allows a PET device to be
located in the vicinity of the patient in concert with the compact gantry. The
radiation oncologist may be able to irradiate a localized tumor by scanning
with a pencil-like particle beam while ascertaining the actual dosage in the
patient with an improved in-beam PET verification of auto-radioactivation
induced by the beam therapy. This should yield an unprecedented flexibility in
the feedback radiotherapy by the radiation oncologist. Laser accelerated
radiotherapy has a unique niche in a current world of high energy accelerator
using synchrotron or cyclotron.
