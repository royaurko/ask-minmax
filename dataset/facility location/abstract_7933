The machine described in this document is an advanced Source of up to 20 MeV
Gamma Rays based on Compton back-scattering, i.e. collision of an intense high
power laser beam and a high brightness electron beam with maximum kinetic
energy of about 720 MeV. Fully equipped with collimation and characterization
systems, in order to generate, form and fully measure the physical
characteristics of the produced Gamma Ray beam. The quality, i.e. phase space
density, of the two colliding beams will be such that the emitted Gamma ray
beam is characterized by energy tunability, spectral density, bandwidth,
polarization, divergence and brilliance compatible with the requested
performances of the ELI-NP user facility, to be built in Romania as the Nuclear
Physics oriented Pillar of the European Extreme Light Infrastructure. This
document illustrates the Technical Design finally produced by the EuroGammaS
Collaboration, after a thorough investigation of the machine expected
performances within the constraints imposed by the ELI-NP tender for the Gamma
Beam System (ELI-NP-GBS), in terms of available budget, deadlines for machine
completion and performance achievement, compatibility with lay-out and
characteristics of the planned civil engineering.
