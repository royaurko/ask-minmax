This paper presents an analysis of target localization accuracy, attainable
by the use of MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) radar systems, configured
with multiple transmit and receive sensors, widely distributed over a given
area. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for target localization accuracy is
developed for both coherent and non-coherent processing. Coherent processing
requires a common phase reference for all transmit and receive sensors. The
CRLB is shown to be inversely proportional to the signal effective bandwidth in
the non-coherent case, but is approximately inversely proportional to the
carrier frequency in the coherent case. We further prove that optimization over
the sensors' positions lowers the CRLB by a factor equal to the product of the
number of transmitting and receiving sensors. The best linear unbiased
estimator (BLUE) is derived for the MIMO target localization problem. The
BLUE's utility is in providing a closed form localization estimate that
facilitates the analysis of the relations between sensors locations, target
location, and localization accuracy. Geometric dilution of precision (GDOP)
contours are used to map the relative performance accuracy for a given layout
of radars over a given geographic area.
