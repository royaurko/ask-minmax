We present integral field spectroscopy of NGC 5033, a low luminosity Seyfert
galaxy. The observations were made with INTEGRAL, a fiber based system
operating at the WHT. The intensity map of the H$\beta$ emission line
represents a spiral or ring-like pattern of HII regions. On the contrary, the
[OIII] intensity map morphology is markedly anisotropic. The strong
morphological differences imply that the [OIII] emitters represent highly
ionized gas illuminated by the central source. The [OIII] map morphology is
compatible with a biconical structure of ionization induced by strong
extinction in the galaxy disc that also obscures half of the spheroidal stellar
bulge. We identify the spectrum corresponding to the Seyfert 1 nucleus from the
presence of H$\beta$ broad emission lines. This spectrum is located in a region
where strong extinction is expected but exhibits the bluest spectral energy
distribution. The Seyfert 1 nucleus seems to be offcenter with respect to the
stellar rotation center. This result has been also found in other Seyfert
galaxies and interpreted in terms of a past merger. The offcentering could
indicate the presence of nonsymmetric departures in the gravitational potential
which could be fueling the active nucleus. The kinematics of the [OIII]
emitters show important deviations at a kpc scale with respect to the stellar
velocity field and show features related to the asymmetrical morphology of the
high ionization region.
