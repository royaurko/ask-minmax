Chondrules are millimeter sized objects of spherical to irregular shape that
constitute the major component of chondritic meteorites that originate in the
region between Mars and Jupiter and which fall to Earth. They appear to have
solidified rapidly from molten or partially molten drops. The heat source that
melted the chondrules remains uncertain. The intense radiation from a gamma-ray
burst (GRB) is capable of melting material at distances up to 300 light years.
These conditions were created in the laboratory for the first time when
millimeter sized pellets were placed in a vacuum chamber in the white
synchrotron beam at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The pellets
were rapidly heated in the X-ray and gamma-ray furnace to above 1400C melted
and cooled. This process heats from the inside unlike normal furnaces. The
melted spherical samples were examined with a range of techniques and found to
have microstructural properties similar to the chondrules that come from
meteorites. This experiment demonstrates that GRBs can melt precursor material
to form chondrules that may subsequently influence the formation of planets.
This work extends the field of laboratory astrophysics to include high power
synchrotron sources.
