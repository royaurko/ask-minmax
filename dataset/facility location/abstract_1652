I summarize the abilities of LEP-II, the SSC/LHC hadron colliders, and a
future high energy $\epem$ collider (NLC) to detect the Higgs bosons of the
Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM). I then review the unique capabilities of a
back-scattered laser beam facility (BSLBF) at the NLC for detecting the heavier
neutral Higgs bosons (the $\hh$ and $\ha$) of the MSSM. A BSLBF could well
allow $\hh$ and $\ha$ discovery via inclusive $\gam\gam\rta \hh,\ha$ production
out to masses of order $0.8\sqrt s$, \ie\ roughly $400\gev$, at the NLC. In
addition, a BSLBF allows one to check for CP violation in the neutral Higgs
sector; such CP violation is predicted to be absent in the MSSM. (Full
