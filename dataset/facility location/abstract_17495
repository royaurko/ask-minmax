Topological objects of $SU(3)$ gluodynamics are studied at the infrared scale
near the transition temperature with the help of zero and near-zero modes of
the overlap Dirac operator. We construct UV filtered topological charge
densities corresponding to three versions of the temporal boundary condition
applied to this operator, for which the zero mode is known to be located on
corresponding three constituent dyons (antidyons) in the reference case of an
analytical (anti)caloron solution. The clustering of the three topological
charge densities marks the positions of three types of dyons and antidyons
which can therefore be considered as present in equilibrium (Monte Carlo)
gluonic fields at the given resolution scale. We classify them either as
constituents of nondissociated (anti)calorons or as constituents of (anti)dyon
pairs or as isolated (anti)dyons. The pattern of the Polyakov loop describing
the centers and the interior of these clusters is observed after a limited
number of overimproved cooling steps and resembles the description known from
analytical caloron solutions.
