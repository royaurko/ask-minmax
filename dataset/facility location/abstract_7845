A mesoscopic continuum model is employed to analyse the transport mechanisms
and structure formation during the redistribution stage of deposition
experiments where organic molecules are deposited on a solid substrate with
periodic stripe-like wettability patterns. Transversally invariant ridges
located on the more wettable stripes are identified as very important transient
states and their linear stability is analysed. It is found that there exist two
different instability modes that result (i) at large ridge volume in the
formation of bulges that spill from the more wettable stripes onto the less
wettable bare substrate and (ii) at small ridge volume in the formation of
small droplets located on the more wettable stripes. These predictions are
confirmed by direct numerical simulations of the fully nonlinear evolution
equation for two-dimensional substrates. In addition, the influence of
different transport mechanisms during redistribution is investigated focusing
on the cases of convective transport with no-slip at the substrate, transport
via diffusion in the film bulk and via diffusion at the film surface. In
particular, it is shown that the transport process does neither influence the
linear stability thresholds nor the sequence of morphologies observed in the
time simulation, but only the ratio of the time scales of the different process
phases.
