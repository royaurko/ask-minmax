Narrowband spikes of the decimeter type have been identified in dynamic
spectrograms of Phoenix-2 of ETH Zurich and located in position with the Nancay
Radioheliograph at the same frequency. The spike positions have been compared
with the location of hard X-ray emission and the thermal flare plasma in soft
X-rays and EUV lines. The decimetric spikes are found to be single sources
located some 20" to 400" away from the flare site in hard or soft X-rays. In
most cases there is no bright footpoint nearby. In at least two cases the
spikes are near loop tops. These observations do not confirm the widely held
view that the spike emission is produced by some loss-cone instability masering
near the footpoints of flare loops. On the other hand, the large distance to
the flare sites and the fact that these spikes are all observed in the flare
decay phase make the analyzed spike sources questionable sites for the main
flare electron acceleration. They possibly indicate coronal post-flare
acceleration sites.
