The third moments of conserved charges, the baryon and electric charge
numbers, and energy, as well as their mixed moments, carry more information on
the state around the QCD phase boundary than previously proposed fluctuation
observables and higher order moments. In particular, their signs give plenty of
information on the location of the state created in relativistic heavy ion
collisions in the temperature and baryon chemical potential plane. We
demonstrate this with an effective model.
