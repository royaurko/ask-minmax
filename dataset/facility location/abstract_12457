In this work we have proposed a geometric model that is employed to devise a
scheme for identifying the hotspots and zones in a chip. These spots or zone
need to be guarded thermally to ensure performance and reliability of the chip.
The model namely continuous unit sphere model has been presented taking into
account that the 3D region of the chip is uniform, thereby reflecting on the
possible locations of heat sources and the target observation points. The
experimental results for the - continuous domain establish that a region which
does not contain any heat sources may become hotter than the regions containing
the thermal sources. Thus a hotspot may appear away from the active sources,
and placing heat sinks on the active thermal sources alone may not suffice to
tackle thermal imbalance. Power management techniques aid in obtaining a
uniform power profile throughout the chip, but we propose an algorithm using
minimum bipartite matching where we try to move the sources minimally (with
minimum perturbation in the chip floor plan) near cooler points (blocks) to
obtain a uniform power profile due to diffusion of heat from hotter point to
cooler ones.
