An investigation of the early stage formation of graphene on the C-face of
6H-SiC is presented. We show that the sublimation of few atomic layers of Si
out of the SiC substrate is not homogeneous. In good agreement with the results
of theoretical calculations it starts from defective sites, mainly dislocations
that define nearly circular flakes, which have a pyramidal, volcano-like, shape
with a center chimney where the original defect was located. At higher
temperatures, complete conversion occurs but, again, it is not homogeneous.
Within the sample surface the intensity of the Raman G and 2D bands, evidences
non-homogeneous thickness.
