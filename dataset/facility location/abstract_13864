We report Swift/BAT survey observations of the Tycho's supernova remnant,
performed over a period of 104 months since the mission's launch. The remnant
is detected with high significance (>10 sigma) below 50 keV. We detect
significant hard X-ray emission in the 60-85 keV band, above the continuum
level predicted by a simple synchrotron model. The location of the observed
excess is consistent with line emission from radioactive Titanium-44, so far
reported only for Type II supernova explosions. We discuss the implications of
these results in the context of the galactic supernova rate, and
nucleosynthesis in Type Ia supernova.
