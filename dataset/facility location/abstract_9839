The effect of impurities situated at different distances from a
two-dimensional electron gas on the density of states in a strong magnetic
field is analyzed. Based on the exact result of Brezin, Gross, and Itzykson, we
calculate the density of states in the whole energy range, assuming the Poisson
distribution of impurities in the bulk. It is shown that in the case of small
impurity concentration the density of states is qualitatively different from
the model case when all impurities are located in the plane of the
two-dimensional electron gas.
