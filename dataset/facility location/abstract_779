We report on a search for the free decay component of pi- stopped in water
and light materials. A non-zero value of this would be an indication of
anomalous nu_e contamination to the nu_e and nu_mu_bar production at
stopped-pion neutrino facilities. No free decay component of pi- was observed
in water, Beryllium, and Aluminum, for which upper limits were established at
8.2E-4, 3.2E-3, and 7.7E-3, respectively.
