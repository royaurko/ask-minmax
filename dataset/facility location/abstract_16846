A major concern in designing tribo-systems is to minimize friction, save
energy, and to reduce wear. Satisfying these requirements depends on the
integrity of the rubbing surface and its suitability to sliding conditions. As
such, designers currently focus on constructing surfaces that are an integral
part of the function of the tribo-system. Inspirations for such constructs come
from studying natural systems and from implementing natural design rules. One
species that may serve as an analogue for design is the Ball python. This is
because such a creature while depending on legless locomotion when sliding
against various surfaces, many of which are deemed tribologically hostile,
doesn't sustain much damage. Resistance to damage in this case originates from
surface design features. As such, studying these features and how do they
contribute to the control of friction and wear is very attractive for design
purposes. In this work we apply a multi scale surface characterization approach
to study surface design features of the Python regius that are beneficial to
design high quality lubricating surfaces (such as those obtained through
plateau honing). To this end, we studied topographical features by SEM and
through White Light Interferrometery (WLI). We further probe the roughness of
the surface on multi scale and as a function of location within the body. The
results are used to draw a comparison to metrological features of commercial
cylinder liners obtained by plateau honing.
