We have conducted a detailed analysis of the emission geometry of a handful
of radio pulsars that have prominent, multiple-component profiles at meter
wavelengths. From careful determination of the total number of emission
components and their locations in pulse longitude, we find that all of the six
pulsars show clear evidence for retardation and aberration effects in the conal
emission beams. Using this information, coupled with a dipolar field geometry,
we obtain estimates of the height and transverse location in the magnetosphere,
for each of the emitting cones in these pulsars. These results support our
earlier conclusions for PSR B0329+54 in that we find successive outer cones (in
cases of multi-cone pulsars) being emitted at higher altitudes in the
magnetosphere. The range of inferred heights is from ~200 to ~2200 km. The set
of ``active'' field lines from which the conal emissions originate are located
in the region from ~0.22 to ~0.74 of the polar cap radius. At the neutron star
surface, these conal rings map to radii of a few to several tens of meters and
the separation between successive rings is about 10 to 20 meters. We discuss
the implications of these findings for the understanding of the pulsar emission
geometry and for current theories and models of the emission mechanism.
