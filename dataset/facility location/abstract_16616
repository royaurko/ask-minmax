In this paper, a grid of the binary evolution models are calculated for the
study of blue straggler (BS) population in intermediate age ($\log
Age$=7.85-8.95) star clusters. The BS formation via mass transfer and merging
is studied systematically using our models. Both Case A and B close binary
evolutionary tracks are calculated in a large range of parameters. The results
show that BSs formed via Case B are generally bluer and even more luminous than
those produced by Case A. Furthermore, the larger range in orbital separations
of Case B models provide a probability of producing more BSs than Case A. Based
on the grid of models, several Monte-Carlo simulations of BS populations in the
clusters in the age range are carried out. The results show that BSs formed via
different channels populate different areas in color magnitude diagram(CMD).
The locations of BSs in CMD for a number of clusters are compared to our
simulations as well. In order to investigate the influence of mass transfer
efficiency in the models and simulations, a set of models are also calculated
by implementing a constant mass transfer efficiency, $\beta$=0.5 during Roche
lobe overflow (Case A binary evolution excluded). The result shows BSs can be
formed via mass transfer at any given age in both cases. However, the
distributions of the BS populations on CMD are different.
