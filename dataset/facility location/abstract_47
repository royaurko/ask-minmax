The OPERA long-baseline oscillation experiment is located in the underground
Gran Sasso laboratory in Italy. OPERA has been designed to observe nu-mu ->
nu-tau appearance in the CNGS nu-mu beam, 730 km away from its source at CERN.
The apparatus consists of a large set of emulsion-lead targets combined with
electronic detectors. First runs in 2007 and 2008 helped checking that detector
and related emulsion facilities are fully operational and led to successful
first analysis of collected data. The talk, after a short description of the
OPERA setup, will present an updated status report on data reconstruction and
analysis applied to present samples of neutrino events.
