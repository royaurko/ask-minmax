Enhancing and controlling chaotic advection or chaotic mixing within liquid
droplets is crucial for a variety of applications including digital
microfluidic devices which use microscopic ``discrete'' fluid volumes
(droplets) as microreactors. In this work, we consider the Stokes flow of a
translating spherical liquid droplet which we perturb by imposing a
time-periodic rigid-body rotation. Using the tools of dynamical systems, we
have shown in previous work that the rotation not only leads to one or more
three-dimensional chaotic mixing regions, in which mixing occurs through the
stretching and folding of material lines, but also offers the possibility of
controlling both the size and the location of chaotic mixing within the drop.
Such a control was achieved through appropriate tuning of the amplitude and
frequency of the rotation in order to use resonances between the natural
frequencies of the system and those of the external forcing. In this paper, we
study the influence of the orientation of the rotation axis on the chaotic
mixing zones as a third parameter, as well as propose an experimental set up to
implement the techniques discussed.
