When a rotating neutron star loses angular momentum, the reduction of the
centrifugal force makes it contract. This perturbs each fluid element, raising
the local pressure and originating deviations from beta equilibrium, inducing
reactions that release heat (rotochemical heating). This effect has previously
been studied by Fern\'andez and Reisenegger for neutron stars of non-superfluid
matter and by Petrovich and Reisenegger for superfluid matter, finding that the
system in both cases reaches a quasi-steady state, corresponding to a partial
equilibration between compression, due to the loss of angular momentum, and
reactions that try to restore the equilibrium. However, Petrovich and
Reisenegger assumes a constant value of the superfluid energy gap, whereas
theoretical models predict density-dependent gap amplitudes, and therefore gaps
that depend on the location in the star. In this work, we try to discriminate
between several proposed gap models, comparing predicted surface temperatures
to the value measured for the nearest millisecond pulsar, J0437-4715.
