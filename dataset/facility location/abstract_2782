We determine the location of the second order endpoint of the line of first
order chiral phase transition in 3-flavor QCD at vanishing chemical potential.
Using Ferrenberg-Swendsen reweighting for two values of the quark mass we
determine the dependence of the transition line on the chemical potential and
locate the chiral critical point. For both quantities we find a significant
quark mass dependence.
