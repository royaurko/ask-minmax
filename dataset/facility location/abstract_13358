The group factor for the higher representations of the $SU(4)$ gauge group is
investigated. For the zero N-ality representations, the minimum values of the
real part of the group factor which appear at large distances, are located at
the points where $50%$ of the maximum vortex flux is in the Wilson loop. This
amount is equal to $60%$ for the representations which belong to N-ality=$1$
class except the fundamental representation. The value of the real part of the
group factor at the minimum points is equal to the value of center of the group
factor at intermediate distances. The appearance of these points is due to the
difference between the asymptotic and intermediate string tensions. The group
factor passes the phase factor to create the larger intermediate string tension
than the asymptotic one.
