In longitudinal and spatial studies, observations often demonstrate strong
correlations that are stationary in time or distance lags, and the times or
locations of these data being sampled may not be homogeneous. We propose a
nonparametric estimator of the correlation function in such data, using kernel
methods. We develop a pointwise asymptotic normal distribution for the proposed
estimator, when the number of subjects is fixed and the number of vectors or
functions within each subject goes to infinity. Based on the asymptotic theory,
we propose a weighted block bootstrapping method for making inferences about
the correlation function, where the weights account for the inhomogeneity of
the distribution of the times or locations. The method is applied to a data set
from a colon carcinogenesis study, in which colonic crypts were sampled from a
piece of colon segment from each of the 12 rats in the experiment and the
expression level of p27, an important cell cycle protein, was then measured for
each cell within the sampled crypts. A simulation study is also provided to
illustrate the numerical performance of the proposed method.
