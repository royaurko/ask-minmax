Recently, the CO J=3-2 observational result of the envelope of the 21
micrometer PPN IRAS 07134+1005 has been reported. Assuming that the CO J=3-2
line was optically thin, the mass-loss rate of the superwind in this PPN was
found to be at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than the typical range. In
order to obtain a more accurate mass-loss rate, we reexamine this data and
construct a radiative transfer model to compare with the data. Also, in order
to better resolve the superwind, we adopt a different weighting on the data to
obtain maps at higher resolution. Our result shows that the CO J=3-2 emission
is located slightly further away from the central source than the mid-IR
emission, probably because that the material is cooler in the outer part and
thus better traced by the CO emission. At lower resolution, however, the CO
emission appeared to be spatially coincident with the mid-IR emission. Our
model has two components, an inner ellipsoidal shell-like superwind with an
equatorial density enhancement and an outer spheroidal AGB wind. The thick
torus in previous model could be considered as the dense equatorial part of our
ellipsoidal superwind. With radiative transfer, our model reproduces more
observed features than previous model and obtains an averaged superwind
mass-loss rate of ~ 1.8 x 10^-5 solar mass per year, which is typical for a
superwind. The mass-loss rate in the equatorial plane is 3 x 10^-5 solar mass
per year, also the same as that derived before from modeling CO J=1-0 emission.
