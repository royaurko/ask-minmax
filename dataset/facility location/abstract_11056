We use angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to study the
momentum dependence of the superconducting gap in NdFeAsO1-xFx single crystals.
We find that the Gamma hole pocket is fully gapped below the superconducting
transition temperature. The value of the superconducting gap is 15 +- 1.5 meV
and its anisotropy around the hole pocket is smaller than 20% of this value.
This is consistent with an isotropic or anisotropic s-wave symmetry of the
order parameter or exotic d-wave symmetry with nodes located off the Fermi
surface sheets. This is a significant departure from the situation in the
cuprates, pointing to possibility that the superconductivity in the iron
arsenic based system arises from a different mechanism.
