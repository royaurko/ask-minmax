The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and the Jansky Very
Large Array (JVLA) have recently begun probing the Universe. Both provide the
largest collecting area available at locations on a high dry site, endowing
them with unparalleled potential for sensitive spectral line observations. Over
the next few years, these telescopes will be joined by other telescopes to
provide advances in maser science, including NOEMA and the LMT. Other
instruments of note for maser science which may commence construction include
the North American Array, the CCAT, and an enlarged worldwide VLB network
outfitted to operate into the millimeter wavelength regime.
