In this paper we study a facility location problem in the plane in which a
single point (facility) and a rapid transit line (highway) are simultaneously
located in order to minimize the total travel time from the clients to the
facility, using the $L_1$ or Manhattan metric. The rapid transit line is given
by a segment with any length and orientation, and is an alternative
transportation line that can be used by the clients to reduce their travel time
to the facility. We study the variant of the problem in which clients can enter
and exit the highway at any point. We provide an $O(n^3)$-time algorithm that
solves this variant, where $n$ is the number of clients. We also present a
detailed characterization of the solutions, which depends on the speed given in
the highway.
