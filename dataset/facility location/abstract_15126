High resolution (lambda / Delta-lambda = 50,000) K-band spectra of massive,
embedded, young stellar objects are presented. The present sample consists of
four massive young stars located in nascent clusters powering Galactic giant H
II regions. Emission in the 2.3 micron 2--0 vibrational--rotational bandhead of
CO is observed. A range of velocity broadened profiles seen in three of the
objects is consistent with the emission arising from a circumstellar disk seen
at various inclination angles. Br gamma spectra of the same spectral and
spatial resolution are also presented which support an accretion disk or torus
model for massive stars. In the fourth object, Br emission suggesting a
rotating torus is observed, but the CO profile is narrow, indicating that there
may be different CO emission mechanisms in massive stars and this is consistent
with earlier observations of the BN object and MWC 349. To--date, only young
massive stars of late O or early B types have been identified with clear
accretion disk signatures in such embedded clusters. Often such stars are found
in the presence of other more massive stars which are revealed by their
photospheric spectra but which exhibit no disk signatures. This suggests the
timescale for dissipating their disks is much faster than the less massive OB
stars or that the most massive stars do not form with accretion disks.
