We propose a simple extension of the well known ST2 model for water [F.H.
Stillinger and A. Rahman, J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 60}, 1545 (1974)] that allows for
a continuous modification of the hydrogen bond angular flexibility. We show
that the bond flexibility affects the relative thermodynamic stability of the
liquid and of the hexagonal (or cubic) ice. On increasing flexibility, the
liquid-liquid critical point, which in the original ST2 model is located in the
no-man's land (i. e. the region where ice is the thermodynamically stable
phase) progressively moves to a temperature where the liquid is more stable
than ice. Our study definitively proves that the liquid-liquid transition in
ST2 is a genuine phenomenon, of high relevance in all tetrahedral
network-forming liquids, including water.
