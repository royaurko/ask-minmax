In the article of V.V. Anisovich et al., Yad. Fiz. 63, 1489 (2000), the
K-matrix solutions for the wave IJ^{PC}=00^{++} were obtained in the mass
region 450 - 1900 MeV where four resonances f0(980), f0(1300), f0(1500),
f0(1750) and the broad state f0(1530^{+90}_{-250}) are located. Based on these
solutions, we determine partial widths for scalar-isoscalar states decaying
into the channels pi-pi, K-anti K, eta-eta, eta-eta', pi-pi-pi-pi and
corresponding decay couplings.
