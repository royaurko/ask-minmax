We present new solutions of noncommutative gauge theories in which coincident
unstable vortices expand into unstable circular shells. As the theories are
noncommutative, the naive definition of the locations of the vortices and
shells is gauge-dependent, and so we define and calculate the profiles of these
solutions using the gauge-invariant noncommutative Wilson lines introduced by
Gross and Nekrasov. We find that charge 2 vortex solutions are characterized by
two positions and a single nonnegative real number, which we demonstrate is the
radius of the shell. We find that the radius is identically zero in all
2-dimensional solutions. If one considers solutions that depend on an
additional commutative direction, then there are time-dependent solutions in
which the radius oscillates, resembling a braneworld description of a cyclic
universe. There are also smooth BIon-like space-dependent solutions in which
the shell expands to infinity, describing a vortex ending on a domain wall.
