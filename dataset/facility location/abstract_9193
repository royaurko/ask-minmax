We present multi-colour broad band CCD photometric observations of a few
thousands of stars located region of the galactic globular clusters NGC 1904
and NGC 6341. These observations are used to generate their deep colour
magnitude diagrams (CMDs) to study overall morphologies of sub giant, red
giant, asymptotic giant and horizontal branches. We also determine the main
sequence morphology of the NGC 6341. A comparison of their CMDs with the
theoretical isochrones given by Demarque et al. (1996) indicates an age of 14
and 16 Gyr for NGC 1904 and NGC 6341 GGCs respectively. We present a new method
for artificial add star experiment. Using this method on the photometric data
of galactic globular cluster NGC 6341, we determined the completeness factor in
B, V and I pass bands. We have determined the luminosity function of the main
sequence stars down to V $\sim$ 21.0 (M$_{V} \sim$ 6.5) from the V Vs (B-V)
colour magnitude diagram of this cluster. Using accurate parameters of 64 GGCs,
we derived relations between galactocentric distance R, distance from the
galactic plane Z$_{g}$ and metalicity [Fe/H] of GGCs.
