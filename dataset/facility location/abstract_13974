A suitable interpolation method is essential to keep the noise level minimum
along with the time-delay. In recent years, many different interpolation
filters have been developed for instance H.264-6 tap filter, and AVS- 4 tap
filter. The present work uses Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
technique to model and investigate the effects of a four-tap low-pass tap
filter (Grid-adaptive filter) on a hole-filled depth image. The work
demonstrates the general form of uniform interpolations for both integer and
sub-pixel locations in terms of the sampling interval and filter length of
depth-images via diverse finite impulse response filtering schemes. The
demonstrated model combined modelling function of fuzzy inference with the
learning ability of artificial neural network.
