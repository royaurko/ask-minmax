The Linear Collider TPC collaboration constructed a Large Prototype TPC
(LPTPC) which is now installed at the EUDET facility, in DESY. The
SiLC-collaboration (Silicon for the Linear Collider) will install position
sensitive silicon strip sensors outside the field cage of the LPTPC, to provide
precise tracking information. The data acquisition system (DAQ) is an adapted
CMS readout system. The silicon modules are tested and ready to be installed,
the mechanical module support and the DAQ system are in preparation.
