An anisotropic thermal plasma phase of a strongly coupled gauge theory can be
holographically modelled by an anisotropic AdS black hole. The temperature and
anisotropy parameter of the AdS black hole background of interest [1] is
specified by the location of the horizon and the value of the Dilaton field at
the horizon. Interestingly, for the first time, we obtain two functions for the
values of the horizon and Dilaton field in terms of the temperature and
anisotropy parameter. Then by introducing a number of spinning probe D7-branes
in the anisotropic background, we compute the value of the chiral magnetic
effect (CME). We observe that in the isotropic and anisotropic plasma the value
of the CME is equal for the massless quarks. However, at fixed temperature,
raising the anisotropy in the system will increase the value of the CME for the
massive quarks.
