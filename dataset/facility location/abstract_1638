A substantial body of data is described by the Standard Model of particle
physics. However the description is far from perfect and there is a growing
number of internal inconsistencies. These fall short of qualifying as
discoveries; nevertheless, examination of their merits is both interesting and
worthwhile. The existence of three families of quarks and leptons is not
understood. There are new data, especially from the B factories; the latter are
shining new light on the problem. From several experiments, data show that our
thoughts about the existence of transitions between neutrino flavors,
oscillations, may be correct but the understanding of the patterns needs work.
However, we see the opening of a number of avenues of investigation as new
facilities and experiments come online.
