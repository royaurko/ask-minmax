We present high-sensitivity near-IR images of a carbon-rich proto-planetary
nebula, AFGL 618, obtained with the Subaru Telescope. These images have
revealed ``bullets'' and ``horns'' extending farther out from the edges of the
previously known bipolar lobes. The spatial coincidence between these near-IR
micro-structures and the optical collimated outflow structure, together with
the detection of shock-excited, forbidden IR lines of atomic species, strongly
suggests that these bullets and horns represent the locations from which
[\ion{Fe}{2}] IR lines arise. We have also discovered CO clumps moving at $>
200$ km s$^{-1}$ at the positions of the near-IR bullets by re-analyzing the
existing $^{12}$CO $J=1-0$ interferometry data. These findings indicate that
the near-IR micro-structures represent the positions of shocked surfaces at
which fast-moving molecular clumps interface with the ambient circumstellar
shell.
