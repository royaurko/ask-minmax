Star formation occurs on physical scales corresponding to individual star
forming regions, typically of order ~100 parsecs in size, but current
observational facilities cannot resolve these scales within field galaxies
beyond the local universe. However, the magnification from strong gravitational
lensing allows us to measure the properties of these discrete star forming
regions within galaxies in the distant universe. New results from
multi-wavelength spectroscopic studies of a sample of extremely bright, highly
magnified lensed galaxies are revealing the complexity of star formation on
sub-galaxy scales during the era of peak star formation in the universe. We
find a wide range of properties in the rest-frame UV spectra of individual
galaxies, as well as in spectra that originate from different star forming
regions within the same galaxy. Large variations in the strengths and velocity
structure of Lyman-alpha and strong P Cygni lines such as C IV, and MgII
provide new insights into the astrophysical relationships between extremely
massive stars, the elemental abundances and physical properties of the nebular
gas those stars ionize, and the galactic-scale outflows they power.
