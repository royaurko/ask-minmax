We report on the search for Lorentz violating sidereal variations of the
frequency difference of co-located spin-species while the Earth and hence the
laboratory reference frame rotates with respect to a relic background field.
The co-magnetometer used is based on the detection of freely precessing nuclear
spins from polarized 3He and 129Xe gas samples using SQUIDs as low-noise
magnetic flux detectors. As result we can determine the limit for the
equatorial component of the background field interacting with the spin of the
bound neutron to be bn < 3.7 x 10^{-32} GeV (95 C.L.).
