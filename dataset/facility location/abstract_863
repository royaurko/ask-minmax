The results of experimental and theoretical study of anomalous attenuation of
probe extraordinary waves in experiments on modification of ionosphere by
powerful HF waves on "Sura" heating facility are presented. The experimental
data indicate significant attenuation of extraordinary waves which can be
explained as a result of multiple scattering of extraordinary waves on
small-scale random irregularities. The possibility of diagnostics of spectrum
of artificial irregularities from measurements of anomalous attenuation of
extraordinary waves is demonstrated.
