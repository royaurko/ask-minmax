We present a new flare star, which was discovered during our survey on a
selected field at the edge of the Pleiades cluster. The field was observed in
the period 2007 - 2010 with three different CCD-cameras at the University
Observatory Jena with telescopes from 25 to 90 cm. The flare duration is almost
one hour with an amplitude in the R-band of about 1.08 mag. The location of the
flare star in a color-magnitude diagram is consistent with age and distance of
the Pleiades. In the optical PSF of the flare star there are two 2MASS objects
(unresolved in most images in the optical Jena PSF), so it is not yet known
which one of them is responsible for this flare. The BVRIJHK colors yield
spectral types of M1 and M2 with extinction being A_V=0.231+/-0.024 mag and
A_V=0.266+/-0.020 for those two stars, consistent with the Pleiades cluster.
