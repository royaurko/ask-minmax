The bar of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is one of the prominent, but
controversial feature regarding its location with respect to the disk of the
LMC. In order to study the relative location of the bar with respect to the
disk, we present the high resolution map of the structure across the LMC. We
used the reddening corrected mean magnitudes ($I_0$) of red clump (RC) stars
from the OGLE III catalogue to map the relative variation in distance (vertical
structure) or variation in RC population across the LMC. The bar does not
appear as an identifiable vertical feature in the map, as there is no
difference in $I_0$ values between the bar and the disk regions. We conclude
that the LMC bar is very much part of the disk, located in the plane of the
disk (within 0.02 mag) and it is not a separate component. We identify warps or
variation in RC population with increase in radial distance. %The structure map
also suggests a %warp or a different RC population in the eastern part of the
LMC disk.
