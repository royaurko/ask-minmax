We report on time-resolved photometry of the superoutburst of an SU UMa-type
dwarf nova, SDSS J013701.06-091234.9 in 2003 December-2004 January. The
obtained light curves definitely show superhumps with a period of 0.056686 (12)
d, which is one of the shortest superhump periods among those of SU UMa-type
dwarf novae ever observed. Considering quiescent photometric studies, we
estimated the fractional superhump excess to be 0.024. Spectroscopic
observations by Szkody et al. (2003) provided evidence for TiO bands despite
the short orbital period, implying that the system has a luminous secondary
star. We draw a color-color diagram of SU UMa-type dwarf novae in quiescence
using 2MASS archives, revealing that the location of this star in the
color-color diagram is deviated from the general trend. The distance to the
system was roughly estimated to be 300${\pm}$80 pc, using the empirical
period-absolute magnitude relation and based on the proper motion.
