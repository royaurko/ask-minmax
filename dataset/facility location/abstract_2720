This study was performed within the framework of the EURISOL for facilities
SPIRAL-II (GANIL, France) and SPES (LNL, Italy), and aims to investigate the
anticipated strength properties of fine-grained graphite at elevated
temperatures. It appears that the major parameters that affect to the lifetime
of a graphite target of this IP are the temperature and heating time. High
temperature tests were conducted to simulate the heating under the influence of
a beam of heavy particles by passing through the sample pulse or AC to study
the laws of the destruction of a graphite target. Tests carried out in this
work have shown the ability to forecast the stability and durability of
graphite materials that traditionally used in nuclear engineering at high
temperature conditions.
