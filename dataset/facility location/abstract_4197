The Hall conductivity of an electron gas on the surface of constant negative
curvature (the Lobachevsky plane) in the presence of an orthogonal magnetic
field is investigated. It is shown that the effect of the surface curvature is
to change the break locations and the plateau widths in the Hall conductivity.
An increase of temperature results in smearing of the steps.
