Lattice QCD models predict the presence of a critical point in the QCD phase
diagram where the first order phase transition between the hadron gas and
Quark-Gluon Plasma ceases to exist. Higher moments of conserved quantities,
such as net-charge, net-baryon number and net-strangeness, are proposed to be
sensitive probes for locating the critical point. The moments of net-charge
distributions have been studied as a function of centrality for {Au+Au}
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 7.7 to 200 GeV using three event
generators, {\it viz.}, UrQMD, HIJING, and THERMINATOR-2. The effect of
centrality selection, resonance production, as well as contributions from
particle species to the net-charge moments and their products have been
studied. It is observed that mean of the net-charge distributions are dominated
by net-protons, whereas standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis closely
follow net-pion distributions. These results, along with the predictions from
Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model, are presented.
