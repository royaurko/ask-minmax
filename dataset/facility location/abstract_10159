Neutrino oscillations have been observed in solar and atmospheric neutrinos,
and in the LSND accelerator experiment. The Standard Model cannot accommodate
all three positive results. The solar and atmospheric results have been
confirmed. An oscillation signal seen by MiniBooNE will validate the
oscillation signal seen by LSND. The question then becomes one of refining the
Standard Model to allow for these three results. Four theories which can
accommodate all three oscillation observations are the existence of sterile
neutrinos, CP violation, the existence of variable mass neutrinos, and small
Lorentz violations. The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), located at Oak Ridge
Laboratories, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, will provide an ideal site to test these
hypotheses. The SNS, due to turn on in 2008, will supply a high intensity
neutrino source of known flux and energy spectrum. This source permits
experiments to probe the high delta-m^2 region for measurements, where a
positive signal from MiniBooNE would lie.
