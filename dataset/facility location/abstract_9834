We analyze models of spin glasses on the two-dimensional square lattice by
exploiting symmetry arguments. The replicated partition functions of the Ising
and related spin glasses are shown to have many remarkable symmetry properties
as functions of the edge Boltzmann factors. It is shown that the applications
of homogeneous and Hadamard inverses to the edge Boltzmann matrix indicate
reduced complexities when the elements of the matrix satisfy certain
conditions, suggesting that the system has special simplicities under such
conditions. Using these duality and symmetry arguments we present a conjecture
on the exact location of the multicritical point in the phase diagram.
