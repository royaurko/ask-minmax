We present multi-wavelength (interferometer and single-dish CO J=1-0, Halpha,
broadband optical and near-infrared) observations of the classic barred spiral
NGC 5383. We compare the observed central gas and dust morphology to the
predictions of recent hydrodynamic simulations. In the nuclear region, our
observations reveal three peaks lying along a S-shaped gas and dust
distribution. In contrast, the model predicts a circumnuclear ring, not the
observed S-shaped distribution; moreover, the predicted surface density
contrast between the central gas accumulation and the bar dust lanes is an
order of magnitude larger than observed. The discrepancies are not due to
unexplored model parameter space or a nuclear bar but are probably due to the
vigorous (7 solar masses per year) star formation activity in the center.
  As is common in similar bars, the star formation rate in the bar between the
bar ends and the central region is low (~0.5 solar masses per yr), despite the
high gas column density in the bar dust lanes; this is generally attributed to
shear and shocks. We note a tendency for the HII regions to be associated with
the spurs feeding the main bar dust lanes, but these are located on the leading
side of the bar. We propose that stars form in the spurs, which provide a high
column density but low shear environment. HII regions can therefore be found
even on the leading side of the bar because the ionizing stars pass
ballistically through the dust lane
