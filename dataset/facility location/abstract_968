Measurements of transition form factors for the electro-excitation of nucleon
resonances in the Q^2=5-14 GeV^2 region can provide one with the information on
quark wave functions at small transverse separations. In particular a
comparison of form factors for the states of opposite parity can give insight
in the mechanisms of chiral symmetry breaking. I discuss perspectives of the
theoretical description of such reactions using a combination of lattice
calculations and light-cone sum rules
