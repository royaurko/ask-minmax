The field of the globular cluster NGC 6362 was monitored between 1995 and
2009 in a search for variable stars. BV light curves were obtained for 69
periodic variables including 34 known RR Lyr stars, 10 known objects of other
types and 25 newly detected variables. Among the latter we identified 18
proper-motion members of the cluster: seven detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs),
six SX Phe stars, two W UMa binaries, two spotted red giants, and a very
interesting eclipsing binary composed of two red giants - the first example of
such a system found in a globular cluster. Five of the DEBs are located at the
turnoff region, and the remaining two are redward of the lower main sequence.
Eighty-four objects from the central 9x9 arcmin^2 of the cluster were found in
the region of cluster blue stragglers. Of these 70 are proper motion (PM)
members of NGC 6362 (including all SX Phe and two W UMa stars), and five are
field stars. The remaining nine objects lacking PM information are located at
the very core of the cluster, and as such they are likely genuine blue
stragglers.
