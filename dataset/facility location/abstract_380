We survey the present landscape in submillimetre astronomy for Canada and
describe a plan for continued engagement in observational facilities to ~2020.
Building on Canada's decadal Long Range Plan process, we emphasize that
continued involvement in a large, single-dish facility is crucial given
Canada's substantial investment in ALMA and numerous PI-led submillimetre
experiments. In particular, we recommend: i) an extension of Canadian
participation in the JCMT until at least the unique JCMT Legacy Survey program
is able to realize the full scientific potential provided by the world-leading
SCUBA-2 instrument; and ii) involvement of the entire Canadian community in
CCAT, with a large enough share in the partnership for Canadian astronomers to
participate at all levels of the facility. We further recommend continued
participation in ALMA development, involvement in many focused PI-led
submillimetre experiments, and partnership in SPICA.
