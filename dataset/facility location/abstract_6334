This is a translation from the Latin original, "De valoribus integralium a
termino variabilis x=0 usque ad x=infinity extensorum" (1781). This is E675 in
the Enestrom index. Euler wants to find the location of the end point of a
clothoid, a type of spiral. He proves some general results about the gamma
function.
