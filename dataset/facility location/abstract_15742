We construct a model of inflation in string theory after carefully taking
into account moduli stabilization. The setting is a warped compactification of
Type IIB string theory in the presence of D3 and anti-D3-branes. The inflaton
is the position of a D3-brane in the internal space. By suitably adjusting
fluxes and the location of symmetrically placed anti-D3-branes, we show that at
a point of enhanced symmetry, the inflaton potential V can have a broad
maximum, satisfying the condition V''/V << 1 in Planck units. On starting close
to the top of this potential the slow-roll conditions can be met. Observational
constraints impose significant restrictions. As a first pass we show that these
can be satisfied and determine the important scales in the compactification to
within an order of magnitude. One robust feature is that the scale of inflation
is low, H = O(10^{10}) GeV. Removing the observational constraints makes it
much easier to construct a slow-roll inflationary model. Generalizations and
consequences including the possibility of eternal inflation are also discussed.
A more careful study, including explicit constructions of the model in string
theory, is left for the future.
