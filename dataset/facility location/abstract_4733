We report analysis of VRIJH photometry, and phase-resolved optical
spectroscopy of the eclipsing DA white dwarf plus dMe dwarf binary QS Vir.
Modeling of the photometric data yields an inclination of $i = 74.9\pm0.6$ and
a mass ratio of $q = M_2/M_1 = 0.50\pm0.05$. Our Doppler maps indicate the
presence of material in the Roche lobe of the white dwarf, at a location near
the M star, likely due to accretion from the stellar wind of the M star (as
opposed to Roche-lobe overflow accretion). We also constructed images of the
brightness distribution of the M star at different epochs which reveal the
location of two stable active regions. Doppler tomography shows that the
majority of the Hydrogen and Ca II H&K emission originates on the active M
dwarf, likely distributed in two preferred activity longitudes, similar to
active regions on BY Dra and FK Comae systems.
