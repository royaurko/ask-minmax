The Very Forward Proton Spectrometer (VFPS) of the H1 experiment at HERA is
collecting data since 2005. The fiber detectors in the Roman pots located at
218 and 222m downstream from the H1 interaction point, tag and measure
diffractively scattered protons with a high acceptance in the $\xpom$ range
[0.01, 0.025]. The experimental set up and the spectrometer tagging performance
using diffractive events collected during 2006 and 2007 are discussed.
