Recently, the HESS array has reported the detection of gamma-ray emission
above a few hundred GeV from eight new sources located close to the Galactic
Plane. The source HESS J1834-087 is spatially coincident with SNR G23.3-0.3
(W41). Here we present MAGIC observations of this source, resulting in the
detection of a differential gamma-ray flux consistent with a power law,
described as dN/(dA dt dE) = (3.7 +/- 0.6)*10^(-12) (E/TeV)^(-2.5 +/- 0.2) \
cm^(-2)s^(-1)TeV^(-1). We confirm the extended character of this flux. We
briefly discuss the observational technique used, the procedure implemented for
the data analysis, and put this detection in the perspective of the molecular
environment found in the region of W41. We present 13CO and 12CO emission maps
showing the existence of a massive molecular cloud in spatial superposition
with the MAGIC detection.
