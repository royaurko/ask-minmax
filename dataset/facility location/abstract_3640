We discuss the expected properties of pair echo emission from gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) at high redshifts ($z \gtrsim 5$), their detectability, and the
consequent implications for probing intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMFs) at
early epochs. Pair echos comprise inverse Compton emission by secondary
electron-positron pairs produced via interactions between primary gamma-rays
from the GRB and low-energy photons of the diffuse intergalactic radiation,
arriving with a time delay that depends on the nature of the intervening IGMFs.
At sufficiently high $z$, the IGMFs are unlikely to have been significantly
contaminated by astrophysical outflows, and the relevant intergalactic
radiation may be dominated by the well-understood cosmic microwave background
(CMB). Pair echoes from luminous GRBs at $z \sim 5-10$ may be detectable by
future facilities such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array or the Advanced
Gamma-ray Imaging System, as long as the GRB primary emission extends to
multi-TeV energies, the comoving IGMFs at these redshifts are $B \sim
10^{-16}-10^{-15}~{\rm Gauss}$, and the non-CMB component of the diffuse
intergalactic radiation is relatively low. Observations of pair echos from
high-$z$ GRBs can provide a unique, in-situ probe of weak IGMFs during the
epochs of early structure formation and cosmic reionization.
