Based on the developed cross-correlation theory for remote location of
neutrino source with two-detector setup for neutrino detection the modification
of arrangement of the OPERA experiment is suggested. Within the framework of
computing experiment based on the OPERA experimental data we show that the use
of this theory makes it possible not only to determine with high accuracy the
delay time between neutrino signals but to eliminate the errors of blind
analysis by which all necessary time corrections for determination of signal
"technologically unremovable" delay time between CERN and GSL are performed.
