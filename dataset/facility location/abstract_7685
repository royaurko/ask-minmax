We present, visualize and analyse the similarities and differences between
the controversial topics related to "edit wars" identified in 10 different
language versions of Wikipedia. After a brief review of the related work we
describe the methods developed to locate, measure, and categorize the
controversial topics in the different languages. Visualizations of the degree
of overlap between the top 100 lists of most controversial articles in
different languages and the content related to geographical locations will be
presented. We discuss what the presented analysis and visualizations can tell
us about the multicultural aspects of Wikipedia and practices of
peer-production. Our results indicate that Wikipedia is more than just an
encyclopaedia; it is also a window into convergent and divergent social-spatial
priorities, interests and preferences.
