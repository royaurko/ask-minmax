By using gauge transformations, we manage to obtain new solutions of
(2+1)-dimensional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili(KP), Kaup-Kuperschmidt(KK) and
Sawada-Kotera(SK) equations from non-zero seeds. For each of the preceding
equations, a Galilean type transformation between these solutions $u_2$ and the
previously known solutions $u_2^{\prime}$ generated from zero seed is given. We
present several explicit formulas of the single-soliton solutions for $u_2$ and
$u_2^{\prime}$, and further point out the two main differences of them under
the same value of parameters, i.e., height and location of peak line, which are
demonstrated visibly in three figures.
