We present the preliminary results of the first alignment to milliarsecond
accuracy of the 6 GHz maser emission in OH and methanol maser lines toward
W3(OH). The identifications of Zeeman pairs allowed us to infer the actual
velocity of the OH material and the magnetic field strength at the location
where 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission arises.
