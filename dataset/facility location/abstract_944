Taking into account the exchange forces between protons of scalar,
pseudoscalar, vector and axial vector type the cross sections of neutral and
charged scalar mesons $a_0(980)$, $a_+(980)$, $f_0(980)$, $\sigma(600)$
production are calculated. The estimation for the facilities of moderately high
energies such as PANDA and NICA are presented. Similar analysis is given for
processes of charged and neutral Higgs boson production at high energy
proton-proton colliders such as Tevatron, RHIC and LHC. The possible signal of
neutral Higgs boson decay into two oppositely charged leptons of different
kinds is discussed. Numerical estimations for parameters of modern colliders
are given.
