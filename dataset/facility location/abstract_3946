HERD is the High Energy cosmic-Radiation Detection instrument proposed to
operate onboard China's space station in the 2020s. It is designed to detect
energetic cosmic ray nuclei, leptons and photons with a high energy resolution
($\sim1\%$ for electrons and photons and $20\%$ for nuclei) and a large
geometry factor ($>3\, m^2sr$ for electrons and diffuse photons and $>2\,
m^2sr$ for nuclei). In this work we discuss the capability of HERD to detect
monochromatic $\gamma$-ray lines, based on simulations of the detector
performance. It is shown that HERD will be one of the most sensitive
instruments for monochromatic $\gamma$-ray searches at energies between
$\sim10$ to a few hundred GeV. Above hundreds of GeV, Cherenkov telescopes will
be more sensitive due to their large effective area. As a specific example, we
show that a good portion of the parameter space of a supersymmetric dark matter
model can be probed with HERD.
