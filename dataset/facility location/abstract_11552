In this paper we study the orthogonality conditions satisfied by the
classical q-orthogonal polynomials that are located at the top of the q-Hahn
tableau (big q-jacobi polynomials (bqJ)) and the Nikiforov-Uvarov tableau
(Askey-Wilson polynomials (AW)) for almost any complex value of the parameters
and for all non-negative integers degrees. We state the degenerate version of
Favard's theorem, which is one of the keys of the paper, that allow us to
extend the orthogonality properties valid up to some integer degree N to
Sobolev type orthogonality properties. We also present, following an analogous
process that applied in [16], tables with the factorization and the discrete
Sobolev-type orthogonality property for those families which satisfy a finite
orthogonality property, i.e. it consists in sum of finite number of masspoints,
such as q-Racah (qR), q-Hahn (qH), dual q-Hahn (dqH), and q-Krawtchouk
polynomials (qK), among others.
