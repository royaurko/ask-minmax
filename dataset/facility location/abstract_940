After presenting the recent measurements of neutral current cross section in
DIS at HERA, we explain the effect of the $\gamma-Z_0$ interference at the
electro-weak scale, visible on these data. Then, the beam charge difference
$x{F}_3$ is measured and the interference itself is extracted. Results are
discussed in the context of perturbative QCD.
