We describe an ongoing optical spectrophotometric monitoring program of a
sample of Fermi/LAT bright sources showing prominent and variable {\gamma}-ray
emission, with the 2.1m telescope at Observatorio Astrof\'isico Guillermo Haro
(OAGH) located in Cananea, Sonora, M\'exico. Our sample contains 11 flat
spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) and 1 Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxy. Our
spectroscopic campaign will allow us to study the spectroscopic properties
(FWHM, EW, flux) of broad-emission lines in the optical (e.g. H{\beta}) and
mid-UV (e.g. Mg II {\lambda}2800) regimes, depending on the redshift of the
source. The cadence of the broad emission lines monitoring is about five nights
per month which in turn will permit us to explore whether there is a correlated
variability between broad emission line features and high levels of
{\gamma}-ray emission.
