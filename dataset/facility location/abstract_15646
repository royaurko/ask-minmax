Electronic structure and band characteristics for zinc monochalcogenides with
zinc-blende- and wurtzite-type structures are studied by first-principles
density-functional-theory calculations with different approximations. It is
shown that the local-density approximation underestimates the band gap and
energy splitting between the states at the top of the valence band, misplaces
the energy levels of the Zn-3d states, and overestimates the
crystal-field-splitting energy. Regardless of the structure type considered,
the spin-orbit-coupling energy is found to be overestimated for ZnO and
underestimated for ZnS with wurtzite-type structure, and more or less correct
for ZnSe and ZnTe with zinc-blende-type structure. The order of the states at
the top of the valence band is found to be anomalous for ZnO in both
zinc-blende- and wurtzite-type structure, but is normal for the other zinc
monochalcogenides considered. It is shown that the Zn-3d electrons and their
interference with the O-2p electrons are responsible for the anomalous order.
The typical errors in the calculated band gaps and related parameters for ZnO
originate from strong Coulomb correlations, which are found to be highly
significant for this compound. The LDA+U approach is by and large found to
correct the strong correlation of the Zn-3d electrons, and thus to improve the
agreement with the experimentally established location of the Zn-3d levels
compared with that derived from pure LDA calculations.
