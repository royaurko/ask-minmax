PSR J1907+0602 is a radio-faint, 107-ms GeV gamma-ray pulsar that was
discovered with the Fermi LAT in a blind pulsar search. PSR J1907+0602 is
located near the bright, extended TeV gamma-ray source MGRO J1908+06 which may
be an associated pulsar wind nebula. We present an analysis of XMM-Newton X-ray
data and EVLA radio data of the pulsar. We detect a faint X-ray source
coincident with the gamma-ray pulsar and investigate its spectral and timing
properties. We also find marginal evidence for a bow shock in the X-ray images.
The pulsar was not detected with the EVLA, and we derive upper limits on the
time-averaged radio flux in multiple frequency bands.
