In March 2007 the assembly of the Silicon Strip Tracker was completed at the
Tracker Integration Facility at CERN. Nearly 15% of the detector was
instrumented using cables, fiber optics, power supplies, and electronics
intended for the operation at the LHC. A local chiller was used to circulate
the coolant for low temperature operation. In order to understand the
efficiency and alignment of the strip tracker modules, a cosmic ray trigger was
implemented. From March through July 4.5 million triggers were recorded. This
period, referred to as the Sector Test, provided practical experience with the
operation of the Tracker, especially safety, data acquisition, power, and
cooling systems. This paper describes the performance of the strip system
during the Sector Test, which consisted of five distinct periods defined by the
coolant temperature. Significant emphasis is placed on comparisons between the
data and results from Monte Carlo studies.
