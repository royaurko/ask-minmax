We report the detection during the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) of
two soft, constant, and faint X-ray sources associated with the Herbig-Haro
object HH210. HH210 is located at the tip of the NNE finger of the emission
line system bursting out of the BN-KL complex, northwest of the Trapezium
cluster in the OMC-1 molecular cloud. Using a recent Halpha image obtained with
the ACS imager on board HST, and taking into account the known proper motions
of HH210 emission knots, we show that the position of the brightest X-ray
source, COUP703, coincides with the emission knot 154-040a of HH210, which is
the emission knot of HH210 having the highest tangential velocity (425 km/s).
The second X-ray source, COUP704, is located on the complicated emission tail
of HH210 close to an emission line filament and has no obvious optical/infrared
counterpart. Spectral fitting indicates for both sources a plasma temperature
of ~0.8 MK and absorption-corrected X-ray luminosities of about 1E30 erg/s
(0.5-2.0 keV). These X-ray sources are well explained by a model invoking a
fast-moving, radiative bow shock in a neutral medium with a density of ~12000
cm^{-3}. The X-ray detection of COUP704 therefore reveals, in the complicated
HH210 region, an energetic shock not yet identified at other wavelengths.
