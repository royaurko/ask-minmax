Topological alignments and snakes are used in image processing, particularly
in locating object boundaries. Both of them have their own advantages and
limitations. To improve the overall image boundary detection system, we focused
on developing a novel algorithm for image processing. The algorithm we propose
to develop will based on the active contour method in conjunction with
topological alignments method to enhance the image detection approach. The
algorithm presents novel technique to incorporate the advantages of both
Topological Alignments and snakes. Where the initial segmentation by
Topological Alignments is firstly transformed into the input of the snake model
and begins its evolvement to the interested object boundary. The results show
that the algorithm can deal with low contrast images and shape cells,
demonstrate the segmentation accuracy under weak image boundaries, which
responsible for lacking accuracy in image detecting techniques. We have
achieved better segmentation and boundary detecting for the image, also the
ability of the system to improve the low contrast and deal with over and under
segmentation.
