We have calculated the high temperature series for the momentum distribution
function n_k of the 2D t-J model to 12th order in inverse temperature. By
extrapolating the series to T=0.2J we searched for a Fermi surface of the 2D
t-J model. We find that three criteria used for estimating the location of a
Fermi surface violate Luttinger's Theorem, implying the 2D t-J model does not
have an adiabatic connection to a non-interacting model.
