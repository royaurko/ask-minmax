H ii regions in galaxies are the sites of star formation and thus particular
places to understand the build-up of stellar mass in the universe. The line
ratios of this ionized gas are frequently used to characterize the ionization
conditions. We use the Hii regions catalogue from the CALIFA survey (~5000 H ii
regions), to explore their distribution across the classical [OIII]/Hbeta vs.
[NII]/Halpha diagnostic diagram, and how it depends on the oxygen abundance,
ionization parameter, electron density, and dust attenuation. We compared the
line ratios with predictions from photoionization models. Finally, we explore
the dependences on the properties of the host galaxies, the location within
those galaxies and the properties of the underlying stellar population. We
found that the location within the BPT diagrams is not totally predicted by
photoionization models. Indeed, it depends on the properties of the host
galaxies, their galactocentric distances and the properties of the underlying
stellar population. These results indicate that although H ii regions are short
lived events, they are affected by the total underlying stellar population. One
may say that H ii regions keep a memory of the stellar evolution and chemical
enrichment that have left an imprint on the both the ionizing stellar
population and the ionized gas
