Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a non-invasive imaging technique that
allows estimation of the location of white matter tracts in-vivo, based on the
measurement of water diffusion properties. For each voxel, a second-order
tensor can be calculated by using diffusion-weighted sequences (DWI) that are
sensitive to the random motion of water molecules. Given at least 6
diffusion-weighted images with different gradients and one unweighted image,
the coefficients of the symmetric diffusion tensor matrix can be calculated.
Deriving the eigensystem of the tensor, the eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be
calculated to describe the three main directions of diffusion and its
magnitude. Using DTI data, fiber bundles can be determined, to gain information
about eloquent brain structures. Especially in neurosurgery, information about
location and dimension of eloquent structures like the corticospinal tract or
the visual pathways is of major interest. Therefore, the fiber bundle boundary
has to be determined. In this paper, a novel ray-based approach for boundary
estimation of tubular structures is presented.
