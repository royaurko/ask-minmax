We consider the model of priced (a.k.a. weighted) timed automata, an
extension of timed automata with cost information on both locations and
transitions, and we study various model-checking problems for that model based
on extensions of classical temporal logics with cost constraints on modalities.
We prove that, under the assumption that the model has only one clock,
model-checking this class of models against the logic WCTL, CTL with
cost-constrained modalities, is PSPACE-complete (while it has been shown
undecidable as soon as the model has three clocks). We also prove that
model-checking WMTL, LTL with cost-constrained modalities, is decidable only if
there is a single clock in the model and a single stopwatch cost variable
(i.e., whose slopes lie in {0,1}).
