Many phenomena seen in solar atmosphere are connected with underphotospheric
processes. MHD oscillation and other dynamical processes observed in quit sun
objects are, for example, these phenomena. In our research we use Stereo Behind
EUV(171\AA and 304\AA ) observations to study dynamical processes in quiet Sun
regions. We found an eruption event in a coronal bright point on the border of
a small coronal hole close to the center of the Solar disk. Several oscillating
loops became visible inside of the hole after the eruption. We suppose that
these loops oscillation were induced by the eruption process in coronal bright
point. The nature of interaction transfer agent is unclear because any
propagating disturbance was not detected. For data processing we used Pixelize
wavelet filtration (PWF method) and Time-distance plots. We measured the
supposed interaction transfer speed and found it about 2-3 km/s. We tried to
find out the nature of the interaction transfer agent.
