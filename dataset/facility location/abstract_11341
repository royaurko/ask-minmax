We report observations during 2008 October of the first recorded
superoutburst of a previously unknown SU UMa-type dwarf nova in Draco located
at 19h 14m 43.52s +60d 52m 14.1s (J2000). Simbad lists a 21st magnitude star at
this position with identifiers GSC2.3 N152008120 and USNO-B1.0 1508-0249096.
The outburst reached magnitude 14.9, its amplitude was approximately 6
magnitudes and its duration at least 11 days. About 11 days after the end of
the main outburst there was a short-lived rebrightening by more than 2
magnitudes. Superhumps were observed with a mean period of 0.07117(1) d and
amplitude 0.12 mag. There was a distinct shortening in the superhump period
around cycle 80 with Psh = 0.07137(2) d before and Psh = 0.07091(2) d after. We
saw weak evidence of an increasing Psh before cycle 80 with dPsh/dt = 3.4(2.0)
