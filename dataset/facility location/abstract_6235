Ground-state properties of deformed proton-rich odd-Z nuclei in the region
$59 \leq Z \leq 69$ are described in the framework of Relativistic Hartree
Bogoliubov (RHB) theory. One-proton separation energies and ground-state
quadrupole deformations that result from fully self-consistent microscopic
calculations are compared with available experimental data. The model predicts
the location of the proton drip-line, the properties of proton emitters beyond
the drip-line, and provides information about the deformed single-particle
orbitals occupied by the odd valence proton.
