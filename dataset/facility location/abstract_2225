The coming decade will see the routine use of solar data of unprecedented
spatial and spectral resolution, time cadence, and completeness. To capitalize
on the new (or soon to be available) facilities such as SDO, ATST and FASR, and
the challenges they present in the visualization and synthesis of
multi-wavelength datasets, we propose that realistic, sophisticated, 3D active
region and flare modeling is timely and critical, and will be a forefront of
coronal studies over the coming decade. To make such modeling a reality, a
broad, concerted effort is needed to capture the wealth of information
resulting from the data, develop a synergistic modeling effort, and generate
the necessary visualization, interpretation and model-data comparison tools to
accurately extract the key physics.
