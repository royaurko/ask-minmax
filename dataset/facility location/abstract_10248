After a summary of the basic three neutrino oscillation formalism we review
briefly our present empirical knowledge of the oscillation parameters and
conclude that the 2-neutrinos model is adequate to describe the survival
probability of the electronic neutrino P(nue->nue). Then we proceed to the
evaluation of P(nue->nue) relative to the antineutrinos emitted by the nuclear
power stations presently in operation along the the Rhone valley. We assume
that a detector has been installed in a existing cavity located under the Mont
Ventoux at a depth equivalent to 1500 m of water. We show that such an
experiment would provide the opportunity to observe neutrinos near the
oscillation absolute minimum. We end by a rough estimate of the counting rate.
