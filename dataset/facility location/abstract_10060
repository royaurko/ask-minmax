In this paper, two-dimensional percolation lattices are applied to describe
wireless propagation environment, and stochastic rays are employed to model the
trajectories of radio waves. We first derive the probability that a stochastic
ray undergoes certain number of collisions at a specific spatial location.
Three classes of stochastic rays with different constraint conditions are
considered: stochastic rays of random walks, and generic stochastic rays with
two different anomalous levels. Subsequently, we obtain the closed-form
formulation of mean received power of radio waves under non line-of-sight
conditions for each class of stochastic ray. Specifically, the determination of
model parameters and the effects of lattice structures on the path loss are
investigated. The theoretical results are validated by comparison with
experimental data.
