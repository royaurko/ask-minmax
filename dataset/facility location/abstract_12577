Bloch oscillations are a powerful tool to investigate spectra with Dirac
points. By varying band parameters, Dirac points can be manipulated and merged
at a topological transition towards a gapped phase. Under a constant force, a
Fermi sea initially in the lower band performs Bloch oscillations and may Zener
tunnel to the upper band mostly at the location of the Dirac points. The
tunneling probability is computed from the low energy universal Hamiltonian
describing the vicinity of the merging. The agreement with a recent experiment
on cold atoms in an optical lattice is very good.
