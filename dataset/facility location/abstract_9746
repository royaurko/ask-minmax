We consider the Nordic electricity spot market from mid 1992 to the end of
year 2000. This market is found to be well approximated by an anti-persistent
self-affine (mean-reverting) walk. It is characterized by a Hurst exponent of
$H\simeq 0.41$ over three orders of magnitude in time ranging from days to
years. We argue that in order to see such a good scaling behavior, and to
locate cross-overs, it is crucial that an analyzing technique is used that {\em
decouples} scales. This is in our case achieved by utilizing a (multi-scale)
wavelet approach. The shortcomings of methods that do not decouple scales are
illustrated by applying, to the same dat a set, the classic $R/S$- and Fourier
techniques, for which scaling regimes and/or positions of cross-overs are hard
to define.
