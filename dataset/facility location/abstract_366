In order to fulfill the test requirement of KSTAR (Korea Superconducting
Tokamak Advanced Research) superconducting magnet system, a large scale
superconducting magnet and conductor test facility, SSTF (Samsung
Superconductor Test Facility), has been constructed at Samsung Advanced
Institute of Technology. The computer system for SSTF DAC (Data Acquisition and
Control) is based on UNIX system and VxWorks is used for the real-time OS of
the VME system. EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System) is
used for the communication between IOC server and client. A database program
has been developed for the efficient management of measured data and a Linux
workstation with PENTIUM-4 CPU is used for the database server. In this paper,
the current status of SSTF DAC system, the database management system and
recent test results are presented.
