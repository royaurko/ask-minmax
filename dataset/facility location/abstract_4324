We determine the asymptotic behaviour of (bilateral) obstacle problems for
fractional energies in rather general aperiodic settings via Gamma-convergence
arguments. As further developments we consider obstacles with random sizes and
shapes located on points of standard lattices, and the case of random
homothetics obstacles centered on random Delone sets of points.
  Obstacle problems for non-local energies occur in several physical
phenomenona, for which our results provide a description of the first order
asympotitc behaviour.
