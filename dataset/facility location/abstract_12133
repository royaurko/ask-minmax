The low energy effective action of string theory depends strongly on the
process of compactification and the localization of fields in extra dimensions.
Explicit string constructions towards the minimal supersymmetric standard model
(MSSM) reveal interesting results leading to the concept of local grand
unification. Properties of the MSSM indicate that we might live at a special
location close to an orbifold fixed point rather than a generic point in
Calabi-Yau moduli space. We observe an enhancement of (discrete) symmetries
that have various implications for the properties of the MSSM such as proton
stability as well as solutions to the flavor problem, the \mu-problem and the
strong CP-problem.
