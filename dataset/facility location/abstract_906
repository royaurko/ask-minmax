We explore an alternative strategy to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy
by making use of possible future neutrino facilities at Fermilab. Here, we use
CPT-conjugate neutrino channels, exploiting a nu_mu beam from the NuMI beamline
and a barnu_e beam from a betabeam experimental setup. Both experiments are
performed at approximately the same E/L. We present different possible
accelerator scenarios for the betabeam neutrino setup and fluxes. This
CPT-conjugate neutrino channel scenario can extract the neutrino mass hierarchy
down to sin^2 (2 theta_13) \approx 0.02.
