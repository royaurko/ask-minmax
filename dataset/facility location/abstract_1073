We present first measurements of forward jet production from p(pol)+p
collisons at \sqrt{s}=500 GeV, including transverse single spin asymmetries.
These asymmetries are expected to be sensitive to spin-correlated transverse
momentum in the initial state, which is particularly interesting because it is
related to orbital angular momentum in the proton.
