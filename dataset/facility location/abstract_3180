CCD photometry of the gravitational lens system 0957+561A,B in the g and r
bands was obtained on alternate nights, weather permitting, from December 1994
through May 1995 using the Double Imaging Spectrograph (DIS) on the Apache
Point Observatory (APO) 3.5-meter telescope. The remote observing and fast
instrument change capabilities of this facility allowed accumulation of light
curves sampled frequently and consistently. The Honeycutt ensemble photometry
algorithm was applied to the data set and yielded typical relative photometric
errors of approximately 0.01 magnitudes. Image A exhibited a sharp drop of
about 0.1 magnitudes in late December 1994; no other strong features were
recorded in either image. This event displays none of the expected generic
features of a microlensing-induced flux variation and is likely to be intrinsic
to the quasar; if so, it should also be seen in the B image with the lensing
differential time delay. We give the expected 1996 image B light curves based
on two values of the time delay and brightness ratio which have been proposed
and debated in the literature. Continued monitoring of the system in the first
half of 1996 should easily detect the image B event and thus resolve the
time-delay controversy.
