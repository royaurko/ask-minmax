The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) between spins is induced by
spin-orbit coupling in magnetic materials lacking inversion symmetry. DMI is
recognized to play a crucial role at the interface between ferromagnetic (FM)
and heavy nonmagnetic (NM) metals to create topological textures called
magnetic skyrmions which are very attractive for ultra-dense information
storage and spintronic devices. DMI also plays an essential role for fast
domain wall (DW) dynamics driven by spin-orbit torques. Here, we present first
principles calculations which clarify the main features and microscopic
mechanisms of DMI in Co/Pt bilayers. DMI is found to be predominantly located
at the interfacial Co layer, originating from spin-orbit energy provided by the
adjacent NM layer. Furthermore, no direct correlation is found between DMI and
proximity induced magnetism in Pt. These results clarify underlying mechanisms
of DMI at FM/NM bilayers and should help optimizing material combinations for
skyrmion- and DW-based storage and memory devices.
