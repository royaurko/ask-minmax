With galaxy groups constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we
analyze the expected galaxy-galaxy lensing signals around satellite galaxies
residing in different host haloes and located at different halo-centric
distances. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to explore the
potential constraints on the mass and density profile of subhaloes associated
with satellite galaxies from SDSS-like surveys and surveys similar to the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). Our results show that for SDSS-like surveys,
we can only set a loose constraint on the mean mass of subhaloes. With
LSST-like surveys, however, both the mean mass and the density profile of
subhaloes can be well constrained.
