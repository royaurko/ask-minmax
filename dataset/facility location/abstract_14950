We present a simple model that accurately describes various statistical
properties of peculiar velocities of dark matter halos. We pay particular
attention to the following two effects; first, the evolution of the halo
peculiar velocity depends on the local matter density, instead of the global
density. Second, dark matter halos are biased tracers of the underlying mass
distribution, thus halos tend to be located preferentially at high density
regions. For the former, we develop an empirical model calibrated with N-body
simulations, while for the latter, we use a conventional halo bias models based
on the extended Press-Schechter model combined with an empirical log-normal
probability distribution function of the mass density distribution. We find
that compared with linear theory, the present model significantly improves the
accuracy of predictions of statistical properties of the halo peculiar velocity
field including the velocity dispersion, the probability distribution function,
and the pairwise velocity dispersion at large separations. Thus our model
predictions may be useful in analyzing future observations of the peculiar
velocities of galaxy clusters.
