We report on the RR Lyrae variable star, MACHO 176.18833.411, located toward
the Galactic bulge and observed within the data from the ongoing Bulge RR Lyrae
Radial Velocity Assay (BRAVA-RR), which has the unusual radial velocity of -372
+- 8 km/s and true space velocity of -482 +- 22 km/s relative to the Galactic
rest frame. Located less than 1 kpc from the Galactic center and toward a field
at (l,b)=(3,-2.5), this pulsating star has properties suggesting it belongs to
the bulge RR Lyrae star population yet a velocity indicating it is abnormal, at
least with respect to bulge giants and red clump stars. We show that this star
is most likely a halo interloper and therefore suggest that halo contamination
is not insignificant when studying metal-poor stars found within the bulge
area, even for stars within 1 kpc of the Galactic center. We discuss the
possibility that MACHO 176.18833.411 is on the extreme edge of the bulge RR
Lyrae radial velocity distribution, and also consider a more exotic scenario in
which it is a runaway star moving through the Galaxy.
