We present a sample of 93 double-mode Cepheids detected in the 2.4 square
degree area in the central part of the SMC. 23 stars from the sample pulsate in
the fundamental mode and the first overtone while 70 objects are the first and
second overtone pulsators. This is the largest sample of such type Cepheids
detected in one environment so far.
  We analyze period ratio of double-mode Cepheids and Fourier parameters of
decomposition of the light curves of these objects. We also present location of
different type Cepheids from the SMC in the color-magnitude diagram and show
their distribution of V-I color indices. We find one object which is probably a
blend, either physical or optical, of two Cepheids pulsating in the fundamental
mode.
