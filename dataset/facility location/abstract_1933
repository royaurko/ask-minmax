In the world of upper limb prostheses, few companies dominate the majority of
the market. They propose different kinds of hand, wrist and elbow prostheses
but their control is often difficult to understand by the patients. We have
decided to develop new myoelectric prosthetic arm (elbow, wrist and hand) by
axing our development on the use of new technologies and facility of use for
the patient. In this paper, we are explaining in details the different kinds of
prostheses currently proposed to the amputees, their advantages and their
drawbacks, the descriptions of the patients' needs and the possible
improvements of the product. We will develop the designing choices of our
prosthesis and the movements it can realize. Then we will explain the
simplified control of the product by the patient and its first reactions.
Finally, we will conclude by the news ideas and the next researches to
concretize.
