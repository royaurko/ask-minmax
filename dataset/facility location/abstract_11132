The Earth's electric field, recorded by two different and distant monitoring
sites located in Greece, is analyzed in terms of monochromatic signals (T=24h).
The analysis is based on the mapping procedures borrowed from the study of
non-linear dynamic systems and chaos. The specific analysis applied on the
electric field recorded for some weeks before the occurrence of 3 large EQs
which occurred in Greece shows some very interesting results. Long before the
EQ occurrence the phase map generated by the uncorrelated each other signals
recorded by a pair of distant monitoring sites is characterized by pairs of
hyperbolas of random azimuth asymptotes. Some days before the occurrence of the
earthquake the recorded signals are strongly correlated and therefore the phase
map is characterized by ellipses. A couple of days before the EQ occurrence the
electric signals become again uncorrelated due to the fact that their
generating mechanism (large scale piezoelectricity) approaches its final stage
and therefore hyperbolas characterize again the phase map. When this stage is
observed the pending EQ shortly (in terms of days) takes place. Three detailed
examples from large Greek EQs are presented towards the validation of this
mechanism.
