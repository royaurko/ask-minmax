We are considering a two-beam accelerator (TBA) scheme with ion or proton
beam as a driver. By comparison of the proposed scheme and the one with
electron driver, we concluded, that TBA with ion/proton driver beam looks
preferable. Existence of big proton accelerators in a few laboratories gives a
boost for reconsideration of the baseline for post-LHC era. These Labs are
FERMILAB, BNL, CERN and IHEP at Protvino, Moscow region. Protvino could emerge
as one advantageous location and get stimulus for recovering the 600GeV-proton
synchrotron in the existing~20km-long tunnel. This synchrotron was planned as a
booster for 3x3TeV storage ring.
