Integrating geological concepts, such as relative positions and proportions
of the different lithofacies, is of highest importance in order to render
realistic geological patterns. The truncated plurigaussian simulation method
provides a way of using both local and conceptual geological information to
infer the distributions of the facies and then those of hydraulic parameters.
The method (Le Loc'h and Galli 1994) is based on the idea of truncating at
least two underlying multi-Gaussian simulations in order to create maps of
categorical variable. In this manuscript we show how this technique can be used
to assess contaminant migration in highly heterogeneous media. We illustrate
its application on the biggest contaminated site of Switzerland. It consists of
a contaminant plume located in the lower fresh water Molasse on the western
Swiss Plateau. The highly heterogeneous character of this formation calls for
efficient stochastic methods in order to characterize transport processes.
