The evidence that stellar systems surrounding the Milky Way (MW) are
distributed in a Vast Polar Structure (VPOS) may be observationally biased by
satellites detected in surveys of the northern sky. The recent discoveries of
more than a dozen new systems in the southern hemisphere thus constitute a
critical test of the VPOS phenomenon. We report that the new objects are
located close to the original VPOS, with half of the sample having offsets less
than 20 kpc. The positions of the new satellite galaxy candidates are so well
aligned that the orientation of the revised best-fitting VPOS structure is
preserved to within 9 degrees and the VPOS flattening is almost unchanged (31
kpc height). Interestingly, the shortest distance of the VPOS plane from the MW
center is now only 2.5 kpc, indicating that the new discoveries balance out the
VPOS at the Galactic center. The vast majority of the MW satellites are thus
consistent with sharing a similar orbital plane as the Magellanic Clouds,
confirming a hypothesis proposed by Kunkel & Demers and Lynden-Bell almost 40
years ago. We predict the absolute proper motions of the new objects assuming
they orbit within the VPOS. Independent of the VPOS results we also predict the
velocity dispersions of the new systems under three distinct assumptions: that
they (i) are dark-matter-free star clusters obeying Newtonian dynamics, (ii)
are dwarf satellites lying on empirical scaling relations of galaxies in dark
matter halos, and (iii) obey MOND.
