During the passage of hurricane Dennis, two functionally different
instruments made continuous recordings from their location in Macon, Georgia.
These were (i) a non-conventional vertical seismometer, and (ii) a low-level
differential pressure sensor. Data were collected for 72 hours, beginning when
the eye of the storm was located in the vicinity of Key West, Florida. Over the
ensuing three-day period, fluctuations in the outputs from the two instruments
were found to be highly correlated, with the exception of one eight hour
interval.
