We develop a new estimation technique for recovering depth-of-field from
multiple stereo images. Depth-of-field is estimated by determining the shift in
image location resulting from different camera viewpoints. When this shift is
not divisible by pixel width, the multiple stereo images can be combined to
form a super-resolution image. By modeling this super-resolution image as a
realization of a random field, one can view the recovery of depth as a
likelihood estimation problem. We apply these modeling techniques to the
recovery of cloud height from multiple viewing angles provided by the MISR
instrument on the Terra Satellite. Our efforts are focused on a two layer cloud
ensemble where both layers are relatively planar, the bottom layer is optically
thick and textured, and the top layer is optically thin. Our results
demonstrate that with relative ease, we get comparable estimates to the M2
stereo matcher which is the same algorithm used in the current MISR standard
product (details can be found in [IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote
Sensing 40 (2002) 1547--1559]). Moreover, our techniques provide the
possibility of modeling all of the MISR data in a unified way for cloud height
estimation. Research is underway to extend this framework for fast, quality
global estimates of cloud height.
