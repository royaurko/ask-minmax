We consider the equations obeyed by different functions which involve the
first or the second derivatives of the biconfluent Heun function. A notable
feature of these equations is that they have at least one more regular
singularity, as compared with the biconfluent Heun equation. The position of
this extra singularity is defined by the accessory parameter of the biconfluent
Heun equation, and in general it may be located at any point of the extended
complex z-plane. Starting from these equations, we construct two different
expansions of the solutions of the biconfluent Heun equation in terms of
incomplete Beta functions. The first series applies single Beta functions as
expansion functions, while the second one involves a combination of two Beta
functions. The coefficients of expansions obey four- and five-term recurrence
relations, respectively. It is shown that the proposed technique is potent to
produce series solutions in terms of other special functions. Two examples of
such expansions in terms of the incomplete Gamma functions are presented.
