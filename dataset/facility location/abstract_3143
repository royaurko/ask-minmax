Mobile health applications (or mHealth apps, as they are commonly known) are
increasingly popular with both individual end users and user groups such as
physicians. Due to their ability to access, store and transmit personally
identifiable and sensitive information (e.g. geolocation information and
personal details), they are potentially an important source of evidentiary
materials in digital investigations. In this paper, we examine 40 popular
Android mHealth apps. Based on our findings, we propose a taxonomy
incorporating artefacts of forensic interest to facilitate the timely
collection and analysis of evidentiary materials from mobile devices involving
the use of such apps. Artefacts of forensic interest recovered include user
details and email addresses, chronology of user locations and food habits. We
are also able to recover user credentials (e.g. user password and four-digit
app login PIN number), locate user profile pictures and identify timestamp
associated with the location of a user.
