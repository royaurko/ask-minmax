We present a study of the diffuse X-ray emission from superbubbles N 70 (DEM
L301) and N 185 (DEM L25) located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, based on data
from the XMM-Newton Satellite. We obtained spectra and images of these objects
in the soft X-ray energy band. These X-ray spectra were fitted by a thermal
plasma model, with temperatures of $2.6 \times 10^{6}$ K and $2.3 \times
10^{6}$ K, for N 70 and N 185, respectively. For N 70, images show that X-ray
emission comes from the inner regions of the superbubble, when we compare the
distribution of the X-ray and the optical emission; while for N 185, the X-ray
emission is partially confined by the optical shell. We suggest that the
observed X-ray emission is caused by shock-heated gas, inside of the optical
shells. We also obtained X-ray luminosities which exceed the values predicted
by the standard analytical model. This fact shows that, in addition to the
winds of the interior stars, it is necessary to consider another ingredient in
the description, such as a supernova explosion, as has been proposed in
previous numerical models.
