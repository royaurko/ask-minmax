A conjecture is given for the exact location of the multicritical point in
the phase diagram of the +/- J Ising model on the triangular lattice. The
result p_c=0.8358058 agrees well with a recent numerical estimate. From this
value, it is possible to derive a comparable conjecture for the exact location
of the multicritical point for the hexagonal lattice, p_c=0.9327041, again in
excellent agreement with a numerical study. The method is a variant of duality
transformation to relate the triangular lattice directly with its dual
triangular lattice without recourse to the hexagonal lattice, in conjunction
with the replica method.
