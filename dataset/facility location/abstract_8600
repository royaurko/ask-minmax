Galaxies in the Las Campanas Redshift Survey are classified according to
their spectra, and the resulting spectral types are analyzed to determine if
local environment affects their properties. We find that the luminosity
function of early-type objects varies as a function of local density. Our
results suggest that early-type galaxies (presumably ellipticals and S0's) are,
on average, fainter when they are located in high-density regions of the
Universe. The same effect may operate for some, but not all, late-type
galaxies. We discuss the implications of this result for theories of galaxy
formation and evolution.
