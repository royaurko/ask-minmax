Spatial clustering has important implications in various fields. In
particular, disease clustering is of major public concern in epidemiology. In
this article, we propose the use of two distance-based segregation indices to
test the significance of disease clustering among subjects whose locations are
from a homogeneous or an inhomogeneous population. We derive their asymptotic
distributions and compare them with other distance-based disease clustering
tests in terms of empirical size and power by extensive Monte Carlo
simulations. The null pattern we consider is the random labeling (RL) of cases
and controls to the given locations. Along this line, we investigate the
sensitivity of the size of these tests to the underlying background pattern
(e.g., clustered or homogenous) on which the RL is applied, the level of
clustering and number of clusters, or differences in relative abundances of the
classes. We demonstrate that differences in relative abundance has the highest
impact on the empirical sizes of the tests. We also propose various non-RL
patterns as alternatives to the RL pattern and assess the empirical power
performance of the tests under these alternatives. We illustrate the methods on
two real-life examples from epidemiology.
