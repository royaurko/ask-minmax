We present a Hubble Space Telescope/WFPC2 narrow-band H-alpha image of a
region on the northeastern limb of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant. This
location provides a detailed example of where the primary blast wave first
encounters the surrounding interstellar medium. The filament structure is seen
in exquisite detail in this image, which was obtained primarily as an EARLY
ACQuisition image for a follow-up spectroscopic program. We compare the HST
image to a digitized version of the POSS-I red plate to measure the proper
motion of this filament. By combining this value for the proper motion with
previous measurements of the shock velocity at this position we find that the
distance to the Cygnus Loop is 440 (+130, -100) pc, considerably smaller than
the canonical value of 770 pc. We briefly discuss the ramifications of this new
distance estimate for our understanding of this prototypical supernova remnant.
