We reduce the 4D Einstein-Hilbert action to a constant-radius hypersurface of
foliation. The resulting theory is a scalar theory defined on a 3D hypersurface
of the original black hole background, and has an exponential potential. Once
the the hypersurface is located at the Schwarzschild radius, the 3D theory is
effectively reduced to a 2D Liouville type theory. We compute {the entropy
associated with the hypersurface intrinsic degrees of freedom}, and show that
its leading order reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. The subleading
terms come in logarithm/inverse powers of the area.
