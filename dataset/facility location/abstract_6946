A nonuniform piezoelectric cantilever with enhanced amplitude of vibration at
resonances is proposed. The cantilever made of lead zirconate titanate (type of
PZT-5H) containing inversely poled piezoelectric domains shows an advantageous
increase in vibration amplitude when compared to a single domain device. The
amplitude of vibrations is enhanced when the domain boundaries are located at
the nodes of vibration displacement. The vibration amplitude of a cantilever
with 2 or 3 periodically inverted domains is mostly affected at the 2nd or 3rd
resonance frequency, respectively. The amplitudes are calculated using the
Finite Element method (FEM).
