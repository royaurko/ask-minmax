Locally refined meshes impose severe stability constraints on explicit
time-stepping methods for the numerical simulation of time dependent wave
phenomena. Local time-stepping methods overcome that bottleneck by using
smaller time-steps precisely where the smallest elements in the mesh are
located. Starting from classical Adams-Bashforth multi-step methods, local
time-stepping methods of arbitrarily high order of accuracy are derived for
damped wave equations. When combined with a finite element discretization in
space with an essentially diagonal mass matrix, the resulting time-marching
schemes are fully explicit and thus inherently parallel. Numerical experiments
with continuous and discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretizations
validate the theory and illustrate the usefulness of these local time-stepping
methods.
