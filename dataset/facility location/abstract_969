The wealth of information in the Gaia catalogue of exoplanets will constitute
a fundamental contribution to several hot topics of the astrophysics of
planetary systems. I briefly review the potential impact of Gaia micro-arsec
astrometry in several areas of exoplanet science, discuss what key follow-up
observations might be required as a complement to Gaia data, and shed some
light on the role of next generation astrometric facilities in the arena of
planetary systems.
