We propose a model universe in the matter dominated phase described by a FRW
background with local inhomogeneities, like our local patch, grown out of the
primordial fluctuations. Our sub-horizon local patch consisting of different
structures is approximated as an inhomogeneous cosmic fluid described by a LTB
metric embedded in a background FRW universe, in which the observer could be
located anywhere. Within the exact general relativistic formulation, the
junction conditions for the only possible matching without a thin shell at the
boundary, neglected so far in the literature, constrains the model in such a
way that the luminosity distance-red shift relation mimics a FRW universe with
dark energy. Therefore, the dimming of SNIa is accounted for in such a {\it
structured} FRW universe. We have also calculated the exact general
relativistic backreaction term and shown how it influences the global Hubble
parameter and the effective density of the cosmic fluid By using an exact
formulation of the general relativistic dynamics of structures in a homogeneous
universe, the claim is therefore stressed that the backreaction of cosmological
perturbations leads to an apparent dimming of the cosmological distances.
