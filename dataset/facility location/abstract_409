Location-Based Service (LBS) becomes increasingly popular with the dramatic
growth of smartphones and social network services (SNS), and its context-rich
functionalities attract considerable users. Many LBS providers use users'
location information to offer them convenience and useful functions. However,
the LBS could greatly breach personal privacy because location itself contains
much information. Hence, preserving location privacy while achieving utility
from it is still an challenging question now. This paper tackles this
non-trivial challenge by designing a suite of novel fine-grained
Privacy-preserving Location Query Protocol (PLQP). Our protocol allows
different levels of location query on encrypted location information for
different users, and it is efficient enough to be applied in mobile platforms.
