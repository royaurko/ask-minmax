We consider the impact of the recent KamLAND data on neutrino oscillations,
the first terrestrial neutrino experiment that can probe the solar neutrino
anomaly. By combining the first 145.1 days of KamLAND data with the full sample
of latest solar neutrino data we find an enhanced rejection against non-LMA
oscillations, allowed only at more than 4 sigma with respect to LMA.
Furthermore, the new data have a strong impact in narrowing down the allowed
range of Delta_m^2 inside the LMA region. In contrast, our global analysis
indicates that the new data have little impact on the location of the best fit
point. In particular the solar neutrino mixing remains significantly
non-maximal (3 sigma).
