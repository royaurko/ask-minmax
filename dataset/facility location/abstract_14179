We derive the distribution function of work performed by a harmonic force
acting on a uniformly dragged Brownian particle subjected to a rotational
torque. Following the Onsager and Machlup's functional integral approach, we
obtain the transition probability of finding the Brownian particle at a
particular position at time $t$ given that it started the journey from a
specific location at an earlier time. The difference between the forward and
the time-reversed form of the generalized Onsager-Machlup's Lagrangian is
identified as the rate of medium entropy production which further helps us
develop the stochastic thermodynamics formalism for our model. The probability
distribution for the work done by the harmonic trap is evaluated for an
equilibrium initial condition. Although this distribution has a Gaussian form,
it is found that the distribution does not satisfy the conventional work
fluctuation theorem.
