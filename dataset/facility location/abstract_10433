Let k be a number field and X a smooth projective k-variety. In this paper,
we study the information obtainable from descent via torsors under finite
k-group schemes on the location of the k-rational points on X within the adelic
points.
  Our main result is that if a curve C/k maps nontrivially into an abelian
variety A/k such that A(k) is finite and Sha(k,A) has no nontrivial divisible
elements, then the information coming from finite abelian descent cuts out
precisely the rational points of C. We conjecture that this is the case for all
curves of genus at least 2.
  We relate finite descent obstructions to the Brauer-Manin obstruction; in
particular, we prove that on curves, the Brauer set equals the set cut out by
finite abelian descent. Our conjecture therefore implies that the Brauer-Manin
obstruction against rational points in the only one on curves.
