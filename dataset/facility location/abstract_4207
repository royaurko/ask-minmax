Location dependence of physical parameters such as the electromagnetic fine
structure constant and Newton's G produce body accelerations which violate
universality of free fall rates testable with laboratory and space experiments.
Theoretically related cosmological time variation of these same parameters are
also constrained by experiments such as lunar laser ranging, and these time
variations produce accelerations of bodies relative to a preferred cosmological
frame.
