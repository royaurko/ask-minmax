We have identified a small globular cluster in M31 located approximately 4
arcseconds northwest of the M31 globular cluster G185. While several multiple
globular clusters have been observed in the Magellanic Clouds none have been
found in the Galaxy or in M31. We estimate the probability of such a chance
line-of-sight alignment occuring near the nucleus of M31 to be 0.09 +/- 0.03
and find no obvious indication of any tidal deformation in either cluster, as
would be expected if the clusters were interacting.
  Two-dimensional modelling suggests G185 has a King (1966) [AJ, 71, 64]
concentration of c = 1.11 +/- 0.08 while the companion has c = 0.67 +/- 0.17
and is physically smaller than G185. Both objects have integrated dereddened
colors similar to those of Galactic globular clusters.
