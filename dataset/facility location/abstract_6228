The fragment yields from the multifragmentation of gold, lanthanum and
krypton nuclei obtained by the EOS Collaboration are examined in terms of
Fisher's droplet formalism modifed to account for Coulomb energy. The critical
exponents sigma and tau and the surface energy coefficient c0 are obtained.
Estimates are made of the pressure-temperature and temperature-density
coexistence curves of finite neutral nuclear matter as well as the location of
the critical point.
