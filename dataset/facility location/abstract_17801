We consider whether Broad Absorption Line Quasars (BAL QSOs) and Narrow Line
Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) are similar, as suggested by Brandt & Gallagher
(2000) and Boroson (2002). For this purpose we constructed a sample of 11 BAL
QSOs from existing Chandra and Swift observations. We found that BAL QSOs and
NLS1s both operate at high Eddington ratios L/Ledd, although BAL QSOs have
slightly lower L/Ledd. BAL QSOs and NLS1s in general have high FeII/H$\beta$
and low [OIII]/H$\beta$ ratios following the classic 'Boroson \& Green'
eigenvector 1 relation. We also found that the mass accretion rates $\dot{M}$
of BAL QSOs and NLS1s are more similar than previously thought, although some
BAL QSOs exhibit extreme mass accretion rates of more than 10 \msun/year. These
extreme mass accretion rates may suggest that the black holes in BAL QSOs are
relativistically spinning. Black hole masses in BAL QSOs are a factor of 100
larger than NLS1s. From their location on a M-$\sigma$ plot, we find that BAL
QSOs contain fully developed black holes. Applying a principal component
analysis to our sample we find eigenvector 1 to correspond to the Eddington
ratio L/Ledd, and eigenvector 2 to black hole mass.
