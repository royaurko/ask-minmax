Spline Galerkin approximation methods for the Sherman-Lauricella integral
equation on simple closed piecewise smooth contours are studied, and necessary
and sufficient conditions for their stability are obtained. It is shown that
the method under consideration is stable if and only if certain operators
associated with the corner points of the contour are invertible. Numerical
experiments demonstrate a good convergence of the spline Galerkin methods and
validate theoretical results. Moreover, it is shown that if all corners of the
contour have opening angles located in interval $(0.1\pi, 1.9\pi)$, then the
corresponding Galerkin method based on splines of order $0$, $1$ and $2$ is
always stable. These results are in strong contrast with the behaviour of the
Nystr\"om method, which has a number of instability angles in the interval
mentioned.
