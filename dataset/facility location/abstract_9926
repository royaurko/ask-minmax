We studied the pure and dilute Baxter-Wu (BW) models using the Wang-Landau
(WL) sampling method to calculate the Density-Of-States (DOS). We first used
the exact result for the DOS of the Ising model to test our code. Then we
calculated the DOS of the dilute Ising model to obtain a phase diagram, in good
agreement with previous studies. We calculated the energy distribution,
together with its first, second and fourth moments, to give the specific heat
and the energy fourth order cumulant, better known as the Binder parameter, for
the pure BW model. For small samples, the energy distribution displayed a
doubly peaked shape. Finite size scaling analysis showed as expected reciprocal
scaling of the positions of the peaks with L. The energy distribution yielded
the expected $\alpha=2/3$ critical exponent for the specific heat. The Binder
parameter minimum appeared to scale with lattice size L with an exponent
$\theta_B$ equal to the specific heat exponent. Its location (temperature)
showed a large correction-to-scaling term $\theta_1=0.248\pm 0.025$. For the
dilute BW model we found a clear crossover to a single peak in the energy
distribution even for small sizes and the expected $\alpha=0$ was recoverd.
