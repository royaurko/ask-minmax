We develop an analytic approach to calculation of the temperature and
polarisation power spectra of the cosmic microwave background due to
inflationary gravitational waves. This approach complements the more precise
numerical results by providing insight into the physical origins of the
features in the power spectra. We explore the use of analytic approximations
for the gravitational-wave evolution, making use of the WKB approach to handle
the radiation-matter transition. In the process, we describe scaling relations
for the temperature and polarisation power spectra. We illustrate the
dependence of the amplitude, shape, and peak locations on the details of
recombination, the gravitational-wave power spectrum, and the cosmological
parameters, and explain the origin of the peak locations in the temperature and
polarisation power spectra. The decline in power on small scales in the
polarisation power spectra is discussed in terms of phase-damping. In an
appendix we detail numerical techniques for integrating the gravitational-wave
evolution in the presence of anisotropic stress from free-streaming neutrinos.
