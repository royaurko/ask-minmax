Taylor's law is the footprint of ecosystems, which admits a power function
relationship $S^{2}=am^{b}$ between the variance $S^{2}$ and mean number $m$ of
organisms in an area. We examine the distribution of spatial coordinate data of
seven urban facilities (beauty salons, banks, stadiums, schools, pharmacy,
convenient stores and restaurants) in 37 major cities in China, and find that
Taylor's law is validated among all 7 considered facilities, in the fashion
that either all cities are combined together or each city is considered
separately. Moreover, we find that the exponent $b$ falls between 1 and 2,
which reveals that the distribution of urban facilities resembles that of the
organisms in ecosystems. Furthermore, through decomposing the inverse of
exponent $b$, we examine two different factors affecting\emph{ }the numbers of
facilities in an area of a city respectively, which are the city-specific
factor and the facility-specific factor. The city-specific factor reflects the
overall density of all the facilities in a city, while the facility-specific
factor indicates the overall aggregation level of each type of facility in all
the cities. For example, Beijing ranks the first in the overall density, while
restaurant tops the overall aggregation level.
