An existence and stability result for a class of purely radiative vacuum
spacetimes arising from hyperboloidal data is given. This result generalises
semiglobal existence results for Minkowski-like spacetimes to the case where
the reference solution contains gravitational radiation. The analysis makes use
of the extended conformal field equations and a gauge based on conformal
geodesics so that the location and structure of the conformal boundary of the
perturbed solutions is known a priori.
