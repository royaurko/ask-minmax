The present work generalizes a nonlocal version of the Polyakov loop-extended
Nambu and Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model to the case of three active quark flavors,
with inclusion of the axial U(1) anomaly. Gluon dynamics is incorporated
through a gluonic background field, expressed in terms of the Polyakov loop.
The thermodynamics of the nonlocal PNJL model accounts for both chiral and
deconfinement transitions. Our results obtained in mean-field approximation are
compared to lattice QCD results for $N_\text{f}=2+1$ quark flavors. Additional
pionic and kaonic contributions to the pressure are calculated in random phase
approximation. Finally, this nonlocal 3-flavor PNJL model is applied to the
finite density region of the QCD phase diagram. It is confirmed that the
existence and location of a critical point in this phase diagram depends
sensitively on the strength of the axial U(1) breaking interaction.
