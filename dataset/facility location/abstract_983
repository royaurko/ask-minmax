An overview on the new COMPASS II experimental programme is presented. The
main topics include a study of Primakoff reactions, generalised parton
distributions via deeply virtual Compton scattering and transverse momentum
dependent distributions in Drell-Yan processes in the pion scattering off
polarised protons. Moreover, the studies of semi-inclusive deep inelastic
scattering on unpolarised target will be continued.
