Lepton number violation (LNV) can be induced by Majorana neutrinos in
four-body decays of the neutral B meson and the top quark. We study the effects
of Majorana neutrinos in these |\Delta L|=2 decays in an scenario where a
single heavy neutrino can enhance the amplitude via the resonant mechanism.
Using current bounds on heavy neutrino mixings, the most optimistic branching
ratios turn out to be at the level of 10^{-6} for \bar{B} -> D^+e^-e^-\pi^+ and
t -> bl^+l^+W^- decays. Searches for these LNV decays at future facilities can
provide complementary constraints on masses and mixings of Majorana neutrinos.
