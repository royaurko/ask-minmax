This paper studies the information-theoretic secrecy performance in
large-scale cellular networks based on a stochastic geometry framework. The
locations of both base stations and mobile users are modeled as independent
two-dimensional Poisson point processes. We consider two important features of
cellular networks, namely, information exchange between base stations and cell
association, to characterize their impact on the achievable secrecy rate of an
arbitrary downlink transmission with a certain portion of the mobile users
acting as potential eavesdroppers. In particular, tractable results are
presented under diverse assumptions on the availability of eavesdroppers'
location information at the serving base station, which captures the benefit
from the exchange of the location information between base stations.
