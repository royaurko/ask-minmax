Asymptotic efficiency (high output without droop) was recently reported for
OLEDS in which a thin emitter layer is located at the anti-node in a resonant
microcavity. Here we extend our theoretical analysis to treat multi-mode
devices with isotropic emitter orientation. We recover our efficiency equations
for the limiting cases with an isotropic emitter layer located at the anti-node
where output is linear in current, and for an isotropic emitter located at the
node where output can exhibit second order losses with an overall efficiency
coefficient that depends on loss terms in competition with a cavity factor.
Additional scenarios are described where output is driven by spontaneous
emission, or mixed spontaneous and stimulated emission, with stimulated
emission present in a loss mode, potentially resulting in cavity driven droop
or output clamping, and where the emitter layer is a host-guest system.
