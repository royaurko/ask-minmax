A fascinating aspect of Rydberg atoms is their ability to form huge but very
weakly bound molecules with a ground state atom, only held together by a
scattering process between the latter and the Rydberg electron. Beyond the
usual way of creating such molecules by laser excitation from two ground state
atoms with a distance of less than the Rydberg radius, we demonstrate that
Rydberg molecules can also be formed by capturing a ground state atom which is
initially located outside the range of the Rydberg atom when it comes in
contact with it. To demonstrate this effect, we investigate the scattering
process between the Rydberg electron and the ground state atom within a
quantum-classical framework. In this picture capturing results from a
dissipative finite-mass correction term in the classical equations of motion.
We show that and under which conditions the capturing takes place.
