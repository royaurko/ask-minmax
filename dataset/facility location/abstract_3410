CEBAF is a high-luminocity factory of virtual photons with variable
virtuality $Q^{2}$ and transverse size. This makes CEBAF, in particular after
the energy upgrade to (8-12)GeV, an ideal facility for uncovering new
phenomena, and opening new windows, at the interface of the perturbative and
nonperturbative QCD. We discuss color transparency as the case for a broad
program on electroproduction of vector mesons
$\rho^{0},\,\omega^{0},\,\phi^{0}$ and their radial excitations
$\rho',\,\omega',\,\phi'$ at CEBAF. We also comment on the second generation of
experiments on color transparency in $^{4}He(e,e'p)$ scattering, which are also
feasible at CEBAF. In 1994, we can make more reliable projections into future
because our understanding of the onset of color transparency has greatly been
augmented by two experiments completed in 1993:\\ i) no effect of CT was seen
in the SLAC NE18 experiment on $A(e,e'p)$ scattering at virtualities of the
exchanged photon $Q^{2} \lsim 7$ GeV$^{2}$, \\ ii) strong signal of CT was
observed in the FNAL E665 experiment on exclusive $\rho^{0}$- meson production
in deep inelastic scattering in the same range of $Q^{2}$. \\ We discuss the
impact of these observations on the CEBAF experimental program. We argue they
both are good news, both were anticipated theoretically, and both rule in the
correct QCD mechanism of the onset of CT.
