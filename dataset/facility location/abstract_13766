The 2d Boussinesq equations model large scale atmospheric and oceanic flows.
Whether its solutions develop a singularity in finite-time remains a classical
open problem in mathematical fluid dynamics. In this work, blowup from smooth
nontrivial initial velocities in stagnation-point form solutions of this system
is established. On an infinite strip
$\Omega=\{(x,y)\in[0,1]\times\mathbb{R}^+\}$, we consider velocities of the
form $u=(f(t,x),-yf_x(t,x))$, with scalar temperature\, $\theta=y\rho(t,x)$.
Assuming $f_x(0,x)$ attains its global maximum only at points $x_i^*$ located
on the boundary of $[0,1]$, general criteria for finite-time blowup of the
vorticity $-yf_{xx}(t,x_i^*)$ and the time integral of $f_x(t,x_i^*)$ are
presented. Briefly, for blowup to occur it is sufficient that $\rho(0,x)\geq0$
and $f(t,x_i^*)=\rho(0,x_i^*)=0$, while $-yf_{xx}(0,x_i^*)\neq0$. To illustrate
how vorticity may suppress blowup, we also construct a family of global exact
solutions. A local-existence result and additional regularity criteria in terms
of the time integral of $\left\|f_x(t,\cdot)\right\|_{L^\infty([0,1])}$ are
also provided.
