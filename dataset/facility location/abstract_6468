We construct exact solutions to five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory
based on Atiyah-Hitchin space. The solutions cannot be written explicitly in a
closed form, so their properties are investigated numerically. The
five-dimensional metric is regular everywhere except on the location of
original bolt in four-dimensional Atiyah-Hitchin base space. On each time-fixed
slices, the metric, asymptotically approaches an Euclidean Taub-NUT space.
