We have estimated the ages of eight late-type Vega-like stars by using
standard age dating methods for single late-type stars, e.g., location on the
color magnitude diagram, Li 6708 angstrom absorption, CaII H&K emission, X-ray
luminosity, and stellar kinematic population. With the exception of the very
unusual pre-main sequence star system HD 98800, all the late-type Vega-like
stars are the same age as the Hyades cluster (600-800 Myr) or older.
