Astronomical facilities at the high-altitude observatory Terskol in the
Northern Caucasus include optical telescopes with diameters up to 2 m, their
instrumentation (high-resolution spectrometers, high-speed photometers, CCDs,
etc.), as well as provisions for data distribution via satellite and computer
networks. The decades of successful research at Terskol have yielded new data
and findings in the following areas of astronomy: discovery and monitoring of
NEOs, precise astrometry and photometry of solar system bodies, high-resolution
spectroscopy of interstellar clouds, search for optical afterglow of gamma ray
bursts, etc. Facilities of the Terskol Observatory are heavily used for the
operation of the Synchronous Network of distant Telescopes, which includes
optical telescopes at Terskol and at observatories in Bulgaria, Greece, and
Ukraine; the remarkable results were obtained especially from synchronous
observations of galaxies and flare stars.
