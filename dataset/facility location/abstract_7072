We pursue the idea of adding the naive $\mu N$ term, where $\mu$ is the quark
chemical potential and $N$ is the conserved quark number, to the lattice QCD
action. While computations of higher order susceptibilities, required for
estimating the location of the QCD critical point, need a lot fewer number of
quark propagators at any order as a result, it has its problem. We discuss a
solution, and examine if it works.
