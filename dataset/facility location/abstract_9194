Aberration and retardation of the radiation within a pulsar's magnetosphere
enable a single corotating absorbing region in the outer magnetosphere to give
rise to a 'double notch' in the pulsar's observed radio profile. This effect
requires that a pulsar has not only absorbing but also emitting regions at
heights which are a substantial proportion of the light cylinder radius. The
known presence of double notches in the weak secondary emission of three nearby
pulsars suggests that this emission comes from open field lines well above
their poles and that an obscuring region extending over no more than 5 percent
of the light cylinder radius is located at or near the light cylinder.
