A preliminary study of the Energy Production Demonstrator (EPD) concept - a
solid heavy metal target irradiated by GeV-range intense proton beams and
producing more energy than consuming - is carried out. Neutron production,
fission, energy deposition, energy gain, testing volume and helium production
are simulated with the MARS15 code for tungsten, thorium, and natural uranium
targets in the proton energy range 0.5 to 120 GeV. This study shows that the
proton energy range of 2 to 4 GeV is optimal for both a natU EPD and the
tungsten-based testing station that would be the most suitable for proton
accelerator facilities. Conservative estimates, not including breeding and
fission of plutonium, based on the simulations suggest that the proton beam
current of 1 mA will be sufficient to produce 1 GW of thermal output power with
the natU EPD while supplying < 8% of that power to operate the accelerator. The
thermal analysis shows that the concept considered has a problem due to a
possible core meltdown; however, a number of approaches (a beam rastering, in
first place) are suggested to mitigate the issue. The efficiency of the
considered EPD as a Materials Test Station (MTS) is also evaluated in this
study.
