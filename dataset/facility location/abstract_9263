We present new observations of IRAS 04000+5052, a Galactic HII region
associated with a young stellar cluster and possibly located at the Perseus
arm. Contrary to previous claims, we have found that this object is not a
compact metal-poor HII region. The electron density and chemical composition of
the nebula are similar to those of normal HII regions of the Galactic disk. The
radial velocity of the ionized gas coincides with that obtained from CO
observations, indicating that the nebula is associated with a molecular cloud.
Probably, the ionizing source of the HII region is a Herbig Be star of B0.5
spectral type.
