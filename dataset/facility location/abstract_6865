This article aims to consider a new univariate nonparametric cumulative sum
(CUSUM) control chart for small shift of location based on both change-point
model and Mann-Whitney statistic. Some comparisons on the performances of the
proposed chart with other charts as well as the properties of the test
statistic are presented. Simulations indicate that the proposed chart is
sensitive in detection of the small mean shifts of the process by a high
intensive accumulation of sample information when the underlying variable is
completely distribution-free.
