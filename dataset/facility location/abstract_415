Since 1990, the United Nations in cooperation with the European Space Agency
is holding annually a workshop on basic space science for the benefit of the
worldwide development of astronomy. These workshops have been held in countries
of Asia and the Pacific (India, Sri Lanka), Latin America and the Caribbean
(Costa Rica, Colombia, Honduras), Africa (Nigeria), Western Asia (Egypt,
Jordan), and Europe (Germany, France). Additional to the scientific benefits of
the workshops and the strengthening of international cooperation, the workshops
lead to the establishment of astronomical telescope facilities in Colombia,
Egypt, Honduras, Jordan, Morocco, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and
Uruguay. The annual UN/ESA Workshops continue to pursue an agenda to network
these astronomical telescope facilities through similar research and education
programmes. Teaching material and hands-on astrophysics material has been
developed for the operation of such astronomical telescope facilities in an
university environment.
