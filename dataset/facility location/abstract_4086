The first near-side X-class flare of the Solar Cycle 24 occurred in February
2011 and produced a very strong seismic response in the photosphere. One
sunquake was reported by Kosovichev (2011) followed by the discovery of a
second sunquake by Zharkov et al (2011). The flare had a two-ribbon structure
and was associated with a flux rope eruption and a halo coronal mass ejection
(CME) as reported in the CACTus catalogue. Following the discovery of the
second sunquake and the spatial association of both sources with the locations
of the feet of the erupting flux rope (Zharkov et al 2011) we present here a
more detailed analysis of the observed photospheric changes in and around the
seismic sources. These sunquakes are quite unusual, taking place early in the
impulsive stage of the flare, with the seismic sources showing little hard
X-ray (HXR) emission, and strongest X-ray emission sources located in the flare
ribbons. We present a directional time--distance diagram computed for the
second source, which clearly shows a ridge corresponding to the travelling
acoustic wave packet and find that the quake at the second source happened
about 45 seconds to one minute earlier than the first source. Using acoustic
holography we report different frequency responses of the two sources. We find
strong downflows at both seismic locations and a supersonic horizontal motion
at the second site of acoustic wave excitation.
