This paper proposes an optimized sensing based channel access framework for
the LTE cognitive femto-cells, with an objective of maximizing the femto-cells
downlink throughput. Cognitive femto-cells opportunistically transmit on the
macro-cell channels when they are free of use. Those free channels are located
by means of spectrum sensing using energy detection. Moreover, periodic sensing
is adopted to detect any changes of the sensing outcomes. The maximum
attainable femto-cell downlink throughput varies with the macro-cell channel
occupancy statistics. Therefore, the LTE macro-cell occupancy is empirically
modeled using exponential distributions mixture. The LTE cognitive femto-cell
downlink throughput is maximized by compromising the transmission efficiency,
the explored spectrum opportunities and the interference from the macro-cell.
An analytical solution for the optimal periodic sensing interval that maximizes
the throughput is found and verified by simulations. The obtained results show
that there is indeed a single periodic sensing interval value that maximizes
the LTE cognitive femto-cell downlink throughput. At the peak of the macro-cell
traffic, our framework increases the femto-cell throughput by around 15%
compared to the senseless case. The impact of the available number of channels
for opportunistic access is studied and no significant impact is found for more
than three channels.
