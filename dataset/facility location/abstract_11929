The CHARA Array is a six 1-m telescope optical and near infrared
interferometer located at the Mount Wilson Observatory in southern California
and operated by the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy of Georgia
State University. The CHARA Array has been in regular scientific operation
since 2005 and now has over 55 publications in the refereed literature,
including two in Science and one in Nature. The Array now supports seven beam
combiners ranging from 0.5 microns up to 2.3 microns and combing from 2 to 4
beams at a time. An upgrade to a full 6 beam combiner is now underway and
fringes with all six telescopes were achieved soon after the meeting.We present
some of the more recent results from the CHARA-Array.
