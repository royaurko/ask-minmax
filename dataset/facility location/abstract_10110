Sequences of initial-data sets representing binary black holes in
quasi-circular orbits have been used to calculate what may be interpreted as
the innermost stable circular orbit. These sequences have been computed with
two approaches. One method is based on the traditional
conformal-transverse-traceless decomposition and locates quasi-circular orbits
from the turning points in an effective potential. The second method uses a
conformal-thin-sandwich decomposition and determines quasi-circular orbits by
requiring the existence of an approximate helical Killing vector. Although the
parameters defining the innermost stable circular orbit obtained from these two
methods differ significantly, both approaches yield approximately the same
initial data, as the separation of the binary system increases. To help
understanding this agreement between data sets, we consider the case of initial
data representing a single boosted or spinning black hole puncture of the
Bowen-York type and show that the conformal-transverse-traceless and
conformal-thin-sandwich methods yield identical data, both satisfying the
conditions for the existence of an approximate Killing vector.
