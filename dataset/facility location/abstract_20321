We present the analysis of the gravitational microlensing event
OGLE-2013-BLG-0102. The light curve of the event is characterized by a strong
short-term anomaly superposed on a smoothly varying lensing curve with a
moderate magnification $A_{\rm max}\sim 1.5$. It is found that the event was
produced by a binary lens with a mass ratio between the components of $q =
0.13$ and the anomaly was caused by the passage of the source trajectory over a
caustic located away from the barycenter of the binary. From the analysis of
the effects on the light curve due to the finite size of the source and the
parallactic motion of the Earth, the physical parameters of the lens system are
determined. The measured masses of the lens components are $M_{1} = 0.096 \pm
0.013~M_{\odot}$ and $M_{2} = 0.012 \pm 0.002~M_{\odot}$, which correspond to
near the hydrogen-burning and deuterium-burning mass limits, respectively. The
distance to the lens is $3.04 \pm 0.31~{\rm kpc}$ and the projected separation
between the lens components is $0.80 \pm 0.08~{\rm AU}$.
