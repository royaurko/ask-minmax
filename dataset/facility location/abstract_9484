NGC 5846 is a giant elliptical galaxy with a previously well studied globular
cluster system (GCS), known to have a bimodal colour distribution with a
remarkably high red fraction. Here we revisit the central galaxy regions
searching for new globular cluster (GC) candidates, and measuring, magnitudes,
colours and sizes for them. We also search for their X-ray counterparts. We use
archival Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 images, from which we modelled and
subtracted the host light distribution and increased the available sample of
GCs. We performed photometry on the central objects, and measured sizes and
equatorial coordinates for the entire system known in this galaxy. We detect
two dozen previously unknown GC candidates in the central regions. Reliable
sizes are obtained for about 60 GCs; their typical effective radii are in the
range 3-5 pc. The largest clusters are located in the central regions. We find
7 X-ray counterparts to globular clusters, most of them in the central region.
They are among the most luminous X-ray sources in NGC 5846. They are also
optically luminous, compact and belong to the red subpopulation.
