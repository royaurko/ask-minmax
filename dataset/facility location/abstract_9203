We examine the spatial offsets between X-ray point sources and star clusters
in three starburst galaxies. We find that the X-ray sources are preferentially
located near the star clusters. Because the star clusters are very good tracers
of the star formation activity in the galaxies, this indicates that the X-ray
sources are young objects associated with current star formation. We find
significant displacements of the X-ray sources from the clusters. These
displacements are likely due to motion of the X-ray sources and indicates that
they are X-ray binaries. We find that brighter X-ray sources preferentially
occur closer to clusters. The absence of very bright sources at large
displacements from clusters may help constrain models of the sources.
