We present the UV, optical, X-ray, and radio properties of the Type IIb SN
2008ax discovered in NGC 4490. The observations in the UV are one of the
earliest of a Type IIb supernova (SN). On approximately day four after the
explosion, a dramatic upturn in the u and uvw1 (lambda_c = 2600 Angstroms)
light curves occurred after an initial rapid decline which is attributed to
adiabatic cooling after the initial shock breakout. This rapid decline and
upturn is reminiscent of the Type IIb SN 1993J on day six after the explosion.
Optical/near-IR spectra taken around the peak reveal prominent H-alpha, HeI,
and CaII absorption lines. A fading X-ray source is also located at the
position of SN 2008ax, implying an interaction of the SN shock with the
surrounding circumstellar material and a mass-loss rate of the progenitor of
M_dot = (9+/-3)x10^-6 solar masses per year. The unusual time evolution (14
days) of the 6 cm peak radio luminosity provides further evidence that the
mass-loss rate is low. Combining the UV, optical, X-ray, and radio data with
models of helium exploding stars implies the progenitor of SN 2008ax was an
unmixed star in an interacting-binary. Modeling of the SN light curve suggests
a kinetic energy (E_k) of 0.5x10^51 ergs, an ejecta mass (M_ej) of 2.9 solar
masses, and a nickel mass (M_Ni) of 0.06 solar masses.
