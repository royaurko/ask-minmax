Studying animal movement and distribution is of critical importance to
addressing environmental challenges including invasive species, infectious
diseases, climate and land-use change. Motion sensitive camera traps offer a
visual sensor to record the presence of a broad range of species providing
location -specific information on movement and behavior. Modern digital camera
traps that record video present new analytical opportunities, but also new data
management challenges. This paper describes our experience with a terrestrial
animal monitoring system at Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Our camera network
captured the spatio-temporal dynamics of terrestrial bird and mammal activity
at the site - data relevant to immediate science questions, and long-term
conservation issues. We believe that the experience gained and lessons learned
during our year long deployment and testing of the camera traps as well as the
developed solutions are applicable to broader sensor network applications and
are valuable for the advancement of the sensor network research. We suggest
that the continued development of these hardware, software, and analytical
tools, in concert, offer an exciting sensor-network solution to monitoring of
animal populations which could realistically scale over larger areas and time
spans.
