The Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) will perform an all-sky survey in
hard X-ray band as well as deep imaging of a series of small sky regions. We
expect various compact objects to be detected in these imaging observations.
Point source detection performance of HXMT imaging observation depends not only
on the instrument but also on its data analysis since images are reconstructed
from HXMT observed data with numeric methods. Denoising technique plays an
import part in HXMT imaging data analysis pipeline alongside with demodulation
and source detection. In this paper we have implemented several methods for
denoising HXMT data and evaluated the point source detection performances in
terms of sensitivities and location accuracies. The results show that direct
demodulation with 1-fold cross correlation should be the default reconstruction
and regularization methods, although both sensitivity and location accuracy
could be further imporved by selecting and tuning numerical methods in data
analysis of HXMT imaging observations.
