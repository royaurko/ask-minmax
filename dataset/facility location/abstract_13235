Although WiFi fingerprint-based indoor localization is attractive, its
accuracy remains a primary challenge especially in mobile environments.
Existing approaches either appeal to physical layer information or rely on
extra wireless signals for high accuracy. In this paper, we revisit the RSS
fingerprint-based localization scheme and reveal crucial observations that act
as the root causes of localization errors, yet are surprisingly overlooked or
even unseen in previous works. Specifically, we recognize APs' diverse
discrimination for fingerprinting a specific location, observe the RSS
inconsistency caused by signal fluctuations and human body blockages, and
uncover the RSS outdated problem on commodity smartphones. Inspired by these
insights, we devise a discrimination factor to quantify different APs'
discrimination, incorporate robust regression to tolerate outlier measurements,
and reassemble different fingerprints to cope with outdated RSSs. Combining
these techniques in a unified solution, we propose DorFin, a novel scheme of
fingerprint generation, representation, and matching, which yields remarkable
accuracy without incurring extra cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DorFin achieves mean error of 2 meters and more importantly, bounds the 95th
percentile error under 5.5 meters; these are about 56% and 69% lower,
respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art schemes such as Horus and
RADAR.
