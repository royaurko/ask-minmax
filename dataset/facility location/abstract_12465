We obtained high-resolution near-IR spectra of 45 AGB stars located in the
Galactic bulge. The aim of the project is to determine key elemental abundances
in these stars to help constrain the formation history of the bulge. A further
aim is to link the photospheric abundances to the dust species found in the
winds of the stars. Here we present a progress report of the analysis of the
spectra.
