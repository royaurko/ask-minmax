We study the tapering optimization scheme for a short period, less than two
cm, superconducting undulator, and show that it can generate 4 keV X-ray pulses
with peak power in excess of 1 terawatt, using LCLS electron beam parameters.
We study the e?ect of undulator module length relative to the FEL gain length
for continous and step-wise taper pro?les. For the optimal section length of
1.5m we study the evolution of the FEL process for two di?erent superconducting
technologies NbTi and Nb3Sn. We discuss the major factors limiting the maximum
output power, particle detrapping around the saturation location and time
dependent detrapping due to generation and ampli?cation of sideband modes.
