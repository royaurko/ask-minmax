Since the first discovery of an extrasolar planetary system more than a
decade ago, hundreds more have been discovered. Surprisingly, many of these
systems harbor Jupiter-class gas giants located close to the central star, at
distances of 0.1 AU or less. Observations of chromospheric 'hot spots' that
rotate in phase with the planetary orbit, and elevated stellar X-ray
luminosities,suggest that these close-in planets significantly affect the
structure of the outer atmosphere of the star through interactions between the
stellar magnetic field and the planetary magnetosphere. Here we carry out the
first detailed three-dimensional MagnetoHydroHynamics (MHD) simulation
containing the two magnetic bodies and explore the consequences of such
interactions on the steady-state coronal structure. The simulations reproduce
the observable features of 1) increase in the total X-ray luminosity, 2)
appearance of coronal hot spots, and 3) phase shift of these spots with respect
to the direction of the planet. The proximate cause of these is an increase in
the density of coronal plasma in the direction of the planet, which prevents
the corona from expanding and leaking away this plasma via a stellar wind. The
simulations produce significant low temperature heating. By including dynamical
effects, such as the planetary orbital motion, the simulation should better
reproduce the observed coronal heating.
