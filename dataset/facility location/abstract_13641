In this article we propose a new method for reducing Newtonian noise in
laser-interferometric gravitational-wave detectors located on the Earth's
surface. We show that by excavating meter-scale recesses in the ground around
the main test masses of a gravitational wave detector it is possible to reduce
the coupling of Rayleigh wave driven seismic disturbances to test mass
displacement. A discussion of the optimal recess shape is given and we use
finite element simulations to derive the scaling of the Newtonian noise
suppression with the parameters of the recess as well as the frequency of the
seismic excitation. Considering an interferometer similar to an Advance LIGO
configuration, our simulations indicate a frequency dependent Newtonian noise
suppression factor of 2 to 4 in the relevant frequency range for a recesses of
4m depth and a width and length of 11m and 5m, respectively. Though a retrofit
to existing interferometers seems not impossible, the application of our
concept to future infrastructures seems to provide a better benefit/cost ratio
and therefore a higher feasibility.
