We construct a holographic model for Josephson junctions with a defect system
of a Dp brane intersecting a D(p+2) brane. In addition to providing a
geometrical picture for the holographic dual, this leads us very naturally to
suggest the possibility of non-Abelian Josephson junctions characterized in
terms of the topological properties of the branes. The difference between the
locations of the endpoints of the Dp brane on either side of the defect
translates into the phase difference of the condensate in the Josephson
junction. We also add a magnetic flux on the D(p+2) brane and allow it evolve
adiabatically along a closed curve in the space of the magnetic flux, while
generating a non-trivial Berry holonomy.
