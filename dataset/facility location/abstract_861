Recent experiments at Jefferson Laboratory and potential new facilities at
the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) make it evident that the
discovery of a spin-singlet S-wave di-cascade bound state of two cascade (Xi)
particles is feasible. We state the simple arguments, based on SU(3) flavor
symmetry, for the existence of this bound state, review the previous
predictions and comment on the experimental conditions necessary for detection.
