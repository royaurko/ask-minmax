In the framework of the so-called extended linear sigma model (eLSM), we
include a pseudoscalar glueball with a mass of 2.6 GeV (as predicted by
Lattice-QCD simulations) and we compute the two- and three-body decays into
scalar and pseudoscalar mesons. This study is relevant for the future PANDA
experiment at the FAIR facility. As a second step, we extend the eLSM by
including the charm quark according to the global $U(4)_R \times U(4)_L$ chiral
symmetry. We compute the masses, weak decay constants and strong decay widths
of open charmed mesons. The precise description of the decays of open charmed
states is important for the CBM experiment at FAIR.
