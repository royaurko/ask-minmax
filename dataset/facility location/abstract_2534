Stochastic cooling, as the different cooling mechanism from electron cooling,
is designed and constructed on CSRe (experimental Cooling Storage Ring) in
HIRFL (Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou) at present. The beam extracted
from CSRm (main Cooling Storage Ring) is injected into the CSRe, and then the
secondary beam with large momentum spread and large emittance is produced at
the internal target area. This paper is designed to optimize the lattice of
CSRe in order to satisfy the requirement of stochastic cooling system. Particle
Tracking Method is used and both transverse and longitudinal simulation is made
on the basis of the designed lattice. The results indicate that stochastic
cooling is suitable for beam cooling with larger momentum spread or larger
emittance, and cooling rate is preliminarily confirmed.
