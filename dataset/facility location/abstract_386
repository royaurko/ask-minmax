FAIR a new International Facility for Antiproton and Ion Reaserach, is under
construction at Darmstadt, in Germany. This will provide scientists in the
world with outstanding beams and experimental conditions for studying matter at
the level of atoms, nuclei, and other subnuclear constituents. An antiproton
beam with intensity up to 2x10$^7$ $\bar{p}/s$ and high momentum resolution
will be available at the High Energy Storage Ring (HESR) where the
$\bar{P}$ANDA (Antiproton Annihilation At Darmstadt) detector will be
installed. In this paper we will illustrate the details of the $\bar{P}$ANDA
scientific program related to hadron spectroscopy, after a brief introduction
about the FAIR facility and the $\bar{P}$ANDA detector.
