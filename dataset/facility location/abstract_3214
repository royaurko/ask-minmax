The LMC, SMC, and the Milky Way are a spectacular set of interacting
galaxies. The prominent tidal arms which protrude from the Magellanic Clouds
extend for tens of kiloparsecs and cover a large part of the southern sky.
These arms, and the Magellanic Clouds themselves, are therefore a highly
suitable subject for the detailed investigation of an interacting galaxy
system. We present the first results of the Parkes narrow-band HI survey of the
tidal arms of the Magellanic System. It is the first fully sampled, spatially
complete survey of this system. The data provide information on the column
density distribution and the variation of the shape of the line profiles over
the extent of the tidal features. We present a cloud catalogue of the tidal
features of the Magellanic System and discuss the distribution relative to the
observational parameters longitude, latitude and radial velocity (v_LSR and
v_GSR). We find a new stream-like feature that is most likely related to the
Leading Arm. Detailed investigation reveals a number of clouds showing a
cometary appearance in the position-velocity representation (so-called
head-tail structures). These head-tail structures are interpreted as clouds
that are currently interacting with an ambient medium.
