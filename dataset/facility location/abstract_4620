We study the Ising model on the triangular lattice with nearest-neighbor
couplings $K_{\rm nn}$, next-nearest-neighbor couplings $K_{\rm nnn}>0$, and a
magnetic field $H$. This work is done by means of finite-size scaling of
numerical results of transfer matrix calculations, and Monte Carlo simulations.
We determine the phase diagram and confirm the character of the critical
manifolds. The emphasis of this work is on the antiferromagnetic case $K_{\rm
nn}<0$, but we also explore the ferromagnetic regime $K_{\rm nn}\ge 0$ for H=0.
For $K_{\rm nn}<0$ and H=0 we locate a critical phase presumably covering the
whole range $-\infty < K_{\rm nn}<0$. For $K_{\rm nn}<0$, $H\neq 0$ we locate a
plane of phase transitions containing a line of tricritical three-state Potts
transitions. In the limit $H \to \infty$ this line leads to a tricritical model
of hard hexagons with an attractive next-nearest-neighbor potential.
