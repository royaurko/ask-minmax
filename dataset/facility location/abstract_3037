The spectra of only a few pulsars are known in the low-energy gamma-ray
region around 1 Mev. We searched for point sources of gamma-radiation in the
0.3-1 and 1-8 Mev bandpasses at the location of known radio and X-ray pulsars.
Single channel photometry using the SPI spectrometer on INTEGRAL, obtained
using a coded-aperture mask, is feasible if calibrated using known fluxes from
point sources. The calibration was carried out using the Crab nebula and
verified using the Vela pulsar. The locations of a representative sample of
pulsar types were then observed. Other than the Crab and Vela pulsars, no
sources were detected. Upper limits are given on the time-averaged flux from
the location of 15 other pulsars; most lie below previously published upper
limits. Six of the pulsars for which we determine upper limits at 1 MeV have
been detected above 100 MeV by FERMI. The upper limits we report here help to
describe the spectrum of these pulsars at all wavelengths.
