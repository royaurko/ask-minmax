We analyze five events of the interaction of coronal mass ejections (CMEs)
with the remote coronal rays located up to 90^\circ away from the CME as
observed by the SOHO/LASCO C2 coronagraph. Using sequences of SOHO/LASCO C2
images, we estimate the kink propagation in the coronal rays during their
interaction with the corresponding CMEs ranging from 180 to 920 km/s within the
interval of radial distances form 3 R. to 6 R. . We conclude that all studied
events do not correspond to the expected pattern of shock wave propagation in
the corona. Coronal ray deflection can be interpreted as the influence of the
magnetic field of a moving flux rope related to a CME. The motion of a
large-scale flux rope away from the Sun creates changes in the structure of
surrounding field lines, which are similar to the kink propagation along
coronal rays. The retardation of the potential should be taken into account
since the flux rope moves at high speed comparable with the Alfven speed.
