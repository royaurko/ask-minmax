(Short version) The nature and the location of the lenses discovered in the
microlensing surveys done so far towards the LMC remain unclear. This
contribution is comprised of two distinct parts. In the first part, motivated
by these questions, we compute the optical depth for the different intervening
populations an the number of expected events for self-lensing, using a recently
drawn coherent picture of the geometrical structure and dynamics of the LMC
disk. In the second part (section 5), a preliminary account of the final
results from the EROS-2 programme is presented. Based on the analysis of 33
million LMC and SMC stars followed during 6.7 years, strict limits on the macho
content of the galactic halo are presented; they cover the range of macho
masses between 0.0001 and 100 solar mass. The limits are better than 20% (resp.
5%) of the standard halo for masses between 0.0002 and 10 (resp. 0.001 to 0.1)
solar mass. This is presently the data set with the largest sensitivity to halo
machos.
