We consider the Einstein equation, where the common electromagnetic energy
momentum tensor is replaced by its generalized equivalent as suggested in our
earlier paper (A.L. Kholmetskii et al. Phys. Scr. 83, 055406 (2011)). Now we
show that with this new electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor, the scalar
curvature at the location of charges is significantly altered in comparison
with the common result, and it even may change its sign. Some implications of
the obtained results are discussed.
