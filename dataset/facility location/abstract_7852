We present the results of extinction measurements toward the main ejecta
shell of the Cassiopeia A supernova (SN) remnant using the flux ratios between
the two near-infrared (NIR) [Fe II] lines at 1.26 and 1.64 $\mu {\rm m}$. We
find a clear correlation between the NIR extinction ($E(J-H)$) and the radial
velocity of ejecta knots, showing that redshifted knots are systematically more
obscured than blueshifted ones. This internal "self-extinction" strongly
indicates that a large amount of SN dust resides inside and around the main
ejecta shell. At one location in the southern part of the shell, we measure
$E(J-H)$ by the SN dust of 0.23$\pm$0.05 mag. By analyzing the spectral energy
distribution of thermal dust emission at that location, we show that there are
warm ($\sim$100 K) and cool ($\sim$40 K) SN dust components and that the latter
is responsible for the observed $E(J-H)$. We investigate the possible grain
species and size of each component and find that the warm SN dust needs to be
silicate grains such as MgSiO$_{3}$, Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$, and SiO$_{2}$, whereas
the cool dust could be either small ($\leq$0.01 $\mu {\rm m}$) Fe or large
($\geq$0.1 $\mu {\rm m}$) Si grains. We suggest that the warm and cool dust
components in Cassiopeia A represent grain species produced in diffuse SN
ejecta and in dense ejecta clumps, respectively.
