Searches for gravitational wave signals which do not have a precise model
describing the shape of their waveforms are often performed using power
detectors based on a quadratic form of the data. A new, optimal method of
generalizing these power detectors so that they operate coherently over a
network of interferometers is presented. Such a mode of operation is useful in
obtaining better detection efficiencies, and better estimates of the position
of the source of the gravitational wave signal. Numerical simulations based on
a realistic, computationally efficient hierarchical implementation of the
method are used to characterize its efficiency, for detection and for position
estimation. The method is shown to be more efficient at detecting signals than
an incoherent approach based on coincidences between lists of events. It is
also shown to be capable of locating the position of the source.
