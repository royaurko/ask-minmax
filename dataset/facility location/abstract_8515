Several macrolensed systems exhibit photometric variability consistent with
microlensing due to objects of stellar mass located in the lens. The degree
of microlensing amplification is dependent upon the size of the source,
with smaller sources being more amplified. In general, amplification of
sources larger than an Einstein radius projected onto the source plane is
negligible. For the quasar Q2237+0305, a quadrupole image lens (Huchra et
al., 1985), this radius is 0.05 pc, larger than the predicted size of a
continuum emitting accretion disk, but substantially smaller than the
broad line region (Figure 1). This scale difference implies that the
continuum will be amplified while the broad line emission remains
essentially unchanged during a microlensing event (Sanitt, 1971; Kayser et
al., 1986).
  The broad line emitting region, as a whole, is too large to be microlensed,
but substructure on small scales may be significantly amplified. Although
the total flux in the line is relatively unchanged, microlensing of
substructure can result in changes in the shape of the emission line
profiles, and produce measurable shifts in the central wavelength of the
line (Nemiroff, 1988; Schneider and Wambsganss, 1990).
