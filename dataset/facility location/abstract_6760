It is well known that in fusion reactions one may get only neutron deficient
superheavy nuclei located far from the island of stability. The multi-nucleon
transfer reactions allow one to produce more neutron enriched new heavy nuclei
but the corresponding cross sections are rather low. Neutron capture process is
considered here as alternative method for production of long-lived neutron rich
superheavy nuclei. Strong neutron fluxes might be provided by nuclear reactors
and nuclear explosions in laboratory frame and by supernova explosions in
nature. All these cases are discussed in the paper.
