We report the detection using ASCA data of a hard X-ray source in the
vicinity of the radio pulsar PSR B1853+01 which is located within the supernova
remnant (SNR) W44. PSR B1853+01, a 267ms pulsar, has to date only been detected
in the radio band. Previous observations at soft X-ray energies (e.g., with
ROSAT HRI) have failed to detect any significant X-ray emission (pulsed or
unpulsed) from the pulsar. Over the 0.5--4.0keV band, the ASCA data show soft
thermal emission from W44 with a morphology very similar to that observed
earlier by Einstein and ROSAT. In the high energy band (4.0--9.5 keV), the SNR
is, for the most part, invisible, although a source coincident with the
position of PSR B1853+01 is evident. The observed ASCA spectra, extracted from
a region around the PSR position, are consistent with a power-law origin
(photon index =~2.3) for the X-ray emission from this source at a flux level
(flux density ~~0.5 10^-6 Jy at 1 keV) consistent with previous upper limits.
Timing analysis of the hard X-ray source failed to detect pulsations at the
pulsar's period. We conclude that the new hard source in W44 represents an
X-ray synchrotron nebula associated with PSR B1853+01.
