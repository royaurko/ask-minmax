We have studied 116 bright galaxies from the Coma cluster brighter than
$m_{r}=17$ mag. From a quantitative morphological analysis we find that the
scales of the disks are smaller than those of field spiral galaxies. There is a
correlation between the scale of the disks and the position of the galaxy in
the cluster; no large disks are present near the center of the cluster or in
high density environments. The structural parameters of the bulges are not
affected by the environment. We have analyzed the distribution of blue and red
objects in the cluster. For spirals there is a trend between color and position
in the cluster. The bluest spiral galaxies are located at larger projected
radii; they also show larger velocity dispersions than the red ones. The
differences in the scale of the disks between cluster galaxies and local
samples of isolated galaxies and the color distribution of the objects can be
understood in terms of the harassment scenario.
