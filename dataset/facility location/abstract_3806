As part of a larger search of Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data
for cool brown dwarfs with effective temperatures less than 1000 K, we present
the discovery of three new cool brown dwarfs with spectral types later than T7.
Using low-resolution, near-infrared spectra obtained with the NASA Infrared
Telescope Facility and the Hubble Space Telescope we derive spectral types of
T9.5 for WISE J094305.98+360723.5, T8 for WISE J200050.19+362950.1, and Y0: for
WISE J220905.73+271143.9. The identification of WISE J220905.73+271143.9 as a Y
dwarf brings the total number of spectroscopically confirmed Y dwarfs to
seventeen. In addition, we present an improved spectrum (i.e. higher
signal-to-noise ratio) of the Y0 dwarf WISE J041022.71+150248.4 that confirms
the Cushing et al. classification of Y0. Spectrophotometric distance estimates
place all three new brown dwarfs at distances less than 12 pc, with WISE
J200050.19+362950.1 lying at a distance of only 3.9-8.0 pc. Finally, we note
that brown dwarfs like WISE J200050.19+362950.1 that lie in or near the
Galactic plane offer an exciting opportunity to measure their mass via
astrometric microlensing.
