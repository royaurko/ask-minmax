Cosmology observations indicate that our universe is composed of 25% dark
matter (DM), yet we know little about its microscopic properties. Whereas the
gravitational interaction of DM is well understood, its interaction with the
Standard Model is not. Direct detection experiments, the current standard, have
a nuclear recoil interaction, low-mass sensitivity edge of order 1 GeV. To
detect DM with mass below 1 GeV, either the sensitivity of the experiments
needs to be improved or use of accelerators producing boosted low-mass DM are
needed. Using neutrino detectors to search for low-mass DM is logical due to
the similarity of the DM and $\nu$ signatures in the detector. The MiniBooNE
experiment, located at Fermilab on the Booster Neutrino Beamline, has produced
the world's largest collection of $\nu$ and $\bar{\nu}$ samples and is already
well understood, making it desirable to search for accelerator-produced boosted
low-mass DM. A search for DM produced by 8.9 GeV/c protons hitting a steel
beamdump has finished, collecting $1.86\times10^{20} \mathrm{POT}$. Analysis
techniques along with predicted sensitivity will be presented.
