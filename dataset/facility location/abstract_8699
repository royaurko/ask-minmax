VLA images of the Sickle and Pistol H II regions near the Galactic center at
3.6 and 6 cm reveal six point sources in the region where the dense Quintuplet
stellar cluster is located. The spectral indices of five of these sources
between 6 cm and 3.6 cm have values of alpha = +0.5 to +0.8, consistent with
the interpretation that the radio sources correspond to ionized stellar winds
of the massive stars in this cluster. The radio source associated with the
Pistol Star shows alpha = -0.4 +/- 0.2, consistent with a flat or slightly
non-thermal spectrum.
