We present the first measurements of reaction-in-flight (RIF) neutrons in an
inertial confinement fusion system. The experiments were carried out at the
National Ignition Facility, using both Low Foot and High Foot drives and
cryogenic plastic capsules. In both cases, the high-energy RIF ($E_n>$ 15 MeV)
component of the neutron spectrum was found to be about $10^{-4}$ of the total.
The majority of the RIF neutrons were produced in the dense cold fuel
surrounding the burning hotspot of the capsule and the data are consistent with
a compressed cold fuel that is moderately to strongly coupled $(\Gamma\sim$0.6)
and electron degenerate $(\theta_\mathrm{Fermi}/\theta_e\sim$4). The production
of RIF neutrons is controlled by the stopping power in the plasma. Thus, the
current RIF measurements provide a unique test of stopping power models in an
experimentally unexplored plasma regime. We find that the measured RIF data
strongly constrain stopping models in warm dense plasma conditions and some
models are ruled out by our analysis of these experiments.
