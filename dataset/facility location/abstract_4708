By considering the finite mass of Fraternite, the dynamic nature of the Adams
ring arcs is regarded as caused by the reaction of a test body (a minor arc)
through the Lindblad resonance (LR). Assumming the eccentricity of the test
body is larger than that of Galatea, this generates several locations along the
ring in the neighborhood of Fraternite where the time averaged force on a test
body vanishes. These locations appear to correspond to the time dependent
configuration of Egalite (2,1), Liberte, and Courage, and seem to be able to
account for the dynamics of the arcs. Such a configuration is a dynamic one
because the minor arcs are not bounded by the corotation eccentricity resonance
(CER) externally imposed by Galatea, but are self-generated by LR reacting to
the external fields.
