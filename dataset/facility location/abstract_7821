The bridge effect of void filaments is a phrase coined by Park & Lee (2009b)
to explain the correlations found in a numerical experiment between the
luminosity of the void galaxies and the degree of the straightness of their
host filaments. Their numerical finding implies that a straight void filament
provides a narrow channel for the efficient transportation of gas and matter
particles from the surroundings into the void galaxies. To observationally
confirm the presence of the bridge effect of void filaments, we identify the
filamentary structures from the Sloan void catalog and determine the specific
size of each void filament as a measure of its straightness. Using both
classical and Bayesian statistics, we indeed detect a strong tendency that the
void galaxies located in the more straight filaments are on average more
luminous, which is in agreement with the numerical prediction. It is also shown
that the strength of correlation increases with the spatial extent of the void
filaments, which can be physically understood on the grounds that the more
stretched filaments can connect the dense surroundings even to the galaxies
located deep in the central parts of the voids. This observational evidence may
provide a key clue to the puzzling issue of why the void galaxies have higher
specific star formation rates and bluer colours than their wall counterparts.
