A central problem of surveillance is to monitor multiple targets moving in a
large-scale, obstacle-ridden environment with occlusions. This paper presents a
novel principled Partially Observable Markov Decision Process-based approach to
coordinating and controlling a network of active cameras for tracking and
observing multiple mobile targets at high resolution in such surveillance
environments. Our proposed approach is capable of (a) maintaining a belief over
the targets' states (i.e., locations, directions, and velocities) to track
them, even when they may not be observed directly by the cameras at all times,
(b) coordinating the cameras' actions to simultaneously improve the belief over
the targets' states and maximize the expected number of targets observed with a
guaranteed resolution, and (c) exploiting the inherent structure of our
surveillance problem to improve its scalability (i.e., linear time) in the
number of targets to be observed. Quantitative comparisons with
state-of-the-art multi-camera coordination and control techniques show that our
approach can achieve higher surveillance quality in real time. The practical
feasibility of our approach is also demonstrated using real AXIS 214 PTZ
cameras
