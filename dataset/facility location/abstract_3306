We performed a millimetric survey of a sample of 24 post-AGB stars aimed to
search for emission from circumstellar matter, in order to investigate the
physical properties of the outer parts of the envelopes. The observations were
conducted using the 37-channel Max-Planck Millimeter Bolometer array at the
30-meter IRAM telescope. The continuum emission toward the detected sources was
used to quantify the mass of the emitting dust. We combined our observations
with data available in literature to construct the spectral energy distribution
(SED) of the sources. When the observational data cover a spectral range wide
enough, some properties of circumstellar envelopes were derived by comparison
with spectra computed using a radiative transfer code. Of the 24 objects in our
sample, we detected millimetric continuum emission toward 11 sources. Two other
sources were detected at flux level close to 3$\sigma$. The derived
circumstellar dust masses range between 0.4 and $24 \times 10^{-4}$
M$_{\odot}$, but these results are affected from the uncertain about the source
distances. The parameters derived from the SED fits are consistent with the
values characteristic for these kind of object. As confirmed from the flux
density extrapolated in the first light channels of the Atacama Large
Millimetric Array, such sources would be good targets for future high
resolution mapping with the ALMA facility.
