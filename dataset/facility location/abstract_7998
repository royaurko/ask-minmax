The young SNR Cassiopeia A was imaged with WFPC-2 through four filters
selected to capture the complete velocity range of the remnant's main shell in
several important emission lines. Primary lines detected were [O III]
4959,5007, [N II] 6583, [S II] 6716,6731 + [O II] 7319,7330 + [O I] 6300,6364,
and [S III] 9069,9532. About 3/4th of the remnant's main shell was imaged in
all four filters. Considerable detail is observed in the reverse-shocked ejecta
with typical knot scale lengths of 0.2"-0.4" (1 - 2 x 10^16 cm). Both bright
and faint emission features appear highly clumped. Large differences in [S III]
and [O III] line intensities indicating chemical abundance differences are also
seen, particularly in knots located along the bright northern limb and near the
base of the northeast jet. A line of curved overlapping filament in the
remnant's northwestern rim appears to mark the location of the remnant's
reverse shock front in this region. Finger-like ejecta structures elsewhere
suggest cases where the reverse shock front is encountering the remnant's
clumped ejecta. Narrow-band [N II] images of the remnant's circumstellar knots
("QSFs") reveal them to be 0.1"-0.6" thick knots and filaments, often with
diffuse edges facing away from the center of expansion. Three color composite
images of the whole remnant and certain sections along with individual filter
enlargements of selected regions of the bright optical shell are presented and
discussed.
