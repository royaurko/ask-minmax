We determine the curvature of the pseudo-critical line of strong interactions
by means of numerical simulations at imaginary chemical potentials. We consider
$N_f=2+1$ stout improved staggered fermions with physical quark masses and the
tree level Symanzik gauge action, and explore two different sets of lattice
spacings, corresponding to temporal extensions $N_t = 6$ and $N_t = 8$. Both
the renormalized chiral condensate and the renormalized chiral susceptibility
are used to locate the transition. The determinations obtained from the two
quantities are in good agreement, a preliminary continuum extrapolation yields
$\kappa = 0.013(2)(1)$. We also investigate the impact of a non-zero strange
quark chemical potential and compare our results to previous determinations in
the literature, discussing the possible sources of systematic errors affecting
the various procedures.
