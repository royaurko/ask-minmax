We calculate the sensitivity to nu_mu->nu_e appearance oscillations in
various Fermilab main injector neutrino beam configurations using simulations
of a MINOS-like detector and an OPERA-like detector. We make the assumption of
3 neutrino generations, and that only solar and atmospheric neutrino
oscillations signals are "real." We find that a 6 GeV neutrino beam pointed at
a fine-grained detector located at SLAC is optimal (for the central Super-K
atmospheric neutrino oscillation Delta-m-squared value). We show that
nu_mu->nu_e appearance signals and the sign of Delta-m_23-squared can be
obtained at the 3-sigma level for theta_13>3degrees.
