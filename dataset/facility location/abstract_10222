We propose a new scenario of baryogenesis in the context of theories with
large extra dimensions. The baryon number is almost conserved at zero
temperature by means of a localization mechanism recently analyzed by
Arkani-Hamed and Schmaltz: leptons and quarks are located at two slightly
displaced positions in the extra space, and this naturally suppresses the
interactions which ``convert'' the latter in the former. We show that this is
expected to be no longer true when finite temperature effects are taken into
account. The whole scenario is first presented in its generality, without
referring to the bulk geometry or to the specific mechanism which may generate
the baryon asymmetry. As an example, we then focus on a baryogenesis model
reminiscent of GUT baryogenesis. The Sakharov out of equilibrium condition is
satisfied by assuming nonthermal production of the bosons that induce baryon
number violation.
