We study a stochastic model proposed recently in the genetic literature to
explain the heterogeneity of cell populations or of gene products. Cells are
located in two colonies, whose sizes fluctuate as birth and migration processes
in switching environments. We prove that there is a range of parameters where
heterogeneity induces a larger mean fitness
