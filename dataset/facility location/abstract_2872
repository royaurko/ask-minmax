In this paper, a concept of multipurpose object detection system, recently
introduced in our previous work, is clarified. The business aspect of this
method is transformation of a classifier into an object detector/locator via an
image grid. This is a universal framework for locating objects of interest
through classification. The framework standardizes and simplifies
implementation of custom systems by doing only a custom analysis of the
classification results on the image grid.
