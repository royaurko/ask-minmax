We review the theory for photon-photon scattering in vacuum, and some of the
proposals for its experimental search, including the results of our recent
works on the subject. We then describe a very simple and sensitive proposal of
an experiment and discuss how it can be used at the present (HERCULES) and the
future (ELI) ultrahigh power laser facilities either to find the first evidence
of photon-photon scattering in vacuum, or to significantly improve the current
experimental limits.
