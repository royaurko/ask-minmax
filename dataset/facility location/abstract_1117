We investigate the constraint on the flavor-dependent neutral current
Non-Standard Interactions in propagation from atmospheric neutrino experiments
Superkamiokande and Hyperkamiokande. With the ansatz where the parameters which
have strong constraints from other experiments are neglected, we show how these
experiments put constraints on the remaining parameters of the Non-Standard
Interactions.
