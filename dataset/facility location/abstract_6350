A preliminary experimental study is presented, that aims at eliciting the
contribution of oral messages to facilitating visual search tasks on crowded
visual displays. Results of quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that
appropriate verbal messages can improve both target selection time and
accuracy. In particular, multimodal messages including a visual presentation of
the isolated target together with absolute spatial oral information on its
location in the displayed scene seem most effective. These messages also got
top-ranking ratings from most subjects.
