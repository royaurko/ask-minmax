We study projective subsets of Baire space from Brouwer's intuitionistic
point of view, using his Thesis on Bars and his continuity axioms. We first
study analytic sets; these are the projections of the closed subsets of Baire
space. We consider a number of examples and discover a fine structure in the
class of the analytic sets that fail to be positively Borel. A subset of Baire
space is strictly analytic if it coincides with the range of a continuous
function from Baire space to itself. We prove separation and boundedness
theorems for strictly analytic sets. Co-analytic sets are the co-projections of
the open subsets of Baire space. We show different ways to prove that some
co-analytic sets are not analytic and that some analytic sets are not
co-analytic. We consider the set of the codes of the closed and located subsets
of Baire space that are almost-countable as an example of a set that is a
projection of a co-analytic set. We bring to light the collapse of the
projective hierarchy: every (positively) projective set coincides with the
projection of a co-analytic set.
