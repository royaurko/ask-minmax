Implementations of tracking systems have become prevalent issues in modern
technology due to its advantage of location detection of objects. Objects are
usually tracked using trackers based on GPS, GSM, RFID and Bluetooth signal
strength implementation. These mechanisms usually require line of sight
operations, limited coverage and low level programming language for accessing
Bluetooth signal strength. This paper presents an alternative technique for
tracking the movement of indoor objects based on Bluetooth communication
technology, principles of motion and least square statistical method.
Algorithms are designed and implemented using Java
