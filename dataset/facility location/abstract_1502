In this paper, I discuss the capabilities and limitations of an 8-10 meter
ultraviolet/optical telescope in space, the proposed successor to the Hubble
Space Telescope, in the context of galaxy studies. The exquisite spatial
resolution and excellent sensitivity of such a facility would open up new
possibilities for the study of nearby dwarf galaxies ($z \la 0.5$), and for
studying the internal structure and kinematics of more luminous galaxies at
high redshift ($z \ga 2$). These applications are of particular importance
because they would address areas in which the popular Cold Dark Matter theory
is in potential conflict with observations.
