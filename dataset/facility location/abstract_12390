The interplay of geometrical and topological entanglement in semiflexible
knotted polymer rings confined inside a spherical cavity is investigated using
advanced numerical methods. By using stringent and robust algorithms for
locating knots, we characterize how the knot length lk depends on the ring
contour length, Lc and the radius of the confining sphere, Rc . In the no- and
strong- confinement cases we observe weak knot localization and complete knot
delocalization, respectively. We show that the complex interplay of lk, Lc and
Rc that seamlessly bridges these two limits can be encompassed by a simple
scaling argument based on deflection theory. The same argument is used to
rationalize the multiscale character of the entanglement that emerges with
increasing confinement.
