We investigate the dynamics of a classical particle in a one-dimensional
two-wave potential composed of two periodic potentials, that are
time-independent and of the same amplitude and periodicity. One of the periodic
potentials is externally driven and performs a translational motion with
respect to the other. It is shown that if one of the potentials is of the
ratchet type, translation of the potential in a given direction leads to motion
of the particle in the same direction, whereas translation in the opposite
direction leaves the particle localized at its original location. Moreover,
even if the translation is random, but still has a finite velocity, an
efficient directed transport of the particle occurs.
