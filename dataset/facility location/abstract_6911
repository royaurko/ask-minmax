Consider a walker performing a random walk in an i.i.d. random environment,
and assume that the walker tells us at each time the environment it sees at its
present location. Given this history of the transition probabilities seen from
the walker - but not its trajectory - can we tell if the RWRE is recurrent or
transient? Can we reconstruct the law of the environment? We show that in a
one-dimensional environment, the law of the environment can be reconstructed,
and we know in particular if the RWRE is recurrent or transient.
