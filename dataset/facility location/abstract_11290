We have used deep ACS/WFC images of M33 to check nature of extended objects
detected by the ground based survey of Zloczewski et al. (2008). A total of 24
candidates turned out to be genuine compact stellar clusters. In addition we
detected 91 new clusters. Equatorial coordinates, integrated magnitudes and
angular sizes are listed for all 115 objects. Fourty-two clusters have
sufficiently red colors to be candidates for old globulars. For four clusters
we extracted resolved stellar photometry. Object 33-3-018 located in the outer
disk of M33 turned out to be a young cluster with an age estimated at 200-350
Myr. Cluster ZK-90 has an age of 3-5 Gyr. The remaining two clusters have
intermediate ages ranging from one to a few Gyr.
