We consider a system consisting of multiple mobile robots in which the user
can at any time issue relocation tasks ordering one of the robots to move from
its current location to a given destination location. In this paper, we deal
with the problem of finding a trajectory for each such relocation task that
avoids collisions with other robots. The chosen robot plans its trajectory so
as to avoid collision with other robots executing tasks that were issued
earlier. We prove that if all possible destinations of the relocation tasks
satisfy so-called valid infrastructure property, then this mechanism is
guaranteed to always succeed and provide a trajectory for the robot that
reaches the destination without colliding with any other robot. The
time-complexity of the approach on a fixed space-time discretization is only
quadratic in the number of robots. We demonstrate the applicability of the
presented method on several real-world maps and compare its performance against
a popular reactive approach that attempts to solve the collisions locally.
Besides being dead-lock free, the presented approach generates trajectories
that are significantly faster (up to 48% improvement) than the trajectories
resulting from local collision avoidance.
