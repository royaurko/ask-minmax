By combining first principles transition state location and molecular
dynamics simulation, we unambiguously identify a carbon atom approaching
induced bridging metal structure formation on Cu (111) surface, which strongly
modify the carbon atom coalescence dynamics. The emergence of this new
structural motif turns out to be a result of the subtle balance between Cu-C
and Cu-Cu interactions. Based on this picture, a simple theoretical model is
proposed, which describes a variety of surface chemistries very well.
