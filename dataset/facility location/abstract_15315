We present a JHKL survey of the massive star forming region RCW 57 (NGC 3576)
based on L-band data at 3.5 micron taken with SPIREX (South Pole Infrared
Explorer), and 2MASS JHK data at 1.25-2.2 micron. This is the second of two
papers, the first one concerning a similar JHKL survey of 30 Doradus.
Colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams are used to detect sources with
infrared excess. This excess emission is interpreted as coming from
circumstellar disks, and hence gives the cluster disk fraction (CDF). Based on
the CDF and the age of RCW 57, it is possible to draw conclusions on the
formation and early evolution of massive stars. The infrared excess is detected
by comparing the locations of sources in JHKL colour-colour and L vs. (K-L)
colour-magnitude diagrams to the reddening band due to interstellar extinction.
A total of 251 sources were detected. More than 50% of the 209 sources included
in the diagrams have an infrared excess. Comparison with other JHKL surveys,
including the results on 30 Doradus from the first paper, support a very high
initial disk fraction (>80%) even for massive stars, although there is an
indication of a possible faster evolution of circumstellar disks around high
mass stars. 33 sources only found in the L-band indicate the presence of
heavily embedded, massive Class I protostars. We also report the detection of
diffuse PAHs emission throughout the RCW 57 region.
