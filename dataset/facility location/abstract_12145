We introduce an operational approach to the use of pulsating sources, located
at spatial infinity, for defining a relativistic positioning and navigation
system, based on the use of four-dimensional bases of null four-vectors, in
flat spacetime. As a prototypical case, we show how pulsars can be used to
define such a positioning system. The reception of the pulses for a set of
different sources whose positions in the sky and periods are assumed to be
known allows the determination of the user's coordinates and spacetime
trajectory, in the reference frame where the sources are at rest. We describe
our approach in flat Minkowski spacetime, and discuss the validity of this and
other approximations we have considered.
