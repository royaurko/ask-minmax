Today's high-intensity laser facilities produce short pulses can, in tight
focus, reach peak intensities of $10^{22}\,\mathrm{Wcm}^{-2}$ and, in long
focus, wakefield-accelerate electrons to GeV energies. The
radiation-reaction--dominated regime, where the recoil from stochastic photon
emission becomes significant, can be reached in the collision of such an
electron beam with an intense short pulse. Measuring the total energy emitted
in gamma rays or the presence of a prominent depletion zone in the electron
beam's post-collision energy spectrum would provide strong evidence of
radiation reaction, provided enough electrons penetrate the region of highest
laser intensity. Constraints on the accuracy of timing necessary to achieve
this are given for a head-on collision.
