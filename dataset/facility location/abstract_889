Two mechanisms of decoherence in ion traps are studied, specially related to
the experiment [Kielpinski et al., Science 291 (2001) 1013]. Statistical
hypothesis are made about the unknown variables and the expected behaviour of
the visibility of the best experimental pattern is calculated for each
mechanism. Data from the experiment are analyzed and show to be insufficient to
distinguish between them. We suggest improvements which can do this with slight
modifications in the present facilities.
