We present new measurements of the power spectra of the E-mode of CMB
polarization, the temperature T, the cross-correlation of E and T, and upper
limits on the B-mode from 2.5 years of dedicated Cosmic Background Imager (CBI)
observations. Both raw maps and optimal signal images in the uv-plane and real
space show strong detections of the E-mode (11.7 sigma for the EE power
spectrum overall) and no detection of the B-mode. The power spectra are used to
constrain parameters of the flat tilted adiabatic Lambda-CDM models: those
determined from EE and TE bandpowers agree with those from TT, a powerful
consistency check. There is little tolerance for shifting polarization peaks
from the TT-forecast locations, as measured by the angular sound crossing scale
theta = 100 ell_s = 1.03 +/- 0.02 from EE and TE cf. 1.044 +/- 0.005 with the
TT data included. The scope for extra out-of-phase peaks from subdominant
isocurvature modes is also curtailed. The EE and TE measurements of CBI, DASI
and BOOMERANG are mutually consistent, and, taken together rather than singly,
give enhanced leverage for these tests.
