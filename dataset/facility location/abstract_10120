When testing multiple hypothesis in a survey --e.g. many different source
locations, template waveforms, and so on-- the final result consists in a set
of confidence intervals, each one at a desired confidence level. But the
probability that at least one of these intervals does not cover the true value
increases with the number of trials. With a sufficiently large array of
confidence intervals, one can be sure that at least one is missing the true
value. In particular, the probability of false claim of detection becomes not
negligible. In order to compensate for this, one should increase the confidence
level, at the price of a reduced detection power. False discovery rate control
is a relatively new statistical procedure that bounds the number of mistakes
made when performing multiple hypothesis tests. We shall review this method,
discussing exercise applications to the field of gravitational wave surveys.
