W75N is a star-forming region containing various ultracompact HII regions and
OH, water, and methanol maser emission. Our VLBA map shows that the OH masers
are located in a thin disk rotating around an O-star which is the exciting star
of the ultracompact HII region VLA1. A separate set of maser spots is connected
with the ultracompact HII region VLA2. The radial velocity of OH maser spots
varies across the disk from 3.7 km/s to 10.9 km/s. The diameter of the disk is
4000 A.U. All maser spots are strongly polarized. This are the first OH masers
showing nearly 100 per cent linear polarization in several spots. Two maser
spots seem to be Zeeman pairs corresponding to a magnetic field of 5.2 mgauss
and 7.7 mgauss, and in one case we tentatively found a Zeeman pair consisting
of two linearly polarized components. The linearly polarized maser spots are
shown to be sigma-components which is the case of the magnetic field being
perpendicular to the line of sight. The direction of the magnetic field as
determined from linearly polarized spots is perpendicular to the plane of the
disk, although the galactic Faraday rotation may significantly affect this
conclusion.
