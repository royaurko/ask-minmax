Many operations in power grids, such as fault detection and event location
estimation, depend on precise timing information. In this paper, a novel time
stamp attack (TSA) is proposed to attack the timing information in smart grid.
Since many applications in smart grid utilize synchronous measurements and most
of the measurement devices are equipped with global positioning system (GPS)
for precise timing, it is highly probable to attack the measurement system by
spoofing the GPS. The effectiveness of TSA is demonstrated for three
applications of phasor measurement unit (PMU) in smart grid, namely
transmission line fault detection, voltage stability monitoring and event
locationing.
