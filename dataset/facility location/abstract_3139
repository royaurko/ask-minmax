Object category localization is a challenging problem in computer vision.
Standard supervised training requires bounding box annotations of object
instances. This time-consuming annotation process is sidestepped in weakly
supervised learning. In this case, the supervised information is restricted to
binary labels that indicate the absence/presence of object instances in the
image, without their locations. We follow a multiple-instance learning approach
that iteratively trains the detector and infers the object locations in the
positive training images. Our main contribution is a multi-fold multiple
instance learning procedure, which prevents training from prematurely locking
onto erroneous object locations. This procedure is particularly important when
using high-dimensional representations, such as Fisher vectors and
convolutional neural network features. We also propose a window refinement
method, which improves the localization accuracy by incorporating an objectness
prior. We present a detailed experimental evaluation using the PASCAL VOC 2007
dataset, which verifies the effectiveness of our approach.
