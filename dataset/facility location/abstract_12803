We present the effects of cosmic rays on the detectors onboard the Herschel
satellite. We describe in particular the glitches observed on the two types of
cryogenic far- infrared bolometer inside the two instruments PACS and SPIRE.
The glitch rates are also reported since the launch together with the SREM
radiation monitors aboard Herschel and Planck spacecrafts. Both have been
injected around the Lagrangian point L2 on May 2009. This allows probing the
radiation environment around this orbit. The impacts on the observation are
finally summarized.
