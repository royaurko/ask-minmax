Author offers the new and distinctly revolutionary method of levitation in
artificial magnetic field. It is shown that a very big space station and small
satellites may be suspended over the Earth's surface and used as motionless
radio-TV translators, telecommunication boosters, absolute geographic position
locators, personal and mass entertainment and as planet-observation platforms.
Presented here is the theory of big AB artificial magnetic field and levitation
in it is generally developed. Computation of three macro-projects: space
station at altitude 100 km, TV-communication antenna at height 500 m, and
multi-path magnetic highway.
  Key words: levitation, AB Levitrons, motionless space satellite.
