Magnetization, heat capacity, electrical resistivity, thermoelectric power,
and Hall effect have been investigated on single-crystalline Ce_2PdSi_3. This
compound is shown to order antiferromagnetically below N'eel temperature (T_N)
\~3 K. The Sommerfeld coefficient far below T_N is found to be about 110 mJ/K^2
mol Ce, which indicates the heavy-fermion character of this compound. The
transport and magnetic properties exhibit large anisotropy with an interplay
between crystalline-electric-field (CEF) and Kondo effects. The sign of
thermoelectric power is opposite for different directions at high temperatures
and the ordinary Hall coefficient is anisotropic with opposite sign for
different geometries, indicating the anisotropic Fermi surface. The CEF
analysis from the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility suggests
that the ground state is |+/-1/2>. The first and the second excited CEF doublet
levels are found to be located at about 30 and 130 K, respectively. The Kondo
temperature is estimated to be the same order as T_N, indicating the presence
of a delicate competition between the Kondo effect and magnetic order.
