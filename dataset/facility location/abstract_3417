We have analyzed the recent JINR measurements on nuclide production cross
sections from interaction of 660 MeV proton beams with radioactive targets of
enriched 129I (85% 129I and 15% 127I), 237Np, and 241Am with eleven different
models, realized in eight transport codes and event-generators: LAHET (Bertini,
ISABEL, INCL+ABLA, and INCL+RAL options), CASCADE, CEM95, CEM2k, LAQGSM+GEM2,
CEM2k+GEM2, LAQGSM+GEMINI, and CEM2k+GEMINI. We found out that all these models
have problems in a correct description of many of these cross sections, though
some of these models describe very well most of the recent measurements done at
GSI using inverse kinematics, as well as many other reactions. None of the
tested here models is able to reproduce well all the JINR data and all of them
should be further improved. Development of a better universal
evaporation/fission model should be of a highest priority. We conclude that it
is impossible to make a correct choice between fission and fragmentation
reaction mechanisms analyzing only measurements on product cross sections;
addressing this question would require analysis of two- or multi-particle
correlation measurements.
