Motivation: Methods are needed to test pre-defined genomic regions such as
promoters for differential methylation in genome-wide association studies,
where the number of samples is limited and the data have large amounts of
measurement error. Results: We developed a new statistical test, the
generalized integrated functional test (GIFT), which tests for regional
differences in methylation based on differences in the functional relationship
between methylation percent and location of the CpG sites within a region. In
this method, subject-specific functional profiles are first estimated, and the
average profile within groups is compared between groups using an ANOVA-like
test. Simulations and analyses of data obtained from patients with chronic
lymphocytic leukemia indicate that GIFT has good statistical properties and is
able to identify promising genomic regions. Further, GIFT is likely to work
with multiple different types of experiments since different smoothing
functions can be used to estimate the functional relationship between
methylation percent and CpG site location. Availability and Implementation:
