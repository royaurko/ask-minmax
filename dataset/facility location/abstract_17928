The paper concerns the hype idea of "Citizen Science" and the related
paradigm shift: to go from the passive "volunteer computing" to other volunteer
actions like "volunteer measurements" under guidance of scientists. They can be
carried out by ordinary people with standard computing gadgets (smartphone,
tablet, etc.) and the various standard sensors in them. Here the special
attention is paid to the system of volunteer scientific measurements to study
air showers caused by cosmic rays. The technical implementation is based on
integration of data about registered night flashes (by radiometric software) in
shielded camera chip, synchronized time and GPS-data in ordinary gadgets: to
identify night "air showers" of elementary particles; to analyze the frequency
and to map the distribution of "air showers" in the densely populated cities.
The project currently includes the students of the National Technical
University of Ukraine "KPI", which are compactly located in Kyiv city and
contribute their volunteer measurements. The technology would be very effective
for other applications also, especially if it will be automated (e.g., on the
basis of XtremWeb or/and BOINC technologies for distributed computing) and used
in some small area with many volunteers, e.g. in local communities
(Corporative/Community Crowd Computing).
