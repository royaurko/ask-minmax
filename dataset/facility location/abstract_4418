We present progress toward using scanned OSSE observations for mapping and
sky survey work. To this end, we have developed a technique for detecting
pointlike sources of unknown number and location, given that they appear in a
background which is relatively featureless or which can be modeled. The
technique, based on the newly developed concept and mean field annealing, is
described, with sample reconstructions of data from the OSSE Virgo Survey. The
results demonstrate the capability of reconstructing source information without
any a priori information about the number and/or location of pointlike sources
in the field-of-view.
