In order to analyze varying plasma conditions upstream of Titan, we have
combined a physical model of Saturn's plasmadisk with a geometrical model of
the oscillating current sheet. During modeled oscillation phases where Titan is
furthest from the current sheet, the main sources of plasma pressure in the
near-Titan space are the magnetic pressure and, for disturbed conditions, the
hot plasma pressure. When Titan is at the center of the sheet, the main source
is the dynamic pressure associated with Saturn's cold, subcorotating plasma.
Total pressure at Titan (dynamic plus thermal plus magnetic) typically
increases by a factor of five as the current sheet center is approached. The
predicted incident plasma flow direction deviates from the orbital plane of
Titan by < 10 deg. These results suggest a correlation between the location of
magnetic pressure maxima and the oscillation phase of the plasmasheet.
