Spectroscopy and deep imaging of the group NEQ3 are presented. This system is
formed by three compact objects with relative separations of ~2.6 and ~2.8
arcsec, and a lenticular galaxy at ~17 arcsec from the geometric centre of the
group. A diffuse filament is located on a line joining the three compact
objects and the main galaxy. Analysis of these observations confirms the
redshift previously known for three of the objects (z=0.1239 for the main
galaxy, and z=0.1935 and 0.1939 for two of the compact objects). We have also
determined the previously unknown redshift of the third compact object as
z=0.2229. Using the relative strength and width of the main spectral lines, we
have classified the compact objects as two HII galaxies and one QSO (the object
at z=0.1935). With cross-correlation techniques, we have tentatively estimated
the redshift of the filament as z=0.19 (although a weaker component also
appears at z=0.12) so that it is probably associated with the halo of the two
compact objects at this redshift. The two objects at redshift ~0.19 represent
possibly one of the more clear examples of starburst (and perhaps QSO activity)
driven by interaction. These, and the relation between these two objects and
the other two at (~0.12 and ~0.22) make the nature of this system intriguing,
being difficult to explain the whole association on conventional scenarios.
