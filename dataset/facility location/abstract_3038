We consider minimizers of a Ginzburg-Landau energy with a discontinuous and
rapidly oscillating pinning term, subject to a Dirichlet boundary condition of
degree $d > 0$. The pinning term models an unbounded number of small impurities
in the domain. We prove that for strongly type II superconductor with
impurities, minimizers have exactly d isolated zeros (vortices). These vortices
are of degree 1 and pinned by the impurities. As in the standard case studied
by Bethuel, Brezis and H\'elein, the macroscopic location of vortices is
governed by vortex/vortex and vortex/ boundary repelling effects. In some
special cases we prove that their macroscopic location tends to minimize the
renormalized energy of Bethuel-Brezis-H\'elein. In addition, impurities affect
the microscopic location of vortices. Our technics allows us to work with
impurities having different size. In this situation we prove that vortices are
pinned by the largest impurities.
