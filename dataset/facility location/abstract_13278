The effects of global climate change on Peruvian glaciers have brought about
several processes of deglaciation during the last few years. The immediate
effect is the change of size of lakes and rivers. Public institutions that
monitor water resources currently have only recent studies which make up less
than 10% of the total. The effects of climate change and the lack of updated
information intensify social-economic problems related to water resources in
Peru. The objective of this research is to develop a software application to
automate the Cadastral Registry of Water Bodies in Peru, using techniques of
digital image processing, which would provide tools for detection, record,
temporal analysis and visualization of water bodies. The images used are from
the satellite Landsat5, which undergo a pre-processing of calibration and
correction of the satellite. Detection results are archived into a file that
contains location vectors and images of the segmentated bodies of water.
