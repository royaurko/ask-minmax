By using H$\alpha$, He I 10830, EUV and soft X-ray (SXR) data, we examined a
filament eruption that occurred on a quiet-sun region near the center of the
solar disk on 2006 January 12, which disturbed a sigmoid overlying the filament
channel observed by the $\emph{GOES-12}$ SXR Imager (SXI), and led to the
eruption of the sigmoid. The event was associated with a partial halo coronal
mass ejection (CME) observed by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraphs
(LASCO) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ($\emph{SOHO}$), and
resulted in the formation of two flare-like ribbons, post-eruption coronal
loops, and two transient coronal holes (TCHs), but there were no significantly
recorded $\emph{GOES}$ or H$\alpha$ flares corresponding to the eruption. The
two TCHs were dominated by opposite magnetic polarities and were located on the
two ends of the eruptive sigmoid. They showed similar locations and shapes in
He I 10830, EUV and SXR observations. During the early eruption phase,
brightenings first appeared on the locations of the two subsequent TCHs, which
could be clearly identified on He I 10830, EUV and SXR images. This eruption
event could be explained by the magnetic flux rope model, and the two TCHs were
likely to be the feet of the flux rope.
