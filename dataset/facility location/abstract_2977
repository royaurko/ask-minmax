Stellar radial velocity in the central region of the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC) is used to estimate the radial velocity curve along various position
angles (PA) including the line of nodes (LON). The central part of the radial
velocity profile, along the LON, shows a V-shaped profile - a clear indication
of counterrotation. The counterrotating region and the secondary bar have
similar location and PA. The origin of the counter-rotating core could be
internal(secondary bar) or external(accretion). To explain the observed
velocity profile, we propose the existence of two disks in the inner LMC, with
one counterrotating. This two disk model is found to match the HI velocities as
well. Two disks with different LON and velocity profiles can create regions
which are kinematically and spatially separated. Predicted such locations are
found to match the observed locations where the HI clouds are found to have two
velocities.
