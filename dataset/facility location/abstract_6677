A set of $n$-lattice points in the plane, no three on a line and no four on a
circle, such that all pairwise distances and all coordinates are integral is
called an $n$-cluster (in $\mathbb{R}^2$). We determine the smallest existent
$7$-cluster with respect to its diameter. Additionally we provide a toolbox of
algorithms which allowed us to computationally locate over 1000 different
$7$-clusters, some of them having huge integer edge lengths. On the way, we
exhaustively determined all Heronian triangles with largest edge length up to
$6\cdot 10^6$.
