A SASE FEL facility was first proposed in Feasibility Report of the TAC
(Turkish Accelerator Center) project in 2000. Conceptual Design Report (CDR) of
the project was completed in 2005. Technical Design Report (TDR) studies of TAC
were started in 2006 in frame of an inter universities project with support of
State Planning Organization (SPO) of Turkey. Main goal of the SASE FEL proposal
is to cover VUV and soft X-rays region of the spectrum besides IR-FEL,
Bremsstrahlung and Synchrotron Radiation proposals of TAC. Up to now,
optimization studies based on a special RF linac or an Energy Recovery Linac
(ERL) for the SASE FEL facility, were completed. Today, ERLs provide a powerful
broad range of applications like: electron cooling devices, high average
brightness, high power FELs, short-pulse radiation sources and high luminosity
colliders. In this study, main parameters for two linac options and SASE FEL
are given.
