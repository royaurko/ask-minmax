A detailed new upgrade of the FEAST eigensolver targeting non-Hermitian
eigenvalue problems is presented and thoroughly discussed. It aims at
broadening the class of eigenproblems that can be addressed within the
framework of the FEAST algorithm. The algorithm is ideally suited for computing
selected interior eigenvalues and their associated right/left bi-orthogonal
eigenvectors,located within a subset of the complex plane. It combines subspace
iteration with efficient contour integration techniques that approximate the
left and right spectral projectors. We discuss the various algorithmic choices
that have been made to improve the stability and usability of the new
non-Hermitian eigensolver. The latter retains the convergence property and
multi-level parallelism of Hermitian FEAST, making it a valuable new software
tool for the scientific community.
