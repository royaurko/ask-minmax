We study the high-luminosity fixed-target neutrino experiments at MiniBooNE,
MINOS and T2K and analyze their sensitivity to light stable states, focusing on
MeV--GeV scale dark matter. Thermal relic dark matter scenarios in the sub-GeV
mass range require the presence of light mediators, whose coupling to the
Standard Model facilitates annihilation in the early universe and allows for
the correct thermal relic abundance. The mediators in turn provide a production
channel for dark matter at colliders or fixed targets, and as a consequence the
neutrino beams generated at fixed targets may contain an additional beam of
light dark matter. The signatures of this beam include elastic scattering off
electrons or nucleons in the (near-)detector, which closely mimics the neutral
current scattering of neutrinos. We determine the event rate at modern fixed
target facilities and the ensuing sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter.
