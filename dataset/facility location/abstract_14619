We study the temperature structure of the central part (r<18' ~0.7 h50**-1
Mpc) of the Coma cluster of galaxies using ASCA data. Two different analysis
methods produce results in good agreement with each other and reveal the
presence of interesting structures in the gas temperature distribution.
Globally, the average temperature in the center of the cluster is 9.0 +/- 0.6
keV in good agreement with previous results. Superimposed on this, we find a
cool area with temperatures of 4-6 keV associated with a filament of X-ray
emission extending southeast from the cluster center detected by Vikhlinin and
coworkers. We also find a hot spot with a temperature of around 13 keV
displaced north from the central peak of emission. The distribution of the gas
temperatures and relative specific entropies suggests that the cool features
are most likely gas stripped from a galaxy group centered on NGC 4874 falling
toward the core from outside, while the hot spot located ``ahead'' of this
in-falling gas is due to shock heating. Thus our results suggest that we are
observing Coma during a minor merger with a small group of galaxies associated
with NGC 4874 shortly before the initial core passage.
