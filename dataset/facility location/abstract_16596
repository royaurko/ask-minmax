The details of the Solar system's formation are still heavily debated.
Questions remain about the formation locations of the giant planets, and the
degree to which volatile material was mixed throughout the proto-planetary
system. One diagnostic which offers great promise in helping to unravel the
history of planet formation is the study of the level of deuteration in various
Solar system bodies. For example, the D/H ratio of methane in the atmosphere of
Titan can be used as a diagnostic of the initial conditions of the solar nebula
within the region of giant planet formation, and can help us to determine where
Titan (and, by extension, the Saturnian system) accreted its volatile material.
The level of Titanian deuteration also has implications for both the sources
and long term evolution of Titan's atmospheric composition. We present the
results of observations taken in the 1.58 microns window using the NIFS
spectrometer on the Gemini telescope, and model our data using the VSTAR
line--by--line transfer model, which yields a D/H ratio for Titan's atmosphere
of 143+/-16) x 10^{-6} [1]. We are currently in the process of modeling the
Gemini high resolution GNIRS spectra using new sets of line parameters derived
for methane in the region between 1.2-1.7 microns [2].
