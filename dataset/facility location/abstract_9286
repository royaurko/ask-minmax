We report the detection with the ATCA of 6.7 GHz methanol emission towards
OMC-1. The source has a size between 40'' and 90'', is located to the
south-east of Ori-KL and may coincide in position with the 25 GHz masers. The
source may be an example of an interesting case recently predicted in theory
where the transitions of traditionally different methanol maser classes show
maser activity simultaneously. In addition, results of recent search for
methanol masers from the 25 and 104.3 GHz transitions are reported.
