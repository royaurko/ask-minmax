Radiative decays of the $1^3S_1$ radial and $1^3D_1$ orbital excitations of
the $\rho$, $\omega$ and $\phi$ are calculated in the quark model, using wave
functions obtained variationally from the Hamiltonian with standard quark-model
parameters. The larger radiative widths should be measurable at new
high-intensity facilities being proposed, and in some cases may be measurable
in data from existing experiments. The radiative decays are a strong
discriminator between the $1^3S_1$ and $1^3D_1$ excitations, and can also be
used to provide unique information about the decay products.
