Given a planar map of $n$ segments in which we wish to efficiently locate
points, we present the first randomized incremental construction of the
well-known trapezoidal-map search-structure that only requires expected $O(n
\log n)$ preprocessing time while deterministically guaranteeing worst-case
linear storage space and worst-case logarithmic query time. This settles a long
standing open problem; the best previously known construction time of such a
structure, which is based on a directed acyclic graph, so-called the history
DAG, and with the above worst-case space and query-time guarantees, was
expected $O(n \log^2 n)$. The result is based on a deeper understanding of the
structure of the history DAG, its depth in relation to the length of its
longest search path, as well as its correspondence to the trapezoidal search
tree. Our results immediately extend to planar maps induced by finite
collections of pairwise interior disjoint well-behaved curves.
