We present and analyze low-temperature series and complex-temperature
partition function zeros for the $q$-state Potts model with $q=4$ on the
honeycomb lattice and $q=3,4$ on the triangular lattice. A discussion is given
as to how the locations of the singularities obtained from the series analysis
correlate with the complex-temperature phase boundary. Extending our earlier
work, we include a similar discussion for the Potts model with $q=3$ on the
honeycomb lattice and with $q=3,4$ on the kagom\'e lattice.
