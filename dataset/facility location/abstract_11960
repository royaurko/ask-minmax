We prepare metastable glassy states in a model glass-former made of
Lennard-Jones particles by sampling biased ensembles of trajectories with low
dynamical activity. These trajectories form an inactive dynamical phase whose
`fast' vibrational degrees of freedom are maintained at thermal equilibrium by
contact with a heat bath, while the `slow' structural degrees of freedom are
located in deep valleys of the energy landscape. We examine the relaxation to
equilibrium and the vibrational properties of these metastable states. The
glassy states we prepare by our trajectory sampling method are very stable to
thermal fluctuations and also more mechanically rigid than low-temperature
equilibrated configurations.
