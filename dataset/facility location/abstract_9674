New boundary bound states (BBS) are found of an integrable model with the
magnetic impurities located at the edges of an open Heisenberg spin chain.
These bound states carry the real energy and are formed by three or five
imaginary modes of the rapidities. These imaginary modes of the rapidities give
the non-zero antisymmetric wave functions and the moments of the centers of the
bound states are zero. It means that these bound states are arisen by the
magnetic impurities and localized at the edges of the correlated system. The
Kondo screening occurs for the antiferromagnetic spin chain with the
ferromagnetic impurities-electrons exchange interaction.
