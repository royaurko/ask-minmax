We have developed a compact Compton gamma-ray imager with a large field of
view and a low channel-count that is capable of quickly localizing gamma-ray
sources in the few hundred keV - several MeV range. The two detector planes
(scatter and absorber) employ bars of NaI(Tl) read out by photomultiplier tubes
(PMTs) located at each end. The long-range imaging performance has been tested
from 392 keV to 1274 keV. An angular resolution measure of 2.72 +/- 0.06
degrees and an efficiency of (1.79 +/- 0.04) x 10^(-3) at 662 keV is obtained.
A Cs-137 (662 keV) source equivalent to a 10 mCi source 40 m away can be
located in 60 seconds with an uncertainty of about a degree. No significant
degradation in imaging performance is observed for source angles up to 40
degrees off axis.
