Motivated by the recent experimental observation [D. A. Abanin et al.,
Science 323, 328 (2011)] of nonlocality in magnetotransport near the Dirac
point in six-terminal graphene Hall bars, for a wide range of temperatures and
magnetic fields, we develop a nonequilibrium Green function (NEGF) theory of
this phenomenon. In the phase-coherent regime and strong magnetic field, we
find large spin Hall (SH) conductance in four-terminal bridges, where the SH
current is pure only at the Dirac point (DP), as well as the nonlocal voltage
at a remote location in six-terminal bars where the direct and inverse SH
effect operate at the same time. The "momentum-relaxing" dephasing reduces
their values at the DP by two orders of magnitude while concurrently washing
out any features away from the DP. Our theory is based on the Meir-Wingreen
formula with dephasing introduced via phenomenological many-body self-energies,
which is then linearized for multiterminal geometries to extract currents and
voltages.
