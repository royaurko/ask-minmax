A gravitational lens model of the radio quasar B1422+231 is presented which
can account for the image arrangement and approximately for the relative
magnifications. The locations of the principal lensing mass and a more distant
secondary mass concentration were predicted and subsequently luminous galaxies
were found at these locations. This argues against the existence of substantial
numbers of ``dark'' galaxies. The model suggests that if the compact radio
source is intrinsically superluminal then the observed component motions may be
as large as ~100c with image B moving in the opposite direction to images A and
C. The prospects for a measuring the Hubble constant from a model incorporating
lens galaxy locations, compact radio source expansion speeds and radio time
delays, if and when these are measured, are briefly assessed.
