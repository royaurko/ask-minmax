Fermilab's Superconducting RF Beam Test Facility currently under construction
will produce electron beams capable of damaging the acceleration structures and
the beam line vacuum chambers in the event of an aberrant accelerator pulse.
The accelerator is being designed with the capability to operate with up to
3000 bunches per macro-pulse, 5Hz repetition rate and 1.5 GeV beam energy. It
will be able to sustain an average beam power of 72 KW at the bunch charge of
3.2 nC. Operation at full intensity will deposit enough energy in niobium
material to approach the melting point of 2500 {\deg}C. In the early phase with
only 3 cryomodules installed the facility will be capable of generating
electron beam energies of 810 MeV and an average beam power that approaches 40
KW. In either case a robust Machine Protection System (MPS) is required to
mitigate effects due to such large damage potentials. This paper will describe
the MPS system being developed, the system requirements and the controls issues
under consideration.
