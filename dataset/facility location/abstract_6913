This paper is devoted to a Radon-type transform arising in Photoacoustic
Tomography that uses integrating line detectors. We consider two situations:
when the line detectors are tangent to the boundary of a cylindrical domain and
when the line detectors are located on a plane. We present the analogue of the
Fourier slice theorems for each case of the Radon-type transforms. Also, we
provide several new inversion formulas, a support theorem, and stability
estimate and necessary range condition results.
