We seek to understand how the technical definition of Lehmer pair can be
related to more analytic properties of the Riemann zeta function, particularly
the location of the zeros of $\zeta^\prime(s)$. Because we are interested in
the connection between Lehmer pairs and the de Bruijn-Newman constant
$\Lambda$, we assume the Riemann Hypothesis throughout. We define strong Lehmer
pairs via an inequality on the derivative of the pre-Schwarzian of Riemann's
function $\Xi(t)$, evaluated at consecutive zeros. Theorem 1 shows that strong
Lehmer pairs are Lehmer pairs. Theorem 2 describes the derivative of the
pre-Schwarzian in terms of $\zeta^\prime(\rho)$. Theorem 3 expresses the
criteria for strong Lehmer pairs in terms of nearby zeros $\rho^\prime$ of
$\zeta^\prime(s)$. We examine 114661 pairs of zeros of $\zeta(s)$ around height
t=10^6, finding 855 strong Lehmer pairs. These are compared to the
corresponding zeros of $\zeta^\prime(s)$ in the same range.
