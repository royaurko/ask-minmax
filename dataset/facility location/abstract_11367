We relate tag clouds to other forms of visualization, including planar or
reduced dimensionality mapping, and Kohonen self-organizing maps. Using a
modified tag cloud visualization, we incorporate other information into it,
including text sequence and most pertinent words. Our notion of word pertinence
goes beyond just word frequency and instead takes a word in a mathematical
sense as located at the average of all of its pairwise relationships. We
capture semantics through context, taken as all pairwise relationships. Our
domain of application is that of filmscript analysis. The analysis of
filmscripts, always important for cinema, is experiencing a major gain in
importance in the context of television. Our objective in this work is to
visualize the semantics of filmscript, and beyond filmscript any other
partially structured, time-ordered, sequence of text segments. In particular we
develop an innovative approach to plot characterization.
