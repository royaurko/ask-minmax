Towards the end of the BeppoSAX mission, the only operated Narrow Field
Instrument was the PDS, which covers the energy range 13-300 keV. Two blazars,
1ES 0507-040 (z=0.304) and PKS 1229-021 (z= 1.045), suitably located in the sky
for BeppoSAX pointing, were observed for about 2 days each in Spring 2002 with
the PDS and detected up to 50 keV. 1ES0507-040 had been already observed by the
BeppoSAX NFIs at an earlier epoch for a much shorter time. We have re-analysed
those data as well, and identified a possible contamination problem in the PDS
spectrum. We present our recent PDS data on both sources, combined with the
previous BeppoSAX data and with non-simultaneous observations at other
frequencies. The derived Spectral Energy Distributions allow us to discuss the
origin of the high energy component.
