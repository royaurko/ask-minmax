PDF model calculations have been performed of the Cabra lifted hydrogen flame
in a vitiated co-flow. Particle trajectories are extracted from the Lagrangian
particle method used to solve the modeled PDF equation. The particle
trajectories in the mixture fraction-temperature plane reveal (at successive
downstream locations): essentially inert mixing between the cold fuel jet and
the hot co-flow; the auto-ignition of very lean particles; and, subsequent
mixing and reaction, leading to near-equilibrium compositions. The purpose of
this paper is to present animations of the particle trajectories obtained using
different turbulent mixing models.
