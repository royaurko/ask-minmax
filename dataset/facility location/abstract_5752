We studied 11 compact high-velocity clouds (CHVCs) in the 21-cm line emission
of neutral hydrogen with the 100-m telescope in Effelsberg. We find that most
of our CHVCs are not spherically-symmetric as we would expect in case of a
non-interacting, intergalactic population. Instead, many CHVCs reveal a complex
morphology suggesting that they are disturbed by ram-pressure interaction with
an ambient medium. Thus, CHVCs are presumably located in the neighborhood of
the Milky Way instead of being spread across the entire Local Group.
