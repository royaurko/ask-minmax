Delayed detonation in an exploding white dwarf, which propagates from an
off-center transition point, rather than from a spherical transition shell, is
described and simulated. The differences between the results of 2D simulations
and the 1D case are presented and discussed. The two dimensional effects become
significant in transition density below 3.e7 g/cm^3, where the energetics, the
production of Fe group elements and the symmetry of the explosion are all
affected. In the 2D case the explosion is less energetic and less Ni is
produced in the detonation phase of the explosion. For low transition density
the reduction in Ni mass can reach 20-30 percent. The asymmetry in abundances
between regions close to the transition point and regions far from that point
is large, and could be a source to polarization patterns in the emitted light.
We conclude that the spatial and temporal distribution of transition locations,
is an important parameter which must be included in delayed detonation models
for Type Ia supernovae. \
