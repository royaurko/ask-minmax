We use published ROSAT observations of the X-ray Nova V1974 Cygni 1992 to
test a model for interstellar dust, consisting of a mixture of carbonaceous
grains and silicate grains. The time-dependent X-ray emission from the nova is
modelled, and X-ray scattering is calculated for a dust mixture with a
realistic size distribution. Model results are compared with the scattered
X-ray halos measured by ROSAT at 9 epochs. The observed X-ray halos are
consistent with the halos calculated for the size distribution of Weingartner &
Draine which reproduces the Milky Way extinction with R_V=3.1, provided that
the reddening E(B-V) approx 0.20, consistent with E(B-V) = 0.19 inferred from
the late-time Balmer decrement. The time delay of the scattered halo relative
to the direct flux from the nova is clearly detected.
  Models with smoothly-distributed dust give good overall agreement with the
observed scattering halo, but tend to produce somewhat more scattering than
observed at 200-300", and insufficient scattering at 50-100". While an
additional population of large grains can increase the scattered intensity at
50-100", this could also be achieved by having ~30% of the dust in a cloud at a
distance from us equal to ~95% of the distance to the nova. Such a model also
improves agreement with the data at larger angles, and illustrates the
sensitivity of X-ray scattering halos to the location of the dust. The
observations therefore do not require a population of micron-sized dust grains.
