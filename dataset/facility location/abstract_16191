The International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) is discovering
hundreds of new hard X-ray sources, many of which remain unidentified. We
report on optical spectroscopy of five such sources for which X-ray
observations at lower energies (~0.5-10 keV) and higher angular resolutions
than INTEGRAL have allowed for unique optical counterparts to be located. We
find that IGR J16426+6536 and IGR J22292+6647 are Type 1 Seyfert active
galactic nuclei (with IGR J16426+6536 further classified as a Seyfert 1.5)
which have redshifts of z=0.323 and z=0.113, respectively. IGR J18308-1232 is
identified as a cataclysmic variable (CV), and we confirm a previous
identification of IGR J19267+1325 as a magnetic CV. IGR J18214-1318 is
identified as an obscured high mass X-ray binary (HMXB), which are systems
thought to have a compact object embedded in the stellar wind of a massive
star. We combine Chandra fluxes with distances based on the optical
observations to calculate X-ray luminosities of the HMXB and CVs, finding
L_(0.3-10 keV)=5e36 erg s^-1 for IGR J18214-1318, L_(0.3-10 keV)=1.3e32 erg
s^-1 for IGR J18308-1232, and L_(0.3-10 keV)=6.7e32 erg s^-1 for IGR
J19267+1325.
