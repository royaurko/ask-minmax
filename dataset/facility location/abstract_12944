The rapid development in information technology has immensely contributed to
the use of modern approaches for visualizing volumetric data. Consequently,
medical volume visualization is increasingly attracting attention towards
achieving an effective visualization algorithm for medical diagnosis and
pre-treatment planning. Previously, research has been addressing implementation
of algorithm that can visualize 2-D images into 3-D. Meanwhile, achieving such
a rendering algorithm at an interactive speed and of good robustness to handle
mass data still remains a challenging issue. However, in medical diagnosis,
finding the exact location of brain tumor or diseases is an important step of
surgery / disease management. This paper proposes a GPU-based raycasting
algorithm for accurate allocation and localization of human brain abnormalities
using magnetic resonance (MRI) images of normal and abnormal patients.
