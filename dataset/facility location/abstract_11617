It has long been asserted that proteins like transcription factors may locate
their target in DNA sequences at rates that surpass by several orders of
magnitude the three-dimensional diffusion limit thank to facilitated diffusion,
that is the combination of one-dimensional (sliding along the DNA) and
three-dimensional diffusion. This claim has been supported along the years by
several mass action kinetic models, while the dynamical model we proposed
recently (J. Chem. Phys. 130, 015103 (2009)) suggests that acceleration of
targeting due to facilitated diffusion cannot be large. In order to solve this
apparent contradiction, we performed additional simulations to compare the
results obtained with our model to those obtained with the kinetic model of
Klenin et al (Phys. Rev. Letters 96, 018104 (2006)). We show in this paper that
the two models actually support each other and agree in predicting a low
efficiency for facilitated diffusion. Extrapolation of these results to real
systems even indicates that facilitated diffusion necessarily slows down the
targeting process compared to three-dimensional diffusion.
