Super-Kamiokande is a 50 kiloton water Cherenkov detector located at the
Kamioka Observatory of the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research, University of
Tokyo. It was designed to study neutrino oscillations and carry out searches
for the decay of the nucleon. The Super-Kamiokande experiment began in 1996 and
in the ensuing decade of running has produced extremely important results in
the fields of atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations, along with setting
stringent limits on the decay of the nucleon and the existence of dark matter
and astrophysical sources of neutrinos. Perhaps most crucially,
Super-Kamiokande for the first time definitively showed that neutrinos have
mass and undergo flavor oscillations. This chapter will summarize the published
scientific output of the experiment with a particular emphasis on the
atmospheric neutrino results.
