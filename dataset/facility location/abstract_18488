The Century Survey Galactic Halo Project is a photometric and spectroscopic
survey from which we select relatively blue stars (V-R<0.30 mag) as probes of
the Milky Way halo. The Survey strip spans the range of Galactic latitude
35<b<88 deg, allowing us to study the nature of populations of stars and their
systematic motions as a function of Galactic latitude. One of our primary goals
is to use blue horizontal-branch stars to trace potential star streams in the
halo, and to test the hierarchical model for the formation of the Galaxy.
  In this paper we discuss spectroscopy and multi-passband photometry for a
sample of 764 blue stars in the Century Survey region. Our sample consists
predominantly of A- and F-type stars. We describe our techniques for
determination of radial velocities, effective temperatures, metallicities, and
surface gravities. Based on these measurements, we derive distance estimates by
comparison with a set of calibrated isochrones. We devote special attention to
the classification of blue horizontal-branch stars, and compare the results
obtained from the application of the techniques of Kinman et al., Wilhelm et
al., and Clewley et al. We identify 55 blue horizontal-branch stars. Our large
sample of stars also uncovers a number of unusual objects, including three
carbon-enhanced stars, a late B-type star located 0.8 kpc above the Galactic
plane, and a DZ white dwarf.
