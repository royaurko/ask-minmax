We present results of B -> vector-vector (VV) and B -> vector-axial vector
(VA) decays B0 -> phi X (X = phi, rho+ or rho0), B+ -> phi K(*)+, B0 -> K*K*,
B0 -> rho+b_1- and B+ -> K*0a_1+. The largest dataset used for these results is
based on 465 * 10^6 Y(4S) -> BB decays, collected with the BABAR detector at
the PEP-II B meson factory located at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC).
