We consider the fundamental problem of charged particles moving along and
around a curved magnetic field line, revising the synchro-curvature radiation
formulae introduced by Cheng and Zhang (1996). We provide more compact
expressions to evaluate the spectrum emitted by a single particle, identifying
the key parameter that controls the transition between the curvature-dominated
and the synchrotron-dominated regime. This parameter depends on the local
radius of curvature of the magnetic field line, the gyration radius, and the
pitch angle. We numerically solve the equations of motion for the emitting
particle by considering self-consistently the radiative losses, and provide the
radiated spectrum produced by a particle when an electric acceleration is
balanced by its radiative losses, as it is assumed to happen in the outer gaps
of pulsar's magnetospheres. We compute the average spectrum radiated throughout
the particle trajectory finding that the slope of the spectrum before the peak
depends on the location and size of the emission region. We show how this
effect could then lead to a variety of synchro-curvature spectra. Our results
reinforce the idea that the purely synchrotron or curvature losses are, in
general, inadequate to describe the radiative reaction on the particle motion,
and the spectrum of emitted photons. Finally, we discuss the applicability of
these calculations to different astrophysical scenarios.
