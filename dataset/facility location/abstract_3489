MEMS storage devices are new non-volatile secondary storages that have
outstanding advantages over magnetic disks. MEMS storage devices, however, are
much different from magnetic disks in the structure and access characteristics.
They have thousands of heads called probe tips and provide the following two
major access facilities: (1) flexibility: freely selecting a set of probe tips
for accessing data, (2) parallelism: simultaneously reading and writing data
with the set of probe tips selected. Due to these characteristics, it is
nontrivial to find data placements that fully utilize the capability of MEMS
storage devices. In this paper, we propose a simple logical model called the
Region-Sector (RS) model that abstracts major characteristics affecting data
retrieval performance, such as flexibility and parallelism, from the physical
MEMS storage model. We also suggest heuristic data placement strategies based
on the RS model and derive new data placements for relational data and
two-dimensional spatial data by using those strategies. Experimental results
show that the proposed data placements improve the data retrieval performance
by up to 4.0 times for relational data and by up to 4.8 times for
two-dimensional spatial data of approximately 320 Mbytes compared with those of
existing data placements. Further, these improvements are expected to be more
marked as the database size grows.
