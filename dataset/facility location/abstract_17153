We study the effect of ultra-high energy particles collisions near the black
hole horizon (BSW effect) for two scenarios: when one of particle either (i)
moves on a circular orbit or (ii) plunges from it towards the horizon. It is
shown that such circular near-horizon orbits can exist for near-extremal black
holes only. This includes the innermost stable orbit (ISCO), marginally bound
orbit (MBO) and photon one (PhO). We consider generic "dirty" rotating black
holes not specifying the metric and show that the energy in the centre of mass
frame has the universal scaling dependence on the surface gravity $\kappa $.
Namely, $E_{c.m.}\sim \kappa ^{-n}$ where for the ISCO $n=1/3$ in case (i) or
$n=1/2$ in case (ii). For the MBO and PhCO $n=1/2$ in both scenarios that
agrees with recent calculations of Harada and Kimura for the Kerr metric. We
also generalize the Grib and Pavlov's observations made for the Kerr metric.
The magnitude of the BSW effect on the location of collision has a somewhat
paradoxical character: it is decreasing when approaching the horizon.
