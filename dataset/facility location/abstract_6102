The scalar-isoscalar propagator of the effective linear $\sigma$ model of
meson dynamics is investigated with the help of an expansion in the number of
the Goldstone bosons. A generic scenario is suggested for the temperature and
density driven evolution of its pole in the second Riemann sheet. An extended
temperature range, correlated with characteristic pole locations, is found
where the phenomenon of threshold enhancement takes place in the corresponding
spectral function.
