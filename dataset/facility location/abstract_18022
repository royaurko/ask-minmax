IRC+10216 is a circumstellar envelope around a carbon-rich evolved star which
contains a large variety of molecules. According to interferometric
observations, molecules are distributed either concentrated around the central
star or as a hollow shell with a radius of 15". We present ALMA Cycle 0 band 6
observations of the J=14-13 rotational transition of CH3CN in IRC+10216,
obtained with an angular resolution of 0.76x0.61. The bulk of the emission is
distributed as a hollow shell located at just 2" from the star, with a void of
emission in the central region up to a radius of 1". This spatial distribution
is markedly different from those found to date in this source for other
molecules. Our analysis indicate that methyl cyanide is not formed neither in
the stellar photosphere nor far in the outer envelope, but at radial distances
as short as 1-2", reaching a maximum abundance of 5e-8 with respect to H2 at
about 6" from the star. Standard chemical models of IRC+10216 predict that
CH3CN should form farther out in the envelope, at a radius of 15", as other
species such as polyyne radicals and cyanopolyynes. We discuss possible
mechanims able to bring the region of formation of CH3CN to shorter radii.
