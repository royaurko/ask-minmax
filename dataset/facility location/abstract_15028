We attempt to explain the properties of the Becklin-Neugebauer (BN) object as
a runaway B star, as originally proposed by Plambeck et al. (1995). This is one
of the best-studied bright infrared sources, located in the Orion Nebula
Cluster -- an important testing ground for massive star formation theories.
  From radio observations of BN's proper motion, we trace its trajectory back
to Trapezium star theta^1C, the most massive (45 Msun) in the cluster and a
relatively tight (17 AU) visual binary with a B star secondary. This origin
would be the most recent known runaway B star ejection event, occurring only
\~4000 yr ago and providing a unique test of models of ejection from multiple
systems of massive stars. Although highly obscured, we can constrain BN's mass
(~7 Msun) from both its bolometric luminosity and the recoil of theta^1C.
Interaction of a runaway B star with dense ambient gas should produce a compact
wind bow shock. We suggest that X-ray emission from this shocked gas may have
been seen by Chandra: the offset from the radio position is ~300 AU in the
direction of BN's motion. Given this model, we constrain the ambient density,
wind mass-loss rate and wind velocity. BN made closest approach to the massive
protostar, source ``I'', 500 yr ago. This may have triggered enhanced accretion
and thus outflow, consistent with previous interpretations of the outflow being
a recent (~10^3 yr) "explosive" event.
