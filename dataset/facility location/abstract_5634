Previous attempts at disturbing the galactic disk by the Magellanic Clouds
relied on direct tidal forcing. However, by allowing the halo to actively
respond rather than remain a rigid contributor to the rotation curve, the
Clouds may produce a wake in the halo which then distorts the disk. Recent work
reported here suggests that the Magellanic Clouds use this mechanism to produce
disk distortions sufficient to account for both the radial location, position
angle and sign of the HI warp and observed anomalies in stellar kinematics
towards the galactic anticenter and LSR motion.
