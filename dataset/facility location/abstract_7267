We report the results of two XMM-Newton observations of the ultra-compact
low-mass X-ray binary 4U1850-087 located in the galactic globular cluster
NGC6712. A broad emission feature at 0.7keV was detected in an earlier ASCA
observation and explained as the result of an unusual Ne/O abundance ratio in
the absorbing material local to the source. We find no evidence for this
feature and derive Ne/O ratios in the range 0.14-0.21, consistent with that of
the interstellar medium. During the second observation, when the source was 10%
more luminous, there is some evidence for a slightly higher Ne/O ratio and
additional absorption. Changes in the Ne/O abundance ratio have been detected
from another ultra-compact binary, 4U1543-624. We propose that these changes
result from an X-ray induced wind which is evaporated from an O and Ne rich
degenerate donor. As the source X-ray intensity increases so does the amount of
evaporation and hence the column densities and abundance ratio of Ne and O.
