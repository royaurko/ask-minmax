The favored theoretical explanation for giant planet formation -- in both our
solar system and others -- is the core accretion model (although it still has
some serious difficulties). In this scenario, planetesimals accumulate to build
up planetary cores, which then accrete nebular gas. With current opacity
estimates for protoplanetary envelopes, this model predicts the formation of
Jupiter-mass planets in 2--3 Myr at 5 AU around solar-mass stars, provided that
the surface density of solids is enhanced over that of the minimum-mass solar
nebula (by a factor of a few). Working within the core-accretion paradigm, this
paper presents theoretical calculations which show that the formation of
Jupiter-mass planets orbiting M dwarf stars is seriously inhibited at all
radial locations (in sharp contrast to solar-type stars). Planet detection
programs sensitive to companions of M dwarfs will test this prediction in the
near future.
