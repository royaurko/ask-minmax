The observed size distribution of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs)--small icy and
rocky solar system bodies orbiting beyond Neptune--is well described by a power
law at large KBO sizes. However, recent work by Bernstein et al. (2003)
indicates that the size spectrum breaks and becomes shallower for KBOs smaller
than about 70 km in size. Here we show that we expect such a break at KBO
radius ~40 km since destructive collisions are frequent for smaller KBOs.
Specifically, we assume that KBOs are rubble piles with low material strength
rather than solid monoliths. This gives a power-law slope q~3 where the number
N(r) of KBOs larger than a size r is given by $N(r) \propto r^{1-q}$; the break
location follows from this slope through a self-consistent calculation. The
existence of this break, the break's location, and the power-law slope we
expect below the break are consistent with the findings of Bernstein et al.
(2003). The agreement with observations indicates that KBOs are effectively
strengthless rubble piles.
