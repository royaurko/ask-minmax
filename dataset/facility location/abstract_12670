A new method for constructing exact inhomogeneous universes is presented,
that allows variation in 3 dimensions. The resulting spacetime may be
statistically uniform on average, or have random, non-repeating variation. The
construction utilises the Darmois junction conditions to join many different
component spacetime regions. In the initial simple example given, the component
parts are spatially flat and uniform, but much more general combinations should
be possible. Further inhomogeneity may be added via swiss cheese vacuoles and
inhomogeneous metrics. This model is used to explore the proposal, that
observers are located in bound, non-expanding regions, while the universe is
actually in the process of becoming void dominated, and thus its average
expansion rate is increasing. The model confirms qualitatively that the faster
expanding components come to dominate the average, and that inhomogeneity
results in average parameters which evolve differently from those of any one
component, but more realistic modelling of the effect will need this
construction to be generalised.
