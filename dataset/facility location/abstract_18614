We carried out a multifrequency and multiepoch study of the highly polarized
quasar, PKS 1502+106 at radio frequencies. The analysis is based on an EVN
dataset at 5 GHz, archive VLBA datasets at 2.3, 8.3, 24.4 and 43.1 GHz and an
archive MERLIN dataset at 5 GHz. The various datasets span over a period of 10
years. The source is characterized by a multi-component one-sided jet at all
epochs. The VLBI images show that a complex curved jet is located to the
southeast and east of the core, with the position angle (PA) of the jet axis
wiggling between 80 deg and 130 deg. The MERLIN image reveals that the jet
extends to 0.6 arcsec at a PA 135+-12 degr. The radio core in the VLBI images
has a brightness temperature approaching the equipartition limit, indicating
highly relativistic plasma beamed towards us. Delta PA in the source, the
misalignment of the kpc- and pc-scale radio structure, is estimated about 32
degr, suggesting that PKS 1502+106 belongs to the aligned population. Four
superluminal components are detected in the parsec scale jet, whose velocities
are 24.2 h{-1}c, 14.3 h{-1}c, 6.8 h{-1}c and 18.1 h{-1}c. Our analysis supports
the idea that the relativistic jet in PKS 1502+106 is characterised by extreme
beaming and that its radio properties are similar to those of gamma-ray loud
sources.
