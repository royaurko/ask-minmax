We present results of performance modelling for METIS, the Mid-infrared
European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) Imager and Spectrograph. Designed by
a consortium of NOVA (Netherlands), UK Astronomy Technology Centre (UK), MPIA
Heidelberg (Germany), CEA Saclay (France) and KU Leuven (Belgium), METIS will
cover the atmospheric windows in L, M and N-band and will offer imaging,
medium-resolution slit spectroscopy (R~1000-3000) and high-resolution integral
field spectroscopy (R~100,000). Our model uses a detailed set of input
parameters for site characteristics and atmospheric profiles, optical design,
thermal background and the most up-to-date IR detector specifications. We show
that METIS will bring an orders-of-magnitude level improvement in sensitivity
and resolution over current ground-based IR facilities, bringing mid-IR
sensitivities to the micro-Jansky regime. As the only proposed E-ELT instrument
to cover this entire spectral region, and the only mid-IR high-resolution
integral field unit planned on the ground or in space, METIS will open up a
huge discovery space in IR astronomy in the next decade.
