It has recently been suggested that the stars in a vertical extension of the
red clump feature seen in LMC color-magnitude diagrams could belong to a tidal
stream of material located in front of that galaxy. If this claim is correct,
this foreground concentration of stars could contribute significantly to the
rate of gravitational microlensing events observed in the LMC microlensing
experiments. Here we present radial velocity measurements of stars in this
so-called ``vertical red clump'' (VRC) population. The observed stellar sample,
it transpires, has typical LMC kinematics. It is shown that it is improbable
that an intervening tidal stream should have the same distribution of radial
velocities as the LMC, which is consistent with an earlier study that showed
that the VRC feature is more likely a young stellar population in the main body
of that galaxy. However, the kinematic data do not discriminate against the
possibility that the VRC is an LMC halo population.
