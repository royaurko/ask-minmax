We review Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) afterglow follow-up observations being
carried out by our group in Korea. We have been performing GRB follow-up
observations using the 4-m UKIRT in Hawaii, the 2.1-m telescope at the McDonald
observatory in Texas, the 1.5-m telescope at Maidanak observatory in
Uzbekistan, the 1.8-m telescope Mt. Bohyun Optical Astronomy Observatory (BOAO)
in Korea, and the 1.0-m remotely operated telescope in Mt. Lemmon, Arizona. We
outline our facilities, and present highlights of our work, including the
studies of high redshift GRBs at z > 5, and several other interesting bursts.
