One hundred and forty six long-period red variable stars in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) from the three year MOA project database were analysed.
A careful periodic analysis was performed on these stars and a catalogue of
their magnitudes, colours, periods and amplitudes is presented. We convert our
blue and red magnitudes to $K$ band values using 19 oxygen-rich stars. A group
of red short-period stars separated from the Mira sequence has been found on a
(log P, K) diagram. They are located at the short period side of the Mira
sequence consistent with the work of Wood and Sebo (1996). There are two
interpretations for such stars; a difference in pulsation mode or a difference
in chemical composition. We investigated the properties of these stars together
with their colour, amplitude and periodicity. We conclude that they have small
amplitudes and less regular variability. They are likely to be higher mode
pulsators. A large scatter has been also found on the long period side of the
(log P, K) diagram. This is possibly a systematic spread given that the blue
band of our photometric system covers both standard B and V bands and affects
carbon-rich stars.
