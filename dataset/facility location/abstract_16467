We investigate the angular and spatial distributions of protons of the energy
of 0.223 MeV after channeling through an (11,~9) single-wall carbon nanotube of
the length of 0.2 $\mu$m. The proton incident angle is varied between 0 and 10
mrad, being close to the critical angle for channeling. We show that, as the
proton incident angle increases and approaches the critical angle for
channeling, a ring-like structure is developed in the angular distribution -
donut effect. We demonstrate that it is the rainbow effect. When the proton
incident angle is between zero and a half of the critical angle for channeling,
the image force affects considerably the number and positions of the maxima of
the angular and spatial distributions. However, when the proton incident angle
is close to the critical angle for channeling, its influence on the angular and
spatial distributions is reduced strongly. We demonstrate that the increase of
the proton incident angle can lead to a significant rearrangement of the
propagating protons within the nanotube. This effect may be used to locate
atomic impurities in nanotubes as well as for creating nanosized proton beams
to be used in materials science, biology and medicine.
