A computer program is described to calculate momentum distributions in
stripping and diffraction dissociation reactions. A Glauber model is used with
the scattering wavefunctions calculated in the eikonal approximation. The
program is appropriate for knockout reactions at intermediate energy collisions
(30 MeV $\leq$ E$_{lab}/$nucleon $\leq 2000$ MeV). It is particularly useful
for reactions involving unstable nuclear beams, or exotic nuclei (e.g.
neutron-rich nuclei), and studies of single-particle occupancy probabilities
(spectroscopic factors) and other related physical observables. Such studies
are an essential part of the scientific program of radioactive beam facilities,
as in for instance the proposed RIA (Rare Isotope Accelerator) facility in the
US.
