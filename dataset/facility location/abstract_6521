The first VERITAS telescope was installed in 2002-2003 at the Fred Lawrence
Whipple Observatory and was originally operated as a prototype instrument.
Subsequently the decision was made to locate the full array at the same site,
resulting in an asymmetric array layout. As anticipated, this resulted in less
than optimal sensitivity due to the loss in effective area and the increase in
background due to local muon initiated triggers. In the summer of 2009, the
VERITAS collaboration relocated Telescope 1 to improve the overall array
layout. This has provided a 30% improvement in sensitivity corresponding to a
60% change in the time needed to detect a source.
