Collision process between breather and moving kink-soliton is investigated
both analytically and numerically in Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) chains. As it is
shown by both analytical and numerical consideration low amplitude breathers
and soft kinks retain their shapes after interaction. Low amplitude breather
only changes the location after collision and remains static. As the numerical
simulations show, the shift of its position is proportional to the stiffness of
the kink-soliton, what is in accordance with the analytical predictions made in
this paper. The numerical experiments are also carried out for large amplitude
breathers and some interesting effects are observed: The odd parity large
amplitude breather does not change position when colliding with widely
separated soft kink-antikink pair, whilst in the case of closely placed
kink-antikink pair the breather transforms into the moving one. Therefore it is
suggested that the "harmless" objects similar to the kink-solitons in FPU
chains could be used in order to displace or move the strongly localized
structures in realistic physical systems. In particular, the analogies with
quasi-one dimensional easy-plane type spin structures are discussed.
