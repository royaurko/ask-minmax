Absolute cross sections for the K-shell photoionization of C-like nitrogen
ions were measured by employing the ion-photon merged-beam technique at the
SOLEIL synchrotron radiation facility in Saint-Aubin, France. High-resolution
spectroscopy with E/$\Delta$E $\approx$ 7,000 was achieved with the photon
energy from 388 to 430 eV scanned with a band pass of 300 meV, and the 399.4 to
402 eV range with 60 meV.
  Experimental results are compared with theoretical predictions made from the
multi-configuration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) and R-matrix methods. The interplay
between experiment and theory enabled the identification and characterization
of the strong 1s $\rightarrow$ 2p resonances observed in the spectra.
