Some 8000 images obtained with the SECIS fast-frame CCD camera instrument
located at Lusaka, Zambia, during the total eclipse of 21 June 2001 have been
analyzed to search for short-period oscillations in intensity that could be a
signature of solar coronal heating mechanisms by MHD wave dissipation. Images
were taken in white- light and Fe XIV green-line (5303 A) channels over 205
seconds (frame rate 39 s-1), approximately the length of eclipse totality at
this location, with a pixel size of four arcseconds square. The data are of
considerably better quality than were obtained during the 11 August 1999 total
eclipse, observed by us (Rudawy et al.: Astron. Astrophys. 416, 1179, 2004), in
that the images are much better exposed and enhancements in the drive system of
the heliostat used gave a much improved image stability. Classical Fourier and
wavelet techniques have been used to analyze the emission at 29518 locations,
of which 10714 had emission at reasonably high levels, searching for periodic
fluctuations with periods in the range 0.1-17 seconds (frequencies 0.06-10 Hz).
While a number of possible periodicities were apparent in the wavelet analysis,
none of the spatially and time-limited periodicities in the local brightness
curves was found to be physically important. This implies that the pervasive
Alfven wave-like phenomena (Tomczyk et al.: Science 317, 1192, 2007) using
polarimetric observations with the CoMP instrument do not give rise to
significant oscillatory intensity fluctuations.
