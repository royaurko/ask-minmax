Dark matter, a conjectured substance not directly observable but which has
tremendous mass, was proposed to explain why galaxies hold together and rotate
faster at their edges than predicted by Newton's Inverse Square (1/r2) Law of
Gravity. Here we propose an alternative, an Inverse Law (1/r), which explains
galactic morphology and rotation without dark matter. By varying initial
conditions, the Inverse Law can systematically and easily generate realistic
galactic formations including spirals, cartwheels (extremely difficult under
Newtonian gravity), bars, rings, and spokes. This model can also produce
filaments and void structures reminiscent of the large-scale structure of the
universe. Newtonian gravity cannot do all this without dark matter. Occam's
Razor suggests that at galactic scales, gravity should be 1/r and dark matter
is unnecessary. This simple model with its self-organizing emergent properties,
combined with dynamical systems theory, has broader implications. It may help
us understand more complex systems.
