We have analysed the early LHC signatures of the minimal supergravity
(mSUGRA) model. Our emphasis is on the 7 - $TeV$ run corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of $\sim 1.0 ~fb^{-1}$ although we have also discussed
briefly the prospects at LHC-10 $TeV$. We focus on the parameter space yielding
relatively light squark and gluinos consistent with the darkmatter relic
density data and the LEP bounds on the lightest Higgs scalar mass. This
parameter space is only allowed for non-vanishing trilinear soft breaking term
$A_0$. A significant region of the parameter space with large to moderate
negative values of $A_0$ consistent with the stability of the scalar potential
and relic density production via neutralino annihilation and/or neutralino -
stau coannihilation yields observable signal via the jets + missing transverse
energy channel. The one lepton + jets + missing energy signal is also viable
over a smaller but non-trivial parameter space. The ratio of the size of the
two signals - free from theoretical uncertainties - may distinguish between
different relic density generating mechanisms. With efficient $\tau$-tagging
facilities at 7 $TeV$ the discriminating power may increase significantly. We
also comment on other dark matter relic density allowed mSUGRA scenarios and
variants there of in the context of LHC-7 $TeV$.
