We show that the surface of an $s$-wave superconductor decorated with a
two-dimensional lattice of magnetic impurities can exhibit chiral topological
superconductivity. If impurities order ferromagnetically and the
superconducting surface supports a sufficiently strong Rashba-type spin-orbit
coupling, Shiba sub-gap states at impurity locations can hybridize into
Bogoliubov bands with non-vanishing, sometimes large, Chern number $C$. This
topological superconductor supports $C$ chiral Majorana edge modes. We
construct phase diagrams for model two-dimensional superconductors, accessing
the dilute and dense magnetic impurity limits analytically and the intermediate
regime numerically. To address potential experimental systems, we identify
stable configurations of ferromagnetic iron atoms on the Pb (111) surface and
conclude that ferromagnetic adatoms on Pb surfaces can provide a versatile
platform for two-dimensional topological superconductivity.
