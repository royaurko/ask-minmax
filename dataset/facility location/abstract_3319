We have investigated a single crystal of CeAgSb2 using low field
ac-susceptibility, thermal expansion and magnetostriction measurements in the
temperature range 1.5K to 90K. The ac-susceptibility exhibits a sharp peak at
9.7K for both B//c and B perp c due to the magnetic ordering of the Ce moment.
The thermal expansion coefficient alpha, exhibits highly anisotropic behaviour
between 3K and 80K : alpha is positive for dL/L perp c, but negative for dL/L
// c. Furthermore, alpha (for dL/L) perp c (i.e. in ab-plane) exhibits a sharp
peak at TN followed by a broad maximum at 20K, while a sharp negative peak at
TN followed by a minimum at 20K has been observed for (dL/L //) the c
direction. The observed maximum and minimum in alpha(T) at 20K have been
attributed to the crystalline field effect on the J=5/2 state of the Ce3+ ion.
The magnetostriction also exhibits anisotropic behaviour with a large
magnetostriction along the c-axis. The ab-plane magnetostriction exhibits a
peak at B=3.3T at 3K, which is consistent with the observed peak in the
magnetoresistance measurements.
