We use a method based on the division algorithm to determine all the values
of the real parameters $b$ and $c$ for which the hypergeometric polynomials
$_2F_1(-n, b; c; z)$ have $n$ real, simple zeros. Furthermore, we use the
quasi-orthogonality of Jacobi polynomials to determine the intervals on the
real line where the zeros are located.
