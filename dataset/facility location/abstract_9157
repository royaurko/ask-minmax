This paper examines how type I planet migration is affected by the presence
of turbulent density fluctuations in the circumstellar disk. For type I
migration, the planet does not clear a gap in the disk and its secular motion
is driven by torques generated by the wakes it creates in the surrounding disk
fluid. MHD turbulence creates additional density perturbations that
gravitationally interact with the planet and can dominate the torques produced
by the migration mechanism itself. This paper shows that conventional type I
migration can be readily overwhelmed by turbulent perturbations and hence the
usual description of type I migration should be modified in locations where the
magnetorotational instability is active. In general, the migrating planet does
not follow a smooth inward trned, but rather exhibits a random walk through
phase space. Our main conclusion is that MHD turbulence will alter the time
scales for type I planet migration and -- because of chaos -- requires the time
scales to be described by a distribution of values.
