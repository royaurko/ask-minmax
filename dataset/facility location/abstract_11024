We have performed ab initio calculations to systematically investigate
electronic properties and magnetism of insulating non-magnetic beryllium
monoxide nanotubes induced by non-magnetic sp impurities: boron, carbon and
nitrogen. We found that in the presence of these sp impurities, which replace
oxygen atoms, the non-magnetic BeO NTs transform into magnetic semiconductors,
which acquire magnetization caused by spin splitting of (B,C,N) 2p states
located in the forbidden gap of a BeO tube. The magnetic moments of the
impurities vary from 0.65 to 1.60. On the contrary, when (B,C,N) dopants
substitute for Be atoms or in the presence of an oxygen vacancy, the
nonmagnetic state of the BeO tubes is retained.
