Adopting a zonal structure of electricity market requires specification of
zones' borders. In this paper we use social welfare as the measure to assess
quality of various zonal divisions. The social welfare is calculated by Market
Coupling algorithm. The analyzed divisions are found by the usage of extended
Locational Marginal Prices (LMP) methodology presented in paper [1], which
takes into account variable weather conditions. The offered method of
assessment of a proposed division of market into zones is however not limited
to LMP approach but can evaluate the social welfare of divisions obtained by
any methodology.
