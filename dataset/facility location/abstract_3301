This letter reports rich X-ray jet structures found in the Chandra
observation of PKS 1055+201. In addition to an X-ray jet coincident with the
radio jet we detect a region of extended X-ray emission surrounding the jet as
far from the core as the radio hotspot to the North, and a similar extended
X-ray region along the presumed path of the unseen counterjet to the Southern
radio lobe. Both X-ray regions show a similar curvature to the west, relative
to the quasar. We interpret this as the first example where we separately
detect the X-ray emission from a narrow jet and extended, residual jet plasma
over the entire length of a powerful FRII jet.
