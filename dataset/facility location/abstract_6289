The scales of the Standard Model correspond to the positions of domain wall
intersections on a straight line in a noncompact two-dimensional extra space.
The domain walls partition an Anti-de Sitter spacetime. We show that domain
wall intersections mark the orthogonal intersections of 1-cycles winding around
a rectangular compact space and a hierarchy of subspaces, and that the
noncompact extra space of the model is a covering space. 4-branes wrap 1-cycles
of the compact spaces and intersect orthogonally in 3-branes, upon which the
particles propagate. We show that particles are located precisely at domain
wall intersections in the covering space.
