Based on a detailed study of the temperature structure of the intracluster
medium in the halo of M~87, abundance profiles of 7 elements, O, Mg, Si, S, Ar,
Ca, and Fe are derived. In addition, abundance ratios are derived from the
ratios of line strengths, whose temperature dependences are small within the
temperature range of the ICM of M~87. The abundances of Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe
show strong decreasing gradients outside 2$'$ and become nearly constant within
the radius at $\sim1.5$ solar. The Fe/Si ratio is determined to be 0.9 solar
with no radial gradient. In contrast, the O abundance is less than a half of
the Si abundance at the center and has a flatter gradient. The Mg abundance is
$\sim$1 solar within 2$'$, which is close to stellar abundance within the same
radius. The O/Si/Fe pattern of M~87 is located at the simple extension of that
of Galactic stars. The observed Mg/O ratio is about 1.25 solar, which is also
the same ratio as for Galactic stars. The O/Si/Fe ratio indicates that the SN
Ia contribution to Si and Fe becomes important towards the center and SN Ia
products have similar abundances of Si and Fe at least around M~87, which may
reflect dimmer SN Ia observed in old stellar systems. The S abundance is
similar to the Si abundance at the center, but has a steeper gradient. This
result suggests that the S/Si ratio of SN II products is much smaller than the
solar ratio.
