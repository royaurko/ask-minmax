WASP0 is a prototype for what is intended to become a collection of WASPs
whose primary aim is to detect transiting extra-solar planets across the face
of their parent star. The WASP0 instrument is a wide-field (9-degree) 6.3cm
aperture F/2.8 Apogee 10 CCD camera (2Kx2K chip, 16-arcsec pixels). The camera
is mounted piggy-back on a commercial 10-inch Meade telescope. We present some
recent results from the WASP camera, including observations from La Palma of
the known transiting planet around HD 209458 and preliminary analysis of other
stars located in the same field. We also outline further problems which
restrict the ability to achieve photon limited precision with a wide-field
commercial CCD.
