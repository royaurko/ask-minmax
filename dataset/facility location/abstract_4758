A fluid droplet located on a super-hydrophobic surface makes contact with the
surface only at small isolated regions, and is mostly in contact with the
surrounding air. As a result, a fluid in motion near such a surface experiences
very low friction, and super-hydrophobic surfaces display strong drag-reduction
in the laminar regime. Here we consider theoretically a super-hydrophobic
surface composed of circular posts (so called fakir geometry) located on a
planar rectangular lattice. Using a superposition of point forces with suitably
spatially-dependent strength, we derive the effective surface slip length for a
planar shear flow on such a fakir surface as the solution to an infinite series
of linear equations. In the asymptotic limit of small surface coverage by the
posts, the series can be interpreted as Riemann sums, and the slip length can
be obtained analytically. For posts on a square lattice, our analytical results
are in excellent quantitative agreement with previous numerical computations.
