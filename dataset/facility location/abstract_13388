We develop stochastic mixed finite element methods for spatially adaptive
simulations of fluid-structure interactions when subject to thermal
fluctuations. To account for thermal fluctuations, we introduce a discrete
fluctuation-dissipation balance condition to develop compatible stochastic
driving fields for our discretization. We perform analysis that shows our
condition is sufficient to ensure results consistent with statistical
mechanics. We show the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution is invariant under the
stochastic dynamics of the semi-discretization. To generate efficiently the
required stochastic driving fields, we develop a Gibbs sampler based on
iterative methods and multigrid to generate fields with $O(N)$ computational
complexity. Our stochastic methods provide an alternative to uniform
discretizations on periodic domains that rely on Fast Fourier Transforms. To
demonstrate in practice our stochastic computational methods, we investigate
within channel geometries having internal obstacles and no-slip walls how the
mobility/diffusivity of particles depends on location. Our methods extend the
applicability of fluctuating hydrodynamic approaches by allowing for spatially
adaptive resolution of the mechanics and for domains that have complex
geometries relevant in many applications.
