The ARGO-YBJ experiment is a multipurpose detector exploiting the full
coverage approach at very high altitude. The apparatus, in stable data taking
since November 2007 with an energy threshold of a few hundreds of GeV and a
duty-cycle of about 90 %, is located at the YangBaJing Cosmic Ray Laboratory
(Tibet, P.R. China, 4300 m a.s.l., 606 g/cm2). A number of interesting results
are available in Cosmic Ray Physics and in Gamma Ray Astronomy after the first
3 years of stable data taking. In this paper Gamma-Ray Astronomy results are
summarized.
