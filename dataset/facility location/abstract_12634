Graphene nanogaps and nanopores show potential for the purpose of electrical
DNA sequencing, in particular because single-base resolution appears to be
readily achievable. Here, we evaluated from first principles the advantages of
a nanogap setup with functionalized graphene edges. To this end, we employed
density functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green's function method to
investigate the transverse conductance properties of the four nucleotides
occurring in DNA when located between the opposing functionalized graphene
electrodes. In particular, we determined the electrical tunneling current
variation as a function of the applied bias and the associated differential
conductance at a voltage which appears suitable to distinguish between the four
nucleotides. Intriguingly, we observe for one of the nucleotides a negative
differential resistance effect.
