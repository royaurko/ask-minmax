I review possible resolution of the $J/\psi (\psi^{\prime}) \to \rho-\pi$
puzzle based on two inputs: the relative phase between the one- photon and the
gluonic decay amplitudes, and a possible hadronic excess in the inclusive
nonelectromagnetic decay rate of $\psi^{\prime}$. The status of a universal
large phase here is examined for its meaning and implications (including those
for B-physics). Since the future of tau/charm facility(s) are again under
consideration together with a future anti-proton facility at GSI, I propose to
extend my review to include a broader discussion of charmonium physics.
Outstanding questions like the status of the $^{1}P_{1}$ state of charmonium,
measuring $D^{0}-\bar D^{0}$ mixing and relative strong phases, status of
molecular P(S) - wave charmonia will also be discussed amongst others.
