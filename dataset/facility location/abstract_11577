Institutions all over the world are continuously exploring ways to use ICT in
improving teaching and learning effectiveness. The use of course web pages,
discussion groups, bulletin boards, and e-mails have shown considerable impact
on teaching and learning in significant ways, across all disciplines. ELearning
has emerged as an alternative to traditional classroom-based education and
training and web lectures can be a powerful addition to traditional lectures.
They can even serve as a main content source for learning, provided users can
quickly navigate and locate relevant pages in a web lecture. A web lecture
consists of video and audio of the presenter and slides complemented with
screen capturing. In this paper, an automated approach for recording live
lectures and for browsing available web lectures for on-demand applications by
end users is presented.
