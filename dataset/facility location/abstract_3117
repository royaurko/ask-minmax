Recent advances in Distributed Computing highlight models and algorithms for
autonomous swarms of mobile robots that self-organise and cooperate to solve
global objectives. The overwhelming majority of works so far considers handmade
algorithms and proofs of correctness. This paper builds upon a previously
proposed formal framework to certify the correctness of impossibility results
regarding distributed algorithms that are dedicated to autonomous mobile robots
evolving in a continuous space. As a case study, we consider the problem of
gathering all robots at a particular location, not known beforehand. A
fundamental (but not yet formally certified) result, due to Suzuki and
Yamashita, states that this simple task is impossible for two robots executing
deterministic code and initially located at distinct positions. Not only do we
obtain a certified proof of the original impossibility result, we also get the
more general impossibility of gathering with an even number of robots, when any
two robots are possibly initially at the same exact location.
