The manner in which gas accretes and orbits within circumnuclear rings has
direct implications for the star formation process. In particular, gas may be
compressed and shocked at the inflow points, resulting in bursts of star
formation at these locations. Afterwards the gas and young stars move together
through the ring. In addition, star formation may occur throughout the ring, if
and when the gas reaches sufficient density to collapse under gravity. These
two scenarios for star formation in rings are often referred to as the `pearls
on a string' and `popcorn' paradigms. In this paper, we use new Herschel PACS
observations, obtained as part of the KINGFISH Open Time Key Program, along
with archival Spitzer and ground-based observations from the SINGS Legacy
project, to investigate the heating and cooling of the interstellar medium in
the nearby star-forming ring galaxy, NGC4736. By comparing spatially resolved
estimates of the stellar FUV flux available for heating, with the gas and dust
cooling derived from the FIR continuum and line emission, we show that while
star formation is indeed dominant at the inflow points in NGC 4736, additional
star formation is needed to balance the gas heating and cooling throughout the
ring. This additional component most likely arises from the general increase in
gas density in the ring over its lifetime. Our data provide strong evidence,
therefore, for a combination of the two paradigms for star formation in the
ring in NGC4736.
