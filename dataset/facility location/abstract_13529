We analyzed temporal and spectral properties, focusing on the short bursts,
for three anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) and soft gamma repeaters (SGRs),
including SGR 1806-20, 1E 1048-5937 and SGR 0501+4516. Using the data from
XMM-Newton, we located the short bursts by Bayesian blocks algorithm. The short
bursts' duration distributions for three sources were fitted by two lognormal
functions. The spectra of shorter bursts ($< 0.2~\rm s$) and longer bursts
($\geq 0.2~\rm s$) can be well fitted in two blackbody components model or
optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung model for SGR 0501+4516. We also found
that there is a positive correlation between the burst luminosity and the
persistent luminosity with a power law index $\gamma = 1.23 \pm 0.18 $. The
energy ratio of this persistent emission to the time averaged short bursts is
in the range of $10 - 10^3$, being comparable to the case in Type I X-ray
burst.
