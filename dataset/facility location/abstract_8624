Emission lines that trace elements subject to strong depletion onto grains
provide a means for probing the dust content of AGNs. Examples include infrared
[FeII] and optical [CaII] lines. The excitation mechanisms underlying the
[FeII] lines remain controversial, resulting in related disagreement over the
gas-phase abundance of iron in Seyfert narrow-line regions. In this
contribution we emphasize the utility of the [CaII] lines as a consistency test
for claims of grain destruction affecting the [FeII] lines. A search for [CaII]
emission in NGC 1068 at a location of strongest [FeII] emission along the radio
jet yields a strong upper limit, but no detection. This result suggests that
grains survive largely intact in a region that otherwise shows strong evidence
of shock processing.
