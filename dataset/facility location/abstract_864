New high current accelerator facilities like proposed for HIDIF or ESS
require a beam with a high brilliance. These beams can not be produced by a
single pass rf-linac. The increase in brightness in such a driver linac is done
by several funneling stages at low energies, in which two identically bunched
ion beams are combined into a single beam with twice the frequency current and
brightness. Our Two-Beam-RFQ funneling experiment is a setup of two ion
sources, a two beam RFQ, a funnel deflector and beam diagnostic equipment to
demonstrate funneling of ion beams as a model for the first funneling stage of
a HIIF driver. The progress of the funneling experiment and results of
simulations will be presented.
