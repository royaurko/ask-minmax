We use Ratner's theorem to compute the asymptotics of the number of
(cylinders of) periodic trajectories in a rectangle with a barrier, assuming
that the location p/q of the barrier is rational. We also show that as q tends
to infinity, the constant in the asymptotic formula tends to the constant for
the generic genus 2 flat surface.
