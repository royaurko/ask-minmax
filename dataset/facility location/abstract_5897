The model of dipole fluid for the ionic liquids similar to the molten NaCl is
proposed. The estimates for the critical parameters are obtained with the help
of the van der Waals equation of state. The influence of the rotation on the
characteristics of a dipole pair and the location of the critical point is
discussed. The dissociation of such fluid near the critical point is
considered.
