Bright point sources associated with extragalactic AGN and radio galaxies are
an important foreground for low frequency radio experiments aimed at detecting
the redshifted 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen during the epoch of
reionization. The frequency dependence of the synthesized beam implies that the
sidelobes of these sources will move across the field of view as a function of
observing frequency, hence frustrating line-of-sight foreground subtraction
techniques. We describe a method for subtracting these point sources from dirty
maps produced by an instrument such as the MWA. This technique combines matched
filters with an iterative centroiding scheme to locate and characterize point
sources in the presence of a diffuse background. Simulations show that this
technique can improve the dynamic range of EOR maps by 2-3 orders of magnitude.
