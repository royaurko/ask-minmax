The properties of the mean first passage time in a system characterized by
multiple periodic attractors are studied. Using a transformation from a high
dimensional space to 1D, the problem is reduced to a stochastic process along
the path from the fixed point attractor to a saddle point located between two
neighboring attractors. It is found that the time to switch between attractors
depends on the effective size of the attractors, $\tau$, the noise, $\epsilon$,
and the potential difference between the attractor and an adjacent saddle point
as: $~T = {c \over \tau} \exp({\tau \over \epsilon} \Delta {\cal{U}})~$; the
ratio between the sizes of the two attractors affects $\Delta {\cal{U}}$. The
result is obtained analytically for small $\tau$ and confirmed by numerical
simulations. Possible implications that may arise from the model and results
are discussed.
