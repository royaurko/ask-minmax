A new technique has been developed at TRIUMF's TITAN facility to perform
in-trap decay spectroscopy. The aim of this technique is to eventually measure
weak electron capture branching ratios (ECBRs) and by this to consequently
determine GT matrix elements of $\beta\beta$ decaying nuclei. These branching
ratios provide important input to the theoretical description of these decays.
The feasibility and power of the technique is demonstrated by measuring the
ECBR of $^{124}$Cs.
