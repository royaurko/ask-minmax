D68 is a narrow ringlet located only 67,627 km (1.12 planetary radii) from
Saturn's spin axis. Images of this ringlet obtained by the Cassini spacecraft
reveal that this ringlet exhibits persistent longitudinal brightness variations
and a substantial eccentricity (ae=25+/-1 km). By comparing observations made
at different times, we confirm that the brightness variations revolve around
the planet at approximately the local orbital rate (1751.6 degrees/day), and
that the ringlet's pericenter precesses at 38.243+/-0.008 degrees/day,
consistent with the expected apsidal precession rate at this location due to
Saturn's higher-order gravitational harmonics. Surprisingly, we also find that
the ringlet's semi-major axis appears to be decreasing with time at a rate of
2.4+/-0.4 km/year between 2005 and 2013. A closer look at these measurements,
along with a consideration of earlier Voyager observations of this same
ringlet, suggests that the mean radius of D68 moves back and forth, perhaps
with a period of around 15 Earth years or about half a Saturn year. These
observations could place important constraints on both the ringlet's local
dynamical environment and the planet's gravitational field.
