The non-stationary mode of radial-slotted erosive discharge was considered.
The existence condition of the relatively steady multiarc regime has been
found. Experimentally it has been shown that this discharge has been
corresponding to the required condition at the sufficiently large current. The
oscillograms of commutation of lightning impulse on the simulative test
facility with the equivalent of a high-voltage transmission line are presented.
The obtained results indicate the ability of erosive discharge, when using
within the framework of the complex lightning protection facility, to fast
commutation of lightning impulses at the level of rated current
