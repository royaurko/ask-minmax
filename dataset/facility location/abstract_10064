We perform a canonical analysis of the system of 2d vacuum dilatonic black
holes. Our basic variables are closely tied to the spacetime geometry and we do
not make the field redefinitions which have been made by other contributors. We
present a careful discssion of asymptotics in this canonical formalism.
Canonical transformations are made to variables which (on shell) have a clear
spacetime significance. We are able to deduce the location of the horizon on
the spatial slice (on shell) from the vanishing of a combination of canonical
data. The constraints dramatically simplify in terms of the new canonical
variables and quantization is easy. The physical interpretation of the variable
conjugate to the ADM mass is clarified. This work closely parallels that done
by Kucha{\v r} for the vacuum Schwarzschild black holes and is a starting point
for a similar analysis, now in progress, for the case of a massless scalar
field conformally coupled to a 2d dilatonic black hole.
