We report our recent results on the QCD phase diagram obtained from the
lattice QCD simulation. The location of the phase boundary between hadronic and
QGP phases in the two-flavor QCD phase diagram is investigated. The imaginary
chemical potential approach is employed, which is based on Monte Carlo
simulations of the QCD with imaginary chemical potential and analytic
continuation to the real chemical potential region.
