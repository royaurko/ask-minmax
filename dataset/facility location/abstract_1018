Flux monitoring of compact radio quasars has revealed dramatic radio-wave
lensing events which challenge our understanding of the interstellar medium.
However, the data on these events remain very sparse. Here we consider how the
Goonhilly radio astronomical facility can make an impact on this problem by
dedicating one or more dishes to flux monitoring for a period of one year. Such
an experiment would be able to identify \sim6 new events and study them in
detail.
