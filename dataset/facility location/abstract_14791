Far ultraviolet (FUV) observations are excellent probes of the inner
accretion disk, disk outflows, and the mass-accumulating white dwarf in
cataclysmic variables. Here we study the contrasting behavior of two canonical
dwarf novae in outburst by presenting FUSE FUV (904 -- 1187 A) spectroscopy of
U Gem and SS Cyg. We observed each system four times during a single outburst.
The outburst peak and early decline spectra of SS Cyg are well fit by models of
a steady-state accretion disk and a biconical wind. A broad, blueshifted OVI
wind-formed absorption line is the only strong spectral feature. In late
outburst decline, OVI and CIII lines are seen as broad emission features and
the continuum has flattened. In U Gem, the continua of the optical outburst
plateau spectra are plausibly fit by accretion disk model spectra. The spectra
also show numerous narrow, low-velocity absorption lines that do not originate
in the inner accretion disk. We discuss the line spectra in the context of
partial absorption of the FUV continuum by low-velocity, vertically-extended
material located at large disk radii. The late outburst decline spectrum of U
Gem is dominated by the white dwarf. WD model fits confirm the sub-solar C and
super-solar N abundances found in earlier studies.
