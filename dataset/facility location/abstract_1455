In Gallium detectors for solar neutrinos, the capture rate due to
Gamow-Teller transitions to excited states of 71Ge beyond the neutron emission
threshold is usually neglected. We make a model calculation to estimate its
effect and find that this yields an additional contribution which may be as
much as 0.4 SNU, even larger than that from the Isobaric Analog State in 71Ge
reached by Fermi transitions, which is normally included in the standard
predictions.
