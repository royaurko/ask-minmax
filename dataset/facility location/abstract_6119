In Phys. Rev. D 58, 014014 (1998) and 71, 094013 (2005), we determined
non-perturbative D^0, D^+, D^{*+}, D_s^+, and Lambda_c^+ fragmentation
functions, both at leading and next-to-leading order in the MS-bar
factorization scheme, by fitting e^+e^- data taken by the OPAL Collaboration at
CERN LEP1. The starting points for the evolution in the factorization scale mu
were taken to be mu_0 = 2m_Q, where Q = c,b. For the reader's convenience, in
this Addendum, we repeat this analysis for mu_0 = m_Q, where the flavor
thresholds of modern sets of parton density functions are located.
