Suggestions have been made that asteroid belts may be important both for the
existence of life and perhaps even for the evolution of complex life on a
planet. Using numerical models for protoplanetary discs we calculate the
location of the snow line, and we propose that asteroid belts are most likely
to form in its vicinity. We then show that observations of warm dust in
exo-solar systems, thought to be produced by collisions between asteroids in a
belt, indicate that asteroid belts (when they exist), indeed coincide with the
radial location and the temperature of the snow line. Giant planets form
outside the snow line and prevent planet formation just inside of their orbit
creating an asteroid belt there. However, the migration of giant planets
through the asteroid belt likely disperses the compact formation. We examine
existing observations of giant exo-planets and find that less than 4% are at
radial locations outside of the snow line. This definitely may be the
consequence of observational selection effects. However, with this caveat in
mind, we point out that the dearth of giant planets outside the snow line may
also suggest that compact asteroid belts are not common, and more speculatively
that complex life may not expected in most of the currently observed systems.
