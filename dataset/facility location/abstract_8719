We cross-correlate the Herbig & Bell and Hipparcos Catalogues in order to
extract the results for young stellar objects (YSOs). We compare the distances
of individual young stars and the distance of their presumably associated
molecular clouds, taking into account post-Hipparcos distances to the relevant
associations and using Hipparcos intermediate astrometric data to derive new
parallaxes of the pre-main sequence stars based on their grouping. We confirm
that YSOs are located in their associated clouds, as anticipated by a large
body of work, and discuss reasons which make the individual parallaxes of some
YSOs doubtful. We find in particular that the distance of Taurus YSOs as a
group is entirely consistent with the molecular cloud distance, although
Hipparcos distances of some faint Taurus-Auriga stars must be viewed with
caution. We then improve some of the solutions for the binary and multiple
pre-main sequence stars. In particular, we confirm three new astrometric young
binaries discovered by Hipparcos: RY Tau, UX Ori, and IX Oph.
