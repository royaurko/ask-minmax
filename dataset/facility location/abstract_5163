Priced timed games are two-player zero-sum games played on priced timed
automata (whose locations and transitions are labeled by weights modeling the
costs of spending time in a state and executing an action, respectively). The
goals of the players are to minimise and maximise the cost to reach a target
location, respectively. We consider priced timed games with one clock and
arbitrary (positive and negative) weights and show that, for an important
subclass of theirs (the so-called simple priced timed games), one can compute,
in exponential time, the optimal values that the players can achieve, with
their associated optimal strategies. As side results, we also show that
one-clock priced timed games are determined and that we can use our result on
simple priced timed games to solve the more general class of so-called
reset-acyclic priced timed games (with arbitrary weights and one-clock).
