The lateral distribution of Cherenkov light at ground level records important
information on the development of the cosmic ray air shower which produces it.
We have constructed an array of 144 non-imaging Cherenkov detectors at the
CASA-MIA experiment site in Dugway, Utah. The various arrays can sample
simultaneously the lateral distributions of electrons, muons, and Cherenkov
light at many locations. We describe the design and operation of the
CASA-BLANCA experiment and its potential to address the composition of primary
cosmic rays between 300 and 30,000 TeV.
