Menten, Reid, Eckart and Genzel (1997) accurately determined the position of
Sgr A* on an infrared image, by aligning the infrared image with positions
measured for SiO masers, associated with infrared-bright evolved stars, at
radio wavelengths. We now report greatly improved radio positions and, for the
first time, proper motions of many stellar SiO masers at the Galactic Center.
These positions and motions, coupled with better infrared imaging, allow a much
improved location of Sgr A* on infrared images. With current data, infrared
stars can be placed in a reference frame tied to Sgr A*, to an accuracy of
approximately 10 mas in position and 1 mas/yr in motion. The position of Sgr A*
is, within uncertainties, consistent with stellar accelerations and the
measured orbital focus of the star S2. The star S2 was observed within 16 mas
(130 AU in projection) of Sgr A* on 2002 May 02. Finally, we find that the
central stellar cluster moves with Sgr A* to within approximatly 70 km/s.
