A field superposition of singular beams incident on, and then reflected from
a mirror has been investigated. It was demonstrated that the standing optical
wave, which contains a vortex, possesses an orbital angle momentum where the
energy flux circulates only in the azimuth direction of the beam. We show in
this paper that the standing light wave containing the optical vortex transfers
angular momentum to a substance located in the field of the vortex without
moving the substance in the azimuth or radial directions. This property of the
standing vortex present an opportunity to form the three-dimensional optical
traps, gasdynamic and hydrodynamic vortices, in a localised volume by a direct
transfer of the orbital angular momentum from the optical vortex.
