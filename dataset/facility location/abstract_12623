We have studied the electronic properties in aperiodic graphene superlattices
of Thue-Morse sequence. Although the structure is aperiodic, an unusual Dirac
point (DP) does exist and its location is exactly at the position of the
zero-averaged wave number (zero-$\bar{k})$. Furthermore, the zero-$\bar{k}$ gap
associated with the DP is robust against the lattice constants and the incident
angles, and multi-DPs can appear under the suitable conditions. A resultant
controllability of electron transport in Thue-Morse sequence is predicted,
which may facilitate the development of many graphene-based electronics.
