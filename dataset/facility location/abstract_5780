High precision planet orbital data extracted from direct observation,
spacecraft explorations and laser ranging techniques enable to put a strong
constraint on the maximal dark matter density of a spherical halo centered
around the Sun. The maximal density at Earth's location is of the order $10^5$
${\rm GeV/cm^3}$ and shows only a mild dependence on the slope of the halo
profile, taken between 0 and -2. This bound is somewhat better than that
obtained from the perihelion precession limits.
