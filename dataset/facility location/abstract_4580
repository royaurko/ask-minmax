Iterative solutions to fourth-order gravity describing static and
electrically charged black holes are constructed. Obtained solutions are
parametrized by two integration constants which are related to the electric
charge and the exact location of the event horizon. Special emphasis is put on
the extremal black holes. It is explicitly demonstrated that in the extremal
limit, the exact location of the (degenerate) event horizon is given by $\rp =
|e|.$ Similarly to the classical Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution, the
near-horizon geometry of the charged black holes in quadratic gravity, when
expanded into the whole manifold, is simply that of Bertotti and Robinson.
Similar considerations have been carried out for the boundary conditions of
second type which employ the electric charge and the mass of the system as seen
by a distant observer. The relations between results obtained within the
framework of each method are briefly discussed.
