Cloud computing allows shared computer and storage facilities to be used by a
multitude of clients. While cloud management is centralized, the information
resides in the cloud and information sharing can be implemented via
off-the-shelf techniques for multiuser databases. Users, however, are very
diffident for not having full control over their sensitive data. Untrusted
database-as-a-server techniques are neither readily extendable to the cloud
environment nor easily understandable by non-technical users. To solve this
problem, we present an approach where agents share reserved data in a secure
manner by the use of simple grant-and-revoke permissions on shared data.
