The main purpose of this paper is to study the structure of the well-known
non-iterative MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm for identifying
the shape of extended electromagnetic inclusions of small thickness located in
a two-dimensional homogeneous space. We construct a relationship between the
MUSIC-type imaging functional for thin inclusions and the Bessel function of
integer order of the first kind. Our construction is based on the structure of
the left singular vectors of the collected multistatic response matrix whose
elements are the measured far-field pattern and the asymptotic expansion
formula in the presence of thin inclusions. Some numerical examples are shown
to support the constructed MUSIC structure.
