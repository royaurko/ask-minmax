This paper presents a digital signal processing tool developed using
MatlabTM, which provides a very low-cost and effective strategy for
analog-to-digital conversion of legated paper biomedical maps without requiring
dedicated hardware. This software-based approach is particularly helpful for
digitalizing biomedical signals acquired from analogical devices equipped with
a plottingter. Albeit signals used in biomedical diagnosis are the primary
concern, this imaging processing tool is suitable to modernize facilities in a
non-expensive way. Legated paper ECG and EEG charts can be fast and efficiently
digitalized in order to be added in existing up-to-date medical data banks,
improving the follow-up of patients.
