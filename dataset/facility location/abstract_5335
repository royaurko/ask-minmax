Total and differential cross sections for the reaction gamma p -> pi^o eta p
have been measured with the Crystal Ball/TAPS detector using the tagged photon
facility at the MAMI C accelerator in Mainz. In the energy range
E_gamma=0.95-1.4 GeV the reaction is dominated by the excitation and sequential
decay of the Delta(1700)D33 resonance. Angular distributions measured with high
statistics allow us to determine the ratio of hadronic decay widths
\Gamma_{\eta \Delta}/\Gamma_{\pi S11} and the ratio of the helicity amplitudes
A_{3/2}/A_{1/2} for this resonance.
