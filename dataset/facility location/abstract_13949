We provide an invariant characterization of the physical properties of the
Kerr spacetime. We introduce two dimensionless invariants, constructed out of
some known curvature invariants, that act as detectors for the event horizon
and ergosurface of the Kerr black hole. We also show that the mass and angular
momentum can be extracted from local measurements of the curvature invariants,
which in the weak field limit could be used to approximate the total angular
momentum and mass of a system of merging black holes. Finally, we introduce a
dimensionless invariant that gives a local measure of the "Kerrness" of the
spacetime.
