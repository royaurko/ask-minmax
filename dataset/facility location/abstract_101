An introduction and the status of R&D activities for a high-resolution,
"cold" beam position monitor (BPM) and the related read-out electronics are
discussed. Two different BPM detector concepts, to be attached to the SC
quadrupole and located inside the ILC cryomodule, are currently under
investigation: A resonant dipole-mode cavity-style BPM pickup, developed at
Fermilab, and a re-entrant resonant coaxial waveguide BPM, designed by
CEA-Saclay. While the 1.5 GHz dipole-mode cavity BPM is still in the R&D phase,
the re-entrant BPM has already passed first beam tests, including its read-out
system. Furthermore, the LAPP group is developing radiation tolerant digital
read-out systems, which are tested at the CLIC test facility (CTF).
