Laser ion source (LIS), which can provide carbon beam with highly stripped
state (C6+) and high intensity (several tens mA), would significantly change
the overall design of the hadrontherapy facility. A LIS based hadrontherapy
facility is proposed with the advantage of short linac length, simple injection
scheme and small synchrotron size. With the experience from the DPIS and HITFiL
project that had conducted in IMP, a conceptional design of the LIS based
hadrontherapy facility will be present with special dedication to APF type IH
DTL design and simulation.
