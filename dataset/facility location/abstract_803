The internal structure of the nucleon is discussed within the context of QCD.
Recent progress in understanding the distribution of flavor and spin in the
nucleon is reviewed, and prospects for extending our knowledge of nucleon
structure in electron scattering experiments at modern facilities such as
Jefferson Lab are outlined.
