Various substances in the liquid state tend to form droplets. In this paper
the shape of such droplets is investigated within the spherical model of a
lattice gas. We show that in this case the droplet boundary is always
diffusive, as opposed to sharp, and find the corresponding density profiles
(droplet shapes). Translation-invariant versions of the spherical model do not
fix the spatial location of the droplet, hence lead to mixed phases. To obtain
pure macroscopic states (which describe localized droplets) we use generalized
quasi-averaging. Conventional quasi-averaging deforms droplets and, hence, can
not be used for this purpose. On the contrary, application of the generalized
method of quasi-averages yields droplet shapes which do not depend on the
magnitude of the applied external field.
