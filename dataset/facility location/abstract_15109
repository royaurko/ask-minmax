Exploration of the time variability on the sky over a broad range of flux
levels and wavelengths is rapidly becoming a new frontier of astronomical
research. We describe here briefly the Palomar-QUEST survey being carried out
from the Samuel Oschin 48-inch Schmidt telescope at Palomar. The following
features make the survey an attractive candidate for studying time variability:
anticipated survey area of 12,000 - 15,000 sq. degrees in the drift scan mode,
point source depth of 21st mag. in I under good conditions, near simultaneous
observations in four filters, and at least four passes per year at each
location covered. The survey will yield a large number of transients and highly
variable sources in the near future and in that sense is a prototype of LSST
and Pan-STARRS. We briefly outline our strategy for searching such objects and
the proposed pipeline for detecting transients in real-time.
