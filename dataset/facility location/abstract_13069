We consider an Ising model on a square grid with ferromagnetic spin-spin
interactions spanning beyond nearest neighbors. Starting from initial states
with a single unbounded interface separating ordered phases, we investigate the
evolution of the interface subject to zero-temperature spin-flip dynamics. We
consider an interface which is initially (i) the boundary of the quadrant, or
(ii) the boundary of a semi-infinite stripe. In the former case the interface
recedes from its original location in a self-similar diffusive manner. After a
re-scaling by t^{1/2}, the shape of the interface becomes more and more
deterministic; we determine this limiting shape analytically and verify our
predictions numerically. The semi-infinite stripe acquires a stationary shape
resembling a finger, and this finger translates along its axis. We compute the
limiting shape and the velocity of the Ising finger.
