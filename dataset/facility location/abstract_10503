Pulse shape analysis of germanium gamma-ray spectrometer signals can yield
information on the radial position of individual gamma-ray interactions within
the germanium crystal. A parametric pulse shape analysis based on calculation
of moments of the reconstructed current pulses from a closed-ended coaxial
germanium detector is used to preferentially select single-site gamma-ray
interactions. The double escape peak events from the 2614.5 keV gamma-ray of
208-Tl are used as a training set to optimize the single-site event selection
region in the pulse shape parameter space. A collimated source of 320.1 keV
gamma-rays from 51-Cr is used to scan different radial positions of the same
semi-coaxial germanium detector. The previously trained single-site selection
region is used to preferentially identify the single-site photoelectric
absorption events from the 320.1 keV full-energy peak. From the identified
events, a comparison of the pulse shape parameter space distributions between
different scan positions allows radial interaction location information to be
collected.
