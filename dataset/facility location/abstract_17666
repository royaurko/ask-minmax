We present dust maps of NGC 1316 (Fornax A), a well-studied early-type galaxy
located in the outskirts of the Fornax cluster. We used the Large APEX
BOlometer CAmera (LABOCA), operating at 870 micron with an angular resolution
of 19.5 arcseconds on the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) 12m
submillimeter telescope in Chile and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
(WISE). WISE observes in four mid-infrared bands centered at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and
22 micron with angular resolutions ranging from 6 to 12 arcseconds. The WISE
and LABOCA maps reveal emission from dust in the central 2 arcminutes of NGC
1316. The disturbed optical morphology with many shells and loops, the complex
distribution of molecular gas and our dust maps are evidences of past merger
activity or gas accretion in the galaxy. Combining the LABOCA flux measurement
with existing mid- and far-infrared measurements, we estimate the temperature
of the cold (~20 K) and warm (~55 K) dust components in the galaxy. This study
will be extended to other southern radio galaxies and merger remnants. Those
galaxies are good targets for future observations at higher angular resolution
and sensitivity with ALMA to probe the interaction of the radio jets with the
dusty molecular gas near active galactic nuclei.
