We present results on lattice QCD at finite temperature (T) and chemical
potential (\mu). We apply the overlap-improving multi-parameter reweighting
technique for n_f=4 and 2+1 staggered QCD. We use semi-realistic masses on
L_t=4 lattices. The critical endpoint (E) of 2+1 flavour QCD on the \mu-T plane
is located. Our results are based on {\cal{O}}(10^3-10^4) configurations.
