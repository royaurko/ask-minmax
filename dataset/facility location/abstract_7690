We have developed a comprehensive methodology for calculating the boundaries
of the habitable zone (HZ) of planet-hosting S-type binary star systems. Our
approach is general and takes into account the contribution of both stars to
the location and extent of the Binary HZ with different stellar spectral types.
We have studied how the binary eccentricity and stellar energy distribution
affect the extent of the habitable zone. Results indicate that in binaries
where the combination of mass-ratio and orbital eccentricity allows planet
formation around a star of the system to proceed successfully, the effect of a
less luminous secondary on the location of the primary's habitable zone is
generally negligible. However, when the secondary is more luminous, it can
influence the extent of the HZ. We present the details of the derivations of
our methodology and discuss its application to the Binary HZ around the primary
and secondary main sequence stars of an FF, MM, and FM binary, as well as two
known planet-hosting binaries alpha Cen AB and HD 196886.
