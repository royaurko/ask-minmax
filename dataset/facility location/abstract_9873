We introduce a mixed-mode load sharing scheme in fiber bundle model. This
model reduces exactly to equal load sharing (ELS) and local load sharing (LLS)
models at the two extreme conditions of the load sharing rule. We identify two
distinct regimes: a) Mean-field regime where ELS mode dominates and b) short
range regime dominated by LLS mode. The crossover behavior is explored through
the numerical study of strength variation, the avalanche statistics,
susceptibility and relaxation time variations, the correlations among the
broken fibers and their cluster analysis. Analyzing the moments of the cluster
size distributions we locate the crossover point of these regimes. We thus
conclude that even in one dimension, fiber bundle model shows crossover
behavior from mean-field to short range interactions.
