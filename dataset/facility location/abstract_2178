A variety of environmental media were analyzed for fallout radionuclides
resulting from the Fukushima nuclear accident by the Low Background Facility
(LBF) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in Berkeley, CA.
Monitoring activities in air and rainwater began soon after the onset of the
March 11, 2011 tsunami and are reported here through the end of 2012. Observed
fallout isotopes include $^{131}$I, $^{132}$I,$^{132}$Te,$^{134}$Cs,
$^{136}$Cs, and $^{137}$Cs. Isotopes were measured on environmental air
filters, automobile filters, and in rainwater. An additional analysis of
rainwater in search of $^{90}$Sr is also presented. Last, a series of food
measurements conducted in September of 2013 are included due to extended media
concerns of $^{134, 137}$Cs in fish. Similar measurements of fallout from the
Chernobyl disaster at LBNL, previously unpublished publicly, are also presented
here as a comparison with the Fukushima incident. All measurements presented
also include natural radionuclides found in the environment to provide a basis
for comparison.
