We report the serendipitous discovery of a BAL QSO at z = 2.169, located 41''
southwest of 3C 48. We present Keck LRIS spectroscopy covering rest frame 1500
A to 2300 A . The C IV BAL has three components and it extends to outflow
velocities of at least 12,000 km/s. The BAL QSO has an intervening
low-ionization metal-line absorption system at z = 1.667 which is likely to be
a damped Ly-alpha absorber. HST images show extended luminous material around
the QSO, which could be either the host galaxy or the intervening system.
