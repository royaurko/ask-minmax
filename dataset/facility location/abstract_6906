Based on over 5400 BV images of 47 Tuc collected between 1998 and 2010 we
obtained light curves of 65 variables, 21 of which are newly detected objects.
New variables are located mostly just outside of the core in a region poorly
studied by earlier surveys of the cluster. Among them there are four detached
eclipsing binaries and five likely optical counterparts of X-ray sources. Two
detached systems are promising targets for follow-up observations. We briefly
discuss properties of the most interesting new variables.
