The upper critical fields ($H_{c2}$) of the single crystals
$\rm(Sr,Na)Fe_2As_2$ and $\rm Ba_{0.55}K_{0.45}Fe_2As_2$ were determined by
means of measuring the electrical resistivity, $ \rho_{xx}(\mu_0H)$, using the
facilities of pulsed magnetic field at Los Alamos. In general, these compounds
possess a very large upper critical field ($H_{c2}(0)$) with a weak anisotropic
effect. The detailed curvature of $H_{c2}(T_c)$ may depend on the magnetic
field orientation and the sample compositions. We argue that such a difference
mainly results from the multi-band effect, which might be modified via doping.
