Pattern tree are based on integrated rules which are equal to a combination
of some points connected to each other in a hierarchical structure, called
Enquiry Hierarchical (EH). The main operation in pattern enquiry seeking is to
locate the steps that match the given EH in the dataset. A point of algorithms
has offered for EH matching; but the majority of this algorithms seeks all of
the enquiry steps to access all EHs in the dataset. A few algorithms such as
seek only steps that satisfy end points of EH. All of above algorithms are
trying to locate a way just for investigating direct testing of steps and to
locate the answer of enquiry, directly via these points. In this paper, we
describe a novel algorithm to locate the answer of enquiry without access to
real point of the dataset blindly. In this algorithm, first, the enquiry will
be executed on enquiry schema and this leads to a schema. Using this plan, it
will be clear how to seek end steps and how to achieve enquiry dataset, before
seeking of the dataset steps. Therefore, none of dataset steps will be seek
blindly.
