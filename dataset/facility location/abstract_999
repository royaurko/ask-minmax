Experimental data on total and differential elastic cross sections for
$p+p(\bar{p})$, $n+p(\bar{p})$, $K^\pm+p$, $K^\pm+n$, $\pi^\pm+p$ starting from
energy 3.5 GeV in CMS are used to determine parameters of vacuum contribution
and parameters of basic non vacuum reggeons: $f$, $\omega$, $\rho$ and $A_2$.
It is argued that non vacuum contributions to proton-proton and proton-neutron
collisions correspond to spectrum in which baryon number is moved from the
fragmentation region to central region in rapidity space. In this case it is
possible that chemical potential is increased in central region of spectrum of
nucleus-nucleus interaction at low energies. This effect might be important for
facilities FAIR and NICA.
