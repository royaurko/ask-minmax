In this paper we investigate the usage of cognitive radio devices within the
service area of TV broadcast stations. Until now the main approach for a
cognitive radio to operate in the TV bands has been to register TV broadcast
stations locations and thus protecting the broadcast stations service area.
Through information about TV receivers location, we show that a cognitive radio
should be able to operate within this service area without causing harmful
interference to the TV receivers as defined by Ofcom and FCC. We provide
simulations based on real statistics from Norway that show that especially in
rural areas TV receiver registration can provide a substantial gain in terms of
exploitable frequencies for a cognitive radio.
