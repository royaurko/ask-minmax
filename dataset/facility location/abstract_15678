The paper investigates a version of the resource allocation problem arising
in the wireless networking, namely in the OVSF code reallocation process. In
this setting a complete binary tree of a given height $n$ is considered,
together with a sequence of requests which have to be served in an online
manner. The requests are of two types: an insertion request requires to
allocate a complete subtree of a given height, and a deletion request frees a
given allocated subtree. In order to serve an insertion request it might be
necessary to move some already allocated subtrees to other locations in order
to free a large enough subtree. We are interested in the worst case average
number of such reallocations needed to serve a request.
  It was proved in previous work that the competitive ratio of the optimal
online algorithm solving this problem is between 1.5 and O(n). We partially
answer the question about its exact value by giving an O(1)-competitive online
algorithm.
  Same model has been used in the context of memory management systems, and
analyzed for the number of reallocations needed to serve a request in the worst
case. In this setting, our result is a corresponding amortized analysis.
