Wireless power transfer (WPT) prolongs the lifetime of wireless sensor
network by providing sustainable power supply to the distributed sensor nodes
(SNs) via electromagnetic waves. To improve the energy transfer efficiency in a
large WPT system, this paper proposes an adaptively directional WPT (AD-WPT)
scheme, where the power beacons (PBs) adapt the energy beamforming strategy to
SNs' locations by concentrating the transmit power on the nearby SNs within the
efficient charging radius. With the aid of stochastic geometry, we derive the
closed-form expressions of the distribution metrics of the aggregate received
power at a typical SN and further approximate the complementary cumulative
distribution function using Gamma distribution with second-order moment
matching. To design the charging radius for the optimal AD-WPT operation, we
exploit the tradeoff between the power intensity of the energy beams and the
number of SNs to be charged. Depending on different SN task requirements, the
optimal AD-WPT can maximize the average received power or the active
probability of the SNs, respectively. It is shown that both the maximized
average received power and the maximized sensor active probability increase
with the increased deployment density and transmit power of the PBs, and
decrease with the increased density of the SNs and the energy beamwidth.
Finally, we show that the optimal AD-WPT can significantly improve the energy
transfer efficiency compared with the traditional omnidirectional WPT.
