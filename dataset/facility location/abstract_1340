In the last decade, Moving Object Databases (MODs) have attracted a lot of
attention from researchers. Several research works were conducted to extend
traditional database techniques to accommodate the new requirements imposed by
the continuous change in location information of moving objects. Managing,
querying, storing, and mining moving objects were the key research directions.
This extensive interest in moving objects is a natural consequence of the
recent ubiquitous location-aware devices, such as PDAs, mobile phones, etc., as
well as the variety of information that can be extracted from such new
databases. In this paper we propose a Spatio-Temporal data warehousing (STDW)
for efficiently querying location information of moving objects. The proposed
schema introduces new measures like direction majority and other
direction-based measures that enhance the decision making based on location
information.
