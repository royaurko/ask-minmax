The `braneworld' (described by the usual worldvolume action) is a D
dimensional timelike surface embedded in a N dimensional ($N>D$) warped,
nonfactorisable spacetime. We first address the conditions on the warp factor
required to have an extremal flat brane in a five dimensional background.
Subsequently, we deal with normal deformations of such extremal branes. The
ensuing Jacobi equations are analysed to obtain the stability condition. It
turns out that to have a stable brane, the warp factor should have a minimum at
the location of the brane in the given background spacetime. To illustrate our
results we explicitly check the extremality and stability criteria for a few
known co-dimension one braneworld models. Generalisations of the above
formalism for the cases of (i) curved branes (ii) asymmetrical warping and
(iii) higher co-dimension braneworlds are then presented alongwith some typical
examples for each. Finally, we summarize our results and provide perspectives
for future work along these lines.
