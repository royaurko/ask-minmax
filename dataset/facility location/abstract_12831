We investigate the domain wall dynamics of a ferromagnetic wire under the
combined influence of a spin-polarized current and magnonic spin-transfer
torque generated by an external field, taking also into account Rashba
spin-orbit coupling interactions. It is demonstrated that current-induced
motion of the domain wall may be completely reversed in an oscillatory fashion
by applying a magnonic spin-transfer torque as long as the spin-wave velocity
is sufficiently high. Moreover, we show that the motion of the domain wall may
be fully terminated by means of the generation of spin-waves, suggesting the
possibility to pin the domain-walls to predetermined locations. We also discuss
how strong spin-orbit interactions modify these results.
