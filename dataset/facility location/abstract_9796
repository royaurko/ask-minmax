One dimensional S=1 XXZ chains with uniaxial single-ion-type anisotropy are
studied by numerical exact diagonalization of finite size systems. The
numerical data are analyzed using conformal field theory, the level
spectroscopy, phenomenological renormalization group and finite size scaling
method. We thus present the first quantitatively reliable ground state phase
diagram of this model. The ground states of this model contain the Haldane
phase, large-D phase, N\'{e}el phase, two XY phases and the ferromagnetic
phase. There are four different types of transitions between these phases: the
Brezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type transitions, the Gaussian type transitions,
the Ising type transitions and the first order transitions. The location of
these critical lines are accurately determined.
