We consider a family of domains $(\Omega_N)_{N>0}$ obtained by attaching an
$N\times 1$ rectangle to a fixed set $\Omega_0 = \{(x,y): 0<y<1,
-\phi(y)<x<0\}$, for a Lipschitz function $\phi\geq 0$. We derive full
asymptotic expansions, as $N\to\infty$, for the $m$th Dirichlet eigenvalue (for
any fixed $m$) and for the associated eigenfunction on $\Omega_N$. The second
term involves a scattering phase arising in the Dirichlet problem on the
infinite domain $\Omega_\infty$. We determine the first variation of this
scattering phase, with respect to $\phi$, at $\phi\equiv 0$. This is then used
to prove sharpness of results, obtained previously by the same contributors, about
the location of extrema and nodal line of eigenfunctions on convex domains.
