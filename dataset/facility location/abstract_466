Around forty years passed from the beginning of operation of the first
electron-positron colliding beam facility VEPP-2 in Institute of Nuclear
Physics (INP), Novosibirsk. Here I described development of electron-positron
colliding beam project in INP, as well as advance of similar projects of the
first generation at LAL, Orsay and at LNF, Frascati.
