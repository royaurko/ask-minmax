We present a detailed algorithm to construct symbolic encodings for chaotic
attractors of three-dimensional flows. It is based on a topological analysis of
unstable periodic orbits embedded in the attractor and follows the approach
proposed by Lefranc et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 73, 1364 (1994)]. For each orbit,
the symbolic names that are consistent with its knot-theoretic invariants and
with the topological structure of the attractor are first obtained using
template analysis. This information, and the locations of the periodic orbits
in the section plane, are then used to construct a generating partition by
means of triangulations. We provide numerical evidence of the validity of this
method by applying it successfully to sets of more than 1500 periodic orbits
extracted from numerical simulations, and obtain partitions whose border is
localized with a precision of 0.01%. A distinctive advantage of this approach
is that the solution is progressively refined using higher-period orbits, which
makes it robust to noise, and suitable for analyzing experimental time series.
Furthermore, the resulting encodings are by construction consistent in the
corresponding limits with those rigorously known for both one-dimensional and
hyperbolic maps.
