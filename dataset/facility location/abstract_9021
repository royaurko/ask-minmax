It has recently been argued that the unidentified SCUBA objects (USOs) are a
thick disk population of free-floating dense, compact galactic gas clumps at a
temperature of about 7 K. The characteristic mass scale is constrained to be on
the order of a Jupiter mass, and the size is about 10 AU. A typical galactic
USO is located at a distance from the sun of about 300 pc. We have calculated
the molecular emission lines from these low temperature clouds. We consider
three molecules: HD, LiH, and CO. HD is optically thin in the cloud, LiH is a
molecule with a large electric dipole moment, and CO is an abundant molecule
that is observed in dusty clouds. Our estimate for the typical object shows
that LiH may be detectable by the future sub-mm array project, ALMA; its
expected flux is at the mJy level and the line width is about $10^5$ Hz.
Although typical galactic USOs are chemically and dynamically transient, the
younger USOs will be recognisable via LiH emission if about a hundred USOs are
observed. If USOs are confirmed to be of galactic origin, the total baryonic
budget will need to be reevaluated.
