Active galactic nuclei present continuum and line emission. The emission
lines are originated by gas located close to the central super-massive black
hole. Some of these lines are broad, and would be produced in a small region
called broad-line region. This region could be formed by clouds surrounding the
central black hole. In this work, we study the interaction of such clouds with
the base of the jets in active galactic nuclei, and we compute the produced
high-energy emission. We focus on sources with low luminosities in the inner
jet regions, to avoid strong gamma-ray absorption. We find that the resulting
high-energy radiation may be significant in Centaurus A. Also, this phenomenon
might be behind the variable gamma-ray emission detected in M87, if very large
dark clouds are present. The detection of jet-cloud interactions in active
galactic nuclei would give information on the properties of the jet base and
the very central regions.
