Visual information determines majority of our spatial behavior. The eye
projects a 2-D image of the world on the retina. We demonstrate that when a
monocular-like imaging system operates entirely with optically dense fluids, an
increase in field-of-view (FOV) is observed compared to an experimental
condition, where the ocular medium is optically neutral. Resulting spatial
shifts in the retinal image towards the fovea complement the photoreceptor
distribution pattern, incidentally revealing a new role for ocular fluids in
the image space. Possible effects on the perceived egocentric object location
are discussed.
