(Abridged) In these lectures aimed for non-specialists, I review progress in
understanding how galaxies form and evolve. Both the star formation history and
assembly of stellar mass can be empirically traced from redshifts z~6 to the
present, but how the various distant populations inter-relate and how stellar
assembly is regulated by feedback and environmental processes remains unclear.
I also discuss how these studies are being extended to locate and characterize
the earlier sources beyond z~6. Did early star-forming galaxies contribute
significantly to the reionization process and over what period did this occur?
Neither theory nor observations are well-developed in this frontier topic but
the first results presented here provide important guidance on how we will use
more powerful future facilities.
