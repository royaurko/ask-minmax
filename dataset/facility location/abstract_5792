Dynamical control of excitable biological systems is often complicated by the
difficult and unreliable task of pre-control identification of unstable
periodic orbits (UPOs). Here we show that, for both chaotic and nonchaotic
systems, UPOs can be located, and their dynamics characterized, during control.
Tracking of system nonstationarities emerges naturally from this approach. Such
a method is potentially valuable for the control of excitable biological
systems, for which pre-control UPO identification is often impractical and
nonstationarities (natural or stimulation-induced) are common.
