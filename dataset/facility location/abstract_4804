The location and asymptotic behaviour for large n of the zeros of exceptional
Jacobi and Laguerre polynomials are discussed. The zeros of exceptional
polynomials fall into two classes: the regular zeros, which lie in the interval
of orthogonality and the exceptional zeros, which lie outside that interval. We
show that the regular zeros have two interlacing properties: one is the natural
interlacing between consecutive polynomials as a consequence of their
Sturm-Liouville character, while the other one shows interlacing between the
zeros of exceptional and classical polynomials. A generalization of the
classical Heine-Mehler formula is provided for the exceptional polynomials,
which allows to derive the asymptotic behaviour of their regular zeros. We also
describe the location and the asymptotic behaviour of the exceptional zeros,
which converge for large n to fixed values.
