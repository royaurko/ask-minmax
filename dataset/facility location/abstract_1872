The EPICS based control system of the ISAC radioactive beam facility
supervises several sub-systems, which are controlled by PLCs. Most of the
devices are protected by non-trivial interlocks, which are implemented with
ladder-logic software. Detailed information on interlock state and the
individual interlock conditions are accessible for each device at the EPICS
operator interface level. With the increasing number of ISAC devices, the
interactive generation and maintenance of these displays with standard EPICS
tools was too labor-intensive and error-prone. Software was developed, which
uses a printout of the PLC program as well as reports from the ISAC device
database to a) check the interlock implementation in the PLC against interlock
specifications in natural language and b) generate device displays with a
graphical representation of interlock state and details of interlock
conditions.
