Observers of the uniformly accelerating observers or the observers who make
up the system of uniformly accelerating observers reach the same velocity V at
different times ti which depends on V and on theirs acceleration gi.
Considering a platform that moves with constant velocity V, the observers can
land smoothly on it. Their ages and locations in the inertial reference frame
attached to the platform are reckoned and compared.
