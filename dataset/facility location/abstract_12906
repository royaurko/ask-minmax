By cross-coupling two logistic maps a novel method is proposed for the public
key steganography in JPEG image. Chaotic maps entail high complexity in the
used algorithm for embedding secret data in a medium. In this paper, discrete
cross- coupled chaotic maps are used to specifying the location of the
different parts of the secret data in the image. Modifying JPEG format during
compressing and decompressing, and also using public key enhanced difficulty of
the algorithm. Simulation results show that in addition to excessive capacity,
this method has high robustness and resistance against hackers and can be
applicable in secret communication. Also the PSNR value is high compared to the
other works.
