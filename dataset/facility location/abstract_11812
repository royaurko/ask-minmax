Electrical faults are in most cases dramatic events for magnets, due to the
large stored energy which is potentially available to be dissipated at the
fault location. After a reminder of the principles of electrostatics in Section
1, the basic mechanisms of conduction and breakdown in dielectrics are
summarized in Section 2. Section 3 introduces the types and function of the
electrical insulation in magnets, and Section 4 its relevant failure
mechanisms. Section 5 deals with ageing and, finally, Section 6 gives some
principles for testing. Though the School specifically dealt with warm magnets,
for completeness some principles of dielectric insulation for superconducting
accelerator magnets are briefly summarized in a dedicated appendix.
