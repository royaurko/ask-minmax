We report an analytical expression for the locations of Lindblad resonances
induced by a perturbing protoplanet, including the effect of disk gravity.
Inner, outer and differential torques are found to be enhanced compared to
situations where a keplerian velocity field for the dynamics of both the disk
and the planet is assumed. Inward migration is strongly accelerated when the
disk gravity is only accounted for in the planet orbital motion. The addition
of disk self-gravity slows down the planet drift but not enough to stop it.
