We investigate the scale on which the correlation arises between the 843 MHz
radio and the 60 micron far-infrared (FIR) emission from star forming regions
in the Milky way. The correlation, which exists on the smallest scales
investigated (down to ~4 pc), becomes noticeably tight on fields of size 30',
corresponding to physical scales of ~20-50 pc. The FIR to radio flux ratio on
this scale is consistent with the radio emission being dominated by thermal
emission. We also investigate the location dependence of q_mean, a parameter
measuring the mean FIR to radio flux ratio, of a sample of star forming
regions. We show that q_mean displays a modest dependence on galactic latitude.
If this is interpreted as a dependence on the intensity of star formation
activity, the result is consistent with studies of the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC) and other nearby galaxies that show elevated values for q in regions of
enhanced star formation.
