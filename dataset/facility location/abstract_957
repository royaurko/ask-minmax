A new package to simulate the formation of electrical pulses in segmented
true-coaxial high purity germanium detectors is presented. The computation of
the electric field and weighting potentials inside the detector as well as of
the trajectories of the charge carriers is described. In addition, the
treatment of bandwidth limitations and noise are discussed. Comparison of
simulated to measured pulses, obtained from an 18-fold segmented detector
operated inside a cryogenic test facility, are presented.
