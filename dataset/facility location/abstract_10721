Coquelin et al. studied biperiodic semiconductor superlattices, which consist
of alternating cell types, one with wide wells and the other narrow wells,
separated by equal strength barriers. If the wells were identical, it would be
a simply periodic system of $N = 2n$ half-cells. When asymmetry is introduced,
an allowed band splits at the Bragg point into two disjoint allowed bands. The
Bragg resonance turns into a transparent state located close to the band edge
of the lower(upper) band when the first(second) well is the wider. Analysis of
this system gives insight into how band splitting occurs. Further we consider
semi-periodic systems having $N= 2n+1$ half-cells. Surprisingly these have very
different transmission properties, with an envelope of maximum transmission
probability that crosses the envelope of minima at the transparent point.
