The purpose of the hardware presented in this contribution is to decrease the
energy threshold of the MAGIC telescopes without significantly increasing the
data acquisition rate. To achieve this purpose, we developed an additional
level of trigger that relies on the location in both MAGIC cameras where the
trigger is issued to rule out accidental events. This allows to decrease the
Discriminator Threshold (DT), which results in a reduction of the energy
threshold of the instrument. We simulated the Topo-trigger concept using the
standard MAGIC Monte Carlo (MC) and tested it with real telescope data. In this
paper we show the concept and results of these tests.
