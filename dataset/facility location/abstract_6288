One of the fundamental limitations to high bit rate, long distance,
telecommunication in optical fibers is Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD). Here
we introduce a conceptually new method to reduce PMD in optical fibers by
carrying out controlled rotations of polarization at predetermined locations
along the fiber. The distance between these controlled polarization rotations
must be less than both the beat length and the mode coupling length of the
fiber. This method can also be combined with the method in which the fiber is
spun while it drawn. The incidence of imperfections on the efficiency of the
method is analysed.
