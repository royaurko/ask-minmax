The Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search (MINOS) experiment's Far
Detector has been operational since July 2003, taking cosmic ray and
atmospheric neutrino data from its location in the Soudan Mine Underground Lab.
Numerous neutrino-induced muons have been observed. The detector's magnetic
field allows the first determination by a large underground detector of muon
charge and thus neutrino versus anti-neutrino on an event by event basis.
