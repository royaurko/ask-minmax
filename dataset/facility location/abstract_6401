We review how the use of recent precise data on kaon decays together with
forward dispersion relations (FDR) and Roy's equations allow us to determine
the sigma resonance pole position very precisely, by using only experimental
input. In addition, we present preliminary results for a modified set of
Roy-like equations with only one subtraction, that show a remarkable
improvement in the precision around the sigma resonance region. For practical
applications, these results are shown to be very well approximated by a very
simple conformal expansion.
