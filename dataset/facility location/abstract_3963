We investigate a stationary pair production cascade in the outer
magnetosphere of a spinning neutron star. The charge depletion due to global
flows of charged particles, causes a large electric field along the magnetic
field lines. Migratory electrons and/or positrons are accelerated by this field
to radiate curvature gamma-rays, some of which collide with the X-rays to
materialize as pairs in the gap. The replenished charges partially screen the
electric field, which is self-consistently solved together with the
distribution functions of particles and gamma-rays. If no current is injected
at neither of the boundaries of the accelerator, the gap is located around the
conventional null surface, where the local Goldreich-Julian charge density
vanishes. However, we first find that the gap position shifts outwards (or
inwards) when particles are injected at the inner (or outer) boundary. Applying
the theory to the Crab pulsar, we demonstrate that the pulsed TeV flux does not
exceed the observational upper limit for moderate infrared photon density and
that the gap should be located near to or outside of the conventional null
surface so that the observed spectrum of pulsed GeV fluxes may be emitted via a
curvature process. Some implications of the existence of a solution for a super
Goldreich-Julian current are discussed.
