The formation of hot subdwarf stars (sdBs), which are core helium-burning
stars located on the extended horizontal branch, is still not understood. Many
of the known hot subdwarf stars reside in close binary systems with short
orbital periods between a few hours and a few days with either M star or white
dwarf companions. Common envelope ejection is the most probable formation
channel. Among these, eclipsing systems are of special importance because it is
possible to constrain the parameters of both components tightly by combining
spectroscopic and light curve analyses. We report the discovery of two
eclipsing binaries with a brown dwarf (< 0.07 M*) and a 0.15 M* late main
sequence star companion in close orbits around sdB stars.
