The spread of invasive species can have far reaching environmental and
ecological consequences. Understanding invasion spread patterns and the
underlying process driving invasions are key to predicting and managing
invasions. We develop a set of statistical methods to characterize local spread
properties and demonstrate their application using historical data on the
spread of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, and hemlock wolly adelgid, Adelges
tsugae. Our method uses a Gaussian process fit to the surface of waiting times
to invasion in order to characterize the vector field of spread. Using this
method we estimate with statistical uncertainties the speed and direction of
spread at each location. Simulations from a stratified diffusion model verify
the accuracy of our method. We show how we may link local rates of spread to
environmental covariates for our two case studies.
