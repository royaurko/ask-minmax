The tombolo of Giens is located in the town of Hyeeres (France). We recall
the history of coastal erosion, and proeminent factors affecting the evolution
of the western tombolo. We then discuss the possibility of stabilizing the
western tombolo. Our argumentation relies on a coupled model integrating
swells, currents, water levels and sediment transport. We present the
conclusions of the simulations of various scenarios, including pre-existing
propositions from coastal engineering offices. We conclude that beach
replenishment seems to be necessary but not sufficient for the stabilization of
the beach. Breakwaters reveal effective particularly in the most exposed
northern area. Some solutions fulfill conditions so as to be elected as
satisfactory. We give a comparative analysis of the efficiency of 14
alternatives for the protection of the tombolo.
