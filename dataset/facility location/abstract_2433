We review a subset of experimental results from the heavy-ion collisions at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) facility at CERN. Excellent consistency is
observed across all the experiments at the LHC (at center of mass energy of
2.76 TeV) for the measurements such as charged particle multiplicity density,
azimuthal anisotropy coefficients and nuclear modification factor of charged
hadrons. Comparison to similar measurements from the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC) at lower energy (center of mass energy of 200 GeV) suggests
that system formed at LHC has a higher energy density, larger system size, and
lives for a longer time. These measurements are compared to model calculations
to obtain physical insights on the properties of matter created at the RHIC and
LHC.
