We develop a class of models with which we simulate the assembly of particles
into T1 capsid-like objects using Newtonian dynamics. By simulating assembly
for many different values of system parameters, we vary the forces that drive
assembly. For some ranges of parameters, assembly is facile, while for others,
assembly is dynamically frustrated by kinetic traps corresponding to malformed
or incompletely formed capsids. Our simulations sample many independent
trajectories at various capsomer concentrations, allowing for statistically
meaningful conclusions. Depending on subunit (i.e., capsomer) geometries,
successful assembly proceeds by several mechanisms involving binding of
intermediates of various sizes. We discuss the relationship between these
mechanisms and experimental evaluations of capsid assembly processes.
