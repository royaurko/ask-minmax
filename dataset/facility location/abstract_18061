We use the complete MOJAVE 1.5 Jy sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) to
examine the gamma-ray detection statistics of the brightest radio-loud blazars
in the northern sky. We find that 23% of these AGN were not detected above 0.1
GeV by the Fermi LAT during the 4-year 3FGL catalog period partly because of an
instrumental selection effect, and partly due to their lower Doppler boosting
factors. Blazars with synchrotron peaks in their spectral energy distributions
located below $10^{13.4}$ Hz also tend to have high-energy peaks that lie below
the 0.1 GeV threshold of the LAT, and are thus less likely to be detected by
Fermi. The non-detected AGN in the 1.5 Jy sample also have significantly lower
15 GHz radio modulation indices and apparent jet speeds, indicating that they
have lower than average Doppler factors. Since the effective amount of
relativistic Doppler boosting is enhanced in gamma-rays (particularly in the
case of external inverse-Compton scattering), this makes them less likely to
appear in the 3FGL catalog. Based on their observed properties, we have
identified several bright radio-selected blazars that are strong candidates for
future detection by Fermi.
