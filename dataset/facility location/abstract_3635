  Two continuous closed-cycle hydrogen Joule-Thomson (J-T) sorption coolers
have been fabricated and assembled by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for
the European Space Agency (ESA) Planck mission. Each refrigerator has been
designed to provide a total of ~ 1W of cooling power at two instrument
interfaces: they directly cool the Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) around
20K while providing a pre-cooling stage for a 4 K J-T mechanical refrigerator
for the High Frequency Instrument (HFI). After sub-system level validation at
JPL, the cryocoolers have been delivered to ESA in 2005. In this paper we
present the results of the cryogenic qualification and test campaigns of the
Nominal Unit on the flight model spacecraft performed at the CSL (Centre
Spatial de Liege) facilities in 2008. Test results in terms of input power,
cooling power, temperature, and temperature fluctuations over the flight
allowable ranges for these interfaces are reported and analyzed with respect to
mission requirements.
