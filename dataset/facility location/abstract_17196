Recent years have witnessed an unprecedented proliferation of social media.
People around the globe contributor, every day, millions of blog posts, social
network status updates, etc. This rich stream of information can be used to
identify, on an ongoing basis, emerging stories, and events that capture
popular attention. Stories can be identified via groups of tightly-coupled
real-world entities, namely the people, locations, products, etc., that are
involved in the story. The sheer scale, and rapid evolution of the data
involved necessitate highly efficient techniques for identifying important
stories at every point of time. The main challenge in real-time story
identification is the maintenance of dense subgraphs (corresponding to groups
of tightly-coupled entities) under streaming edge weight updates (resulting
from a stream of user-generated content). This is the first work to study the
efficient maintenance of dense subgraphs under such streaming edge weight
updates. For a wide range of definitions of density, we derive theoretical
results regarding the magnitude of change that a single edge weight update can
cause. Based on these, we propose a novel algorithm, DYNDENS, which outperforms
adaptations of existing techniques to this setting, and yields meaningful
results. Our approach is validated by a thorough experimental evaluation on
large-scale real and synthetic datasets.
