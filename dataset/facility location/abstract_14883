We present a 93' by 93' map of the area near the Local Group dwarf galaxy LGS
3, centered on an HI cloud 30' away from the galaxy. Previous contributors
associated this cloud with LGS 3 but relied on observations made with a 36'
beam. Our high-resolution (3.4'), wide-field Arecibo observations of the region
reveal that the HI cloud is distinct from the galaxy and suggest an interaction
between the two. We point out faint emission features in the map that may be
gas that has been tidally removed from the HI cloud by LGS 3. We also derive
the rotation curve of the cloud and find that it is in solid-body rotation out
to a radius of 10', beyond which the rotation velocity begins to decline.
Assuming a spherical geometry for the cloud, the implied mass is 2.8 x 10^7
(d/Mpc) M_{Sun}, where d is the distance in Mpc. The observed HI mass is 5.5 x
10^6 (d/Mpc)^2 M_{Sun}, implying that the cloud is dark-matter dominated unless
its distance is at least 1.9 Mpc. We propose that the cloud is a high-velocity
cloud that is undergoing a tidal interaction with LGS 3 and therefore is
located roughly 700 kpc away from the Milky Way. The cloud then contains a
total mass of ~2.0 x 10^7 M_{Sun}, 82% of which consists of dark matter.
