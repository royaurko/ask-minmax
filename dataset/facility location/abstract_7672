Despite first being detected in the 1970s, surprisingly little is known about
the OH main line maser population in the nearby starburst galaxy M82. Sometimes
referred to as 'kilomasers', they have isotropic luminosities intermediate
between Galactic masers and those found in more distant megamasers. Several
observations have been carried by this group over the last ten years in an
attempt to get a better handle on their nature. High velocity resolution VLA
observations in 2006 showed that almost all of the maser spots, distributed
across the central arcminute of the galaxy, were apparently coincident with
background continuum features, and a handful displayed multiple velocity
components. The majority of those with velocity structure are located on a
blue-shifted arc in the pv-plane, spatially located on an arc northward of the
peculiar source known as B41.95+57.5. Now, new results from high spatial and
spectral resolution observations with the EVN have resolved several of these
masers into multiple spatial components for the first time. The maser emission
is compared with known continuum sources in the galaxy, and we conclude that at
least some of the maser emission is from high-gain maser action.
