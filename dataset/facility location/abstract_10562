Here we investigate the propagation and scattering of surface water waves by
arrays of bottom-mounted cylindrical steps. Both periodic and random
arrangements of the steps are considered. The wave transmission through the
arrays is computed using the multiple scattering method based upon a recently
derived formulation. For the periodic case, the results are compared to the
band structure calculation. We demonstrate that complete band gaps can be
obtained in such a system. Furthermore, we show that the randomization of the
location of the steps can significantly reduce the transmission of water waves.
Comparison with other systems is also discussed.
