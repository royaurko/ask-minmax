Astronomical instrumentation is most of the time faced with challenging
requirements in terms of sensitivity, stability, complexity, etc., and
therefore leads to high performance developments that at first sight appear to
be suitable only for the specific design application at the telescope. However,
their usefulness in other disciplines and for other applications is not
excluded. The ERA2 facility is a lab demonstrator, based on a high-performance
astronomical spectrograph, which is intended to explore the innovation
potential of fiber-coupled multi-channel spectroscopy for spatially resolved
spectroscopy in life science, material sciences, and other areas of research.
