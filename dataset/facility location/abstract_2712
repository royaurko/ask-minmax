To improve the control efficiency of Superconducting Electron Cyclotron
Resonance Ion source(SECRAL) for Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou(HIRFL),
a upgrade version of control system for SECRAL is designed and set up. The
control software package is developed by Visual C++, which is able to control
and monitor all of the equipment for the SECRAL system about 130 parameters.
The previous analog power supplies are replaced by four digital power units at
High Voltage(HV) platform, The old slow speed of AC motors are upgraded to
servo motors newly for higher precision, stability and linearity. Meanwhile,
some control strategy and user interface are optimized. In order to prevent the
incorrect operation which may cause the quench of the superconducting magnet,
alarm and interlock protection functions are added to the software and
hardware. Since the upgraded SECRAL control system is online, it has been
running smoothly.
