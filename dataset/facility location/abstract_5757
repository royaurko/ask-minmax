It is proposed that TeV gamma-rays and neutrinos can be produced by cosmic
rays (CRs) through hadronic interactions in the innermost parts of the winds of
massive O and B stars. Convection prevents low-energy particles from
penetrating into the wind, leading to an absence of MeV-GeV counterparts. It is
argued that groups of stars located close to the CR acceleration sites in OB
stellar associations may be detectable by ground-based Cherenkov telescopes.
