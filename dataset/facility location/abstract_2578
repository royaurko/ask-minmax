A new method for parallel generation of $q$-valued pseudorandom sequence
based on the presentation of systems generating logical formulae by means of
arithmetic polynomials is proposed. Fragment consisting of $k$-elements of
$q$-valued pseudorandom sequence may be obtained by means of single calculation
of a single recursion numerical formula. It is mentioned that the method of the
"arithmetization" of generation may be used and further developed in order to
protect the encryption gears from cryptographic onset, resulting in the
initiating of mass hardware failures. The achieved results may be widely
applied to the realization of perspective high-performance cryptographic
facilities for information protection.
