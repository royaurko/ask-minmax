The electromagnetic decays of the Sig0(1385) and Lambda(1520) hyperons were
studied in photon-induced reactions gamma p -> K+ Lambda(1116)gamma in the CLAS
detector at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. We report the
first observation of the radiative decay of the Sig0(1385) and a measurement of
the Lambda(1520) radiative decay width. For the Sig0(1385) -> Lambda(1116)gamma
transition, we measured a partial width of 479+/-120(stat)+81-100(sys) keV,
larger than all of the existing model predictions. For the Lambda(1520) ->
Lambda(1116)gamma transition, we obtained a partial width of
167+/-43(stat)+26-12(sys) keV.
