In the last years there has been remarkable progress in the comparison of
experimental data on the shape of event-by-event distributions of conserved
quantities and lattice thermodynamic predictions based on the grand canonical
ensemble. In this talk we discuss how the QCD crossover temperature and the
freezeout curve are extracted from the analysis of fluctuations. We report that
one can also go further and locate the QCD critical point already from
published data. We also list the systematics which must be brought under
control in future.
