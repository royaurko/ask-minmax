The World Wide Web (WWW) is a wonderful tool to provide users with
documentation and tools that make the preparation and running of an experiment
a little easier. We present a set of tools that allow one to estimate the
activation of a sample in the neutron beam, or to calculate the absorption of a
sample. Ever tried to figure out the time for the next sample change - here our
scheduler can help. In addition there is a simple database that can be used to
keep track of all the data files collected at various facilities. We present
these little tools, but also demonstrate how easy it is to create new WWW based
tools that make the life of users easier.
