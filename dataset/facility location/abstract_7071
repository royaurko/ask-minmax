Electric currents in solar active regions are thought to provide the energy
released via magnetic reconnection in solar flares. Vertical electric current
densities $J_z$ at the photosphere may be estimated from vector magnetogram
data, subject to substantial uncertainties. The values provide boundary
conditions for nonlinear force- free modelling of active region magnetic
fields. A method is presented for estimating values of $J_z$ taking into
account uncertainties in vector magnetogram field values, and minimizing
$J_z^2$ across the active region. The method is demonstrated using the boundary
values of the field for a force-free twisted bipole, with the addition of noise
at randomly chosen locations.
