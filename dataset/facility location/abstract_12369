Within the key project "Herschel M33 extended survey" (HerM33es), we are
studying the physical and chemical processes driving star formation and
galactic evolution in the nearby galaxy M33, combining the study of local
conditions affecting individual star formation with properties only becoming
apparent on global scales. Here, we present recent results obtained by the
HerM33es team. Combining Spitzer and Herschel data ranging from 3.6um to 500um,
along with HI, Halpha, and GALEX UV data, we have studied the dust at high
spatial resolutions of 150pc, providing estimators of the total infrared (TIR)
brightness and of the star formation rate. While the temperature of the warm
dust at high brightness is driven by young massive stars, evolved stellar
populations appear to drive the temperature of the cold dust. Plane-parallel
models of photon dominated regions (PDRs) fail to reproduce fully the [CII],
[OI], and CO maps obtained in a first spectroscopic study of one 2'x2'
subregion of M33, located on the inner, northern spiral arm and encompassing
the HII region BCLMP302.
