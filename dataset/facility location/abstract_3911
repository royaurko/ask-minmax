In a previous work we have demonstrated the feasibility of high-frame-rate,
fast-neutron radiography of generic air-water two-phase flows in a 1.5 cm
thick, rectangular flow channel. The experiments have been carried out at the
high-intensity, white-beam facility of the Physikalisch-Technische
Bundesanstalt, Germany, using an multi-frame, time-resolved detector developed
for fast neutron resonance radiography. The results were however not fully
optimal and therefore we have decided to modify the detector and optimize it
for the given application, which is described in the present work. Furthermore,
we managed to improve the image post-processing methodology and the noise
suppression. Using the tailored detector and the improved post-processing
significant increase in the image quality and an order of magnitude lower
exposure times, down to 3.33 ms, have been achieved with minimized motion
artifacts. Similar to the previous study, different two-phase flow regimes such
as bubbly slug and churn flows have been examined. The enhanced imaging quality
enables an improved prediction of two-phase flow parameters like the
instantaneous volumetric gas fraction, bubble size and bubble velocities.
Instantaneous velocity fields around the gas enclosures can also be more
robustly predicted using optical flow methods as previously.
