We bring the two color maps for the plane component magnetic field of our
Galaxy in coordinates of (R;l) and (DM;l). It was shown that magnetic field has
reversals of the direction in neighbor spiral arms, in agreement with known
models for the Galactic magnetic field. For the Sagittarius spiral arm region
there is, however, some disagreement with standard magnetic field models. The
major discrepancy is the fact that in the Sagittarius arm region the magnetic
field in Southern hemisphere of the Galaxy, have opposite direction to the
field of the Northern hemisphere. We think that the Sagittarius spiral arm, at
last the magnetic spiral arm in this region is not symmetric to the Galactic
plane, and is located mainly in Northern hemisphere.
