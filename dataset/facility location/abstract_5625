In this letter we propose a physical explanation for recently reported
correlations between pairs of close and antipodal gamma-ray bursts from
publicly available BATSE catalogue. Our model is based on the cosmological
scenario in which bursters are located at cosmological distances of order of
0.5--2~Gpc. Observed distribution of gamma-ray bursts strongly suports this
assumption. If so gamma-ray bursts may provide a very good probe for
investigating the topological structure of the Universe. We notice that
correlation between antipodal events may in fact indicate that we live in the
so called Ellis' small universe which has Friedman-Roberston-Walker metric
structure and nontrivial topology.
