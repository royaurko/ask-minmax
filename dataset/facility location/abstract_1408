Over the next decade, we can expect time domain astronomy to flourish at
optical and radio wavelengths. In parallel with these efforts, a dedicated
transient "machine" operating at higher energies (X-ray band through soft
gamma-rays) is required to reveal the unique subset of events with variable
emission predominantly visible above 100 eV. Here we focus on the transient
phase space never yet sampled due to the lack of a sensitive, wide-field and
triggering facility dedicated exclusively to catching high energy transients
and enabling rapid coordinated multi-wavelength follow-up. We first describe
the advancements in our understanding of known X-ray transients that can only
be enabled through such a facility and then focus on the classes of transients
theoretically predicted to be out of reach of current detection capabilities.
Finally there is the exciting opportunity of revealing new classes of X-ray
transients and unveiling their nature through coordinated follow-up
observations at longer wavelengths.
