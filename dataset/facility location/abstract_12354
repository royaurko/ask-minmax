In this paper we describe a new formulation for the 3D salient local features
based on the voxel grid inspired by the Scale Invariant Feature Transform
(SIFT). We use it to identify the salient keypoints (invariant points) on a 3D
voxelized model and calculate invariant 3D local feature descriptors at these
keypoints. We then use the bag of words approach on the 3D local features to
represent the 3D models for shape retrieval. The advantages of the method are
that it can be applied to rigid as well as to articulated and deformable 3D
models. Finally, this approach is applied for 3D Shape Retrieval on the McGill
articulated shape benchmark and then the retrieval results are presented and
compared to other methods.
