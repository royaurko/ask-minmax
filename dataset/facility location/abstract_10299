Critical exponents for the 3D O(n)-symmetric model with n > 3 are estimated
on the base of six-loop renormalization-group (RG) expansions. A simple
Pade-Borel technique is used for the resummation of the RG series and the Pade
approximants [L/1] are shown to give rather good numerical results for all
calculated quantities. For large n, the fixed point location g_c and the
critical exponents are also determined directly from six-loop expansions
without addressing the resummation procedure. An analysis of the numbers
obtained shows that resummation becomes unnecessary when n exceeds 28 provided
an accuracy of about 0.01 is adopted as satisfactory for g_c and critical
exponents. Further, results of the calculations performed are used to estimate
the numerical accuracy of the 1/n-expansion. The same value n = 28 is shown to
play the role of the lower boundary of the domain where this approximation
provides high-precision estimates for the critical exponents.
