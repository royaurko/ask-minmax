We provide a geometric method to stabilize asymptotically the periodic orbits
of generic three-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamical systems. The main advantage
of this method is that one needs not know any parameterization of the orbit to
be stabilized, the only requirement about the orbit is the knowledge of its
geometric location, on some dynamically invariant set. The stabilization
procedure is illustrated in the case of Euler's equations from the free rigid
body dynamics and respectively the Rikitake model of geomagnetic reversal.
