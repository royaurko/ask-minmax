We present a photometric search for UCD candidates in the nearby galaxy group
NGC 1023 (d=11 Mpc) -- the poorest environment searched for UCDs yet --, based
on wide field imaging with CFHT. After photometric and morphological selection,
we obtain a sample of 21 UCD candidates with -12<M_V<-11 mag, if located at NGC
1023's distance. From spectroscopy taken at Calar Alto observatory, we identify
the UCD candidate in closest projection to NGC 1023 as an emission line
background galaxy. Our photometric data show that in the NGC 1023 group, the
mass spectrum of analogs to Fornax/Virgo UCD is restricted to about 1/4 of the
maximum Fornax/Virgo UCD mass. More spectroscopy is needed to further constrain
the mass range of UCDs in this galaxy group.
