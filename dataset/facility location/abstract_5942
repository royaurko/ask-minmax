Using an ab-initio electronic structure method, I study the (111) surfaces of
the half-metallic NiMnSb alloy. In all cases there is a very pronounced surface
state within the minority gap which destroys the half-metallicity This state
survives for several atomic layers below the surface contrary to the (001)
surfaces where surface states were located only at the surface layer. The lower
dimensionality of the surface leads in general to large enhancements of the
surface spin moments.
