Recent studies of atmospheric neutrinos and the results from CHOOZ and
Palo-Verde experiment call for new and more sensitive searches for neutrino
oscillations at reactors. The main goal of the project considered here is to
look for very small mixing angle oscillations of electron neutrinos in the
atmospheric neutrino mass parameter region around \Delta m^2 ~3 10^-3 eV^2 and
to define the element U_{e3} of the neutrino mixing matrix (U_{e3}is the
contribution of the mass-3 state to the electron neutrino flavor state). The
practical goal of the project is to decrease, relative to the CHOOZ, the
statistic and systematic errors as much as possible. To achieve this we plan to
use two identical antineutrino detectors each with a ~50-ton liquid
scintillator target located at ~1100 m and ~250 m from the underground reactor
(~600 mwe). Much attention is given to the detector calibration and monitoring
procedures. As a first step we consider two much smaller pilot detectors each
of ~ a 3 ton target mass stationed at ~20 m and 35-60 m from the reactor. The
goals of this first stage are: (i) to accumulate necessary experience and (ii)
to investigate with electron neutrinos the LSND mass parameter region.
