In this article, we study the Cyber-Human Interaction (CHI) based approach
that the "Human" part sets a list of location-based objectives and makes the
pathway decision whereas the "Cyber" part provides the pathway suggestion,
infer heuristics from the environment along the pathway and incrementally
resolve the location-based objectives with new heuristics for indoor
localization. For this study, we implement a CHI-based system on mobile phone.
The CHI-based system offers the pathway suggestion and the solution of the
location-based objectives based on its trajectory management. Without any
priori knowledge on the area of interest and any aid from other equipments, a
laborer can achieve his location-based objectives by walking through the area
of interest and simultaneously online interacting with the CHI-based system
installed in his phone. In evaluation, we conduct the experiments and show the
advantage CHI in reducing the time cost and the expense cost for the laborer.
