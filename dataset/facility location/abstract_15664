An emerging class of data-intensive applications involve the geographically
dispersed extraction of complex scientific information from very large
collections of measured or computed data. Such applications arise, for example,
in experimental physics, where the data in question is generated by
accelerators, and in simulation science, where the data is generated by
supercomputers. So-called Data Grids provide essential infrastructure for such
applications, much as the Internet provides essential services for applications
such as e-mail and the Web. We describe here two services that we believe are
fundamental to any Data Grid: reliable, high-speed transporet and replica
management. Our high-speed transport service, GridFTP, extends the popular FTP
protocol with new features required for Data Grid applciations, such as
striping and partial file access. Our replica management service integrates a
replica catalog with GridFTP transfers to provide for the creation,
registration, location, and management of dataset replicas. We present the
design of both services and also preliminary performance results. Our
implementations exploit security and other services provided by the Globus
Toolkit.
