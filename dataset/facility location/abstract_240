We report on optical observations of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) followed up by
our collaboration with the 1.23m telescope located at the Calar Alto
observatory. The 1.23m telescope is an old facility, currently undergoing
upgrades to enable fully autonomous response to GRB alerts. We discuss the
current status of the control system upgrade of the 1.23m telescope. The
upgrade is being done by the ARAE our group, based on members of IAA (Instituto
de Astrofiisica de Andalucia). Currently the ARAE group is responsible to
develop the BOOTES network of robotic telescopes based on the Remote Telescope
System, 2nd Version (RTS2), which controls the available instruments and
interacts with the EPICS database of Calar Alto. Currently the telescope can
run fully autonomously or under observer supervision using RTS2. The fast
reaction response mode for GRB reaction (typically with response times below 3
minutes from the GRB onset) still needs some development and testing. The
telescope is usually operated in legacy interactive mode, with periods of
supervised autonomous runs under RTS2. We show the preliminary results of
several GRBs followed up with observer intervention during the testing phase of
the 1.23m control software upgrade.
