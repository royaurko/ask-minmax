We present the results of processing of Age-Momentum Correlation (AMOC)
spectra that were measured for glycerol by the Gamma-induced positron
spectroscopy (GiPS) facility. Our research has shown that the shape of
experimental s(t) curve cannot be explained without introduction of the
intermediate state of positronium (Ps), called quasi-free Ps. This state yields
the wide Doppler line near zero lifetimes. We discuss the possible properties
of this intermediate Ps state from the viewpoint of developed model. The amount
of annihilation events produced by quasi-free Ps is estimated to be less than
5% of total annihilations. In the proposed model, quasi-free Ps serves as a
precursor for trapped Ps of para- and ortho-states.
