We report on the low temperature behaviour of the colloidal electrolyte by
means of Molecular Dynamics simulations, where the electrostatic interactions
were modeled using effective screened interactions. As in previous works, we
have found a region of gas-liquid coexistence located in the low $T$- low
$\rho$ region. At temperatures much lower than the critical one, the system
cannot reach equilibrium, that is, the gas-liquid transition is arrested. Two
different mechanisms have been identified to cause arrest: gelation in the
lowest $T$ and crowding at intermediate $T$ values, the latter associated with
the crossing point between the binodal and the glass line. To test the latter,
the dynamics of the colloidal electrolyte near this crossing point has been
computed and compared to the universal predictions of the ideal MCT. As in
other glass-forming liquids, we found good agreement between this mean field
theory and the dynamics of this complex system, although it fails just at the
transition. Interestingly, in this region we found that the dynamics of this
system is driven mainly by the steric interactions, showing all the typical
properties of a repulsive colloidal glass. Finally, the isodiffusivity lines
show that in this system with short range attractions, there is no re-entrant
glass phenomenon, as opposed to monocomponent systems.
