Dome A on the Antarctic plateau is likely one of the best observing sites on
Earth thanks to the excellent atmospheric conditions present at the site during
the long polar winter night. We present high-cadence time-series aperture
photometry of 10,000 stars with i<14.5 mag located in a 23 square-degree region
centered on the south celestial pole. The photometry was obtained with one of
the CSTAR telescopes during 128 days of the 2008 Antarctic winter.
  We used this photometric data set to derive site statistics for Dome A and to
search for variable stars. Thanks to the nearly-uninterrupted synoptic
coverage, we find 6 times as many variables as previous surveys with similar
magnitude limits. We detected 157 variable stars, of which 55% are
unclassified, 27% are likely binaries and 17% are likely pulsating stars. The
latter category includes delta Scuti, gamma Doradus and RR Lyrae variables. One
variable may be a transiting exoplanet.
