A sample of 11 thousand galaxies with radial velocities V_ LG < 3500 km/s is
used to study the features of the local distribution of luminous (stellar) and
dark matter within a sphere of radius of around 50 Mpc around us. The average
density of matter in this volume, Omega_m,loc=0.08+-0.02, turns out to be much
lower than the global cosmic density Omega_m,glob=0.28+-0.03. We discuss three
possible explanations of this paradox: 1) galaxy groups and clusters are
surrounded by extended dark halos, the major part of the mass of which is
located outside their virial radii; 2) the considered local volume of the
Universe is not representative, being situated inside a giant void; and 3) the
bulk of matter in the Universe is not related to clusters and groups, but is
rather distributed between them in the form of massive dark clumps. Some
arguments in favor of the latter assumption are presented. Besides the two
well-known inconsistencies of modern cosmological models with the observational
data: the problem of missing satellites of normal galaxies and the problem of
missing baryons, there arises another one - the issue of missing dark matter.
