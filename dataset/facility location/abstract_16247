We present the discovery of an absorption-line redshift of z = 2.609 for GRB
090426, establishing the first firm lower limit to a redshift for a gamma-ray
burst with an observed duration of <2 s. With a rest-frame burst duration of
T_90z = 0.35 s and a detailed examination of the peak energy of the event, we
suggest that this is likely (at >90% confidence) a member of the short/hard
phenomenological class of GRBs. From analysis of the optical-afterglow spectrum
we find that the burst originated along a very low HI column density sightline,
with N_HI < 3.2 x 10^19 cm^-2. Our GRB 090426 afterglow spectrum also appears
to have weaker low-ionisation absorption (Si II, C II) than ~95% of previous
afterglow spectra. Finally, we also report the discovery of a blue, very
luminous, star-forming putative host galaxy (~2 L*) at a small angular offset
from the location of the optical afterglow. We consider the implications of
this unique GRB in the context of burst duration classification and our
understanding of GRB progenitor scenarios.
