HST and FUSE have provided high signal-to-noise, high-resolution spectra of a
variety of cataclysmic variables and have allowed a detailed characterization
of FUV emission sources in both high and low states. Here, I describe how this
has advanced our understanding of non-magnetic CVs and the substantial
interpretive challenges still posed by the observations. In the high state, the
FUV spectra are dominated by disk emission that is modified by scattering in
high and low velocity material located above the disk photosphere. Progress is
being made toward reproducing the high-state spectra using kinematic
prescriptions of the velocity field and new ionization and radiative transfer
codes. In conjunction with hydrodynamical simulations of the outflows, accurate
estimates of the mass loss rates and determination of the launching mechanism
are likely forthcoming. In quiescence, the FUV spectra reveal contributions
from the WD and the disk. Quantitative analyses have lead to solid measurements
of the temperatures and abundances of a number of WDs in CVs, and of a
determination of the response of the WD to an outburst. Basic challenges exist
in terms of understanding the other components of the emission in quiescence,
however, and these are needed to better understand the structure of the disk
and the physical mechanisms resulting in ongoing accretion in quiescence.
