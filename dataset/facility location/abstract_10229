KNO scaling, i.e. the collapse of multiplicity distributions P_n onto a
universal scaling curve manifests when P_n is expressed as the distribution of
the standardized multiplicity (n-c)/lambda with c and lambda being location and
scale parameters governed by leading particle effects and the growth of average
multiplicity. At very high energies, strong violation of KNO scaling behavior
is observed (p-pbar) and expected to occur (e+e-). This challenges one to
introduce novel, physically well motivated and preferably simple scaling rules
obeyed by high-energy data. One possibility what I find useful and which
satisfies the above requirements is the repetition of the original scaling
prescription (shifting and rescaling) in Mellin space, that is, for the
multiplicity moments' rank. This scaling principle is discussed here,
illustrating its capabilities both on model predictions and on real data.
