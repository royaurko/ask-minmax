Information Technology (IT) significantly impacts the environment throughout
its life cycle. Most enterprises have not paid enough attention to this until
recently. IT's environmental impact can be significantly reduced by behavioral
changes, as well as technology changes. Given the relative energy and materials
inefficiency of most IT infrastructures today, many green IT initiatives can be
easily tackled at no incremental cost. The Green Grid - a non-profit trade
organization of IT professionals is such an initiative, formed to initiate the
issues of power and cooling in data centers, scattered world-wide. The Green
Grid seeks to define best practices for optimizing the efficient consumption of
power at IT equipment and facility levels, as well as the manner in which
cooling is delivered at these levels hence, providing promising attitude in
bringing down the environmental hazards, as well as proceeding to the new era
of green computing. In this paper we review the various analytical aspects of
The Green Grid upon the data centers and found green facts.
