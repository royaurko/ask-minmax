We present the results of a FUSE observation of an X-ray selected knot in the
Vela supernova remnant. Spectra were obtained through the 30"x30" low
resolution aperture and the 4"x20" medium resolution aperture. O VI 1032,1038
and C III 977 are detected strongly in both spectra, and S VI 933,944 is
detected weakly only in the larger aperture spectrum. We also report the first
detection of C II 1037 emission in a supernova remnant. The spectra show the
presence of two kinematic components along the line of sight - one with both
low and high excitation emission centered at a velocity of -50 km/s and another
with only low excitation emission centered at a velocity of +100 km/s. We
associate the -50 km/s component with the observed X-ray knot, and find a
dynamical pressure of 3.7x10^{-10} dyne cm^{-2} driving the shock. We compare
our results with data obtained using the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope at
nearby locations and find that differences in the spectra imply the existence
of two emitting components in the X-ray knot. Based on the X-ray morphology
seen in a ROSAT HRI image, we identify two distinct regions which can be
associated with these two components whose ultraviolet emission differs
dramatically. These observations demonstrate the importance of high spectral
resolution in understanding the proper physical relationships between the
various emitting components in supernova remnants.
