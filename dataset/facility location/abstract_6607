This paper proposes a verification-based decoding approach for reconstruction
of a sparse signal with incremental sparse measurements. In its first step, the
verification-based decoding algorithm is employed to reconstruct the signal
with a fixed number of sparse measurements. Often, it may fail as the number of
sparse measurements may be not enough, possibly due to an underestimate of the
signal sparsity. However, we observe that even if this first recovery fails,
many component samples of the sparse signal have been identified. Hence, it is
natural to further employ incremental measurements tuned to the unidentified
samples with known locations. This approach has been proven very efficiently by
extensive simulations.
