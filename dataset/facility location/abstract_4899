We study the interference and outage statistics in a slotted Aloha ad hoc
network, where the spatial distribution of nodes is non-stationary and
isotropic. In such a network, outage probability and local throughput depend on
both the particular location in the network and the shape of the spatial
distribution. We derive in closed-form certain distributional properties of the
interference that are important for analyzing wireless networks as a function
of the location and the spatial shape. Our results focus on path loss exponents
2 and 4, the former case not being analyzable before due to the stationarity
assumption of the spatial node distribution. We propose two metrics for
measuring local throughput in non-stationary networks and discuss how our
findings can be applied to both analysis and optimization.
