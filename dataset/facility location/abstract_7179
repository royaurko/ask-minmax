We present a weak-lensing analysis of a region around the galaxy cluster Cl
1604+4304 (z=0.897) on the basis of the deep observations with the HST/WFPC2.
We apply a variant of Schneider's aperture mass technique to the observed WFPC2
field and obtain the distribution of weak-lensing signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio
within the field. The resulting S/N map reveals a clear pronounced peak located
about 1.7 arcmin (850h_{50}^{-1} kpc at z=0.897) southwest of the second peak
associated with the optical cluster center determined from the dynamical
analysis of Postman et al. A non-linear finite-field inversion method has been
used to reconstruct the projected mass distribution from the observed shear
field. The reconstructed mass map shows a super-critical feature at the
location of the S/N peak as well as in the cluster central region. Assuming the
redshift distribution of field galaxies, we obtain the total mass in the
observed field to be 1.0 h_{50}^{-1} 10^{15} M_sun for <z>=1.0. The estimated
mass within a circular aperture of radius 280h_{50}^{-1} kpc centered on the
dark clump is 2.4h_{50}^{-1} 10^{14} M_sun. We have confirmed the existence of
the ` dark ' mass concentration from another deep HST observation with a
slightly different ~20 arcsec pointing.
