Using high frequency (12-22 GHz) VLBA observations we confirm the existence
of a Faraday rotation measure gradient of ~ 500 rad/m^2/mas transverse to the
jet axis in the quasar 3C 273. The gradient is seen in two epochs spaced
roughly six months apart. This stable transverse rotation measure gradient is
expected if a helical magnetic field wraps around the jet. The overall order to
the magnetic field in the inner projected 40 parsecs is consistent with a
helical field. However, we find an unexpected increase in fractional
polarization along the edges of the source, contrary to expectations. This high
fractional polarization rules out internal Faraday rotation, but is not readily
explained by a helical field. After correcting for the rotation measure, the
intrinsic magnetic field direction in the jet of 3C 273 changes from parallel
to nearly perpendicular to the projected jet motion at two locations. If a
helical magnetic field causes the observed rotation measure gradient then the
synchrotron emitting electrons must be separate from the helical field region.
The presence or absence of transverse rotation measure gradients in other
sources is also discussed.
