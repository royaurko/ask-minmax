The present von Neumann computing paradigm involves a significant amount of
information transfer between a central processing unit (CPU) and memory, with
concomitant limitations in the actual execution speed. However, it has been
recently argued that a different form of computation, dubbed memcomputing
[Nature Physics, 9, 200-202 (2013)] and inspired by the operation of our brain,
can resolve the intrinsic limitations of present day architectures by allowing
for computing and storing of information on the same physical platform. Here we
show a simple and practical realization of memcomputing that utilizes
easy-to-build memcapacitive systems. We name this architecture Dynamic
Computing Random Access Memory (DCRAM). We show that DCRAM provides
massively-parallel and polymorphic digital logic, namely it allows for
different logic operations with the same architecture, by varying only the
control signals. In addition, by taking into account realistic parameters, its
energy expenditures can be as low as a few fJ per operation. DCRAM is fully
compatible with CMOS technology, can be realized with current fabrication
facilities, and therefore can really serve as an alternative to the present
computing technology.
