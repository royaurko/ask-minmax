We present multiwavelength optical linear polarimetric observations of 69
stars toward the young open cluster Be 59. The observations reveal the presence
of three dust layers located at the distances of \sim300, \sim500 and \sim700
pc. The dust layers produce a total polarization Pv \sim 5.5 per cent. The mean
values of polarization and polarization angles due to the dust layers are found
to increase systematically with distance. We show that polarimetry in
combination with the (U - B) - (B - V) colour-colour diagram yields a better
identification of cluster members. The polarization measurements suggest that
the polarization due the intra-cluster medium is \sim 2.2 per cent. An
anomalous reddening law exists for the cluster region, indicating a relatively
larger grain size than that in the diffuse ISM. The spatial variation of the
polarization and E(B - V) is found to increase with radial distance from the
cluster center, whereas the {\theta}v and {\lambda}max are found to decrease
with increasing radial distance from the cluster center. About 40 per cent of
cluster members show the signatures of either intrinsic polarization or
rotation in their polarization angles. There is an indication that the star
light of the cluster members might have been depolarized because of non-uniform
alignment of dust grains in the foreground dust layers and in the intra-cluster
medium.
