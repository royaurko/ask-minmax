We have conducted an optical study of the environments of seven radio-loud
quasars at redshifts 1<z<1.6. In this paper we describe deep B and R band
images obtained for fields of $\sim6\times$6 arcmin around these quasars with
3$\sigma$ limiting magnitudes of $B\sim26$ and $R\sim25.4$. We found an
statistically significant excess of {\it faint} (B>22.5 and R>22.0) galaxies on
scales of r<170'' and r<35'' around the quasars. The number of excess galaxies,
their magnitudes and the angular extension of the excesses are compatible with
clusters of galaxies at the redshift of the QSOs. We also found that the
quasars of our sample are in general {\it not} located at the peak of the
density distribution, lying in a projected distance of about $\sim$70'' from
it. This result agrees with the scenario of a link between overdensities of
galaxies around radio sources and the origin of their radio emission.
