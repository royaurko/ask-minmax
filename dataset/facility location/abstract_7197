We have obtained high resolution (<1") deep x-ray images of the globular
cluster 47Tucanae (NGC 104) with the Chandra X-ray Observatory to study the
population of compact binaries in the high stellar density core. A 70 kilosec
exposure of the cluster reveals a centrally concentrated population of faint
(Lx ~10^{30-33} erg/s) x-ray sources, with at least 108 located within the
central 2arcmin X 2.5arcmin and at least half with Lx <10^{30.5} erg/s. All 15
millisecond pulsars (MSPs) recently located precisely by radio observations are
identified, though two are unresolved by Chandra. The x-ray spectral and
temporal characteristics, as well as initial optical identifications with the
Hubble Space Telescope, suggest that >~50% are millisecond pulsars, ~30% are
accreting white dwarfs, ~15% are main sequence binaries in flare outbursts and
only 2 to 3 are quiescent low mass x-ray binaries containing neutron stars, the
conventional progenitors of MSPs. An approximate upper limit of ~470Msun for
the mass of an accreting central black hole in the cluster is derived. These
observations provide the first x-ray "color-magnitude" diagram for a globular
cluster and census of its compact object and binary population.
