This article compiles and examines a comprehensive coronal
magnetic-null-point survey created by potential-field-source-surface (PFSS)
modeling and Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA)
observations. The locations of 582 potential magnetic null points in the corona
were predicted from the PFSS model between Carrington Rotations (CR) 2098 (June
2010) and 2139 (July 2013). These locations were manually inspected, using
contrast-enhanced SDO/AIA images in 171 angstroms at the east and west solar
limb, for structures associated with nulls. A Kolmogorov--Smirnov (K--S) test
showed a statistically significant difference between observed and predicted
latitudinal distributions of null points. This finding is explored further to
show that the observability of null points could be affected by the Sun's
asymmetric hemisphere activity. Additional K--S tests show no effect on
observability related to eigenvalues associated with the fan and spine
structure surrounding null points or to the orientation of spine. We find that
approximately 31% of nulls obtained from the PFSS model were observed in
SDO/AIA images at one of the solar limbs. An observed null on the east solar
limb had a 51.6% chance of being observed on the west solar limb. Predicted
null points going back to CR 1893 (March 1995) were also used for comparing
radial and latitudinal distributions of nulls to previous work and to test for
correlation of solar activity to the number of predicted nulls.
