The beam transport system for the Advanced Hydrotest Facility (AHF)
anticipates multiple beam splitters [1]. Monitoring two separated beams in a
common beam pipe in the splitter sections imposes certain requirements on
diagnostics for these sections. In this note we explore a two-beam system in a
generic beam monitor and study the feasibility of resolving the positions of
the two beams with a single diagnostic device.
