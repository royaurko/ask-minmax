The unidentified EGRET source 3EG J1828+0142, located at (l,b) ~ (31.9,5.8)
(Hartman et al. 1999), is particularly enigmatic since it displays very high
variability over timescales of months (Torres et al. 2000, Tompkins 1999) yet
no blazar has been found within the 95% confidence contour of the gamma-ray
location error-box (Punsly et al 2000). It also has an unusually steep
gamma-ray spectral index of Gamma=2.76 +/- 0.39. It's relatively low latitude
may be indicative of a galactic origin of the variable GeV flux. A
multifrequency study of this source has been initiated and may reveal the
presence of a novel type of compact object: a galactic 'microblazar'. X-ray
data, especially those of high spatial resolution from CHANDRA, would be
particularly useful in establishing such a connection.
