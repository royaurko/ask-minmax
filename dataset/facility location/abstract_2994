We study the effect of naval nuclear reactors on the study of neutrino
oscillations. We find that the presence of naval reactors at unknown locations
and times may limit the accuracy of future very long baseline reactor-based
neutrino oscillation experiments. At the same time we argue that a nuclear
powered surface ship such as a large Russian ice-breaker may provide an ideal
source for precision experiments. While the relatively low reactor power would
in this case require a larger detector, the source could be conveniently
located at essentially any distance from a detector built at an underground
location near a shore in a region of the world far away from other nuclear
installations. The variable baseline would allow for a precise measurement of
backgrounds and greatly reduced systematics from reactor flux and detector
efficiency. In addition, once the oscillation measurement is completed, the
detector could perform geological neutrino and astrophysical measurements with
minimal reactor background.
