We present the results of a search for gravitational waves (GWs) from
individual sources using high cadence observations of PSR B1937+21. The data
were acquired from an intensive observation campaign with the Lovell telescope
at Jodrell Bank, between June 2011 and May 2013. The almost daily cadence
achieved, allowed us to be sensitive to GWs with frequencies up to
$4.98\times10^{-6}\,\rm {Hz}$, extending the upper bound of the typical
frequency range probed by Pulsar Timing Arrays. We used observations taken at
three different radio frequencies with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope
in order to correct for dispersion measure effects and scattering variances.
The corrected timing residuals exhibited an unmodeled periodic noise with an
amplitude $~150\,\rm {ns}$ and a frequency of $3.4\rm {yr}^{-1}$. As the signal
is not present in the entire data set, we attributed it to the rotational
behaviour of the pulsar, ruling out the possibilities of being either due to a
GW or an asteroid as the cause. After removing this noise component, we placed
limits on the GW strain of individual sources equaling to $h_{\rm
s}=1.53\times10^{-11}$ and $h_{\rm s}=4.99\times10^{-14}$ at $10^{-7}\,\rm
{Hz}$ for random and optimal sources locations respectively.
