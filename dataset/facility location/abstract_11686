Accuracy of throwing in games and sports is governed by how errors at
projectile release are propagated by flight dynamics. To address the question
of what governs the choice of throwing strategy, we use a simple model of
throwing with an arm modelled as a hinged bar of fixed length that can release
a projectile at any angle and angular velocity. We show that the amplification
of deviations in launch parameters from a one parameter family of solution
curves is quantified by the largest singular value of an appropriate Jacobian.
This allows us to predict a preferred throwing style in terms of this singular
value, which itself depends on target location and the target shape. Our
analysis also allows us to characterize the trade-off between speed and
accuracy despite not including any effects of signal-dependent noise. Using
nonlinear calculations for propagating finite input-noise, we find that an
underarm throw to a target leads to an undershoot, but an overarm throw does
not. Finally, we consider the limit of the arm-length vanishing, i.e. shooting
a projectile, and find that the most accurate shooting angle bifurcates as the
ratio of the relative noisiness of the initial conditions crosses a threshold.
