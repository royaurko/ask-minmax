In systems with ``balanced loss and gain'', the PT-symmetry is broken by
increasing the non-hermiticity or the loss-gain strength. We show that finite
lattices with oscillatory, PT-symmetric potentials exhibit a new class of
PT-symmetry breaking and restoration. We obtain the PT phase diagram as a
function of potential periodicity, which also controls the location complex
eigenvalues in the lattice spectrum. We show that the sum of PT-potentials with
nearby periodicities leads to PT-symmetry restoration, where the system goes
from a PT-broken state to a PT-symmetric state as the average loss-gain
strength is increased. We discuss the implications of this novel transition for
the propagation of a light in an array of coupled waveguides.
