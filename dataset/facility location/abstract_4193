The phase diagram of a lattice microemulsion model proposed by Ciach, H{\o}ye
and Stell is studied using mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations.
Surfactant directional degrees of freedom are summed out exactly before
mean-field theory is applied, and the resulting phase diagrams are much
improved compared with previous mean-field results. The critical line and
tricritical point is located using Monte Carlo simulations and finite size
scaling.
