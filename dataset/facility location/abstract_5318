We summarize and critically evaluate the available data on nuclear fusion
cross sections important to energy generation in the Sun and other
hydrogen-burning stars and to solar neutrino production. Recommended values and
uncertainties are provided for key cross sections, and a recommended spectrum
is given for 8B solar neutrinos. We also discuss opportunities for further
increasing the precision of key rates, including new facilities, new
experimental techniques, and improvements in theory. This review, which
summarizes the conclusions of a workshop held at the Institute for Nuclear
Theory, Seattle, in January 2009, is intended as a 10-year update and
supplement to Reviews of Modern Physics 70 (1998) 1265.
