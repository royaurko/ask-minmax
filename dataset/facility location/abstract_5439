The cross sections of forward emission of one, two and three neutrons by 158A
GeV 115In nuclei in collisions with Al, Cu, Sn and Pb targets are reported. The
measurements were performed in the framework of the ALICE-LUMI experiment at
the SPS facility at CERN. Various corrections accounting for the absorption of
beam nuclei and produced neutrons in target material and surrounding air were
introduced. The corrected cross section data are compared with the predictions
of the RELDIS model for electromagnetic fragmentation of 115In in
ultraperipheral collisions, as well as with the results of the
abrasion-ablation model for neutron emission in hadronic interactions. The
measured neutron emission cross sections well agree with the RELDIS results,
with the exception of In-Al collisions where the measured cross sections are
larger compared to RELDIS. This is attributed to a relatively large
contribution of hadronic fragmentation of In on Al target with respect to
electromagnetic fragmentation, on the contrary to similar measurements
performed earlier with 30A GeV 208Pb colliding with Al.
