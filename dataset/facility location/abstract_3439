In this contribution we discuss how to prepare some possible detectors - only
silicon option being considered, for the new era of HEP challenges because the
bulk displacement damage in the detector, consequence of irradiation, produces
effects at the device level that limit their long time utilisation, increasing
the leakage current and the depletion potential, eventually up to breakdown,
and thus affecting the lifetime of detector systems. Physical phenomena that
conduce to the degradation of the detector are analysed both at the material
and device levels, and some predictions of the time degradation of silicon
detectors in the radiation environments expected in the LHC machine upgrade in
luminosity and energy as SLHC or VLHC, or at ULHC are given. Possible effects
at the detector level after high energy cosmic proton bombardment are
investigated as well. Time dependences of these device parameters are studied
in conditions of continuous irradiation and the technological options for
detector materials are discussed, to obtain devices harder to radiation.
