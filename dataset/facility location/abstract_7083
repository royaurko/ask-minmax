We present initial ideas for a programming paradigm based on simulation that
is targeted towards applications of artificial intelligence (AI). The approach
aims at integrating techniques from different areas of AI and is based on the
idea that simulated entities may freely exchange data and behavioural patterns.
We define basic notions of a simulation-based programming paradigm and show how
it can be used for implementing AI applications.
