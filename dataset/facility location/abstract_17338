Aims. We carried out a radial-velocity survey to search for planets around
metal-poor stars. In this paper we report the discovery of two planets around
HIP 11952, a metal-poor star with [Fe/H]= -1.9 that belongs to our target
sample. Methods. Radial velocity variations of HIP 11952 were monitored
systematically with FEROS at the 2.2 m telescope located at the ESO La Silla
observatory from August 2009 until January 2011. We used a cross-correlation
technique to measure the stellar radial velocities (RV). Results. We detected a
long-period RV variation of 290 d and a short-period one of 6.95 d. The
spectroscopic analysis of the stellar activity reveals a stellar rotation
period of 4.8 d. The Hipparcos photometry data shows intra-day variabilities,
which give evidence for stellar pulsations. Based on our analysis, the observed
RV variations are most likely caused by the presence of unseen planetary
companions. Assuming a primary mass of 0.83 M\odot, we computed minimum
planetary masses of 0.78 MJup for the inner and 2.93 MJup for the outer planet.
The semi-major axes are a1 = 0.07 AU and a2 = 0.81 AU, respectively.
Conclusions. HIP 11952 is one of very few stars with [Fe/H]< -1.0 which have
planetary companions. This discovery is important to understand planet
formation around metal-poor stars
