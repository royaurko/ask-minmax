We present new high and low resolution spectroscopic and photometric data of
nine members of the young association CMa R1. All the stars have circumstellar
dust at some distance as could be expected from their association with
reflection nebulosity. Four stars (HD 52721, HD 53367, LkHalpha 220 and
LkHalpha 218) show Halpha emission and we argue that they are Herbig Be stars
with discs. Our photometric and spectroscopic observations on these stars
reveal new characteristics of their variability. We present first
interpretations of the variability of HD 52721, HD 53367 and the two LkHalpha
stars in terms of a partially eclipsing binary, a magnetic activity cycle and
circumstellar dust variations, respectively. The remaining five stars show no
clear indications of Halpha emission in their spectra, although their spectral
types and ages are comparable with those of HD 52721 and HD 53367. This
indicates that the presence of a disc around a star in CMa R1 may depend on the
environment of the star. In particular we find that all Halpha emission stars
are located at or outside the arc-shaped border of the H II region, which
suggests that the stars inside the arc have lost their discs through
evaporation by UV photons from nearby O stars, or from the nearby (< 25 pc)
supernova, about 1 Myr ago.
