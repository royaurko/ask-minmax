We have obtained U-band polarimetry of the spatially extended, blue optical
continuum associated with the FR I radio source PKS 2322-122. PKS 2322-122 is
located in the Abell 2597 cluster central galaxy. We find a three sigma upper
limit to the degree of polarization of the optical continuum of less than 6%.
This limit is inconsistent with the blue continuum being primarily scattered
light or synchrotron radiation. We can therefore exclude models which attribute
the blue continuum to scattered light from an active nucleus that is hidden
from direct view. Essentially all of the data pertaining to the blue continuum
along the radio source-the ``blue lobes''-indicate that they are regions of
recent star formation that may have been induced by an interaction between the
radio source and the cool ($<10^4$ K), surrounding gas. We compare the
restframe U-band polarized luminosities and 1.4 GHz radio powers of A2597 and
A1795 to those for several high redshift radio galaxies exhibiting the
alignment effect. We suggest that the fundamental property distinguishing some
powerful, high redshift radio galaxies exhibiting the alignment effect, and the
lower-power, FR I radio galaxies in cooling flows that exhibit the blue lobe
phenomenon, is the strength of the AGN.
