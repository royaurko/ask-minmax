We show that planar a plasmonic metamaterial with spatially variable
meta-atom parameters can focus transmitted light into sub-wavelength hot-spots
located beyond the near-field of the metamaterial. By nano-structuring a gold
film we created an array of meta-lenses generating foci of 160 nm
(0.2{\lambda}) in diameter when illuminated by a wavelength of 800 nm. We
attribute the occurrence of sub-wavelength hotspots beyond the near field to
the phenomenon of superoscillation.
