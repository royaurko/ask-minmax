Motivated by the seminal work of Schwinger, we obtain explicit closed form
expressions for the one-loop effective action in a constant electromagnetic
field. We discuss both massive and massless charged scalars and spinors in two,
three, and four dimensions. Both strong field and weak field limits are
calculable. The latter limit results in an asymptotic expansion whose first
term reproduces the Euler-Heisenberg effective Lagrangian. We use the zeta
function renormalization prescription, and indicate its relationship to
Schwinger's renormalized effective action.
