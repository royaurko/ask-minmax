We describe the GRB and All-sky Monitor Experiment (GAME) mission submitted
by a large international collaboration (Italy, Germany, Czech Repubblic,
Slovenia, Brazil) in response to the 2012 ESA call for a small mission
opportunity for a launch in 2017 and presently under further investigation for
subsequent opportunities. The general scientific objective is to perform
measurements of key importance for GRB science and to provide the wide
astrophysical community of an advanced X-ray all-sky monitoring system. The
proposed payload was based on silicon drift detectors (~1-50 keV), CdZnTe (CZT)
detectors (~15-200 keV) and crystal scintillators in phoswich (NaI/CsI)
configuration (~20 keV-20 MeV), three well established technologies, for a
total weight of ~250 kg and a required power of ~240 W. Such instrumentation
allows a unique, unprecedented and very powerful combination of large field of
view (3-4 sr), a broad energy energy band extending from ~1 keV up to ~20 MeV,
an energy resolution as good as ~300 eV in the 1-30 keV energy range, a source
location accuracy of ~1 arcmin. The mission profile included a launch (e.g., by
Vega) into a low Earth orbit, a baseline sky scanning mode plus pointed
observations of regions of particular interest, data transmission to ground via
X-band (4.8 Gb/orbit, Alcantara and Malindi ground stations), and prompt
transmission of GRB / transient triggers.
