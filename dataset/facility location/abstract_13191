In this paper, we establish Fog Index (FI) as a text filter to locate the
sentences in texts that contain connected biomedical concepts of interest. To
do so, we have used 24 random papers each containing four pairs of connected
concepts. For each pair, we categorize sentences based on whether they contain
both, any or none of the concepts. We then use FI to measure difficulty of the
sentences of each category and find that sentences containing both of the
concepts have low readability. We rank sentences of a text according to their
FI and select 30 percent of the most difficult sentences. We use an association
matrix to track the most frequent pairs of concepts in them. This matrix
reports that the first filter produces some pairs that hold almost no
connections. To remove these unwanted pairs, we use the Equally Weighted
Harmonic Mean of their Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Sensitivity as a
second filter. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.
