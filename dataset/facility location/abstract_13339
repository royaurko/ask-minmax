We have developed a highly scalable application, called Shoal, for tracking
and utilizing a distributed set of HTTP web caches. Squid servers advertise
their existence to the Shoal server via AMQP messaging by running Shoal Agent.
The Shoal server provides a simple REST interface that allows clients to
determine their closest Squid cache. Our goal is to dynamically instantiate
Squid caches on IaaS clouds in response to client demand. Shoal provides the
VMs on IaaS clouds with the location of the nearest dynamically instantiated
Squid Cache. In this paper, we describe the design and performance of Shoal.
