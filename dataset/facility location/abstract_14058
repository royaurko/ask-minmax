Generalized-ensemble simulations enable the study of complex adsorption
scenarios of a coarse-grained model polymer near an attractive nanostring,
representing an ultrathin nanowire. We perform canonical and microcanonical
statistical analyses to investigate structural transitions of the polymer and
discuss their dependence on the temperature and on model parameters such as
effective wire thickness and attraction strength. The result is a complete
hyperphase diagram of the polymer phases, whose locations and stability are
influenced by the effective material properties of the nanowire and the
strength of the thermal fluctuations. Major structural polymer phases in the
adsorbed state include compact droplets attached to or wrapping around the
wire, and tubelike conformations with triangular pattern that resemble ideal
boron nanotubes. The classification of the transitions is performed by
microcanonical inflection-point analysis.
