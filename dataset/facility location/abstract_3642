Support to Astronomy operations is an important and long-lived activity
within INSA. Probably the best known (and traditional) INSA activities are
those related with real-time spacecraft operations: Ground station maintenance
and operation (Ground station engineers and operators); spacecraft and payload
real-time operation (spacecraft and instruments controllers); computing
infrastructure maintenance (operators, analysts) and general site services.In
this paper, we'll show a different perspective, probably not so well-known,
presenting some INSA recent activities at the European Space Astronomy Centre
(ESAC) and NASA Madrid Deep Space Communication Complex (MDSCC) directly
related to scientific operations. Basic lines of activity involved include:
Operations support for science operations; system and software support for real
time systems; technical administration and IT support; R \& D activities,
radioastronomy (at MDSCC and ESAC) and scientific research projects. This paper
is structured as follows: first, INSA activities in two ESA cornerstone
astrophysics missions, XMM-Newton and Herschel, will be outlined. Then, our
activities related to Science infrastructure services, represented by the
Virtual Observatory (VO) framework and the Science Archives development
facilities are briefly shown. Radio Astronomy activities will be described
afterwards, and finally, a few research topics in which INSA scientists are
involved will be also described.
