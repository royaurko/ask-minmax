Social scientists have used agent-based models to understand how individuals
interact and behave in various political, ecological and economic scenarios.
Agent-based models are ideal for understanding such models involving
interacting individuals producing emergent phenomenon. Sugarscape is one of the
most famous examples of a social agent-based model which has been used to show
how societies grow in the real world.
  This paper builds on the Sugarscape model, using the Flexible Large scale
Agent-based modelling Environment (FLAME) to simulate three different scenarios
of the experiment, which are based on the Sugar and Citizen locations. FLAME is
an agent-based modelling framework which has previously been used to model
biological and economic models. The paper includes details on how the model was
written and the various parameters set for the simulation. The results of the
model simulated are processed for three scenarios and analysed to see what
affect the initial starting states of the agents had on the overall result
obtained through the model and the variance in simulation time of processing
the model on multicore architectures.
  The experiments highlight that there are limitations of the FLAME framework
and writing simulation models in general which are highly dependent on initial
starting states of a model, also raising further potential work which can be
built into the Sugarscape model to study other interesting phenomenon in social
and economic laws.
