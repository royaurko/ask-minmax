On the basis of tidal despinning timescale arguments, Peale showed in 1977
that the majority of irregular satellites (with unknown rotation states) are
expected to reside close to their initial (fast) rotation states. Here we
investigate the problem of the current typical rotation states among all known
satellites from a viewpoint of dynamical stability. We explore location of the
known planetary satellites on the ($\omega_0$, $e$) stability diagram, where
$\omega_0$ is an inertial parameter of a satellite and $e$ is its orbital
eccentricity. We show that most of the satellites with unknown rotation states
cannot rotate synchronously, because no stable synchronous 1:1 spin-orbit state
exists for them. They rotate either much faster than synchronously (those
tidally unevolved) or, what is much less probable, chaotically (tidally evolved
objects or captured slow rotators).
