The "crowd" has become a very important geospatial data provider. Subsumed
under the term Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), non-expert users have
been providing a wealth of quantitative geospatial data online. With spatial
reasoning being a basic form of human cognition, narratives expressing
geospatial experiences, e.g., travel blogs, would provide an even bigger source
of geospatial data. Textual narratives typically contain qualitative data in
the form of objects and spatial relationships. The scope of this work is (i) to
extract these relationships from user-generated texts, (ii) to quantify them
and (iii) to reason about object locations based only on this qualitative data.
We use information extraction methods to identify toponyms and spatial
relationships and to formulate a quantitative approach based on distance and
orientation features to represent the latter. Positional probability
distributions for spatial relationships are determined by means of a greedy
Expectation Maximization-based (EM) algorithm. These estimates are then used to
"triangulate" the positions of unknown object locations. Experiments using a
text corpus harvested from travel blog sites establish the considerable
location estimation accuracy of the proposed approach.
