The location of the (gamma,p)/(gamma,n) and (gamma,alpha)/(gamma,n) line at
gamma-process temperatures is discussed, using recently published reaction
rates based on global Hauser-Feshbach calculations. The results can directly be
compared to previously published, classic gamma-process discussions. The nuclei
exhibiting the largest sensitivity to uncertainties in nuclear structure and
reaction parameters are specified.
