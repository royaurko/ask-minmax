Using ISOPHOT maps at 100 and 200um and raster scans at 100, 120, 150 and
200um we have detected four unresolved far-infrared sources in the high
latitude molecular cloud L183. Two of the sources are identified with 1.3mm
continuum sources found by Ward-Thompson et al. and are located near the
temperature minimum and the coincident column density maximum of dust
distribution. For these two sources, the ISO observations have enabled us to
derive temperatures (about 8.3 K) and masses (about 1.4 and 2.4 solar masses).
They are found to have masses greater than or comparable to their virial masses
and are thus expected to undergo gravitational collapse. We classify them as
pre-protostellar sources. The two new sources are good candidates for
pre-protostellar sources or protostars within L183.
