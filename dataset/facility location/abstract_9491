Formation of giant radio pulses is attributed to propagation effects in the
plasma of pulsar magnetosphere. Induced scattering of radio waves by the plasma
particles is found to lead to an efficient redistribution of the radio emission
in frequency. With the steep spectrum of pulsar radiation, intensity transfer
between the widely spaced frequencies may imply significant narrow-band
amplification of the radiation. This may give rise to giant pulses. It is
demonstrated that the statistics of giant pulse intensities observed can be
reproduced if one take into account pulse-to-pulse fluctuations of the plasma
number density and the original intensity. Polarization properties of the
strongly amplified pulses, their location in the average pulse window and the
origin of the nanostructure of giant pulses are discussed as well.
