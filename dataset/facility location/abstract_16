Telemedicine refers to the use of information and communication technology to
provide and support health care mainly for the purpose of providing
consultation. It is also a way to provide medical procedures or examinations to
remote locations. It has the potential to improve both the quality and the
access to health care services delivery while lowering costs even in the
scarcity of resources. Understanding the potentiality of telemedicine, many
developing countries are implementing telemedicine to provide health care
facility to remote area where health care facilities are deficient. Bangladesh
is not an exception to this either. In this paper we mention the reasons why
Bangladesh has to move for telemedicine. We also present the past and on-going
telemedicine activities and projects in Bangladesh. Analyzing these projects we
have found out some factors which should be assessed carefully for successful
implementation of telemedicine application. Finally we propose a prototype
telemedicine network for Bangladesh that can improve health facilities through
telemedicine by making a connection between rural health facility providers and
special hospitals.
