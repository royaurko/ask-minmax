This paper compares the distribution of zeros of the Riemann zeta function
$\zeta(s)$ with those of a symmetric combination of zeta functions, denoted
${\cal T}_+(s)$, known to have all its zeros located on the critical line
$\Re(s)=1/2$. Criteria are described for constructing a suitable quotient
function of these, with properties advantageous for establishing an accessible
proof that $\zeta(s)$ must also have all its zeros on the critical line: the
celebrated Riemann hypothesis. While the argument put forward is not at the
level of rigour required to constitute a full proof of the Riemann hypothesis,
it should convince non-specialists that it must hold.
