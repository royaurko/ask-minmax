ROSAT observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) have revealed a large
diffuse X-ray arc around the point source RX J053335-6854.9. The relative
locations of the diffuse and point sources suggest that they might originate
from a common supernova explosion. We have analyzed the physical properties of
the diffuse X-ray emission and determined that it is most likely a supernova
remnant in a low-density medium in the LMC. We have also analyzed the X-ray and
optical observations of RX J053335-6854.9 and concluded that it is a foreground
dMe star in the solar neighborhood. Therefore, despite their positional
coincidence, these two X-ray sources are physically unrelated.
