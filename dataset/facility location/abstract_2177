The Q-weak experiment at Hall C of Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator
Facility has made the first direct measurement of the weak charge of the
proton, Qweak(p), through a precision measurement of the parity-violating
asymmetry in elastic e-p scattering at low momentum transfer Q^2= 0.025
(GeV/c)^2 with incident electron beam energy of 1.155 GeV. The Q-weak
experiment, along with earlier results of parity violating elastic scattering
experiments, is expected to determine the most precise value of Qweak(p) which
is suppressed in the Standard Model. If this result is further combined with
the 133Cs atomic parity violation (APV) measurement, significant constraints on
the weak charge of the up quark, down quark, and neutron can be extracted. This
data will also be used to determine the weak-mixing angle, sin^2 theta_?W, with
a relative uncertainty of < 0.5% that will provide a competitive measurement of
the running of sin^2 theta_?W to low Q^2. An overview of the experiment and its
results using the commissioning dataset, constituting approximately 4% of the
data collected in the experiment, are reported here.
