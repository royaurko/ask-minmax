M22 is an anomalous globular cluster that hosts two groups of stars with
different metallicity and s-element abundance. The star-to-star light-element
variations in both groups, with the presence of individual Na-O and C-N
anticorrelations, demonstrates that this Milky-Way satellite has experienced a
complex star-formation history. We have analysed FLAMES/UVES spectra for seven
stars covering a small color interval, on the reddest horizontal-branch (HB)
portion of this cluster and investigated possible relations between the
chemical composition of a star and its location along the HB. Our chemical
abundance analysis takes into account effects introduced by deviations from the
local-thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE effects), that are significant for the
measured spectral lines in the atmospheric parameters range spanned by our
stars. We find that all the analysed stars are barium-poor and sodium-poor,
thus supporting the idea that the position of a star along the HB is strictly
related to the chemical composition, and that the HB-morphology is influenced
by the presence of different stellar populations.
