While microscopic organisms can use gradient-based search to locate
resources, this strategy can be poorly suited to the sensory signals available
to macroscopic organisms. We propose a framework that models search-decision
making in cases where sensory signals are infrequent, subject to large
fluctuations, and contain little directional information. Our approach
simultaneously models an organism's intrinsic movement behavior (e.g. Levy
walk) while allowing this behavior to be adjusted based on sensory data. We
find that including even a simple model for signal response can dominate other
features of random search and greatly improve search performance. In
particular, we show that a lack of signal is not a lack of information.
Searchers that receive no signal can quickly abandon target-poor regions. Such
phenomena naturally give rise to the area-restricted search behavior exhibited
by many searching organisms.
