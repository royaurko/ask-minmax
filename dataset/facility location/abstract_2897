We propose a method of antimonopoly regulation in a day-ahead power market
with locational marginal pricing which forms economic incentives for a
producer, operating a portfolio of generating units, to submit an offer
indicating its true cost and faithful values of technical parameters, entering
generating units constraints. The uncertainty faced by regulator when applying
the method affects neither nodal output/consumption volumes nor locational
marginal prices but manifests itself in overall uplift or downlift for the
market, which may be allocated among the other market players in a way
preserving the price signals produced by the market.
