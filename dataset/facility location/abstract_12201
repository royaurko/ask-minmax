We consider stochastic cellular networks where base stations locations form a
homogenous Poisson point process and each mobile is attached to the base
station that provides the best mean signal power. The mobile is in outage if
the SINR falls below some threshold. The handover decision has to be made if
the mobile is in outage for some time slots. The outage probability and the
handover probability is evaluated in taking into account the effect of path
loss, shadowing, Rayleigh fast fading, frequency factor reuse and conventional
beamforming. The main assumption is that the Rayleigh fast fading changes each
time slot while other network components remain static during the period of
study.
