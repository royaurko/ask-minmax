The observation of a prompt optical flash from GRB990123 convincingly
demonstrated the value of autonomous robotic telescope systems. Pursuing a
program of rapid follow-up observations of gamma-ray bursts, the Robotic
Optical Transient Search Experiment (ROTSE) has developed a next-generation
instrument, ROTSE-III, that will continue the search for fast optical
transients. The entire system was designed as an economical robotic facility to
be installed at remote sites throughout the world. There are seven major system
components: optics, optical tube assembly, CCD camera, telescope mount,
enclosure, environmental sensing & protection and data acquisition. Each is
described in turn in the hope that the techniques developed here will be useful
in similar contexts elsewhere.
