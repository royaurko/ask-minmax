The giant radio galaxy M 87 is located at a distance of ~16 Mpc and harbors a
supermassive black hole in its center. The structure of its relativistic plasma
jet is resolved at radio, optical and X-ray wavelengths. M 87 belongs to the
class of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and is one of the few extragalactic TeV
gamma-ray source not belonging to the class of blazars. M 87 is also detected
by Fermi in the GeV energy range. This makes it a unique laboratory for the
study of the jet substructures and the morphology of the non-thermal emission
processes. In spring 2010 a major flare was observed at TeV energies, and was
sampled by VERITAS and Fermi with unprecedented accuracy. The results of the
VERITAS observations will be discussed.
