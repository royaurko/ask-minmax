We show how to construct physical, minimal energy states for systems of
static and moving charges. These states are manifestly gauge invariant. For
charge-anticharge systems we also construct states in which the gauge fields
are restricted to a finite volume around the location of the matter fields.
Although this is an excited state, it is not singular, unlike all previous
finite volume descriptions. We use our states to model the processes of pair
creation and annihilation.
