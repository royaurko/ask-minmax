We used the Spitzer Space Telescope's Infrared Spectrograph to map nearly the
entire extent of Cassiopeia A between 5-40 micron. Using infrared and Chandra
X-ray Doppler velocity measurements, along with the locations of optical ejecta
beyond the forward shock, we constructed a 3-D model of the remnant. The
structure of Cas A can be characterized into a spherical component, a tilted
thick disk, and multiple ejecta jets/pistons and optical fast-moving knots all
populating the thick disk plane. The Bright Ring in Cas A identifies the
intersection between the thick plane/pistons and a roughly spherical reverse
shock. The ejecta pistons indicate a radial velocity gradient in the explosion.
Some ejecta pistons are bipolar with oppositely-directed flows about the
expansion center while some ejecta pistons show no such symmetry. Some ejecta
pistons appear to maintain the integrity of the nuclear burning layers while
others appear to have punched through the outer layers. The ejecta pistons
indicate a radial velocity gradient in the explosion. In 3-D, the Fe jet in the
southeast occupies a "hole" in the Si-group emission and does not represent
"overturning", as previously thought. Although interaction with the
circumstellar medium affects the detailed appearance of the remnant and may
affect the visibility of the southeast Fe jet, the bulk of the symmetries and
asymmetries in Cas A are intrinsic to the explosion.
