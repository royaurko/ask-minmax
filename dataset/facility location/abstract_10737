Some unusual features observed in hadronic collisions at high energies can be
understood assuming that gluons in hadrons are located within small spots
occupying only about 10% of the hadron's area. Such a conjecture about the
presence of two scales in hadrons helps to explain: why diffractive gluon
radiation so much suppressed; why the triple-Pomeron coupling shows no
t-dependence; why total hadronic cross sections rise with energy so slowly; why
diffraction cone shrinks so slowly, and why
$\alpha^\prime_P\ll\alpha^\prime_R$; why the transition from hard to soft
regimes in the structure functions occurs at rather large $Q^2$; why the
observed Cronin effect at collider energies is so weak; why hard reactions
sensitive to primordial parton motion (direct photon, Drell-Yan dileptons,
heavy flavors, back-to-back di-hadrons, seagull effect, etc.) demand such a
large transverse momenta of the projectile partons, which is not explained by
NLO calculations; why the onset of nuclear shadowing for gluons is so much
delayed compared to quarks, and why shadowing is so weak.
