The fragmentation of neutron-rich 132Sn nuclei produced in the fission of
238U projectiles at 950 MeV/u has been investigated at the FRagment Separator
(FRS) at GSI. This work represents the first investigation of fragmentation of
medium-mass radioactive projectiles with a large neutron excess. The measured
production cross sections of the residual nuclei are relevant for the possible
use of a two-stage reaction scheme (fission+fragmentation) for the production
of extremely neutron-rich medium-mass nuclei in future rare-ion-beam
facilities. Moreover, the new data will provide a better understanding of the
"memory" effect in fragmentation reactions.
