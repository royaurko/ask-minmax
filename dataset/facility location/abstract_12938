In this paper we propose a Bayesian nonparametric model for clustering
partial ranking data. We start by developing a Bayesian nonparametric extension
of the popular Plackett-Luce choice model that can handle an infinite number of
choice items. Our framework is based on the theory of random atomic measures,
with the prior specified by a completely random measure. We characterise the
posterior distribution given data, and derive a simple and effective Gibbs
sampler for posterior simulation. We then develop a Dirichlet process mixture
extension of our model and apply it to investigate the clustering of
preferences for college degree programmes amongst Irish secondary school
graduates. The existence of clusters of applicants who have similar preferences
for degree programmes is established and we determine that subject matter and
geographical location of the third level institution characterise these
clusters.
