We study the three dimensional fundamental-adjoint $SU(2)$ lattice gauge
theory at non-zero temperatures by Monte Carlo simulations. On an $8^3 \times
2$ lattice, at $\beta_A = 1.1$, where $\beta_A$ is the adjoint coupling, we
find no evidence of any transition at the location of a previously known bulk
phase transition around $\beta = 1.33$. Moreover, the deconfinement transition
at $ \beta_A = 1.1$ occurs at $\beta=1.20$ and is of first order for $\beta_A
\ge 1.1$, thus implying a change of universality class from that of the Wilson
action at $\beta_A=0$. Computations of the plaquette susceptibility and the
temporal and spatial Polyakov loops on $8^3 \times 4$ and $16^3 \times 8$
lattices at $\beta_A = 1.1$ further support these conclusions and suggest that
the previously claimed bulk transition around $\beta = 1.33$ is, in fact, the
first order deconfinement transition. Simulations at larger $\beta_A$ and the
measurements of the mass gaps from the correlation functions of temporal and
spatial Polyakov loops also confirm the temperature dependent nature of the
above transition. The consequences of our results on universality are
discussed.
