We observed a 10x20 pc region of the molecular cloud M17 in the 12CO and 13CO
J=3-2 and J=2-1 transitions to determine their global behavior and to assess
the reliability of using ratios of CO line intensities integrated over an
entire cloud to determine the physical conditions within the cloud. Both the
12CO/13CO J=2-1 and J=3-2 line ratios correlate with the 13CO integrated
intensity, with smaller line ratios observed at locations with large integrated
intensities. This correlation is likely due to variations in the column density
from one position to another within M17. The 12CO and 13CO (J=3-2/J=2-1) line
ratios show no significant variation from place to place within M17, even on
the peak of the photon-dominated region. A Large Velocity Gradient analysis of
globally averaged line ratios gives results in reasonable agreement with the
results obtained for individual lines-of-sight through the cloud, which
suggests that the typical physical conditions in a molecular cloud can be
determined using CO line ratios integrated over the entire cloud. There appears
to be a clear trend of increasing 12CO/13CO J=2-1 and J=3-2 line ratios as one
moves from Galactic molecular cloud cores to entire Galactic molecular clouds
to normal galaxies. The most likely explanation of the high line ratios for
normal galaxies is a significant contribution to the CO emission by low column
density material, such as diffuse molecular clouds or the outer envelopes of
giant molecular clouds.
