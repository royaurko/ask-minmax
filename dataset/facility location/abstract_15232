Four decades have gone by since the discovery that the solar wind at 1 AU
seems to exist in two relatively distinct states: slow and fast. There is still
no universal agreement concerning the primary physical cause of this apparently
bimodal distribution, even in its simplest manifestation at solar minimum. In
this presentation we review and extend a series of ideas that link the
different states of solar wind to the varying superradial geometry of magnetic
flux tubes in the extended corona. Past researchers have emphasized different
aspects of this relationship, and we attempt to disentangle some of the
seemingly contradictory results. We apply the hypothesis of Wang and Sheeley
(as well as Kovalenko) that Alfven wave fluxes at the base are the same for all
flux tubes to a recent model of non-WKB Alfven wave reflection and turbulent
heating, and we predict coronal heating rates as a function of flux tube
geometry. We compare the feedback of these heating rates on the locations of
Parker-type critical points, and we discuss the ranges of parameters that yield
a realistic bifurcation of wind solutions into fast and slow. Finally, we
discuss the need for next-generation coronagraph spectroscopy of the extended
corona - especially measurements of the electron temperature above 1.5 solar
radii - in order to confirm and refine these ideas.
