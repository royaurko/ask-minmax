A derivation is given for the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann thermal activation law
for the glassy state of a bulk polymer. Our microscopic considerations involve
the entropy of closed polymer molecular chains (i.e. polymer closed strings).
For thin film polymer glasses, one obtains open polymer strings in that the
boundary surfaces serve as possible string endpoint locations. The
Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann thermal activation law thereby holds true for a bulk
polymer glass but is modified in the neighborhood of the boundaries of thin
film polymers.
