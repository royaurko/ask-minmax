We are interested in the comparison of transcript boundaries from cells which
originated in different environments. The goal is to assess whether this
phenomenon, called differential splicing, is used to modify the transcription
of the genome in response to stress factors. We address this question by
comparing the change-points locations in the individual segmentation of each
profile, which correspond to the RNA-Seq data for a gene in one growth
condition. This requires the ability to evaluate the uncertainty of the
change-point positions, and the work of Rigaill et. al. (2011) provides an
appropriate framework in such case. Building on their approach, we propose two
methods for the comparison of change-points, and illustrate our results on a
dataset from the yeast specie. We show that the UTR boundaries are subject to
differential splicing, while the intron boundaries are conserved in all
profiles. Our approach is implemented in an R package called EBS which is
available on the CRAN.
