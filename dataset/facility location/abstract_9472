The XMM-Newton spectra of the isolated neutron star RX J0720.4-3125 obtained
over 4.5 years can be described by sinusoidal variations in the inferred
blackbody temperature, the size of the emitting area and the depth of the
absorption line with a period of 7.1 +/- 0.5 years, which we suggest to be the
precession period of the neutron star. Precession of a neutron star with two
hot spots of different temperature and size, probably not located exactly in
antipodal positions, may account for the variations in the X-ray spectra,
changes in the pulsed fraction, shape of the light curve and the phase-lag
between soft and hard energy bands observed from RX J0720.4-3125. An
independent sinusoidal fit to published and new pulse timing residuals from a
coherent analysis covering ~12 years yields a consistent period of 7.7 +/- 0.6
years supporting the precession model.
