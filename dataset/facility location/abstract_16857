This work investigates the impact of deep coal mining induced vibrations on
surface constructions using numerical tools. An experimental study of the
geological site amplification and of its influence on mining induced vibrations
has already been published in a previous paper (Part 1: Experimental evidence
for site effects in a coal basin). Measurements have shown the existence of an
amplification area in the southern part of the basin where drilling data have
shown the presence of particularly fractured and soft stratigraphic units. The
present study, using the Boundary Element Method (BEM) in the frequency domain,
first investigates canonical geological structures in order to get general
results for various sites. The amplification level at the surface is given as a
function of the shape of the basin and of the velocity contrast with the
bedrock. Next, the particular coal basin previously studied experimentally
(Driad-Lebeau et al., 2009) is modeled numerically by BEM. The amplification
phenomena characterized numerically for the induced vibrations are found to be
compatible with the experimental findings: amplification level, frequency
range, location. Finally, the whole work was necessary to fully assess the
propagation and amplification of mine induced vibrations. The numerical results
quantifying amplification can also be used to study other coal basins or
various types of alluvial sites.
