Borexino is a low threshold liquid-scintillator detector for solar neutrinos
located in the LNGS underground laboratory, Italy. Because of the ultra-high
radio purity it is the first experiment able to do a real time analysis of the
low energetic solar neutrinos. A detection of the solar 7Be neutrinos with a
rate of 47+-7 counts/day/100tons can be reported (192 days of live time
measurement). 8B neutrinos are observed with a rate of 0.26+-0.06
counts/day/100tons after 246 live days. All detected neutrino fluxes agree with
the SSM predictions in case of the MSW-LMA oscillation solution. Borexino is
the first experiment with the ablility to simultaneously measure solar neutrino
oscillation in the vacuum-dominated and the matter-enhanced energy regions.
