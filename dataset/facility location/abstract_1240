The UK has no research nuclear reactors and relies on the importation of 99Mo
and other medical radioisotopes (e.g. Iodine-131) from overseas (excluding PET
radioisotopes). The UK is therefore vulnerable not only to global shortages,
but to problems with shipping and importation of the products. In this context
Professor Erika Denton UK national Clinical Director for Diagnostics requested
that the British Nuclear Medicine Society lead a working group with
stakeholders including representatives from the Science & Technology Facilities
Council (STFC) to prepare a report. The group had a first meeting on 10 April
2013 followed by a working group meeting with presentations on 9th September
2013 where the scope of the work required to produce a report was agreed.
  The objectives of the report are: to describe the status of the use of
medical radioisotopes in the UK; to anticipate the potential impact of
shortages for the UK; to assess potential alternative avenues of medical
radioisotope production for the UK market; and to explore ways of mitigating
the impact of medical radioisotopes on patient care pathways. The report
incorporates details of a visit to the Cyclotron Facilities at Edmonton,
Alberta and at TRIUMF, Vancouver BC in Canada by members of the report team.
