The calculation of network reliability in a probabilistic context has long
been an issue of practical and academic importance. Conventional approaches
(determination of bounds, sums of disjoint products algorithms, Monte Carlo
evaluations, studies of the reliability polynomials, etc.) only provide
approximations when the network's size increases, even when nodes do not fail
and all edges have the same reliability p. We consider here a directed, generic
graph of arbitrary size mimicking real-life long-haul communication networks,
and give the exact, analytical solution for the two-terminal reliability. This
solution involves a product of transfer matrices, in which individual
reliabilities of edges and nodes are taken into account. The special case of
identical edge and node reliabilities (p and rho, respectively) is addressed.
We consider a case study based on a commonly-used configuration, and assess the
influence of the edges being directed (or not) on various measures of network
performance. While the two-terminal reliability, the failure frequency and the
failure rate of the connection are quite similar, the locations of complex
zeros of the two-terminal reliability polynomials exhibit strong differences,
and various structure transitions at specific values of rho. The present work
could be extended to provide a catalog of exactly solvable networks in terms of
reliability, which could be useful as building blocks for new and improved
bounds, as well as benchmarks, in the general case.
