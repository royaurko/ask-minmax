The metric on the moduli space of SU(2) charge four BPS monopoles with
tetrahedral symmetry is calculated using numerical methods. In the asymptotic
region, in which the four monopoles are located on the vertices of a large
tetrahedron, the metric is in excellent agreement with the point particle
metric. We find that the four monopoles are accelerated through the cubic
monopole configuration and compute the time advance. Numerical evidence is
presented for a remarkable equivalence between a proper distance in the
4-monopole moduli space and a related proper distance in the point particle
moduli space.
