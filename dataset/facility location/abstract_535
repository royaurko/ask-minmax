Electron antineutrino interactions above the inverse beta decay energy of
protons ($E_\bar{\nu}_e>$1.8) where looked for with the Borexino Counting Test
Facility (CTF). One candidate event survived after rejection of background,
which included muon-induced neutrons and random coincidences. An upper limit on
the solar $\bar{\nu}_{e}$ flux, assumed having the $^8$B solar neutrino energy
spectrum, of 1.1$\times10^{5}$ cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ (90% C.L.) was set with a 7.8
ton $\times$ year exposure. This upper limit corresponds to a solar neutrino
transition probability, $\nu_{e} \to \bar{\nu}_{e}$, of 0.02 (90% C.L.).
Predictions for antineutrino detection with Borexino, including geoneutrinos,
are discussed on the basis of background measurements performed with the CTF.
