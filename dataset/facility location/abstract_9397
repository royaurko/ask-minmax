We present the discovery of nine quasars behind the Large Magellanic Cloud,
with emission redshifts ranging from 0.07 to 2.0. Six of them were identified
as part of the systematic variability-based search for QSOs in the objects from
the OGLE-II database. Combination of variability-based selection of candidates
with the candidates' colours appears to be a powerful technique for identifying
quasars, potentially reaching ca. 50% efficiency. We report an apparent
correlation between variability magnitude and variability timescale, which - if
confirmed - could put even more constraints on QSO candidate selection. The
remaining three quasars were identified via followup spectroscopy of optical
counterparts to X-ray sources found serendipitously by the Chandra X-ray
Observatory satellite. Even though the locations of the candidates were quite
uniformly distributed over the LMC bar, the confirmed QSOs all appear near the
bar's outskirts.
