We present the LTE abundance analysis of high resolution spectra for red
giant stars in the peculiar bulge globular cluster NGC 6388. Spectra of seven
members were taken using the UVES spectrograph at the ESO VLT2 and the
multiobject FLAMES facility. We exclude any intrinsic metallicity spread in
this cluster: on average, [Fe/H]=-0.44+/-0.01+/-0.03 dex on the scale of the
present series of papers, where the first error bar refers to individual
star-to-star errors and the second is systematic, relative to the cluster.
Elements involved in H-burning at high temperatures show large spreads,
exceeding the estimated errors in the analysis. In particular, the pairs Na and
O, Al and Mg are anticorrelated and Na and Al are correlated among the giants
in NGC 6388, the typical pattern observed in all galactic globular clusters
studied so far. Stars in NGC 6388 shows an excess of alpha-process elements,
similar to the one found in the twin bulge cluster NGC 6441. Mn is found
underabundant in NGC 6388, in agreement with the average abundance ratio shown
by clusters of any metallicity. Abundances of neutron-capture elements are
homogeneously distributed within NGC 6388; the [Eu/Fe] ratio stands above the
value found in field stars of similar metallicity.
