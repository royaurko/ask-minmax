Based on a multiphase transport model, medium modifications of prompt
photon-tagged jet fragmentation function are investigated by comparing prompt
photon-tagged hadron azimuthal correlation in Au+Au collisions (0-40\%) with
that in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The measured
modification factor, $I_{AA}$, increases with the increasing integration range
of the away side, which reveals a medium-modified jet shape in which the medium
enhancement of soft particles is preferentially located far away from the jet
axis. The $I_{AA}$ largely results from strong interactions between jets and
partonic matter. However, both hadronization of coalescence and hadronic
rescatterings play certain roles to modify the $I_{AA}$. These behaviors
reflect a dynamical evolution of modifications of the prompt photon-tagged jet
fragmentation function in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.
