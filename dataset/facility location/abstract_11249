We present the coordinates, apparent magnitudes, and morphological types for
230 galaxies presumably identified with HIPASS (HI Parkes All-Sky Survey)
sources. The new optical counterparts of the HIPASS sources follow the
well-known statistical relationships between the hydrogen mass, luminosity, and
type of galaxies. Low-surface-brightness galaxies constitute a significant
fraction among these objects. The median value of the hydrogen
mass-to-luminosity ratio for them is a factor of 2 or 3 higher than that for
bright HIPASS galaxies, reaching $1.7 M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}$. A number of our
objects are located near the boundary $\log(M_{HI}/L_B) = 0.2(M_B + 20)$ that
defines the zone of gravitational stability of disk galaxies against
large-scale star formation.
