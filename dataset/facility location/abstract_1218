The existing Nuclear Resonance Fluorescence (NRF) setup at the HI{\gamma}S
facility at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory at Duke University has
been extended in order to perform {\gamma}-{\gamma} coincidence experiments.
The new setup combines large volume LaBr3:Ce detectors and high resolution HPGe
detectors in a very close geometry to offer high efficiency, high energy
resolution as well as high count rate capabilities at the same time. The
combination of a highly efficient {\gamma}-ray spectroscopy setup with the
mono-energetic high-intensity photon beam of HI{\gamma}S provides a worldwide
unique experimental facility to investigate the {\gamma}-decay pattern of
dipole excitations in atomic nuclei. The performance of the new setup has been
assessed by studying the nucleus \sulfur at 8.125 MeV beam energy. The
{\gamma}-decay branching ratio from the $1^+$ level at 8125.4 keV to the first
excited $2^+$ state was determined to 15.7(3)%.
