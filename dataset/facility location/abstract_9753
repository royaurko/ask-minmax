We have used the indium/copper surface alloy to study the dynamics of surface
vacancies on the Cu(001) surface. Individual indium atoms that are embedded
within the first layer of the crystal, are used as probes to detect the rapid
diffusion of surface vacancies. STM measurements show that these indium atoms
make multi-lattice-spacing jumps separated by long time intervals. Temperature
dependent waiting time distributions show that the creation and diffusion of
thermal vacancies form an Arrhenius type process with individual long jumps
being caused by one vacancy only. The length of the long jumps is shown to
depend on the specific location of the indium atom and is directly related to
the lifetime of vacancies at these sites on the surface. This observation is
used to expose the role of step edges as emitting and absorbing boundaries for
vacancies.
