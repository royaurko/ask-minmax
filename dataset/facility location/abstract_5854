We investigate sets of financial non-redundant and nonsynchronously recorded
time series. The sets are composed by a number of stock market indices located
all over the world in five continents. By properly selecting the time horizon
of returns and by using a reference currency we find a meaningful taxonomy. The
detection of such a taxonomy proves that interpretable information can be
stored in a set of nonsynchronously recorded time series.
