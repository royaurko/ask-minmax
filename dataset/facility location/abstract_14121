We study the use of overlapping and non-overlapping camera layouts in
estimating the ego-motion of a moving robot. To estimate the location and
orientation of the robot, we investigate using four cameras as non-overlapping
individuals, and as two stereo pairs. The pros and cons of the two approaches
are elucidated. The cameras work independently and can have larger field of
view in the non-overlapping layout. However, a scale factor ambiguity should be
dealt with. On the other hand, stereo systems provide more accuracy but require
establishing feature correspondence with more computational demand. For both
approaches, the extended Kalman filter is used as a real-time recursive
estimator. The approaches studied are verified with synthetic and real
experiments alike.
