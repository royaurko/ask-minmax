The X2.2-class solar flare of February 15, 2011, produced a powerful
`sunquake' event, representing a seismic response to the flare impact. The
impulsively excited seismic waves formed a compact wavepacket traveling through
the solar interior and appeared on the surface as expanding wave ripples. The
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), instrument on SDO, observes variations
of intensity, magnetic field and plasma velocity (Dopplergrams) on the surface
of Sun almost uninterruptedly with high resolution (0.5 arcsec/pixel) and high
cadence (45 sec). The flare impact on the solar surface was observed in the
form of compact and rapid variations of the HMI observables (Doppler velocity,
line-of-sight magnetic field and continuum intensity). These variations, caused
by the impact of high-energy particles in the photosphere, formed a typical
two-ribbon flare structure. The sunquake can be easily seen in the raw
Dopplergram differences without any special data processing. The source of this
quake was located near the outer boundary of a very complicated complicated
sunspot region, NOAA 1158, in a sunspot penumbra and at the penumbra boundary.
This caused an interesting plasma dynamics in the impact region. I present some
preliminary results of analysis of the near-real-time data from HMI, and
discuss properties of the sunquake and the flare impact sources.
