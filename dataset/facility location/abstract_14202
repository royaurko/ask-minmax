Max-stable processes play an important role as models for spatial extreme
events. Their complex structure as the pointwise maximum over an infinite
number of random functions makes simulation highly nontrivial. Algorithms based
on finite approximations that are used in practice are often not exact and
computationally inefficient. We will present two algorithms for exact
simulation of a max-stable process at a finite number of locations. The first
algorithm generalizes the approach by \citet{DM-2014} for Brown--Resnick
processes and it is based on simulation from the spectral measure. The second
algorithm relies on the idea to simulate only the extremal functions, that is,
those functions in the construction of a max-stable process that effectively
contribute to the pointwise maximum. We study the complexity of both algorithms
and prove that the second procedure is always more efficient. Moreover, we
provide closed expressions for their implementation that cover the most popular
models for max-stable processes and extreme value copulas. For simulation on
dense grids, an adaptive design of the second algorithm is proposed.
