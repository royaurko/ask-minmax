Electronic Raman scattering measures a polarization-dependent scattering
intensity which can provide information about the location of nodes in the
energy gap of an unconventional superconductor as well as its overall symmetry.
In this paper, we calculate the Raman intensity in the presence of disorder for
several models of the iron pnictide superconducting state. We include, for
completeness, $d$-wave and isotropic $s_\pm$ responses in addition to more
realistic extended $s_\pm$ superconducting gaps. The effect of disorder is
modeled using a self-consistent $T$-matrix approximation, and is studied in the
limits of isotropic and intraband-only scattering. We show how recent
experiments on Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ may be consistent with "node
lifting" by intraband disorder.
