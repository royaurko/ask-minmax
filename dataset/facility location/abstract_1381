We come out in this paper with an astroclimatological study of meteorological
data on relative humidity, dew point temperature, air temperature, wind speed,
barometric air pressure, and sky cloudiness recorded at four Romanian locations
(Baisoara, Rosia Montana, Semenic, Ceahlau) and Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT)
located at Observatorio del Roque de Los Muchachos, in the Canary Islands. Long
term trends of microclimates have been compared in order to identify the
site-to-site variations. We have performed this analysis as part of a site
testing campaign aimed at finding the best location for the establishment of a
small Cherenkov telescope in Romania. The conditions at the Romanian sites have
been compared to those of the Canary Islands considered as a reference. A
statistical approach has been used for data analysis. Monthly and annual
samples have been extracted from series of raw data for nighttime, daytime and
entire day intervals. Percentage distributions of meteorological parameters,
whose values exceed certain limits, have been derived. Significant differences
have been found between the Romanian sites and the NOT site. The comparison of
the Romanian locations indicates Baisoara to be the best site for the
establishment of the telescope, closely followed by Rosia Montana. As these two
sites are both located in the Apuseni Mountains, we consider this area as the
optimal place for performing astronomical observations in Romania.
