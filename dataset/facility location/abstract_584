Submillimeter observations are a key for answering many of the big questions
in modern-day astrophysics, such as how stars and planets form, how galaxies
evolve, and how material cycles through stars and the interstellar medium. With
the upcoming large submillimeter facilities ALMA and Herschel a new window will
open to study these questions. ARTIST is a project funded in context of the
European ASTRONET program with the aim of developing a next generation model
suite for comprehensive multi-dimensional radiative transfer calculations of
the dust and line emission, as well as their polarization, to help interpret
observations with these groundbreaking facilities.
