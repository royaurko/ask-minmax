We have constructed a Doppler-shifter-type pulsed ultra-cold neutron (UCN)
source at the Materials and Life Science Experiment Facility (MLF) of the Japan
Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC). Very-cold neutrons (VCNs) with
136-$\mathrm{m/s}$ velocity in a neutron beam supplied by a pulsed neutron
source are decelerated by reflection on a m=10 wide-band multilayer mirror,
yielding pulsed UCN. The mirror is fixed to the tip of a 2,000-rpm rotating arm
moving with 68-$\mathrm{m/s}$ velocity in the same direction as the VCN. The
repetition frequency of the pulsed UCN is $8.33~\mathrm{Hz}$ and the time width
of the pulse at production is $4.4~\mathrm{ms}$. In order to increase the UCN
flux, a supermirror guide, wide-band monochromatic mirrors, focus guides, and a
UCN extraction guide have been newly installed or improved. The count rate of
the output neutrons with longitudinal wavelengths longer than $58~\mathrm{nm}$
is $1.6 \times 10^{2}~\mathrm{cps}$, while that of the true UCNs is
$80~\mathrm{cps}$ at an equivalent beampower of $1~\mathrm{MW}$. The spatial
density at production is $1.4~\mathrm{UCN/cm^{3}}$. This new UCN source enables
us to research and develop apparatus necessary for the investigation of the
neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM).
