The Sivers distributions recently extracted from semi-inclusive deep
inelastic scattering data [1] are used to compute estimates for Sivers
asymmetries in Drell-Yan processes which are being planned at several
facilities (RHIC, COMPASS, J-PARC, PAX, PANDA, NICA (JINR) and SPASCHARM
(IHEP)). Most of these asymmetries turn out to be large and could allow a clear
test of the predicted sign change of the Sivers distributions when active in
SIDIS and Drell-Yan processes. This is regarded as a fundamental test of our
understanding, within QCD and the factorization scheme, of single spin
asymmetries.
