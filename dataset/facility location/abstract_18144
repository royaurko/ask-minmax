With the wide adoption of large-scale Internet services and big data, the
cloud has become the ideal environment to satisfy the ever-growing storage
demand, thanks to its seemingly limitless capacity, high availability and
faster access time. In this context, data replication has been touted as the
ultimate solution to improve data availability and reduce access time. However,
replica placement systems usually need to migrate and create a large number of
data replicas over time between and within data centers, incurring a large
overhead in terms of network load and availability. In this paper, we propose
CRANE, an effiCient Replica migrAtion scheme for distributed cloud Storage
systEms. CRANE complements any replica placement algorithm by efficiently
managing replica creation in geo-distributed infrastructures by (1) minimizing
the time needed to copy the data to the new replica location, (2) avoiding
network congestion, and (3) ensuring a minimal availability of the data. Our
results show that, compared to swift (the OpenStack project for managing data
storage), CRANE is able to minimize up to 30% of the replica creation time and
25% of inter-data center network traffic, while ensuring the minimum required
availability of the data.
