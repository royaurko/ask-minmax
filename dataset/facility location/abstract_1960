This document describes a Fortran 95 package for carrying out DGLAP evolution
and other common manipulations of parton distribution functions (PDFs). The
PDFs are represented on a grid in x-space so as to avoid limitations on the
functional form of input distributions. Good speed and accuracy are obtained
through the representation of splitting functions in terms of their convolution
with a set of piecewise polynomial basis functions, and Runge-Kutta techniques
are used for the evolution in Q. Unpolarised evolution is provided to NNLO,
including heavy-quark thresholds in the MSbar scheme, and longitudinally
polarised evolution to NLO. The code is structured so as to provide simple
access to the objects representing splitting functions and PDFs, making it
possible for a user to extend the facilities already provided. A streamlined
interface is also available, facilitating use of the evolution part of the code
from F77 and C/C++.
