A Free Electron Laser (FEL) facility utilizing a recirculated Superconducting
Radio Frequency (SRF) linear accelerator (linac) provides the opportunity to
achieve about five times greater photon energy than an unrecirculated linac of
similar cost. > A 4 GeV SRF, cw, electron linac can be used to drive an FEL
producing 5 keV photons. The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, a Department
of Energy (DOE) Basic Energy Sciences (BES) laboratory, proposes to utilize a 4
GeV unrecirculated, SRF, linac in a segment of existing linac tunnel. > For an
initial investment similar to that of the proposed SLAC strategy, a
recirculated SRF linac system could deliver the 4 GeV electrons for photon
energies of 5 keV and provide an upgrade path to photon energies of 25 keV. >
Further support amounting to about a third of the initial investment would
provide upgrade funds for additional SRF linac and cryogenic capacity
sufficient to provide electron energies appropriate for 25 keV photons matching
the European XFEL.
