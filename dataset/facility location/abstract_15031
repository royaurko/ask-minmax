New high-resolution, wide-field 90 cm VLA observations of the Galactic Center
region by Nord et al. have revealed twenty nonthermal filament (NTF)
candidates. We report 6 cm polarization observations of six of these. All of
the candidates have the expected NTF morphology, and two show extended
polarization confirming their identification as NTFs. One of the new NTFs
appears to be part of a system of NTFs located in the Sgr B region, 64 pc in
projection north of Sgr A. These filaments cross the Galactic plane with an
orientation similar to the filaments in the Galactic Center Radio Arc. They
extend the scale over which the NTF phenomena is known to occur to almost 300
pc along the Galactic plane. Another NTF was found in the Galactic plane south
of the Sgr C filament but with an orientation of 45 degrees to the Galactic
plane. This is only the second of 12 confirmed NTFs that is not oriented
perpendicular to the Galactic plane. An additional candidate in the Sgr C
region was resolved into multiple filamentary structures. Polarization was
detected only at the brightness peak of one of the filaments. Several of these
filaments run parallel to the Galactic plane and can be considered additional
evidence for non-poloidal magnetic fields at the GC. Together the 90 and 6 cm
observations indicate that the Galactic center magnetic field may be more
complex than a simple globally ordered dipole field.
