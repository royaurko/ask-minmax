Three different maps of the quiet Sun, observed with the Advanced Stokes
Polarimeter (ASP) and the Diffraction-Limited Stokes Polarimeter (DLSP), show
evidence of strong ($\simeq$1700 G) and weak ($<$500 G) fields coexisting
within the resolution element both at network and internetwork locations. The
angular resolution of the observations is of 1\arcsec (ASP) and 0.\arcsec6
(DLSP), respectively. Even at the higher DLSP resolution, a significant
fraction of the network magnetic patches harbor a mixture of strong and weak
fields. Internetwork elements that exhibit kG fields when analyzed with a
single-component atmosphere are also shown to harbor considerable amounts of
weak fields. Only those patches for which a single-component analysis yields
weak fields do not show this mixture of field strengths. Finally, there is a
larger fractional area of weak fields in the convective upflows than in the
downflows.
