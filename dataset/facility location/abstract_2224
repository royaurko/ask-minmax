Connected radio interferometers are sometimes used in the tied-array mode:
signals from antenna elements are coherently added and the sum signal applied
to a VLBI backend or pulsar processing machine. Usually there is no
computer-controlled amplitude weighting in the existing radio interferometer
facilities. Radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation with phase-only
adaptive beamforming is proposed for this mode of observation. Small phase
perturbations are introduced in each of the antenna's signal. The values of
these perturbations are optimized in such a way that the signal from a radio
source of interest is preserved and RFI signals suppressed. An evolutionary
programming algorithm is used for this task. Computer simulations, made for
both one-dimensional and two-dimensional array set-ups, show considerable
suppression of RFI and acceptable changes to the main array beam in the radio
source direction.
