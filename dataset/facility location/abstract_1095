Simulations of the magnetic fields from the Super High Momentum Spectrometer
in Hall C at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility show significant
field leakage into the region of the primary beam line between the target and
the beam dump. Without mitigation, these remnant fields will steer the
unscattered beam enough to limit beam operations at small scattering angles.
Presented here are magnetic field simulations of the spectrometer magnets and a
solution using optimal placement of a minimal amount of shielding iron around
the beam line.
