The influence of spin-exchange scattering centers on the triplet Cooper
pairing is considered to explore the behavior of superfluid 3He in high
porosity aerogel containing 3He atoms localized at the surface of silica
strands. The homogeneously located and isotropically scattering system of
spin-polarized ``impurity'' centers is adopted as a simple model to investigate
the contribution of spin-exchange scattering chanel for quasiparticles to the
formation of non-unitary superfluid A1-phase in aerogel environment. It is
demonstrated that an interference between the potential and exchange parts of
quasiparticle scattering against spin-polarized ``impurity'' centers can change
considerably the temperature width and the spin structure of A_{1}-phase in
aerogel.
