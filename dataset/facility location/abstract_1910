The magnetic-field stability of a mass spectrometer plays a crucial role in
precision mass measurements. In the case of mass determination of short-lived
nuclides with a Penning trap, major causes of instabilities are temperature
fluctuations in the vicinity of the trap and pressure fluctuations in the
liquid helium cryostat of the superconducting magnet. Thus systems for the
temperature and pressure stabilization of the Penning trap mass spectrometer
ISOLTRAP at the ISOLDE facility at CERN have been installed. A reduction of the
fluctuations by at least one order of magnitude downto dT=+/-5mK and
dp=+/-50mtorr has been achieved, which corresponds to a relative frequency
change of 2.7x10^{-9} and 1.5x10^{-10}, respectively. With this stabilization
the frequency determination with the Penning trap only shows a linear temporal
drift over several hours on the 10 ppb level due to the finite resistance of
the superconducting magnet coils.
