In a previous contribution, Phys. Rev. Lett 107, 230601 (2011), we have
proposed a method to treat first order phase transitions at low temperatures.
It describes arbitrary order parameter through an analytical expression $W$,
which depends on few coefficients. Such coefficients can be calculated by
simulating relatively small systems, hence with a low computational cost. The
method determines the precise location of coexistence lines and arbitrary
response functions (from proper derivatives of $W$). Here we exploit and extend
the approach, discussing a more general condition for its validity. We show
that in fact it works beyond the low $T$ limit, provided the first order phase
transition is strong enough. Thus, $W$ can be used even to study athermal
problems, as exemplified for a hard-core lattice gas. We furthermore
demonstrate that other relevant thermodynamic quantities, as entropy and
energy, are also obtained from $W$. To clarify some important mathematical
features of the method, we analyze in details an analytically solvable problem.
Finally, we discuss different representative models, namely, Potts, Bell-Lavis,
and associating gas-lattice, illustrating the procedure broad applicability.
