Laboratory experiments show that dusty bodies in a gaseous environment eject
dust particles if they are illuminated. We find that even more intense dust
eruptions occur when the light source is turned off. We attribute this to a
compression of gas by thermal creep in response to the changing temperature
gradients in the top dust layers. The effect is studied at a light flux of 13
kW/(m*m) and 1 mbar ambient pressure. The effect is applicable to
protoplanetary disks and Mars. In the inner part of protoplanetary disks,
planetesimals can be eroded especially at the terminator of a rotating body.
This leads to the production of dust which can then be transported towards the
disk edges or the outer disk regions. The generated dust might constitute a
significant fraction of the warm dust observed in extrasolar protoplanetary
disks. We estimate erosion rates of about 1 kg/s for 100 m parent bodies. The
dust might also contribute to subsequent planetary growth in different
locations or on existing protoplanets which are large enough not to be
susceptible to particle loss by light induced ejection. Due to the ejections,
planetesimals and smaller bodies will be accelerated or decelerated and drift
outward or inward, respectively. The effect might also explain the entrainment
of dust in dust devils on Mars, especially at high altitudes where gas drag
alone might not be sufficient.
