We present a method to search for large angular-scale correlations, termed
topological signatures, in the angular distribution of cosmic objects, which
does not depend on cosmological models or parameters and is based only on the
angular coordinates of the objects. In order to explore Cosmic Microwave
Background temperature fluctuations data, we applied this method to simulated
distributions of objects in thin spherical shells located in three different
multiply-connected Euclidean 3-spaces ($T^3$, $T_{\pi}$, and $G_6$), and found
that the topological signatures due to these topologies can be revealed even if
their intensities are small. We show how to detect such signatures for the
cases of full-sky and partial-sky distributions of objects. This method can
also be applied to other ensembles of cosmic objects, like galaxies or quasars,
in order to reveal possible angular-scale correlations in their distributions.
