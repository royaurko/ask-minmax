The (n, gamma) cross section of 206Pb has been measured at the CERN n_TOF
facility with high resolution in the energy range from 1 eV to 600 keV by using
two optimized C6D6 detectors. In the investigated energy interval about 130
resonances could be observed, from which 61 had enough statistics to be
reliably analyzed via the R-matrix analysis code SAMMY. Experimental
uncertainties were minimized, in particular with respect to (i) angular
distribution effects of the prompt capture gamma-rays, and to (ii) the
TOF-dependent background due to sample-scattered neutrons. Other background
components were addressed by background measurements with an enriched 208Pb
sample. The effect of the lower energy cutoff in the pulse height spectra of
the C6D6 detectors was carefully corrected via Monte Carlo simulations.
Compared to previous 206Pb values, the Maxwellian averaged capture cross
sections derived from these data are about 20% and 9% lower at thermal energies
of 5 keV and 30 keV, respectively. These new results have a direct impact on
the s-process abundance of 206Pb, which represents an important test for the
interpretation of the cosmic clock based on the decay of 238U.
