We derive the asymptotic distribution of the domination number of a new
family of random digraph called proximity catch digraph (PCD), which has
application to statistical testing of spatial point patterns and to pattern
recognition. The PCD we use is a parametrized digraph based on two sets of
points on the plane, where sample size and locations of the elements of one is
held fixed, while the sample size of the other whose elements are randomly
distributed over a region of interest goes to infinity. PCDs are constructed
based on the relative allocation of the random set of points with respect to
the Delaunay triangulation of the other set whose size and locations are fixed.
We introduce various auxiliary tools and concepts for the derivation of the
asymptotic distribution. We investigate these concepts in one Delaunay triangle
on the plane, and then extend them to the multiple triangle case. The methods
are illustrated for planar data, but are applicable in higher dimensions also.
