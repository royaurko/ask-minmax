We find a new relation among right-handed Dehn twists in the mapping class
group of a $k$-holed torus for $4 \leq k \leq 9$. This relation induces an
elliptic Lefschetz pencil structure on the four-manifold \cp $#(9-k)$ \cpb $ $
with $k$ base points and twelve singular fibers. By blowing up the base points
we get an elliptic Lefschetz fibration on the complex elliptic surface $E(1)=$
\cp $#9$ \cpb $ \to S^2$ with twelve singular fibers and $k$ disjoint sections.
More importantly we can locate these $k$ sections in a Kirby diagram of the
induced elliptic Lefschetz fibration. The $n$-th power of our relation gives an
explicit description for $k$ disjoint sections of the induced elliptic
fibration on the complex elliptic surface $E(n) \to S^2$ for $n \geq 1$.
