The present uncertainties in the knowledge of the neutrino cross sections for
E_nu \sim 1 GeV, that is in the energy range most important for atmospheric and
long baseline accelerator neutrinos, are large. These uncertainties do not play
a significant role in the interpretation of existing data, however they could
become a limiting factor in future studies that aim at a complete and accurate
determination of the neutrino oscillation parameters. New data and theoretical
understanding on nuclear effects and on the electromagnetic structure functions
at low Q^2 and in the resonance production region are available, and can be
valuable in reducing the present systematic uncertainties. The collaboration of
physicists working in different subfields will be important to obtain the most
from this available information. It is now also possible, with the facilities
developed for long baseline beams, to produce high intensity and well
controlled neutrino beams to measure the neutrino interaction properties with
much better precision that what was done in the past. Several projects and
ideas to fully exploit these possibilities are under active investigation.
These topics have been the object of the first neutrino interaction (NUINT01)
workshop.
