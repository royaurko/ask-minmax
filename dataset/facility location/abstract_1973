Atomic masses of the neutron-rich isotopes $^{76-80}$Zn, $^{78-83}$Ga,
$^{80-85}Ge, $^{81-87}$As and $^{84-89}$Se have been measured with high
precision using the Penning trap mass spectrometer JYFLTRAP at the IGISOL
facility. The masses of $^{82,83}$Ga, $^{83-85}$Ge, $^{84-87}$As and $^{89}$Se
were measured for the first time. These new data represent a major improvement
in the knowledge of the masses in this neutron-rich region. Two-neutron
separation energies provide evidence for the reduction of the N=50 shell gap
energy towards germanium Z=32 and a subsequent increase at gallium (Z=31). The
data are compared with a number of theoretical models. An indication of the
persistent rigidity of the shell gap towards nickel (Z=28) is obtained.
