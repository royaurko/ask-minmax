We report the detection of Cepheid variable stars in the barred spiral galaxy
NGC 1365, located in the Fornax cluster, using the Hubble Space Telescope Wide
Field and Planetary Camera 2. Twelve V (F555W) and four I (F814W) epochs of
observation were obtained. The two photometry packages, ALLFRAME and DoPHOT,
were separately used to obtain profile-fitting photometry of all the stars in
the HST field. The search for Cepheid variable stars resulted in a sample of 52
variables, with periods between 14 and 60 days, in common with both datasets.
ALLFRAME photometry and light curves of the Cepheids are presented. A subset of
34 Cepheids were selected on the basis of period, light curve shape, similar
ALLFRAME and DoPHOT periods, color, and relative crowding, to fit the Cepheid
period-luminosity relations in V and I for both ALLFRAME and DoPHOT. The
measured distance modulus to NGC 1365 from the ALLFRAME photometry is 31.31 +/-
0.20 (random) +/- 0.18 (systematic) mag, corresponding to a distance of 18.3
+/- 1.7 (random) +/- 1.6 (systematic) Mpc. The reddening is measured to be
E(V-I) = 0.16 +/- 0.08 mag. These values are in excellent agreement with those
obtained using the DoPHOT photometry, namely a distance modulus of 31.26 +/-
0.10 mag, and a reddening of 0.15 +/- 0.10 mag (internal errors only).
