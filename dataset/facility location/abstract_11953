We show that the presence of a spin-dependent random potential in a
superconductor or a superfluid atomic gas leads to distinct transitions at
which the energy gap and average order parameter vanish, generating an
intermediate gapless superfluid phase, in marked contrast to the case of
spin-symmetric randomness where no such gapless superfluid phase is seen. By
allowing the pairing amplitude to become inhomogeneous, the gapless
superconducting phase persists to considerably higher disorder compared with
the prediction of Abrikosov-Gorkov. The low-lying excited states are located
predominantly in regions where the pairing amplitude vanishes and coexist with
the superfluid regions with a finite pairing. Our results are based on
inhomogeneous Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean field theory for a two dimensional
attractive Hubbard model with spin-dependent disorder.
