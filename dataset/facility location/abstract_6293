The paper presents an investigation of local-time effect - one of the
manifestations of macroscopic fluctuations phenomena. Was shown the existence
of the named effect for longitudinal distance between locations of measurements
up to 500 meters. Also a structure of intervals distribution in neighborhood of
local-time peak was studied and splitting of the peak was found out. Obtained
results lead to conclusion about sharp anisotropy of space-time.
