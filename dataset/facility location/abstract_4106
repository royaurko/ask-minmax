The nearby radio galaxy 3C293 is one of a small group of objects where
extreme outflows of neutral hydrogen have been detected. However, due to the
limited spatial resolution of previous observations, the exact location of the
outflow was not able to be determined. In this letter, we present new higher
resolution VLA observations of the central regions of this radio source and
detect a fast outflow of HI with a FWZI velocity of \Delta v~1200 km/s
associated with the inner radio jet, approximately 0.5 kpc west of the central
core. We investigate possible mechanisms which could produce the observed HI
outflow and conclude that it is driven by the radio-jet. However, this outflow
of neutral hydrogen is located on the opposite side of the nucleus to the
outflow of ionised gas previously detected in this object. We calculate a mass
outflow rate in the range of 8-50 solar masses/yr corresponding to a kinetic
energy power injected back into the ISM of 1.38x10^{42} - 1.00x10^{43} erg/s or
0.01 - 0.08 percent of the Eddington luminosity. This places it just outside
the range required by some galaxy evolution simulations for negative feedback
from the AGN to be effective in halting star-formation within the galaxy.
