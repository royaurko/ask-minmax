The vector and tensor polarizations of a deuteron beam have been measured
using elastic deuteron-carbon scattering at 75.6 MeV and deuteron-proton
scattering at 270 MeV. After acceleration to 1170 MeV inside the COSY ring, the
polarizations of the deuterons were checked by studying a variety of nuclear
reactions using a cluster target at the ANKE magnet spectrometer placed at an
internal target position of the storage ring. All these measurements were
consistent with the absence of depolarization during acceleration and provide a
number of secondary standards that can be used in subsequent experiments at the
facility.
