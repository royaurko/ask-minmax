A fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) system based on two independent
measurement volumes is presented. The optical setup and data acquisition
hardware are detailed, as well as a complete protocol to control the location,
size and shape of the measurement volumes. A method that allows to monitor
independently the excitation and collection efficiency distribution is
proposed. Finally, a few examples of measurements that exploit the two spots in
static and/or scanning schemes, are reported.
