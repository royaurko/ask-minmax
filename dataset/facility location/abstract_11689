Pulsar timing is a promising technique for detecting low frequency sources of
gravitational waves. Historically the focus has been on the detection of
diffuse stochastic backgrounds, such as those formed from the superposition of
weak signals from a population of binary black holes. More recently, attention
has turned to members of the binary population that are nearer and brighter,
which stand out from the crowd and can be individually resolved. Here we show
that the timing data from an array of pulsars can be used to recover the
physical parameters describing an individual black hole binary to good
accuracy, even for moderately strong signals. A novel aspect of our analysis is
that we include the distance to each pulsar as a search parameter, which allows
us to utilize the full gravitational wave signal. This doubles the signal
power, improves the sky location determination by an order of magnitude, and
allows us to extract the mass and the distance to the black hole binary.
