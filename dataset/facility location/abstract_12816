Discovered in October 2010 by the LINEAR survey, P/2010 TO20 LINEAR-Grauer
(LG) was initially classified as an inert Jupiter Trojan. Subsequent
observations obtained in October 2011 revealed LG to be a Jupiter-family comet.
LG has one of the largest perihelia (q=5.1 AU) and lowest eccentricities
(e=0.09) of the known JFCs. We report on observations of LG taken on 29 October
2011 and numerical simulations of its orbital evolution. Analysis of our data
reveals that LG has a small nucleus (<3 km in radius) with broadband colours
(B-R=0.99+/-0.06 mag, V-R=0.47+/-0.06 mag) typical of JFCs. We find a model
dependent mass-loss rate close to 100 kg/s, most likely powered by water-ice
sublimation. Our numerical simulation indicate that the orbit of LG is unstable
on very short (10 to 100 yr) timescales and suggest this object has recently
evolved into its current location from a more distant, Centaur-type orbit. The
orbit, dynamics and activity of LG share similarities with the well known case
of comet 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1.
