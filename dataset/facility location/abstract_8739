We have used the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland-Association (BIMA) millimeter
array outfitted with sensitive cm-wave receivers to search for Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) anisotropies on arcminute scales. The interferometer was
placed in a compact configuration which produces high brightness sensitivity,
while providing discrimination against point sources. Operating at a frequency
of 28.5 GHz, the FWHM primary beam of the instrument is 6.6 arcminutes. We have
made sensitive images of seven fields, five of which where chosen specifically
to have low IR dust contrast and be free of bright radio sources. Additional
observations with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) millimeter array
were used to assist in the location and removal of radio point sources.
Applying a Bayesian analysis to the raw visibility data, we place limits on CMB
anisotropy flat-band power Q_flat = 5.6 (+3.0 -5.6) uK and Q_flat < 14.1 uK at
68% and 95% confidence. The sensitivity of this experiment to flat band power
peaks at a multipole of l = 5470, which corresponds to an angular scale of
approximately 2 arcminutes. The most likely value of Q_flat is similar to the
level of the expected secondary anisotropies.
