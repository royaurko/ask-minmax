In this work, two types of codes such that they both dominate and locate the
vertices of a graph are studied. Those codes might be sets of detectors in a
network or processors controlling a system whose set of responses should
determine a malfunctioning processor or an intruder. Here, we present our more
significant contributions on \lambda-codes and \eta-codes concerning concerning
bounds, extremal values and realization theorems.
