We use the fitted Pareto law to construct an accompanying approximation of
the excess distribution function. A selection rule of the location of the
excess distribution function is proposed based on a stagewise lack-of-fit
testing procedure. Our main result is an oracle type inequality for the
Kullback--Leibler loss.
