In this paper, we provide an $O(n \mathrm{polylog} n)$ bound on the expected
complexity of the randomly weighted Voronoi diagram of a set of $n$ sites in
the plane, where the sites can be either points, interior-disjoint convex sets,
or other more general objects. Here the randomness is on the weight of the
sites, not their location. This compares favorably with the worst case
complexity of these diagrams, which is quadratic. As a consequence we get an
alternative proof to that of Agarwal etal [AHKS13] of the near linear
complexity of the union of randomly expanded disjoint segments or convex sets
(with an improved bound on the latter). The technique we develop is elegant and
should be applicable to other problems.
