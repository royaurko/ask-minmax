The energy dependence of hadron production in central Pb-Pb collisions at SPS
energies is presented and compared with data at lower and higher energies and
with results from p-p interactions. It is observed that there is little change
in transverse activity in the SPS energy range, that there is a steepening rate
of increase of pion production and that the K+/pi+ ratio exhibits a sharp peak
located at about 30 AGeV. The Lambda/pi ratio also shows a pronounced maximum
which is weaker in Ksi/pi and absent in Omega/pi.
