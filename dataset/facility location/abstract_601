A new superconducting RF cavity test facility has been commissioned at
Fermilab in conjunction with first tests of a 325 MHz, {\beta} = 0.22
superconducting single-spoke cavity dressed with a helium jacket and prototype
tuner. The facility is described and results of full gradient, CW cavity tests
with a high Qext drive coupler are reported. Sensitivities to Q disease and
externally applied magnetic fields were investigated. Results are compared to
bare cavity results obtained prior to hydrogen degassing and welding into the
helium jacket.
