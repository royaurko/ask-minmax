I discuss the theoretical uncertainties in the indirect Higgs mass
determination. I present the probability density function for the Higgs mass
obtained combining together the information from precision measurements with
the results from the direct search experiments carried out at LEP. The
probability that the Higgs weights less than 116 GeV comes out to be around 35
% while the 95 % upper limit is located around 210-230 GeV.
