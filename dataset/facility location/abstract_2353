Our paper approaches the parking assistance service in urban environments as
an instance of service provision in non-cooperative network environments. We
propose normative abstractions for the way drivers pursue parking space and the
way they respond to partial or complete information for parking demand and
supply as well as specific pricing policies on public and private parking
facilities. The drivers are viewed as strategic agents who make rational
decisions attempting to minimize the cost of the acquired parking spot. We
formulate the resulting games as resource selection games and derive their
equilibria under different expressions of uncertainty about the overall parking
demand. The efficiency of the equilibrium states is compared against the
optimal assignment that could be determined by a centralized entity and
conditions are derived for minimizing the related price of anarchy value. Our
results provide useful hints for the pricing and practical management of
on-street and private parking resources. More importantly, they exemplify
counterintuitive less-is-more effects about the way information availability
modulates the service cost, which underpin general competitive service
provision settings and contribute to the better understanding of effective
information mechanisms.
