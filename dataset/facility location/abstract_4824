We investigate the formation processes of a sandpile using numerical
simulation. We find a new relation between the fluctuation of the motion of the
top and the surface state of a sandpile. The top moves frequently as particles
are fed one by one every time interval T. The time series of the top location
has the power spectrum which obeys a power law, S(f)~f^{\alpha}, and its
exponent \alpha depends on T and the system size w. The surface state is
characterized by two time scales; the lifetime of an avalanche, T_{a}, and the
time required to cause an avalanche, T_{s}. The surface state is fluid-like
when T_{a}~T_{s}, and it is solid-like when T_{a}<<T_{s}. Our numerical results
show that \alpha is a function of T_{s}/T_{a}.
