In this paper, we adopt a new communication protocol between the UAV and
fixed on-ground nodes. This protocol tends to reduce communication power
consumption by stopping communication if the channel is not good to communicate
(i.e. far nodes, obstacles, etc.) The communication is performed using the XBee
868M standard and Libelium wapsmotes. Our designed protocol is based on a new
communication model that we propose in this paper. The protocole decides wether
to communicate or not after computing the channel reliability through prior
RSSI measurement and nodes location data
