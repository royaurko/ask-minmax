A general numerical method is presented to locate the partition function
zeros in the complex beta plane for large lattice sizes. We apply this method
to the 2D Ising model and results are reported for square lattice sizes up tp
L=64. We also propose an alternative method to evaluate corrections to scaling
which relies only on the leading zeros. This method is illustrated with our
data.
