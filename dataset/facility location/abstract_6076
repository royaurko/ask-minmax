The original de Rafael-Taron bound on the slope of the Isgur-Wise function at
zero recoil is known to be violated in QCD by singularities appearing in an
unphysical region. To be consistent, quark models must have corresponding
singularity structures. In an existing relativistic quark-loop model, the
meson-quark-antiquark vertex is such that the required singularity is an
anomalous threshold. We also discuss the implications of another anomalous
threshold, whose location is determined by quark masses alone.
