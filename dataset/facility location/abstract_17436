Resonant Switch (RS) model of twin peak high-frequency quasi-periodic
oscillations (HF QPOs) assumes switch of twin oscillations at a resonant point
where frequencies of the upper and lower oscillations become commensurable and
the twin oscillations change from one pair of the oscillating modes
(corresponding to a specific model of HF QPOs) to some other pair due to
non-linear resonant phenomena. The RS model is used to determine range of
allowed values of spin and mass of the neutron star located at the atoll source
4U 1636-53 where two resonant points are observed at frequency ratios $nu_{U}$
: $nu_{L}$ = 3:2, 5:4. We consider the standard specific models of the twin
oscillations based on the orbital and epicyclic geodetical frequencies. The
resonant points are determined by the energy switch effect exhibited by the
vanishing of the amplitude difference of the upper and lower oscillations. The
predicted ranges of the neutron star parameters are strongly dependent on the
twin modes applied in the RS model. We demonstrate that for some of the
oscillatory modes used in the RS model the predicted parameters of the neutron
star are unacceptable. Among acceptable RS models the most promising are those
combining the Relativistic Precession and the Total Precession frequency
relations or their modifications.
