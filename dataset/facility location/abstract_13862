We have carried out 12CO (J=1-0 and 2-1), 13CO (J=1-0), and C18O (J=1-0)
observations in the direction of the supernova remnant (SNR) G22.7-0.2. A
filamentary molecular gas structure, which is likely part of a larger molecular
complex with VLSR~75-79 km/s, is detected and is found to surround the southern
boundary of the remnant. In particular, the high-velocity wing (77-110 km/s) in
the 12CO (J=1-0 and J=2-1) emission shows convincing evidence of the
interaction between SNR G22.7-0.2 and the 75-79 km/s molecular clouds (MCs).
Spectra with redshifted profiles, a signature of shocked molecular gas, are
seen in the southeastern boundary of the remnant. The association between the
remnant and the 77 km/s MCs places the remnant at the near distance of 4.0-4.8
kpc, which agrees with a location on the Scutum-Crux arm. We suggest that SNR
G22.7-0.2, SNR W41, and HII region G022.760-0.485 are at the same distance and
are associated with GMC G23.0-0.4.
