"T-fold" backgrounds are generically-nongeometric compactifications of string
theory, described by T^n fibrations over a base N with transition functions in
the perturbative T-duality group. We review Hull's doubled torus formalism,
which geometrizes these backgrounds, and use the formalism to constrain the
D-brane spectrum (to leading order in g_s and alpha') on T^n fibrations over
S^1 with O(n,n;Z) monodromy. We also discuss the (approximate) moduli space of
such branes and argue that it is always geometric. For a D-brane located at a
point on the base N, the classical ``D-geometry'' is a T^n fibration over a
multiple cover of N.
