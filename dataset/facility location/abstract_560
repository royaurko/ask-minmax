The High-Energy Storage Ring (HESR) of the future International Facility for
Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) at GSI in Darmstadt is planned as an
antiproton synchrotron and storage ring in the momentum range from 1.5 to 15
GeV/c. An important feature of this new facility is the combination of phase
space cooled beams with dense internal targets (e.g. pellet targets), resulting
in demanding beam parameter of two operation modes: high luminosity mode with
peak luminosities up to 2*10^32 cm-2 s-1, and high resolution mode with a
momentum spread down to 10^-5, respectively. To reach these beam parameters
very powerful phase space cooling is needed, utilizing high-energy electron
cooling and high-bandwidth stochastic cooling. The effect of beam-target
scattering and intra-beam interaction is investigated in order to study beam
equilibria and beam losses for the two different operation modes.
