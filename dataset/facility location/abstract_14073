The polymeric phase of nitrogen connected by the lower (than three) order N-N
bonds has been long sought after for the potential application as high energy
density materials. Here we report a hitherto unknown polymeric N$_2$H phase
discovered in the high-pressure hydronitrogen system by first-principle
structure search method based on particle swarm optimization algorithm. This
polymeric hydronitrogen consists of quasi-one-dimensional infinite
armchair-like polymeric N chains, where H atoms bond with two adjacent N
located at one side of armchair edge. It is energetically stable against
decomposition above ~33 GPa, and shows novel metallic feature as the result of
pressure-enhanced charge transfer and delocalization of {\pi} electrons within
the infinite nitrogen chains. The high energy density (~4.40 KJ/g), high
nitrogen content (96.6%), as well as relatively low stabilization pressure,
make it a possible candidate for high energy density applications. It also has
lattice dynamical stability down to the ambient pressure, allowing for the
possibility of kinetic stability with respect to variations of external
conditions. Experimental synthesis of this novel phase is called for.
