We present a detailed study of the spatial resolution of our time-resolved
neutron imaging detector utilizing a new neutron position reconstruction method
that improves both spatial resolution and event reconstruction efficiency. Our
prototype detector system, employing a micro-pattern gaseous detector known as
the micro-pixel chamber ({\mu}PIC) coupled with a
field-programmable-gate-array-based data acquisition system, combines
100{\mu}m-level spatial and sub-{\mu}s time resolutions with excellent gamma
rejection and high data rates, making it well suited for applications in
neutron radiography at high-intensity, pulsed neutron sources. From data taken
at the Materials and Life Science Experimental Facility within the Japan Proton
Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC), the spatial resolution was found to be
approximately Gaussian with a sigma of 103.48 +/- 0.77 {\mu}m (after correcting
for beam divergence). This is a significant improvement over that achievable
with our previous reconstruction method (334 +/- 13 {\mu}m), and compares well
with conventional neutron imaging detectors and with other high-rate detectors
currently under development. Further, a detector simulation indicates that a
spatial resolution of less than 60 {\mu}m may be possible with optimization of
the gas characteristics and {\mu}PIC structure. We also present an example of
imaging combined with neutron resonance absorption spectroscopy.
