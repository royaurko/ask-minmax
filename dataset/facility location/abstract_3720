X-ray Thomson scattering is being developed as a method to measure the
temperature, electron density, and ionization state of high energy density
plasmas such as those used in inertial confinement fusion. X-ray laser sources
have always been of interest because of the need to have a bright monochromatic
x-ray source to overcome plasma emission and eliminate other lines in the
background that complicate the analysis. With the advent of the xray free
electron laser (X-FEL) at the SLAC Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) and other
facilities coming online worldwide, we now have such a source available in the
keV regime. Most Thomson scattering codes used to model experimental data
greatly simplify or neglect the contributions of the bound electrons to the
scattered intensity. In this work we take the existing models of Thomson
scattering that include elastic ion-ion scattering and inelastic
electron-electron scattering and add the contribution of bound electrons in the
partially ionized plasmas. To date, most experiments have studied hydrogen or
beryllium plasmas. We first analyze existing experimental data for beryllium to
validate the code. We then consider several higher Z materials such as Cr and
predict the existence of additional peaks in the scattering spectrum that
requires new computational tools to understand. For a Sn plasma, we show that
bound contributions change the shape of the scattered spectrum in a way that
would change the plasma temperature and density inferred from experiment.
