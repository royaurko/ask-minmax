The energy dependence of various hadronic observables is reviewed. The study
of their evolution from AGS over SPS to the highest RHIC energy reveals
interesting features, which might locate a possible onset of deconfinement.
These observables include transverse spectra of different particle types and
their total multiplicities, as well as elliptic flow. In this context
especially the observation of a maximum of the strangeness to pion ratio is of
particular interest, since on one hand it has been predicted as a signal for
the onset of deconfinement but on the other hand also statistical model
calculations exhibit qualitatively similar structures. The sharpness of these
features is however not reproduced by hadronic scenarios.
  The significance of these structures will be discussed in this contribution.
Other observables, such as radius parameters from Bose-Einstein correlations,
on the other hand do not exhibit any structure in their energy dependence.
