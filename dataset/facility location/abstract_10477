We characterize horizontal mixing and transport structures in the surface
circulation of the Mediterranean Sea, as obtained from a primitive equation
circulation model. We calculate the Finite Size Lyapunov Exponents (FSLEs) of
the velocity data set, which gives a direct measure of the local stirring. By
proper election of the FSLE parameters, we focus on the mesoscale structures,
locating a number of vortices embedded in an intricate network of
high-stretching lines. These lines control transport in the system. At the edge
of the vortices, a dense tangle of line intersections appears, identifying
strong mixing. The spatial distribution of FSLEs, averaged over one year,
allows to classify areas in the Mediterranean basin according by their mixing
activity. The space average of FSLEs on selected geographical regions gives a
measure for quantifying and comparing the mixing seasonal variability.
