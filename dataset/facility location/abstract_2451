We present the experimental demonstration of a method for generating two
spectrally and temporally separated pulses by an externally seeded, single-pass
free-electron laser operating in the extreme-ultraviolet spectral range. Our
results, collected on the FERMI@Elettra facility and confirmed by numerical
simulations, demonstrate the possibility of controlling both the spectral and
temporal features of the generated pulses. A free-electron laser operated in
this mode becomes a suitable light source for jitter-free, two-colour
pump-probe experiments.
