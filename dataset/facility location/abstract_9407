Recent progress in the diagnosis of flare fast particles is critically
discussed with the main emphasis on high resolution Hard X-Ray (HXR) data from
RHESSI and coordinated data from other instruments. Spectacular new photon data
findings are highlighted as are advances in theoretical aspects of their use as
fast particle diagnostics, and some important comparisons made with
interplanetary particle data. More specifically the following topics are
addressed
  (a) RHESSI data on HXR (electron) versus gamma-ray line (ion) source
locations.
  (b) RHESSI hard X-ray source spatial structure in relation to theoretical
models and loop density structure.
  (c) Energy budget of flare electrons and the Neupert effect.
  (d) Spectral deconvolution methods including blind target testing and results
for RHESSI HXR spectra, including the reality and implications of dips inferred
in electron spectra
  (e) The relation between flare in-situ and interplanetary particle data.
