We report new measurements of the doubly-polarized photodisintegration of
$^3$He at an incident photon energy of 16.5 MeV, carried out at the High
Intensity $\gamma$-ray Source (HI$\gamma$S) facility located at Triangle
Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL). The spin-dependent double-differential
cross sections and the contribution from the three--body channel to the
Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn (GDH) integrand were extracted and compared with the
state-of-the-art three--body calculations. The calculations, which include the
Coulomb interaction and are in good agreement with the results of previous
measurements at 12.8 and 14.7 MeV, can no longer describe the cross section
results at 16.5 MeV. The GDH integrand was found to be about one standard
deviation larger than the maximum value predicted by the theories.
