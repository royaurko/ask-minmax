We present a time-resolved study of the logical operation of a polariton
condensate transistor switch. Creating a polariton condensate (source) in a
GaAs ridge-shaped microcavity with a non-resonant pulsed laser beam, the
polariton propagation towards a collector, at the ridge edge, is controlled by
a second weak pulse (gate), located between the source and the collector. The
experimental results are interpreted in the light of simulations based on the
generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation, including incoherent pumping, decay and
energy relaxation within the condensate.
