We report on the discovery of the young, nearby, brown dwarf 2MASS
J0041353$-$562112. The object has a spectral type of M7.5, it shows Li
absorption and signatures of accretion, which implies that it still has a disk
and suggests an age below 10 Myr. The space motion vector and position on the
sky indicate that the brown dwarf is probably a member of the $\sim$20 Myr old
Tuc-Hor association, or that it may be an ejected member of the $\sim$12 Myr
old $\beta$ Pic association, both would imply that 2MASS J0041353$-$562112 may
in fact be older than 10 Myr. No accreting star or brown dwarf was previously
known in these associations. Assuming an age of 10 Myr, the brown dwarf has a
mass of about 30 M$_{\rm Jup}$ and is located at 35 pc distance. The newly
discovered object is the closest accreting brown dwarf known. Its membership to
an association older than 10 Myr implies that either disks in brown dwarfs can
survive as long as in more massive stars, perhaps even longer, or that star
formation in Tuc-Hor or $\beta$ Pic occured more recently than previously
thought. The history and evolution of this object can provide new fundamental
insight into the formation process of stars, brown dwarfs, and planets.
