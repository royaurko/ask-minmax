Microscopic robots could perform tasks with high spatial precision, such as
acting in biological tissues on the scale of individual cells, provided they
can reach precise locations. This paper evaluates the feasibility of in vivo
locomotion for micron-size robots. Two appealing methods rely only on surface
motions: steady tangential motion and small amplitude oscillations. These
methods contrast with common microorganism propulsion based on flagella or
cilia, which are more likely to damage nearby cells if used by robots made of
stiff materials. The power potentially available to robots in tissue supports
speeds ranging from one to hundreds of microns per second, over the range of
viscosities found in biological tissue. We discuss design trade-offs among
propulsion method, speed, power, shear forces and robot shape, and relate those
choices to robot task requirements. This study shows that realizing such
locomotion requires substantial improvements in fabrication capabilities and
material properties over current technology.
