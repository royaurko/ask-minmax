Cross sections, kinetic energy and angular distributions of fragments with
charge 6$\le$Z$\le$28 emitted in 78,82Kr+40C at 5.5 MeV/A reactions were
measured at the GANIL facility using the INDRA apparatus. This experiment aims
to investigate the influence of the neutron enrichment on the decay mechanism
of excited nuclei. Data are discussed in comparison with predictions of
transition state and Hauser-Feshbach models.
