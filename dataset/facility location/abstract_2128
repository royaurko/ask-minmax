We describe here the nature, formation and evolution of the supergiant high
mass X-ray binary (HMXB) population, i.e. systems accreting the stellar wind of
supergiant stars. There are now many new observations, from the high-energy
side (mainly from the INTEGRAL satellite), complemented by multi-wavelength
observations (mainly in the optical, near and mid-infrared from ESO
facilities), showing that a new population of supergiant HMXBs has been
recently revealed. We report here on the observational facts about the
different categories of HMXBs, allowing to build a consistent scenario
explaining the various characteristics of these sources, based on models of
accretion in these sources (e.g. transitory accretion disc versus clumpy
winds). We also mention new observations suggesting the existence of
evolutionary links between Be and stellar wind accreting supergiant X-ray
binaries.
