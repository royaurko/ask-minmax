The Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard (JCH) system describes a network of single-mode
photonic cavities connected via evanescent coupling. Each cavity contains a
single two level system which can be tuned in resonance with the cavity. Here
we explore the behavior of single excitations (where an excitation can be
either photonic or atomic) in the linear JCH system, which describes a coupled
cavity waveguide. We use direct, analytic diagonalization of the Hamiltonian to
study cases where inter-cavity coupling is either uniform or varies
parabolically along the chain. Both excitations located in a single cavity, as
well as one excitation as a Gaussian pulse spread over many cavities, are
investigated as initial states. We predict unusual behavior of this system in
the time domain, including slower than expected propagation of the excitation,
and also splitting of the excitation into two distinct pulses, which travel at
distinct speeds. In certain limits, we show that the JCH system mimics two
Heisenberg spin chains.
