The energy dependence of the local ${\cal P}$ and ${\cal CP}$ violation in
Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions in a large energy range is estimated within a simple
phenomenological model. It is expected that at LHC the chiral magnetic effect
will be about 20 times weaker than at RHIC. At lower energy range, covered by
the low-energy scan at RHIC and future NICA/FAIR facilities, the created
magnetic field strength and energy density of deconfined matter are rather high
providing necessary conditions for the chiral magnetic effect. However, the
particular model for the chiral magnetic effect predicts that this effect
should vanish sharply at energy somewhere above the top SPS one. To elucidate
CME background effects the Hadron-String-Dynamics (HSD) transport model
including electromagnetic fields is put forward. Importance of new planning
experiments at LHC and for the low-energy RHIC scan program is emphasized.
