A sliver state is a classical solution of the string field theory of the
tachyon vacuum that represents a background with a single D25-brane. We show
that the sliver wavefunctional factors into functionals of the left and right
halves of the string, and hence can be naturally regarded as a rank-one
projector in a space of half-string functionals. By developing an algebraic
oscillator approach we are able construct higher rank projectors that describe
configurations of multiple D-branes of various dimensionalities and located at
arbitrary positions. The results bear remarkable similarities with
non-commutative solitons.
