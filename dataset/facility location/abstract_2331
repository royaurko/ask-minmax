We investigate the effects of newly measured beta-decay half-lives on
r-process nucleosynthesis. These new rates were determined by recent
experiments at the radioactive isotope beam factory facility in the RIKEN
Nishina Center. We adopt an r-process nucleosynthesis environment based on a
magnetohydrodynamic supernova explosion model that includes strong magnetic
fields and rapid rotation of the progenitor. A number of the new beta-decay
rates are for nuclei on or near the r-process path, and hence they affect the
nucleosynthesis yields and time scale of the r-process. The main effect of the
newly measured beta-decay half-lives is an enhancement in the calculated
abundance of isotopes with mass number A = 110 -- 120 relative to calculated
abundances based upon beta-decay rates estimated with the finite-range droplet
mass model. This effect slightly alleviates, but does not fully explain, the
tendency of r-process models to underproduce isotopes with A = 110 -- 120
compared to the solar-system r-process abundances.
