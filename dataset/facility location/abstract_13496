This report is a summary of research conducted on cloth tracking for
automated textile manufacturing during a two semester long research course at
Georgia Tech. This work was completed in 2009. Advances in current sensing
technology such as the Microsoft Kinect would now allow me to relax certain
assumptions and generally improve the tracking performance. This is because a
major part of my approach described in this paper was to track features in a 2D
image and use these to estimate the cloth deformation. Innovations such as the
Kinect would improve estimation due to the automatic depth information obtained
when tracking 2D pixel locations. Additionally, higher resolution camera images
would probably give better quality feature tracking. However, although I would
use different technology now to implement this tracker, the algorithm described
and implemented in this paper is still a viable approach which is why I am
publishing this as a tech report for reference. In addition, although the
related work is a bit exhaustive, it will be useful to a reader who is new to
methods for tracking and estimation as well as modeling of cloth.
