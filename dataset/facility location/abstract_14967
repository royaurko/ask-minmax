New optical MK classification spectra have been obtained for 14 OB star
candidates identified by Comeron et al. (2002) and presumed to be possible
members of the Cyg OB2 cluster. All 14 candidate OB stars observed are indeed
early-type stars, strongly suggesting the remaining 31 candidates identified by
Comeron et al. are also early-type stars. However, as many as half of the new
stars appear to be significantly older than the previously studied optical
cluster, making their membership in Cyg OB2 suspect. Despite this, the
recognition of Cyg OB2 being a more massive and extensive star cluster than
previously realized, along with the recently recognized candidate super star
cluster Westerlund 1 only a few kpc away (Clark & Negueruela 2002), reminds us
that we are woefully under-informed about the massive cluster population in our
Galaxy. Extrapolations of the locally derived cluster luminosity function
indicate 10s to perhaps 100 of these very massive open clusters (Mcl ~ 10^4
M_sun, Mv ~ -11) should exist within our galaxy. Radio surveys will not detect
these massive clusters if they are more than a few million years old. Our best
hope for remedying this shortfall is through deep infrared searches and follow
up near-infrared spectroscopic observations, as was used by Comeron et al. to
locate candidate members of the Cyg OB2 association.
