We present the results of a search for the donor star in the high inclination
SU UMa type cataclysmic variable IY UMa. We detect absorption features in the
near infrared consistent with an M type dwarf donor star. Using the skew
mapping technique to exploit the velocity information provided by the 8183-8194
Angstrom Na I absorption doublet, we locate the absorption at the expected
donor velocity of IY UMa.
