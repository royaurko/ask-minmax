A multicomponent random process used as a model for the problem of space-time
earthquake prediction; this allows us to develop consistent estimation for
conditional probabilities of large earthquakes if the values of the predictor
characterizing the seismicity prehistory are known. We introduce tools for
assessing prediction efficiency, including a separate determination of
efficiency for "time prediction" and "location prediction": a generalized
correlation coefficient and the density of information gain. We suggest a
technique for testing the predictor to decide whether the hypothesis of no
prediction can be rejected.
