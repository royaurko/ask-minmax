This paper considers nonlinear systems with full state feedback, a central
controller and distributed sensors not co-located with the central controller.
We present a methodology for designing decentralized asynchronous
event-triggers, which utilize only locally available information, for
determining the time instants of transmission from the sensors to the central
controller. The proposed design guarantees a positive lower bound for the
inter-transmission times of each sensor, while ensuring asymptotic stability of
the origin of the system with an arbitrary, but priorly fixed, compact region
of attraction. In the special case of Linear Time Invariant (LTI) systems,
global asymptotic stability is guaranteed and scale invariance of
inter-transmission times is preserved. A modified design method is also
proposed for nonlinear systems, with the addition of event-triggered
communication from the controller to the sensors, that promises to
significantly increase the average sensor inter-transmission times compared to
the case where the controller does not transmit data to the sensors. The
proposed designs are illustrated through simulations of a linear and a
nonlinear example.
