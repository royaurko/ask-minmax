Recent developments in the MARS15 code are described for the critical modules
related to demands of hadron and lepton colliders and Megawatt proton and
heavy-ion beam facilities. Details of advanced models for particle production
and nuclide distributions in nuclear interactions at low and medium energies,
energy loss, atomic displacements and gas production are presented along with
benchmarking against data.
