On 2010 March 19, the Swift/Burst Alert Telescope triggered on a short burst
with temporal and spectral characteristics similar to those of Soft Gamma
Repeater (SGR) bursts. The source location, however, did not coincide with any
known SGR. Subsequent observations of the source error box with the Swift/X-ray
Telescope and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) led to the discovery of a
new X-ray source, with a spin period of 7.56 s, confirming SGR J1833-0832 as a
new magnetar. Based on our detailed temporal and spectral analyses, we show
that the new SGR is rapidly spinning down (4 x 10^{-12} s/s) and find an
inferred dipole magnetic field of 1.8 x 10^{14} G. We also show that the X-ray
flux of SGR J1833-0832 remained constant for approximately 20 days following
the burst and then started to decline. We derived an accurate location of the
source with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and we searched for a counterpart in
deep optical and infrared observations of SGR J1833-0832, and for radio pulsed
emission with the Westerbork Radio Synthesis Telescope. Finally, we compare the
spectral and temporal properties of the source to the other magnetar
candidates.
