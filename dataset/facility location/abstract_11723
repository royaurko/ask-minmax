We present early results of our multiwavelength study of the star forming
region IRAS 20050+2720. While we use X-rays and IR to classify young stellar
objects, the optical data can be used to exclude foreground objects. The
dataset set contains 57 class I sources, 183 class II sources and 183 X-ray
sources, of which 140 are class III candidates. Within IRAS 20050+2720 four
subclusters are found. Subcluster A and B are the densest regions, which
contain stars of all evolutionary stages. Subcluster C is much younger than the
other two. It has not formed any class III objects yet. We newly identify a
fourth subcluster, which consists mostly of class II objects and is located
about 10 arcmin from the center of the cloud.
