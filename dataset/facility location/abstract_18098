We study the ionization and kinematics of the ionized gas in the nuclear
region of the barred Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC~5643 using MUSE integral field
observations in the framework of the MAGNUM (Measuring Active Galactic Nuclei
Under MUSE Microscope) survey. The data were used to identify regions with
different ionization conditions and to map the gas density and the dust
extinction. We find evidence for a double sided ionization cone, possibly
collimated by a dusty structure surrounding the nucleus. At the center of the
ionization cone, outflowing ionized gas is revealed as a blueshifted,
asymmetric wing of the [OIII] emission line, up to projected velocity
v(10)~-450 km/s. The outflow is also seen as a diffuse, low luminosity radio
and X-ray jet, with similar extension. The outflowing material points in the
direction of two clumps characterized by prominent line emission with spectra
typical of HII regions, located at the edge of the dust lane of the bar. We
propose that the star formation in the clumps is due to `positive feedback'
induced by gas compression by the nuclear outflow, providing the first
candidate for outflow induced star formation in a Seyfert-like radio quiet AGN.
This suggests that positive feedback may be a relevant mechanism in shaping the
black hole-host galaxy coevolution.
