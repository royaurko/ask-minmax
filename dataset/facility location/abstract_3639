Laser accelerated protons can be a complimentary source for treatment of
oncological diseases to the existing hadron therapy facilities. We demonstrate
how the protons, accelerated from near-critical density plasmas by laser pulses
having relatively small power, reach energies which may be of interest for
medical applications. When an intense laser pulse interacts with near-critical
density plasma it makes a channel both in the electron and then in the ion
density. The propagation of a laser pulse through such a self-generated channel
is connected with the acceleration of electrons in the wake of a laser pulse
and generation of strong moving electric and magnetic fields in the propagation
channel. Upon exiting the plasma the magnetic field generates a quasi-static
electric field that accelerates and collimates ions from a thin filament formed
in the propagation channel. Two-dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulations show
that a 100 TW laser pulse tightly focused on a near-critical density target is
able to accelerate protons up to energy of 250 MeV. Scaling laws and optimal
conditions for proton acceleration are established considering the energy
depletion of the laser pulse.
