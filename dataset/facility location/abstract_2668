For a long time it was known that deuteron, as a weakly coupled nucleon pair,
has no excited states. However, A.M. Baldin et al, commenting results of the
first physical experiment with accelerated nuclei at JINR synchrophasotron,
assumed as far back as in 1979 that one of peaks in a differential
cross-section may arise due to an "excited state of deuterium". We have
established that one of the peaks in the cross-section may be explained indeed
in this way and corresponds to the dibaryon reported by WASA-at-COSY
Collaboration. Another peak in the same region is interpreted most likely by
interference of several $N^*$-resonances, and this possibility was also
mentioned in the paper by A.M. Baldin et al. Further experimental studies based
on modern experimental facilities and more abundant statistics are necessary to
verify these observations.
