Phase-targeted RXTE observations have allowed us to detect a transient 71.49
\pm 0.02 s signal that is most likely to be originating from the supergiant
fast X-ray transient IGR J17544-2619. The phase-folded light curve shows a
possible double-peaked structure with a pulsed flux of ~4.8*10^-12 erg cm^-2
s^-1 (3-10 keV). Assuming the signal to indicate the spin period of the neutron
star in the system, the provisional location of IGR J17544-2619 on the Corbet
diagram places the system within the classical wind-fed supergiant XRB region.
Such a result illustrates the growing trend of supergiant fast X-ray transients
to span across both of the original classes of HMXB in Porb - Pspin space.
