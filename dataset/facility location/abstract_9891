We report on an anomalous behavior of the absorption spectrum in a
one-dimensional lattice with long-range-correlated diagonal disorder with a
power-like spectrum in the form S(k) ~ 1/k^A. These type of correlations give
rise to a phase of extended states at the band center, provided A is larger
than a critical value A_c. We show that for A < A_c the absorption spectrum is
single-peaked, while an additional peak arises when A > A_c, signalling the
occurrence of the Anderson transition. The peak is located slightly below the
low-energy mobility edge, providing a unique spectroscopic tool to monitor the
latter. We present qualitative arguments explaining this anomaly.
