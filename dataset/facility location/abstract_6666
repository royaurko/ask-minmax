We study using the Bethe-Salpeter formalism the excitation energies of the
zincbacteriochlorinbacteriochlorin dyad, a paradigmatic photosynthetic complex.
In great contrast with standard timedependent density functional theory
calculations with (semi)local kernels, charge transfer excitations are
correctly located above the intramolecular Q-bands transitions found to be in
excellent agreement with experiment. Further, the asymptotic Coulomb behavior
towards the true quasiparticle gap for charge transfer excitations at long
distance is correctly reproduced, showing that the present scheme allows to
study with the same accuracy intramolecular and charge transfer excitations at
various spatial range and screening environment without any adjustable
parameter.
