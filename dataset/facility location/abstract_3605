Knowledge mining is the process of deriving new and useful knowledge from
vast volumes of data and background knowledge. Modern healthcare organizations
regularly generate huge amount of electronic data stored in the databases.
These data are a valuable resource for mining useful knowledge to help medical
practitioners making appropriate and accurate decision on the diagnosis and
treatment of diseases. In this paper, we propose the design of a novel medical
expert system based on a logic-programming framework. The proposed system
includes a knowledge-mining component as a repertoire of tools for discovering
useful knowledge. The implementation of classification and association mining
tools based on the higher order and meta-level programming schemes using Prolog
has been presented to express the power of logic-based language. Such language
also provides a pattern matching facility, which is an essential function for
the development of knowledge-intensive tasks. Besides the major goal of medical
decision support, the knowledge discovered by our logic-based knowledge-mining
component can also be deployed as background knowledge to pre-treatment data
from other sources as well as to guard the data repositories against constraint
violation. A framework for knowledge deployment is also presented.
