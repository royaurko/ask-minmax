We discover the existence of vortex solitons supported by the surface between
two optical lattices imprinted in Kerr-type nonlinear media. Such solitons can
feature strongly noncanonical profiles, and we found that their properties are
dictated by the location of the vortex core relative to the surface. The
refractive index modulation forming the lattices at both sides of the interface
results in complete stability of the vortex solitons in wide domains of their
existence, thus introducing the first known example of stable topological
solitons supported by a surface.
