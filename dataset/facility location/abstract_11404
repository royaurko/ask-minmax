With the installation of its last two lines in May 2008, ANTARES is currently
the largest neutrino detector in the Northern Hemisphere. The detector
comprises 12 detection lines, carrying 884 ten-inch photomultipliers, at a
depth of about 2500 m in the Mediterranean Sea, about 40 km off shore Toulon in
South France. Thanks to its exceptional angular resolution, better than 0.3
degree above 10 TeV, and its favorable location with the Galactic Center
visible 63% of time, ANTARES is specially suited for the search of
astrophysical point sources. Since 2007 ANTARES has been taking data in smaller
configurations with 5 and 10 lines. With only 5 lines it already has been
possible to set the most restrictive upper limits in the Southern sky. In this
contribution we present the search of point sources with the 5-line data
sample.
