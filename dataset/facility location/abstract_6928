In a theoretical study we investigate the electronic structure and the band
gap of the inverse spinel ferrite NiFe2O4. The experimental optical absorption
spectrum is accurately reproduced by fitting the Tran-Blaha parameter in the
modified Becke-Johnson potential. The accuracy of the commonly applied Tauc
plot to find the optical gap is assessed based on the computed spectra and we
find that this approach can lead to a misinterpretation of the experimental
data. The minimum gap of NiFe2O4 is found to be a 1.53eV wide indirect gap,
which is located in the minority spin channel.
