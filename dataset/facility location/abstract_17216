Context: Recent near-infrared data have contributed to the discovery of new
(obscured) massive stellar clusters and massive stellar populations in
previously known clusters in our Galaxy. These discoveries lead us to view the
Milky Way as an active star-forming machine.
  Aims: The main purpose of this work is to determine physically the main
parameters (distance, size, total mass and age) of Masgomas-1, the first
massive cluster discovered by our systematic search programme.
  Methods: Using near-infrared (J, H, and Ks) photometry we selected 23 OB-type
and five red supergiant candidates for multi-object H- and K-spectroscopy and
spectral classification.
  Results: Of the 28 spectroscopically observed stars, 17 were classified as
OB-type, four as supergiants, one as an A-type dwarf star, and six as late-type
giant stars. The presence of a supergiant population implies a massive nature
of Masgomas-1, supported by our estimate of the cluster initial total mass of
(1.94\pm0.28)\cdot10^4 M_{sun}, obtained after integrating of the cluster mass
function. The distance estimate of 3.53 kpc locates the cluster closer than the
Scutum--Centaurus base but still within that Galactic arm. The presence of an
O9V star and red supergiants in the same population indicates that the cluster
age is in the range of 8 to 10 Myr.
