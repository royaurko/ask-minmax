Model computations of Delta Scuti stars, located in the vicinity of the red
edge of the classical instability strip, suggest amplitudes of solar-like
oscillations larger than in cooler models located outside the instability
strip. Solar-like amplitudes in our Delta Scuti models are found to be large
enough to be detectable with ground-based instruments provided they can be
distinguished from the opacity-driven large-amplitude pulsations. There would
be advantages in observing simultaneously opacity-driven and stochastically
excited modes in the same star. We anticipate their possible detection in the
context of the planned asteroseismic space missions, such as the French mission
COROT (COnvection ROtation and planetary Transits). We propose known Delta
Scuti stars as potential candidates for the target selection of these upcoming
space missions.
