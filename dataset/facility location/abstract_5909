Using a combination of Monte Carlo techniques, we locate the liquid--vapor
critical point of adhesive hard spheres. We find that the critical point lies
deep inside the gel region of the phase diagram. The (reduced) critical
temperature and density are $\tau_c=0.1133\pm0.0005$ and $\rho_c=0.508\pm0.01$.
We compare these results with the available theoretical predictions. Using a
finite-size scaling analysis, we verify that the critical behavior of the
adhesive hard sphere model is consistent with that of the 3D Ising universality
class.
