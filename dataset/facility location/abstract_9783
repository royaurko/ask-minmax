We consider a Hamiltonian system made of $N$ classical particles moving in
two dimensions, coupled via an {\it infinite-range interaction} gauged by a
parameter $A$. This system shows a low energy phase with most of the particles
trapped in a unique cluster. At higher energy it exhibits a transition towards
a homogenous phase. For sufficiently strong coupling $A$ an intermediate phase
characterized by two clusters appears. Depending on the value of $A$ the
observed transitions can be either second or first order in the canonical
ensemble. In the latter case microcanonical results differ dramatically from
canonical ones. However, a canonical analysis, extended to metastable and
unstable states, is able to describe the microcanonical equilibrium phase. In
particular, a microcanonical negative specific heat regime is observed in the
proximity of the transition whenever it is canonically discontinuous. In this
regime, {\it microcanonically stable} states are shown to correspond to {\it
saddles} of the Helmholtz free energy, located inside the spinodal region.
