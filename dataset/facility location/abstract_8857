We estimate the optical depth, time-scale distribution and fraction of
microlensing events originating from sources in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy
(Sgr) lensed by deflectors in the Milky Way. These events have a time-scale
longer by a factor ~1.3 than the MW/MW events and occur mainly on sources
fainter than V~21 mag below Sgr's turn off. The fraction of events involving a
source in Sgr depends on the location and extinction of the field and on the
limiting magnitude of the survey. The contribution of the MW/Sgr events is
negligible (<1%) at very low latitudes (|b|<2 deg.) but increases continuously
towards higher |b| and becomes dominant near the highest density region of the
dwarf galaxy. Sgr is present within the fields of current microlensing surveys
and any optical depth map inferred from observations will become biased by the
presence of Sgr towards higher |b| where the contribution of MW/Sgr events is
significant. Systematic spectroscopic measurements on the sources of all the
microlensing events may allow detection of this kind of event for which the
degeneracy on the lens mass can be significantly reduced.
