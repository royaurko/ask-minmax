We consider the application of Kramers theory to the microscopic calculation
of rates of conformational transitions of macromolecules. The main difficulty
in such an approach is to locate the transition state in a huge configuration
space. We present a method which identifies the transition state along the most
probable reaction pathway. It is then possible to microscopically compute the
activation energy, the damping coefficient, the eigenfrequencies at the
transition state and obtain the rate, without any a-priori choice of a reaction
coordinate. Our theoretical results are tested against the results of Molecular
Dynamics simulations for transitions in a 2-dimensional double well and for the
cis-trans isomerization of a linear molecule.
