The electron spin effects on the surface of a nanotube have been considered
through the spin-orbit interaction (SOI), arising from the electron confinement
on the surface of the nanotube. This is of the same nature as the
Rashba-Bychkov SOI at a semiconductor heterojunction. We estimate the effect of
disorder within a potential barrier on the transmission probability. Using a
continuum model, we obtained analytic expressions for the spin-split energy
bands for electrons on the surface of nanotubes in the presence of SOI. First
we calculate analytically the scattering amplitudes from a potential barrier
located around the axis of the nanotube into spin-dependent states. The effect
of disorder on the scattering process is included phenomenologically and
induces a reduction in the transition probability. We analyzed the relative
role of SOI and disorder on the transmission probability which depends on the
angular and linear momentum of the incoming particle, and its spin orientation.
We demonstrated that in the presence of disorder perfect transmission may not
be achieved for finite barrier heights.
