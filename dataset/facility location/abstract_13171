Sometimes machine code turns out to be a better target for verification than
source code. RISC machine code is especially advantaged with respect to source
code in this regard because it has only two instructions that access memory.
That architecture forms the basis here for an inference system that can prove
machine code safe against `hardware aliasing', an effect that occurs in
embedded systems. There are programming memes that ensure code is safe from
hardware aliasing, but we want to certify that a given machine code is provably
safe.
