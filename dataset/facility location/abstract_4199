A novel method is developed to enable the formation, positioning and
patterning of individual metal nano-clusters with controllable and
monodispersed sizes down to 1-2 nm-scale. Among wide range of potential
applications, the nanoparticle arrays are used for deterministic synthesis of
monodispersed single walled carbon nanotubes. The carbon nanotubes are grown at
individually controlled locations with near one-to-one yield, reaching one of
the ultimate goals of nanotube synthesis.
