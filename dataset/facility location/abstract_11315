We present a comprehensive study of the photon energy dependence of the
valence band photoemission yield in the prototype Mott-Hubbard oxide V2O3. The
analysis of our experimental results, covering an extended photon energy range
(20-6000 eV) and combined with GW calculations, allow us to identify the nature
of the orbitals contributing to the total spectral weight at different binding
energies, and in particular to locate the V 4s at about 8 eV binding energy.
  From this comparative analysis we can conclude that the intensity of the
quasiparticle photoemission peak, observed close to the Fermi level in the
paramagnetic metallic phase upon increasing photon energy, does not have a
significant correlation with the intensity variation of the O 2p and V 3d
yield, thus confirming that bulk sensitivity is an essential requirement for
the detection of this coherent low energy excitation.
