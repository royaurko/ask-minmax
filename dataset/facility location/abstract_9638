The dynamics of a random (quenched) field Ising model (in two dimension) at
zero temperature in the presence of an additional sinusoidally oscillating
homogeneous (in space) magnetic field has been studied by Monte Carlo
simulation using the Metropolis single spin flip dynamics. The instantaneous
magnetisation is found to be periodic with the same periodicity of the
oscillating magnetic field. For very low values of amplitude of oscillating
field and the width of randomly quenched magnetic field, the magnetisation
oscillates asymmetrically about a nonzero value and the oscillation becomes
symmetric about a zero value for higher values of amplitude of oscillating
field and the width of the quenched disorder. The time averaged magnetisation
over a full cycle of the oscillating magnetic field defines the dynamic order
parameter. This dynamic order parameter is nonzero for very low values of
amplitude of oscillating magnetic field and the width of randomly quenched
field. A phase boundary line is drawn in the plane formed by the amplitude of
the oscillating magnetic field and the width of the randomly quenched magnetic
field. A tricritical point has been located, on the phase boundary line, which
separates the nature (discontinuous /continuous) of the dynamic transition.
