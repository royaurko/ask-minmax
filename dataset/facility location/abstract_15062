We report the first detection of X-ray emission from the Quintuplet star
cluster and compare its X-ray emission to that of the Arches star cluster. Four
point sources are significantly detected near the core of the Quintuplet
cluster with a total, absorption-corrected luminosity of ~1\times10^{33} ergs
s^{-1}. Diffuse, thermal emission is also detected near the core of the
Quintuplet cluster with an absorption-corrected luminosity of ~1\times10^{34}
ergs s^{-1}. We analyze the diffuse and point-like emission from the Arches and
Quintuplet and discuss the possibility that they are host to cluster wind
outflows. We also present the results of our search for X-ray emission from
candidate star clusters in the Galactic center (GC) region. We use extinction
estimated by near-IR colors and X-ray spectral fits, as well as other IR
properties, to determine if the candidate clusters are new, GC star clusters.
We find that three of the six candidate clusters found toward the GC are likely
foreground clusters, two of the candidate clusters are not detected in the
X-ray data, but have near-IR extinctions consistent with a GC location, and one
of the candidate clusters has X-ray and near-IR extinctions consistent with
being in the GC. The X-ray and IR emission from the candidate clusters is
compared to the known, massive, GC star clusters.
