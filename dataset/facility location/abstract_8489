We present a CCD investigation of the galactic globular M5 aimed to increase
the statistical relevance of the available sample of evolving bright stars.
Previous investigations, limited to the outer cluster region, have been
extended toward the cluster center, more than doubling the number of observed
luminous stars. On this basis, we discuss a statistically relevant sample, rich
of 415 HB stars. The occurrence of a gap in the blue side of the HB is
suggested. Comparison to the current evolutionary scenario discloses a good
agreement concerning both the C-M diagram location and the relative abundance
of stars in the advanced evolutionary phases, supporting our present knowledge
of the evolution of low mass stars. Determination of the amount of the original
helium content through the ratio R N(HB)/N(RGB) gives $Y = 0.22 \pm 0.02$.
