We propose that the radiative decay process, \eta_b\to J/\psi\gamma, may
serve as a clean searching mode for \eta_b in hadron collision facilities. By a
perturbative QCD calculation, we estimate the corresponding branching ratio to
be of order 10^{-7}. Though very suppressed, this radiative decay channel in
fact has larger branching ratio than the hadronic decay process \eta_b\to
J/\psi J/\psi, which was previously hoped to be a viable mode for ferreting out
\eta_b in Tevatron Run 2. The discovery potential of \eta_b through this
channel seems promising in the forthcoming LHC experiments and maybe even in
Tevatron Run 2, thanks to the huge statistics of \eta_b to be accumulated in
these experiments. The same calculational scheme is also used to estimate the
branching ratios for the processes \eta_b (\eta_c) \to \phi\gamma.
