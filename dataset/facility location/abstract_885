The two major goals for this facility, called ATF2, are : (A) Achievement of
a 37 nm beam size, and (B) control of beam position down to 2 nm level. The
scientific justification for the ATF2 project and its technical design have
been described in Volume 1 of the ATF2 Proposal. We present here Volume 2 of
the ATF2 Proposal, in which we present specifics of the construction plans and
the group organization to execute the research programs at ATF2.
