The influence of commuting in socio-economic dynamics increases constantly.
Analysing and modelling the networks formed by commuters to help
decision-making regarding the land-use has become crucial. This paper presents
a simple spatial interaction simulated model with only one parameter. The
proposed algorithm considers each individual who wants to commute, starting
from their living place to all their workplaces. It decides where the location
of the workplace following the classical rule inspired from the gravity law
consisting in a compromise between the job offers and the distance to the jobs.
The further away the job offer is, the more important it must be in order to be
considered. Inversely, only the quantity of offers is important for the
decision when these offers are close. The paper also presents a comparative
analysis of the structure of the commuting networks of the four European
regions to which we apply our model. The model is calibrated and validated on
these regions. Results from the analysis shows that the model is very efficient
in reproducing most of the statistical properties of the network given by the
data sources.
