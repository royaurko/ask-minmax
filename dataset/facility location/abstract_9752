Electronic structure of a newly discovered antiperovskite superconductor
MgCNi$_3$ is investigated by using the LMTO band method. The main contribution
to the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy $E_{\rm F}$ comes from Ni
3$d$ states which are hybridized with C 2$p$ states. The DOS at $E_{\rm F}$ is
varied substantially by the hole or electron doping due to the very high and
narrow DOS peak located just below $E_{\rm F}$. We have also explored
electronic structures of C-site and Mg-site doped MgCNi$_3$ systems, and
described the superconductivity in terms of the conventional phonon mechanism.
