The preliminary results of an aging test performed at the CERN Gamma
Irradiation Facility on a single--gap RPC prototype developed for the LHCb Muon
System are presented. The results are based on an accumulated charge density of
0.42 C/cm^2, corresponding to about 4 years of LHCb running at the highest
background rate. We observe a rise in the dark current and noise measured with
source off. The current drawn with source on steadily decreased, possibly
indicating an increase of resistivity of the chamber plates. The performance of
the chamber, studied with a muon beam under several photon flux values, is
found to still fulfill the LHCb operation requirements.
