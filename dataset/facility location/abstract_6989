A physical metric is defined as one which gives a measurable speed of light
throughout the whole space time continuum. It will be shown that a metric which
satisfies the condition that speed of light on the spherical direction is that
in a vacuum gives a correct result. All the metric functions thus obtained are
positive definite and exhibits a repulsive force at short distances. The
horizon in the sense of vanishing of the speed of light still exists in the
radial direction. It is located at 2.60 times of the Schwarzschild radius. This
radius corresponds to the size of a black hole, as well as the photon sphere
radius. The metric can be used to calculate general relativistic predictions in
higher order for any process.
