Distinguishing $\gamma$-ray and hadron initiated extensive air showers (EAS)
based on lateral distribution of electrons has been studied by detailed Monte
Carlo (MC) simulations. The possibility of using the local age parameter (LAP)
of EAS for the gamma-hadron separation has been explored. It is found that
separating $\gamma$-ray and hadron induced EAS on the basis of LAP can be
useful for surface detector experiments those have no reliable muon measurement
facilities.
