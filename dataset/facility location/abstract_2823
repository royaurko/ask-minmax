The subject of this paper is a system of phase-oscillators, which are
globally pulse-coupled via excitatory interaction. The appearance and stability
of one- and two-cluster-states is investigated for a family of unimodal
phase-response-curves (PRC). The PRCs and their derivatives are assumed to be
zero at the spiking point. We show that there exist stable homoclinic
connections of the one-cluster state for PRCs with the maximum located shortly
before the spiking point and coexisting stable two-clusters states when the
maximum of the PRC is located shortly after the spike.
