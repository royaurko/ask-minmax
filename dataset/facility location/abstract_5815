A slave boson representation for the degenerate Hubbard model is introduced.
The location of the metal to insulator transition that occurs at commensurate
densities is shown to depend weakly on the band degeneracy M. The relative
weights of the Hubbard sub-bands depend strongly on M, as well as the
magnetic properties. It is also shown that a sizable Hund's rule coupling is
required in order to have a ferromagnetic instability appearing. The metal to
insulator transition driven by an increase in temperature is a strong function
of it.
