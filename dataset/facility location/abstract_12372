Terzan 5 is a Galactic globular cluster exhibiting prominent X-ray and
gamma-ray emission. Following the discovery of extended X- ray emission in this
object, we explore here archival data at several wavelengths for other
unexpected emission features in the vicinity of this globular cluster. Radio
data from the Effelsberg 100 metre telescope show several extended structures
near Terzan 5, albeit with large uncertainties in the flux estimates and no
reliable radio spectral index. In particular, a radio source extending from the
location of Terzan 5 to the north-west could result from long-term non-thermal
electron production by the large population of milli-second pulsars in this
globular cluster. Another prominent radio structure close to Terzan 5 may be
explained by ionised material produced by a field O star. As for the diffuse
X-ray emission found in Terzan 5, its extension appears to be limited to within
2.5 arcmin of the globular cluster and the available multi-wavelength data is
compatible with an inverse Compton scenario but disfavours a non-thermal
Bremsstrahlung origin.
