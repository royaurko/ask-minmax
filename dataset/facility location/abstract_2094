We present a mid-infrared high spectral resolution spectrum of CRL618 in the
frequency ranges 778-784 and 1227-1249 cm^-1 (8.01-8.15 and 12.75-12.85 um)
taken with the Texas Echelon-cross-Echelle Spectrograph (TEXES) and the
Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). We have identified more than 170
ro-vibrational lines arising from C2H2, HCN, C4H2, and C6H2. We have found no
unmistakable trace of C8H2. The line profiles display a complex structure
suggesting the presence of polyacetylenes in several components of the
circumstellar envelope (CSE). We derive total column densities of 2.5 10^17,
3.1 10^17, 2.1 10^17, 9.3 10^16 cm^-2, and < 5 10^16 cm^-2 for HCN, C2H2, C4H2,
C6H2, and C8H2, respectively. The observations indicate that both the
rotational and vibrational temperatures in the innermost CSE depend on the
molecule, varying from 100 to 350 K for the rotational temperatures and 100 to
500 K for the vibrational temperatures. Our results support a chemistry in the
innermost CSE based on radical-neutral reactions triggered by the intense UV
radiation field.
