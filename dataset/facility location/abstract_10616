The generalized oscillator strengths (GOS) of discrete excitations np-nd,
both dipole (L=1) and octupole (L=3) are studied, the latter for the first
time. We demonstrate that although the relevant transitions in the same atom
are closely located in energy, the dependence of their GOS on the momentum
transfer q squared, is remarkably different, so that the GOS corresponding to
L=3 have at least one extra maximum as a function of q squared and dominate
over those of the L=1, starting from about q=1.25$ atomic unit (a.u.). The
calculations were performed in the one particle Hartree-Fock approximation and
with account of many-electron correlations via the Random Phase Approximation
with Exchange. The GOS are studied for values of q squared up to 30 a.u.
