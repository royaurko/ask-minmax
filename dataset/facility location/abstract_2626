Concept of a multichannel electron spin detector based on optical imaging
principles and Mott scattering (iMott) is presented. A multichannel electron
image produced by standard angle-resolving (photo) electron analyzer or
microscope is re-imaged by an electrostatic lens at an accelerating voltage of
40 keV onto the Au target. Quasi-elastic electrons bearing spin asymmetry of
the Mott scattering are imaged by magnetic lenses onto position-sensitive
electron CCDs whose differential signals yield the multichannel spin asymmetry
image. Fundamental advantages of this concept include acceptance of inherently
divergent electron sources from the electron analyzer or microscope focal plane
as well as small aberrations achieved by virtue of high accelerating voltages,
as demonstrated by extensive ray-tracing analysis. The efficiency gain compared
to the single-channel Mott detector can be a factor of more than 1e4 which
opens new prospects of spin-resolved spectroscopies in application not only to
standard bulk and surface systems (Rashba effect, topological insulators, etc.)
but also to buried heterostructures. The simultaneous spin detection and fast
CCD readout enable efficient use of the iMott detectors at X-ray FEL
facilities.
