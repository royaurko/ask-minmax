In wireless networks, radio-map based locating techniques are commonly used
to cope the complex fading feature of radio signal, in which a radio-map is
built by calibrating received signal strength (RSS) signatures at training
locations in the offline phase. However, in severe hostile environments, such
as in ship cabins where severe shadowing, blocking and multi-path fading
effects are posed by ubiquitous metallic architecture, even radio-map cannot
capture the dynamics of RSS. In this paper, we introduced multiple feature
radio-map location method for severely noisy environments. We proposed to add
low variance signature into radio map. Since the low variance signatures are
generally expensive to obtain, we focus on the scenario when the low variance
signatures are sparse. We studied efficient construction of multi-feature
radio-map in offline phase, and proposed feasible region narrowing down and
particle based algorithm for online tracking. Simulation results show the
remarkably performance improvement in terms of positioning accuracy and
robustness against RSS noises than the traditional radio-map method.
