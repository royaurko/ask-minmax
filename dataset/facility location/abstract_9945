The superconducting transition in a single overdoped, detwinned YBa2Cu3Ox
(YBCO) crystal is studied using four different probes. Whereas the AC and DC
magnetic susceptibilities find a dominant transition at 88 K with a smaller
effect near 92 K, the specific heat and electrical resistivity reveal only a
single transition at 88 K and 92 K, respectively. Under hydrostatic pressures
to 0.60 GPa these two transitions shift in opposite directions, their
separation increasing. The present experiments clearly show that the bulk
transition lies at 88 K and originates from fully oxygenated YBCO; the 92 K
transition likely arises from filamentary superconductivity in a minority
optimally doped phase (< 1 %) of YBCO located at or near the crystal surface.
