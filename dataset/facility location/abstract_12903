The galactic center (GC) has long been a region of interest for high-energy
and very-high-energy observations. Many potential sources of GeV/TeV gamma-ray
emission are located in the GC region, e.g. the accretion of matter onto the
central black hole, cosmic rays from a nearby shell-type super nova remnant, or
the annihilation of dark matter. The GC has been detected at MeV/GeV energies
by EGRET and recently by Fermi/LAT. At TeV energies, the GC was detected at the
level of 4 standard deviations with the Whipple 10m telescope and with one
order of magnitude better sensitivity by H.E.S.S. and MAGIC. We present the
results from 3 years of VERITAS GC observations conducted at large zenith
angles. The results are compared to astrophysical models.
