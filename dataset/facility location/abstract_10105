When applied to a dipole source subjected to acceleration which is violent
and long lasting (``extreme acceleration''), Maxwell's equations predict
radiative power which augments Larmor's classical radiation formula by a
nontrivial amount. The physical assumptions behind this result are made
possible by the kinematics of a system of geometrical clocks whose tickings are
controlled by cavities which are expanding inertially. For the purpose of
measuring the radiation from such a source we take advantage of the physical
validity of a spacetime coordinate framework (``inertially expanding frame'')
based on such clocks. They are compatible and commensurable with the
accelerated clocks of the accelerated source. By contrast, a common Lorentz
frame with its mutually static clocks won't do: it lacks that commensurability.
Inertially expanding clocks give a physicist a window into the frame of a
source with extreme acceleration. He thus can locate that source and measure
radiation from it without being subjected to such acceleration himself. The
conclusion is that inertially expanding reference frames reveal qualitatively
distinct aspects of nature which would not be accessible if static inertial
frames were the only admissible frames.
