The uniformly accelerated reference frame described by Hamilton, Desloge and
Philpott involves the observers who perform the hyperbolic motion with constant
proper acceleration gi. They start to move from different distances measured
from the origin O of the inertial reference frame K(XOY), along its OX axis
with zero initial velocity. Equipped with clocks and light sources they are
engaged with each other in Radar echo, Doppler Effect and Radar detection
experiments. They are also engaged in the same experiments with an inertial
observer at rest in K(XOY) and located at its origin O. We derive formulas that
account for the experiments mentioned above. We study also the landing
conditions of the accelerating observers on a uniformly moving platform.
