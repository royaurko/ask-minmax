The odd-mass $^{117}$Sn nucleus was investigated in nuclear resonance
fluorescence experiments up to an endpoint energy of the incident photon
spectrum of 4.1 MeV at the bremsstrahlung facility of the Stuttgart University.
More than 50 mainly hitherto unknown levels were found. From the measurement of
the scattering cross sections model independent absolute electric dipole
excitation strengths were extracted. The measured angular distributions
suggested the spins of 11 excited levels. Quasi-particle phonon model
calculations including a complete configuration space were performed for the
first time for a heavy odd-mass spherical nucleus. These calculations give a
clear insight in the fragmentation and distribution of the $E1$, $M1$, and $E2$
excitation strength in the low energy region. It is proven that the $1^{-}$
component of the two-phonon $[2^{+}_{1} \otimes 3^{-}_{1}]$ quintuplet built on
top of the $1/2^{+}$ ground state is strongly fragmented. The theoretical
calculations are consistent with the experimental data.
