The supranova model for Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) is becoming increasingly more
popular. In this scenario the GRB occurs weeks to years after a supernova
explosion, and is located inside a pulsar wind bubble (PWB). Protons
accelerated in the internal shocks that emit the GRB may interact with the
external PWB photons producing pions which decay into \sim 10^{16} eV
neutrinos. A km^2 neutrino detector would observe several events per year
correlated with the GRBs.
