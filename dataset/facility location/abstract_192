We have been searching for surviving companions of progenitors of Galactic
Type-Ia supernovae, in particular SN 1572 and SN 1006. These companion stars
are expected to show peculiarities: (i) to be probably more luminous than the
Sun, (ii) to have high radial velocity and proper motion, (iii) to be possibly
enriched in metals from the SNIa ejecta, and (iv) to be located at the distance
of the SNIa remnant. We have been characterizing possible candidate stars using
high-resolution spectroscopic data taken at 10m-Keck and 8.2m-VLT facilities.
We have identified a very promising candidate companion (Tycho G) for SN 1572,
but we have not found any candidate companion for SN 1006, suggesting that SN
event occurred in 1006 could have been the result of the merging of two white
dwarfs. Adding these results to the evidence from the other direct searches,
the clear minority of cases (20\% or less) seem to disfavour the
single-degenerate channel or that preferentially the single-degenerate
escenario would involve main-sequence companions less massive than the Sun.
Therefore, it appears to be very important to continue investigating these and
other Galactic Type-Ia SNe such as the Johannes Kepler SN 1604.
