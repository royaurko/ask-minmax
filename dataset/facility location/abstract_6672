In this letter we show the presence of a spin-glass like phase in single
crystals of magnetoelectric gallium ferrite (GaFeO3) below ~210 K via
temperature dependent ac and dc magnetization studies. Analysis of frequency
dispersion of the susceptibility peak at ~210 K using the critical slowing down
model and Vogel-Fulcher law strongly suggests the existence of a classical
spin-glass like phase. This classical spin glass behavior of GaFeO3 is
understood in terms of an outcome of geometrical frustration arising from the
inherent site disorder among the antiferromagnetically coupled Fe ions located
at octahedral Ga and Fe sites.
