We conjecture the exact shock statistics in the inviscid decaying Burgers
equation in D>1 dimensions, with a special class of correlated initial
velocities, which reduce to Brownian for D=1. The prediction is based on a
field-theory argument, and receives support from our numerical calculations. We
find that, along any given direction, shocks sizes and locations are
uncorrelated.
