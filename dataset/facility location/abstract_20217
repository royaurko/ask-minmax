The symbiotic X-ray binary 4U 1954+319 is a rare system hosting a peculiar
neutron star (NS) and an M-type optical companion. Its ~5.4h NS spin period is
the longest among all known accretion-powered pulsars and exhibited large (~7%)
fluctuations over 8 years. A spin trend transition was detected with Swift/BAT
around an X-ray brightening in 2012. The source was in quiescent and bright
states before and after this outburst based on 60 ks Suzaku observations in
2011 and 2012. The observed continuum is well described by a Comptonized model
with the addition of a narrow 6.4 keV Fe Kalpha line during the outburst.
Spectral similarities to slowly rotating pulsars in high-mass X-ray binaries,
its high pulsed fraction (~60-80%), and the location in the Corbet diagram
favor high B-field (>~1e+12 G) over a weak field as in low-mass X-ray binaries.
The observed low X-ray luminosity (1e+33-1e+35 erg/s), probable wide orbit, and
a slow stellar wind of this SyXB make quasi-spherical accretion in the subsonic
settling regime a plausible model. Assuming a ~1e+13 G NS, this scheme can
explain the ~5.4 h equilibrium rotation without employing the magnetar-like
field (~1e+16 G) required in the disk accretion case. The time-scales of
multiple irregular flares (~50 s) can also be attributed to the free-fall time
from the Alfven shell for a ~1e+13 G field. A physical interpretation of SyXBs
beyond the canonical binary classifications is discussed.
