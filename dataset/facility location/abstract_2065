Within 5-10 years, very long baseline interferometry facilities will be able
to observe the "shadow" of super-massive black hole candidates. This will
allow, for the first time, to test gravity in the strong field regime. In this
paper, we study numerically the photon orbits in the $\delta = 2$
Tomimatsu-Sato space-time. The $\delta = 2$ Tomimatsu-Sato space-time is a
stationary, axisymmetric, and asymptotically flat exact solution of the vacuum
Einstein equations. We compare the associated shadow with the one of Kerr black
holes. The shape of the shadow in the $\delta = 2$ Tomimatsu-Sato space-time is
oblate and the difference between the two axes can be as high as 6% when viewed
on the equatorial plane. We argue that future space sub-mm interferometers
(e.g. VSOP-3) may distinguish the two cases, and thus are able to test the
Cosmic Censorship Conjecture.
