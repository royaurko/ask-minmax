We present a new algorithm, named Autonomous Gaussian Decomposition (AGD),
for automatically decomposing spectra into Gaussian components. AGD uses
derivative spectroscopy and machine learning to provide optimized guesses for
the number of Gaussian components in the data, and also their locations,
widths, and amplitudes. We test AGD and find that it produces results
comparable to human-derived solutions on 21cm absorption spectra from the 21cm
SPectral line Observations of Neutral Gas with the EVLA (21-SPONGE) survey. We
use AGD with Monte Carlo methods to derive the HI line completeness as a
function of peak optical depth and velocity width for the 21-SPONGE data, and
also show that the results of AGD are stable against varying observational
noise intensity. The autonomy and computational efficiency of the method over
traditional manual Gaussian fits allow for truly unbiased comparisons between
observations and simulations, and for the ability to scale up and interpret the
very large data volumes from the upcoming Square Kilometer Array and pathfinder
telescopes.
