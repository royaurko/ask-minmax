The largest underground neutrino observatory, Super-Kamiokande, located near
Kamioka, Japan has been collecting data since April 1996. It is located at a
depth of roughly 2.7 kmwe in a zinc mine under a mountain, and has an effective
area for detecting entering-stopping and through-going muons of about
$1238 m^2$ for muons of $>1.7 GeV$. These events are collected at a rate of 1.5
per day from the lower hemisphere of arrival directions, with 2.5 muons per
second in the downgoing direction.
  We report preliminary results from 229 live days analyzed so far with respect
to zenith angle variation of the upcoming muons. These results do not yet have
enough statistical weight to discriminate between the favored hypothesis for
muon neutrino oscillations and no-oscillations. We report on the search for
astrophysical sources of neutrinos and high energy neutrino fluxes from the sun
and earth center, as might arise from WIMP annihilations. None are found. We
also present a topographical map of the overburden made from the downgoing
muons. The detector is performing well, and with several years of data we
should be able to make significant progress in this area.
