We analyze the colour magnitude diagram of the field population in the
direction of the bulge cluster NGC 6553 to discuss the stellar field component
projected towards the cluster. In particular we investigate the nature of a
peculiar feature, called ``red flare'' which appears as a faint turnoff,
located 2 magnitudes about below the turnoff of the cluster, with a sparse
trace of a sub-giant branch just above. A detailed modeling shows that the red
flare is consistent with the expected location of the turnoff and sub-giant
branch of the bulge population, once that the appropriate metallicity range and
spatial distribution of the bulge stars are adopted. From the data, hints can
be derived about the spatial shape and the basic stellar parameters of the
bulge.
