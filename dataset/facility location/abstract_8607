The asymmetries of solar p-mode lines provide important diagnostic clues as
to the nature and location of the source of mode excitation. At the same time,
they can also be responsible for systematic errors in the determination of mode
frequencies.
  I present a matched wave asymptotic analysis which leads to an expression for
the spectrum valid for arbitrary stratifications and arbitrary source types.
  From this it is possible to deduce the correct asymmetric line profile to use
in fitting the spectra, along with the physical interpretation of the fitted
parameters.
  I apply this procedure to low-degree MDI doppler data from which I am able to
deduce corrections to the mode frequencies. A preliminary comparison of the
asymmetry parameter with numerical calculations yields an estimate of the
source depth.
