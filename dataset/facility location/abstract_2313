CIEMAT has been working on the RF power extractor so-called PETS (Power
Extraction and Transfer Structure) for the CLIC Test Facility 3 (CTF3) since
2007. The first contribution has been installed at the Test Beam Line (TBL).
Additionally, a new PETS configuration is presently under fabrication at CIEMAT
and will be installed in the Test Module at CTF3. This paper describes the PETS
prototypes design, fabrication and assembly techniques. The characterization of
the devices with low RF power is also described.
