We try to explain quasar-galaxy associations by gravitational lensing by
globular clusters, located in the halos of foreground galaxies. We propose
observational test for verification of this hypothesis. We processed
SUPERCOSMOS sky survey and found overdensities of star-like sources with zero
proper motions in the vicinities of foreground galaxies from CfA3 catalog. We
show mean effect for galaxies with different redshifts. Two effects can explain
observational data - these are lensing by globular clusters and lensing by
dwarf galaxies. We made CCD 3-color photometry with 2.0-1.2 meter telescopes to
select extremely lensed objects around several galaxies for spectroscopic
observations.
