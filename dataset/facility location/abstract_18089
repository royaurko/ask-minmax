The ongoing activity of neurons generates a spatially- and time-varying field
of extracellular voltage ($V_e$). This $V_e$ field reflects population-level
neural activity, but does it modulate neural dynamics and the function of
neural circuits? We provide a cable theory framework to study how a bundle of
model neurons generates $V_e$ and how this $V_e$ feeds back and influences
membrane potential ($V_m$). We find that these "ephaptic interactions" are
small but not negligible. The model neural population can generate $V_e$ with
millivolt-scale amplitude and this $V_e$ perturbs the $V_m$ of "nearby" cables
and effectively increases their electrotonic length. After using passive cable
theory to systematically study ephaptic coupling, we explore a test case: the
medial superior olive (MSO) in the auditory brainstem. The MSO is a possible
locus of ephaptic interactions: sounds evoke large $V_e$ in vivo in this
nucleus (millivolt-scale). The $V_e$ response is thought to be generated by MSO
neurons that perform a known neuronal computation with submillisecond temporal
precision (coincidence detection to encode sound source location). Using a
biophysically-based model of MSO neurons, we find millivolt-scale ephaptic
interactions consistent with the passive cable theory results. These subtle
membrane potential perturbations induce changes in spike initiation threshold,
spike time synchrony, and time difference sensitivity. These results suggest
that ephaptic coupling may influence MSO function.
