Within 5-10 years, very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) facilities will
be able to directly image the accretion flow around SgrA$^*$, the super-massive
black hole candidate at the center of the Galaxy, and observe the black hole
"shadow". In 4-dimensional general relativity, the no-hair theorem asserts that
uncharged black holes are described by the Kerr solution and are completely
specified by their mass $M$ and by their spin parameter $a$. In this paper, we
explore the possibility of distinguishing Kerr and Bardeen black holes from
their shadow. In Hioki & Maeda (2009), under the assumption that the background
geometry is described by the Kerr solution, the contributors proposed an algorithm
to estimate the value of $a/M$ by measuring the distortion parameter $\delta$,
an observable quantity that characterizes the shape of the shadow. Here, we try
to extend their approach. Since the Hioki-Maeda distortion parameter is
degenerate with respect to the spin and possible deviations from the Kerr
solution, one has to measure another quantity to test the Kerr black hole
hypothesis. We study a few possibilities. We find that it is extremely
difficult to distinguish Kerr and Bardeen black holes from the sole observation
of the shadow, and out of reach for the near future. The combination of the
measurement of the shadow with possible accurate radio observations of a pulsar
in a compact orbit around SgrA$^*$ could be a more promising strategy to verify
the Kerr black hole paradigm.
