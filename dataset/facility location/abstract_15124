We present a high quality CMD for a 36'x 36' field located 8 degrees (7 kpc)
from the LMC center, as well as a precise determination of the LMC surface
brightness derived from the resolved stellar population out to this large
galactocentric radius. This deep CMD shows for the first time the detailed age
distribution at this position, where the surface brightness is V=26.5 mag/sq".
At a radius R=474' the main sequence is well populated from the oldest turnoff
at I=21.5 to the 2.5 Gyr turnoff at I=19.5. Beyond this radius, a relatively
strong gradient in the density of stars with ages in the 2.5-4 Gyr range is
apparent. There are some stars brighter and bluer than the main population,
quite uniformly distributed over the whole area surveyed, which are well
matched by a 1.5 Gyr isochrone and may be indicative of a relatively recent
star formation, or merger, event. The surface brightness profile of the LMC
remains exponential to this large galactocentric radius and shows no evidence
of disk truncation. Combining the information on surface brightness and stellar
population we conclude that the LMC disk extends (and dominates over a possible
stellar halo) out to a distance of at least 7 kpc. These results confirm that
the absence of blue stars in the relatively shallow off-center CMDs of dIrr
galaxies is not necessarily evidence for an exclusively old stellar population
resembling the halo of the Milky Way.
