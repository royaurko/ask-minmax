Astrophysical observations and cosmological data have led to the conclusion
that nearly one quarter of the Universe consists of dark matter. Under certain
assumptions, an observable signature of dark matter is the annual modulation of
the rate of dark matter-nucleon interactions taking place in an Earth-bound
experiment. To search for this effect, we introduce the concept for a new dark
matter experiment using NaI scintillation detectors deployed deep in the South
Pole ice. This experiment complements dark matter search efforts in the
Northern Hemisphere and will investigate the observed annual modulation in the
DAMA/LIBRA and DAMA/NaI experiments. The unique location will permit the study
of background effects correlated with seasonal variations and the surrounding
environment. This paper describes the experimental concept and explores the
sensitivity of a 250 kg NaI experiment at the South Pole.
