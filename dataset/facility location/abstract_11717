We study the Zee model in the framework of the split fermion model in
$M_4\times S_1/Z_2$ spacetime. Neutrino masses are generated through 1-loop
diagrams without the right-handed neutrinos introduced. By assuming an order
one anarchical complex 5D Yukawa couplings, all the effective 4D Yukawa
couplings are determined by the wave function overlap between the split
fermions and the bulk scalars in the fifth dimension. The predictability of the
Yukawa couplings is in sharp contrast to the original Zee model in 4D where the
Yukawa couplings are unknown free parameters. This setup exhibits a geometrical
alternative to the lepton flavor symmetry. By giving four explicit sets of the
split fermion locations, we demonstrate that it is possible to simultaneously
fit the lepton masses and neutrino oscillation data by just a handful free
parameters without much fine tuning. Moreover, we are able to make definite
predictions for the mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, the absolute neutrino masses,
and the lepton flavor violation processes for each configuration.
