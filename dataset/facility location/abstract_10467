We analyze the problem of evolution in a system with stochastic perturbation
and point out that analytic properties of the noise present in the system might
determine spectral properties of the evolution operator (Frobenius-Perron
operator). We also propose a method for approximation of the spectrum and
eigenvectors of the FP-operator by applying a suitable noise. Moreover we
demonstrate that the eigenvalues of the FP-operator located outside the
essential spectrum are robust not only against local perturbation but also
against the non local perturbation and that these stable eigenvalues have a
direct physical meaning: they determine the rate of the exponential decay of
correlation in the system.
