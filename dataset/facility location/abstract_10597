The various human brain tasks are performed at different locations and time
scales. Yet, we discovered the existence of time-invariant (above an essential
time scale) partitioning of the brain activity into personal state-specific
frequency bands. For that, we perform temporal and ensemble averaging of best
wavelet packet bases from multi-electrode EEG recordings. These personal
frequency-bands provide new templates for quantitative analyses of brain
function, e.g., normal vs. epileptic activity.
