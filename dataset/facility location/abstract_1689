We show that the transverse momentum dependent transversity function is
proportional to the longitudinal polarization of a quark in a transversely
polarized proton. This result suggests an alternative, convenient method for
determining transversity, without knowing unusual fragmentation functions. The
method consists of measuring the double spin azimuthal asymmetry in
semi-inclusive pion leptoproduction by a transversely polarized proton target.
The asymmetry, which is twist 3, is estimated to be more than 10% under the
most favorable conditions. The experiment we suggest is feasible at facilities
like DESY and CERN.
