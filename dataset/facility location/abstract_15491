We present the results of a study of the photospheric abundances of the HgMn
star HD 175640, conducted using archival ESO-UVES spectra. A large number of
unblended (titanium, chromium, manganese and iron) lines were studied to search
for the presence of chemical stratification in the atmosphere of this star. The
selected lines are located in the visible region of the spectrum, longward of
the Balmer jump, in orders with S/N $\geq$ 300. We derived the abundance of
each element by calculating independently the abundance associated each line.
We then characterized the depth of formation of each line, and examined the
dependence of abundance on optical depth. Titanium, chromium, manganese and
iron show no variation of their abundance with optical depth. These four
elements do not appear to be strongly stratified in the atmosphere of HD
175640. This indicates that if stratification occurs, it must be in atmospheric
layers which are not diagnosed by the spectral lines studied, or that it is too
weak to detect using these data. We also report evidence that HD 175640 is an
SB1, and furthermore report anomalous shifts of some strong Fe {\sc II} lines,
the origin of which is unclear.
