Mankind has not yet explained dark matter, the accelerating expansion of the
Universe, the 'knee' and 'ankle' of the cosmic ray energy spectrum graph, the
low star formation rates of low surface brightness (LSB) dwarf galaxies, the
ignition of hydrogen fusion reactions in the first generation stars or the
departing locations of earthbound high-energy cosmic ray protons. A new
research hypothesis has been developed by the contributor based upon finding
astronomically based 'cosmic constituents' of the Universe that may be created
or influenced by or have a special relationship with possible dark matter
candidates. A list of 14 relevant and plausible 'cosmic constituents' of the
Universe was developed by the contributor, which was then used to establish a list
of constraints regarding the nature and characteristics of the long-sought dark
matter particles. A dark matter candidate was then found that best conformed to
the 14 constraints established by the 'cosmic constituents.'
