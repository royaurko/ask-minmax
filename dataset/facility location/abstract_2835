This volume contains the papers presented at the sixth workshop on Answer Set
Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2013) held on August 25th,
2013 in Istanbul, co-located with the 29th International Conference on Logic
Programming (ICLP 2013). It thus continues a series of previous events
co-located with ICLP, aiming at facilitating the discussion about crossing the
boundaries of current ASP techniques in theory, solving, and applications, in
combination with or inspired by other computing paradigms.
