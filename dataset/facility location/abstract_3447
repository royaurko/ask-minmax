The proposed high-luminosity B/Flavor factories offer new opportunities for
the improved determination of the fundamental physical parameters of standard
heavy leptons. Compared to the electron or the muon case, the magnetic
properties of the $\tau$ lepton are largely unexplored. We show that the
electromagnetic properties of the $\tau$, and in particular its magnetic form
factor, may be measured competitively in these facilities, using unpolarized or
polarized electron beams. Various observables of the $\tau$'s produced on top
of the $\Upsilon$ resonances, such as cross-section and normal polarization for
unpolarized electrons or longitudinal and transverse asymmetries for polarized
beams, can be combined in order to increase the sensitivity on the magnetic
moment form factor. In the case of polarized electrons, we identify a special
combination of transverse and longitudinal $\tau$ polarizations able to
disentangle this anomalous magnetic form factor from both the charge form
factor and the interference with the Z-mediating amplitude. For an integrated
luminosity of $15 \times 10^{18} b^{-1}$ one could achieve a sensitivity of
about $10^{-6}$, which is several orders of magnitude below any other existing
high- or low-energy bound on the magnetic moment. Thus one may obtain a QED
test of this fundamental quantity to a few % precision.
