A novel, low-budget, open-air, slant-geometry antenna test range for UHF
radiation is presented. It was designed primarily to facilitate variation of
the distance between emitter and receiver antennas, but has also the potential
for adaptation to simultaneous variation of distance and receiver antenna
orientation. In support of the validity of the range the inverse square law for
433.5 MHz radiation between two naked half-wave dipole antennas was tested with
high spatial resolution from close to the far field limit outward to 46
wavelengths. Sine amplitude input voltage at the receiver antenna varied with
the distance to the power -0.9970 +/- 0.0051 (R^2 = 0.992), thus corroborating
the inverse square law for transmission power at the lowest frequency for which
thus far data have been published. Keywords: inverse square law; dipole
antenna; test facility; electromagnetic propagation; UHF measurements; distance
dependence.
