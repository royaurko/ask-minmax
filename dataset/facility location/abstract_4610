Assumptions on a likelihood function, including a local Glivenko-Cantelli
condition, imply the existence of M-estimators converging to an M-functional.
Scatter matrix-valued estimators, defined on all empirical measures on
${\Bbb{R}}^d$ for $d\geq 2$, and equivariant under all, including singular,
affine transformations, are shown to be constants times the sample covariance
matrix. So, if weakly continuous, they must be identically 0. Results are
stated on existence and differentiability of location and scatter functionals,
defined on a weakly dense, weakly open set of laws, via elliptically symmetric
t distributions on ${\Bbb{R}}^d$, following up on work of Kent, Tyler, and
D\"{u}mbgen.
