Researchers are often on the move, say at conferences or projects meetings,
and as workflows are becoming ubiquitous in the scientific process, having
access to scientific workflows from a mobile device would be a significant
advantage. We therefore have developed Taverna Mobile, an application for
Android phones which allows browsing of existing workflows, executing them, and
reviewing the results.
  Taverna Mobile does not aim to reproduce the full experience of building
workflows in the Taverna Workbench, rather it focuses on tasks we have deemed
relevant to a scientist that is not at her desk. For instance, when visiting a
conference she might hear about someone's workflow, which she can quickly
locate and mark for later exploration. When in the biology lab, faced with
updated scientific data, the scientist can rerun her own workflow with new
inputs. While commuting, she can monitor the status of a long-running job.
