Aims: Following the study already presented in our previous paper, based on
the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) sample, which consists of five clusters of
galaxies within the redshift range 0.18 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 0.25, imaged in the
central 0.5-2 Mpc in very good seeing conditions, we have studied the
quantitative morphology of their bright galaxy population
  Methods: We have analyzed the surface brightness profiles of the galaxy
population in those clusters. Previously, we have performed simulations in
order to check the reliability of the fits. We have also derived a quantitative
morphological classification.
  Results: The structural parameters derived from these analysis have been
analyzed. We have obtained that the structural parameters of E/S0 galaxies are
similar to those showed by galaxies in low redshift clusters. However, the disc
scales are different. In particular, the scales of the discs of galaxies at
medium redshift clusters are statistically different than those located in
similar galaxies in the Coma cluster. But, the scales of the discs of galaxies
in medium redshift clusters are similar to nearby field galaxies.
  Conclusions: The results suggest that the evolution of the disc component of
galaxies in clusters is faster than in field ones. Mechanisms like galaxy
harassment showing timescales of $\sim 1$Gyr could be the responsible of this
disc scale evolution. This indicates that spiral galaxies in clusters have
suffered a strong evolution in the last 2.5 Gyr or that Coma is in some way
anomalous.
