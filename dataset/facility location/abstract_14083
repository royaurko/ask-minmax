This work develops frequency-domain decoding algorithms for $(n=2^m,k)$
systematic Reed-Solomon (RS) codes over fields $\mathbb{F}_{2^m},m\in
\mathbb{Z}^+$, where $n-k$ is a power of two. The proposed algorithms are based
on a new polynomial basis with a fast Fourier transform with computational
complexity of order $\mathcal{O}(n\lg(n))$. First, the basis of syndrome
polynomials is reformulated in the decoding procedure so that the new
transforms can be applied to the decoding procedure. A fast extended Euclidean
algorithm is developed to determine the error locator polynomial. The
computational complexity of the proposed decoding algorithm is
$\mathcal{O}(n\lg(n-k)+(n-k)\lg^2(n-k))$, improving upon the best currently
available decoding complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\lg^2(n)\lg\lg(n))$ and reaching
the best known complexity bound that was established by Justesen in 1976, whose
approach is for RS codes that operate only on some specified finite fields. As
revealed by the computer simulations, the proposed decoding algorithm is $50$
times faster than the conventional one for the $(2^{16},2^{15})$ RS code.
