The mean square polarizability radii of the proton have been measured for the
first time in a virtual Compton scattering experiment performed at the
MIT-Bates out-of-plane scattering facility. Response functions and
polarizabilities obtained from a dispersion analysis of the data at Q2=0.06
GeV2/c2 are in agreement with O(p3) heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory.
The data support the dominance of mesonic effects in the polarizabilities, and
the increase of beta with increasing Q2 is evidence for the cancellation of
long-range diamagnetism by short-range paramagnetism from the pion cloud.
