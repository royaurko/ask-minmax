The HEGRA CT-System was used to search for TeV gamma-rays from the
microquasar and supernova remnant combination SS-433/W50 over the 1998 and 1999
observing seasons, resulting in about 20 hours of useful data. An analysis of
various extended sources of location guided by X-Ray observations reveals no
evidence for TeV emission at photon energies above 1 TeV, with resulting 99%
upper limits in the range 8 to 10 of the Crab flux. For one of these locations,
the eastern jet termination, a model predicting a presently detectable TeV
gamma-ray flux via the inverse Compton upscattering of microwave background
photons is now somewhat constrained. The results and model contraints are
briefly discussed.
