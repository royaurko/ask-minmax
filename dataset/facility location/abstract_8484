There are now a half dozen young pulsars detected in high energy photons by
the Compton GRO, showing a variety of emission efficiencies and pulse profiles.
We present here a calculation of the pattern of high energy emission on the sky
in a model which posits $\gamma$-ray production by charge depleted gaps in the
outer magnetosphere. This model accounts for the radio to $\gamma$-ray pulse
offsets of the known pulsars, as well as the shape of the high energy pulse
profiles. We also show that $\sim 1/3$ of emitting young radio pulsars will not
be detected due to beaming effects, while $\sim 2.5 \times$ the number of
radio-selected $\gamma$-ray pulsars will be viewed only high energies. Finally
we compute the polarization angle variation and find that the previously
misunderstood optical polarization sweep of the Crab pulsar arises naturally in
this picture. These results strongly support an outer-magnetosphere location
for the $\gamma-$ray emission.
