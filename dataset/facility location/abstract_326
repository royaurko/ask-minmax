A semi-empirical method that allows us to predict intensity of generated
field emission in superconducting RF cavities is described. Spatial, angular
and energy distributions of the generated radiation are calculated with the
FISHPACT code. The Monte Carlo code MARS15 is used for modeling the radiation
transport in matter. A comparison with dose rate measurements performed in the
Fermilab Vertical Test Facility for ILC-type cavities with accelerating
gradients up to 35 MV/m is presented as well.
