In this letter we report observation of room temperature ferromagnetism in
bulk Ga$_2$O$_3$ . We also observe large (10-60%) increase/decrease in
photoluminescence. In the red(700 nm wavelength)/blue(500 nm), with the
application of small magnetic field(0.4 Tesla). We argue, that ferromagnetism
occurs entirely due to chains of oxygen(O(3) sites, Fig. 5) vacancies. We
propose a simple model to explain, origin and location of moment, formation of
ferromagnetic dislocation needles, and strong increase/decrease ofred/blue
photoluminescence intensity with magnetic field.
