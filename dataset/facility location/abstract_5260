Coulomb excitation of the exotic neutron-rich nucleus $^{26}$Ne on a
$^{nat}$Pb target was measured at 58 A.MeV in order to search for low-lying E1
strength above the neutron emission threshold. Data were also taken on an
$^{nat}$Al target to estimate the nuclear contribution. The radioactive beam
was produced by fragmentation of a 95 A.MeV $^{40}$Ar beam delivered by the
RIKEN Research Facility. The set-up included a NaI gamma-ray array, a charged
fragment hodoscope and a neutron wall. Using the invariant mass method in the
$^{25}$Ne+n channel, we observe a sizable amount of E1 strength between 6 and
10 MeV. The reconstructed $^{26}$Ne angular distribution confirms its E1
nature. A reduced dipole transition probability of B(E1)=0.49$\pm$0.16
$e^2fm^2$ is deduced. For the first time, the decay pattern of low-lying
strength in a neutron-rich nucleus is obtained. The results are discussed in
terms of a pygmy resonance centered around 9 MeV.
