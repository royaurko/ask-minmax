We report the results of Raman scattering experiments on single crystals of
La(2-x)Sr(x)CuO(4) [La214] as a function of temperature and doping. In
underdoped compounds low-energy B1g spectral weight is depleted in association
with the opening of a pseudogap on regions of the Fermi surface located near
(pi, 0) and (0, pi). The magnitude of the depletion increases with decreasing
doping, and in the most underdoped samples, with decreasing temperature. The
spectral weight that is lost at low-energies (omega < 800 cm-1) is transferred
to the higher energy region normally occupied by multi-magnon scattering. From
the normal state B2g spectra we have determined the scattering rate
Gamma(omega, T) of qausiparticles located near the diagonal directions in
k-space, (pi/2, pi/2) regions. In underdoped compounds, Gamma(omega, T) is
suppressed at low temperatures for energies less than Eg(x) ~ 800 cm-1. The
observed doping dependence of the two-magnon scattering and the scattering rate
suppression thus suggest that the pseudogap is characterized by an energy scale
Eg ~ J, where J is the antiferromagnetic super-exchange energy. Comparison with
the results from other techniques provides a consistent picture of the
pseudogap in La214.
