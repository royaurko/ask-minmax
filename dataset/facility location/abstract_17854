In this position paper, we present our approach of utilizing mobile devices
(i.e., mobile phones and tablets) for assisting engineers and experts in
understanding and maintaining the factory pipelines. For this, we present a
platform, called assistME, that is composed of three main components: the
assistME Server, the assistME mobile infrastructure, and the co-assistME
collaborative environment. In order to get full utilization of the assistME
platform, we assume that an initial setup is made in the factory in such a way
that it is equipped with different sensors to collect data about specific
events in the factory pipeline together with the corresponding locations of
these events. The assistME Server works as a central control unit in the
platform and collects data from the installed sensors in the factory pipeline.
In the case of any unexpected behavior or any critical situation in the factory
pipeline, notification and other details are sent to the related group of
engineers and experts through the assistME mobile app. Further, the co-assistME
collaborative environment, equipped with a large shared screen and multiple
mobile devices, helps the engineers and experts to collaborate with to
understand and analyze the current situation in the factory pipeline in order
to maintain it accurately.
