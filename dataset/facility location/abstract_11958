Cosmic rays are a known problem in astronomy, causing both loss of data and
data inaccuracy. The problem becomes even more extreme when considering data
from a high-radiation environment, such as in orbit around Earth or outside the
Earth's magnetic field altogether, unprotected, as will be the case for the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). For JWST, all the instruments employ
nondestructive readout schemes. The most common of these will be "up the ramp"
sampling, where the detector is read out regularly during the ramp. We study
three methods to correct for cosmic rays in these ramps: a two-point difference
method, a deviation from the fit method, and a y-intercept method. We apply
these methods to simulated nondestructive read ramps with single-sample groups
and varying combinations of flux, number of samples, number of cosmic rays,
cosmic-ray location in the exposure, and cosmic-ray strength. We show that the
y-intercept method is the optimal detection method in the read-noise-dominated
regime, while both the y-intercept method and the two-point difference method
are best in the photon-noise-dominated regime, with the latter requiring fewer
computations.
