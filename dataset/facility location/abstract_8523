Observational signatures of helical jets can be found in some X-ray binaries
(XRB), planetary nebulae, Herbig-Haro objects and in jets of active galactic
nuclei (AGN). For the prototypical XRB SS433 a kinematic model of precessing
jets has been applied very successfully and yielded a determination of its
distance which is independent of conventional methods. In galactic jets
precession appears to be the predominant mechanism for the production of
observed helical signatures. In extragalactic jets other mechanisms seem to be
similarly frequent. As a result of their strong dependence on the direction of
motion with respect to the observer, special relativistic effects can be
pronounced in helical jets. These have to be taken into account in AGN-jets and
the newly discovered galactic sources which show apparent superluminal motion.
Since the galactic superluminal jets are located in a binary system, jet
precession is very likely in these sources. In this paper I review the main
structural and kinematic signatures of helical jets and briefly mention the
physical mechanisms behind them. I will present kinematic simulations of
relativistic jets which are helically bent or have an internal helical flow
field.
