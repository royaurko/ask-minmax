In this paper the problem of the theory of a quasicrystal structures - the
determination of coordinates of each atom of quasicrystal in analytical form -
is solved. Within the framework of the proposed model a periodic crystal can be
presented as a particular case of a quasicrystal. The simple and explicit
analytical formulas which describe the location of each atom in a quasicrystal
are given. The exact solutions for Penrose and Ammann-Beenker quasicrystal
structures are given. On the basis of the analytical formulas the routines are
created. The routines are inserted directly into graphical files generating the
quasiperiodic structures.
