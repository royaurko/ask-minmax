The need to populate the fusion materials engineering data base has long been
recognized, the IFMIF facility being the present proposed neutron source for
this purpose. Re-evaluation of the regulatory approach for the EU proposed DEMO
device shows that the specification of the neutron source can be reduced with
respect to IFMIF, allowing lower risk technology solutions to be considered.
The justification for this approach is presented and a description of a
proposed facility, FAFNIR, is presented with more detailed discussion of the
accelerator and target designs.
