A future $ep$ facility, THERA, where electrons of 250 GeV and protons of 920
GeV are collided could provide valuable information on the structure of the
photon. With an increase in the centre-of-mass energy of a factor of 3 and an
extension of the minimum photon energy fraction carried by the interacting
parton of a factor of 10 compared to HERA, a new kinematic regime in the study
of the photon will be opened. Inclusive dijet production has been studied and
the potential gains the new collider would bring are discussed. The differences
between current parametrisations of the photon structure in this new kinematic
region are shown to be up to 50%. Comparisons of THERA's capabilities are made
with what HERA can currently produce and how it complements $e^+e^-$ colliders
addressed.
