In competition experiments between two RNA viruses of equal or almost equal
fitness, often both strains gain in fitness before one eventually excludes the
other. This observation has been linked to the Red Queen effect, which
describes a situation in which organisms have to constantly adapt just to keep
their status quo. I carried out experiments with digital organisms
(self-replicating computer programs) in order to clarify how the competing
strains' location in fitness space influences the Red-Queen effect. I found
that gains in fitness during competition were prevalent for organisms that were
taken from the base of a fitness peak, but absent or rare for organisms that
were taken from the top of a peak or from a considerable distance away from the
nearest peak. In the latter two cases, either neutral drift and loss of the
fittest mutants or the waiting time to the first beneficial mutation were more
important factors. Moreover, I found that the Red-Queen dynamic in general led
to faster exclusion than the other two mechanisms.
