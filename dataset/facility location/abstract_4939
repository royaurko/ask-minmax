The paper focuses on the accuracy improvement of geometric and elasto-static
calibration of industrial robots. It proposes industry-oriented performance
measures for the calibration experiment design. They are based on the concept
of manipulator test-pose and referred to the end-effector location accuracy
after application of the error compensation algorithm, which implements the
identified parameters. This approach allows the users to define optimal
measurement configurations for robot calibration for given work piece location
and machining forces/torques. These performance measures are suitable for
comparing the calibration plans for both simple and complex trajectories to be
performed. The advantages of the developed techniques are illustrated by an
example that deals with machining using robotic manipulator.
