In this paper, we propose a Bayesian method to segment one-dimensional
piecewise constant signals corrupted by a functional part. In our model, the
piecewise constant part is expressed as a product of a lower triangular matrix
by a sparse vector and the functional bias is represented as a sparse lineal
combination of functions from a dictionary. A Stochastic Search Variable
Selection approach is used to estimate the sparse vectors, which allows us to
obtain estimators for the breakpoints location, the means over each segment and
the functional bias. The performance of our method is assessed using simulated
data and real geodetic data where GPS coordinate series are affected by
undocumented artificial abrupt changes and additionally show prominent periodic
variations.
