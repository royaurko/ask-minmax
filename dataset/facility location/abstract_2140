The CBM experiment will investigate heavy-ion collisions at beam energies
from 8 to 45 AGeV at the future accelerator facility FAIR. The goal of the
experiment is to study the QCD phase diagram in the region of moderate
temperatures and highest net-baryon densities in search of the first-order
phase transition from confined to deconfined matter at the QCD critical point.
To do so, CBM aims to measure rare hadronic, leptonic and photonic probes among
them open charm. In order to reject the rich background generated by the heavy
ion collisions, a micro vertex detector (MVD) providing an unprecedented
combination of high rate capability and radiation hardness, very light material
budget and excellent granularity is required. In this work, we will present and
discuss the concept of this detector.
