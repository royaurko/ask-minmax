The X-ray and near-IR emission from Sgr A* is dominated by flaring, while a
quiescent component dominates the emission at radio and sub-mm wavelengths. The
spectral energy distribution of the quiescent emission from Sgr A* peaks at
sub-mm wavelengths and is modeled as synchrotron radiation from a thermal
population of electrons in the accretion flow, with electron temperatures
ranging up to $\sim 5-20$\,MeV. Here we investigate the mechanism by which
X-ray flare emission is produced through the interaction of the quiescent and
flaring components of Sgr A*. The X-ray flare emission has been interpreted as
inverse Compton, self-synchrotron-Compton, or synchrotron emission. We present
results of simultaneous X-ray and near-IR observations and show evidence that
X-ray peak flare emission lags behind near-IR flare emission with a time delay
ranging from a few to tens of minutes. Our Inverse Compton scattering modeling
places constraints on the electron density and temperature distributions of the
accretion flow and on the locations where flares are produced. In the context
of this model, the strong X-ray counterparts to near-IR flares arising from the
inner disk should show no significant time delay, whereas near-IR flares in the
outer disk should show a broadened and delayed X-ray flare.
