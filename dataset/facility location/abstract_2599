Measuring the time structure of the storage ring on the sample spot inside
the experimental hutch is a foundational step during the time-resolved
experiments using the pulsed synchrotron X-rays with the time structure defined
by the storage ring. In this work, the method of time-resolved X-ray excited
optical luminescence was designed and implemented to do the measurement. This
method is based on the principle of time-correlated single photon counting
techniques. The measurement system consists of a spectrometer with a detector
of photomultiplier tube, a timing system, a set of Nuclear Instrument Modules
and a luminescent material of Zinc Oxide. The measurement was performed on the
X-ray absorbed fine structure spectrum beamline at Shanghai Synchrotron
Radiation Facility. The results show that this system can be used to measure
the time structure of the storage ring with a precision of less than 1 ns.
