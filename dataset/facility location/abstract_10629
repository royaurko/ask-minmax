New families of three-dimensional nonlinear travelling waves are discovered
in pipe flow. In contrast to known waves (Faisst & Eckhardt Phys. Rev. Lett.
91, 224502 (2003), Wedin & Kerswell, J. Fluid Mech. 508, 333 (2004)), they
possess no rotational symmetry and exist at much lower Reynolds numbers.
Particularly striking is an `asymmetric mode' which has one slow streak
sandwiched between two fast streaks located preferentially to one side of the
pipe. This family originates in a pitchfork bifurcation from a mirror-symmetric
travelling wave which can be traced down to a Reynolds number of 773. Helical
and non-helical rotating waves are also found emphasizing the richness of phase
space even at these very low Reynolds numbers. The delay in Reynolds number
from when the laminar state ceases to be a global attractor to turbulent
transition is then even larger than previously thought.
