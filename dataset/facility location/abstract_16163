We have developed a new simulation method to estimate the distance between
the native state and the first transition state, and the distance between the
intermediate state and the second transition state of a protein which
mechanically unfolds via intermediates. Assuming that the end-to-end extension
$\Delta R$ is a good reaction coordinate to describe the free energy landscape
of proteins subjected to an external force, we define the midpoint extension
$\Delta R^*$ between two transition states from either constant-force or
constant loading rate pulling simulations. In the former case, $\Delta R^*$ is
defined as a middle point between two plateaus in the time-dependent curve of
$\Delta R$, while, in the latter one, it is a middle point between two peaks in
the force-extension curve. Having determined $\Delta R^*$, one can compute
times needed to cross two transition state barriers starting from the native
state. With the help of the Bell and microscopic kinetic theory, force
dependencies of these unfolding times can be used to locate the intermediate
state and to extract unfolding barriers. We have applied our method to the
titin domain I27 and the fourth domain of {\em Dictyostelium discoideum}
filamin (DDFLN4), and obtained reasonable agreement with experiments, using the
C$_{\alpha}$-Go model.
