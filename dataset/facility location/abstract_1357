Region-of-Interest (ROI) location information in videos has many practical
usages in video coding field, such as video content analysis and user
experience improvement. Although ROI-based coding has been studied widely by
many researchers to improve coding efficiency for video contents, the ROI
location information itself is seldom coded in video bitstream. In this paper,
we will introduce our proposed ROI location coding tool which has been adopted
in surveillance profile of AVS2 video coding standard (surveillance profile).
Our tool includes three schemes: direct-coding scheme, differential- coding
scheme, and reconstructed-coding scheme. We will illustrate the details of
these schemes, and perform analysis of their advantages and disadvantages,
respectively.
