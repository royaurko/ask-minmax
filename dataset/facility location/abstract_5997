We present a pair of coupled partial differential equations to describe the
evolution of the average total intensity and intensity flux of a wavefield
inside a randomly layered medium. These equations represent a modification of
the Kubelka-Munk equations, or radiative transfer. Our modification accounts
for wave interference (e.g., localization), which is neglected in radiative
transfer. We numerically solve the modified Kubelka-Munk equations and compare
the results to radiative transfer as well as to simulations of the wave
equation with randomly located thin layers.
