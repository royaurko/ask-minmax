AIMS: To determine the Point Source Location Accuracy (PSLA) for the
INTEGRAL/IBIS telescope based on analysis of archival in-flight data. METHODS:
Over 40000 individual pointings (science windows) of INTEGRAL/IBIS data were
analysed using the latest Off-line Science Analysis software, version 7.0.
Reconstructed source positions were then compared against the most accurate
positions available, determined from focusing X-ray telescopes. Since the PSLA
is a strong function of source detection significance, the offsets from true
position were histogrammed against significance, so that the 90% confidence
limits could be determined. This has been done for both sources in the fully
coded field of view (FCFOV) and partially coded field of view (PCFOV). RESULTS:
The PSLA is found to have improved significantly since values derived from
early mission data and software for both FCFOV and PCFOV. CONCLUSIONS: This
result has implications for observers executing follow-up programs on IBIS
sources since the sky area to be searched is reduced by >50% in some cases.
