The influences of blood vessels and focused location on temperature
distribution during high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation of liver
tumors is studied. A three-dimensional acoustics-thermal-fluid coupling model
is employed to compute the temperature field in the hepatic cancerous region.
The model is based on the linear Westervelt and bioheat equations as well as
the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations for the liver parenchyma and blood
vessels. The effect of acoustic streaming is also taken into account in the
present HIFU simulation study. Different blood vessel diameters and focal point
locations were investigated. We found from this three-dimensional numerical
study that in large blood vessels both the convective cooling and acoustic
streaming can change considerably the temperature field and the thermal lesion
near blood vessels. If the blood vessel is located within the beam width, both
acoustic streaming and blood flow cooling effects should be taken into account.
The predicted temperature difference for the cases considered with and without
acoustic streaming effect is 54 % in regions close to the vessel wall. The
necrosed volume can be reduced about 30 %, when taking into account acoustic
streaming effect.
