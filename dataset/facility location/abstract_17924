We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to extract the band
dispersion and the Fermi surface of BaCu$_2$As$_2$ and $\alpha$-BaCu$_2$Sb$_2$.
While the Cu $3d$ bands in both materials are located around 3.5 eV below the
Fermi level, the low-energy photoemission intensity mainly comes from As $4p$
states, suggesting a completely filled Cu $3d$ shell. The splitting of the As
$3d$ core levels and the lack of pronounced three-dimensionality in the
measured band structure of BaCu$_2$As$_2$ indicate a surface state likely
induced by the cleavage of this material in the collapsed tetragonal phase,
which is consistent with our observation of a Cu$^{+1}$ oxydation state.
However, the observation of Cu states at similar energy in
$\alpha$-BaCu$_2$Sb$_2$ without the pnictide-pnictide interlayer bonding
characteristic of the collapsed tetragonal phase suggests that the short
interlayer distance in BaCu$_2$As$_2$ follows from the stability of the
Cu$^{+1}$ rather than the other way around. Our results confirm the prediction
that BaCu$_2$As$_2$ is an $sp$ metal with weak electronic correlations.
