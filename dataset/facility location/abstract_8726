We discuss the first results obtained on the study of a sample of high-z
galaxies (2 < z < 7), using the gravitational amplification effect in the core
of lensing clusters. Sources are located close to the critical lines in
clusters with well constrained mass distributions, and selected through
photometric redshifts, computed on a large wavelength domain, and lens
inversion techniques.
