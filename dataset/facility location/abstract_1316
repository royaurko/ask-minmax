We investigate the fluctuation of the top location of a sandpile numerically
using the two-dimensional discrete elements method. We feed particles to a
sandpile at a fixed time interval and calculate power spectra from the time
series of the top location. We find that the power spectra are approximated as
power functions, and their exponents increase to -1 through a plateau as the
time interval decreases. For small time interval, avalanches occur continuously
either on the left or right side slope of a sandpile, and the slope on which
avalanches take place switches intermittently. The long time fluctuation of the
top location corresponds to the switchings. For the time series of the
switchings, we discuss the relation between the power spectrum and the
distribution of waiting times based on analytic theories.
