OPERA (Oscillation Project with Emulsion tRacking Apparatus)is an
international collaboration between Europe and Asia, aiming to give the first
direct proof of tau neutrino appearance in a pure muon neutrino beam, in order
to validate the hypothesis for atmospheric neutrino oscillations. The first
european long baseline neutrino beam called CNGS is produced at CERN and sent
in the direction of the Gran Sasso underground laboratory 730 km away, where
the OPERA detector is located. Since 2006 the electronic detector part is fully
commissioned and running. Cosmic ray events have been recorded on a regular
basis and the first neutrino beam events have been observed in the target
elements made of very precise emulsion films and lead sheets during the last
run in autumn 2007. This paper reviews the status of the detector, the beam
performances, the first results from the neutrino event analysis and the
prospects.
