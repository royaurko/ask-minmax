The Supernova Remnant MSH 15-52 has been observed in very high energy (VHE)
gamma-rays using the H.E.S.S. 4-telescope array located in Namibia. A gamma-ray
signal is detected at the 25 sigma level during an exposure of 22.1 hours live
time. The image reveals an elliptically shaped emission region around the
pulsar PSR B1509-58, with semi-major axis 6' in the NW-SE direction and
semi-minor axis 2' approximately. This morphology coincides with the diffuse
pulsar wind nebula as observed at X-ray energies by ROSAT. The overall energy
spectrum from 280 GeV up to 40 TeV can be fitted by a power law with photon
index Gamma = 2.27 +/- 0.03(stat.) +/- 0.20(syst.). The detected emission can
be plausibly explained by inverse Compton scattering of accelerated
relativistic electrons with soft photons.
