In this paper we present some new, practical, geometric optimization
techniques for computing polygon partitions, 1D and 2D point, interval, square
and rectangle covers, as well as 1D and 2D interval and rectangle K-centers.
All the techniques we present have immediate applications to several cost
optimization and facility location problems which are quite common in practice.
The main technique employed is dynamic programming, but we also make use of
efficient data structures and fast greedy algorithms.
