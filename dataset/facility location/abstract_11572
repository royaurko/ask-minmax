Understanding superfluidity with higher order partial waves is crucial for
the understanding of high-$T_c$ superconductivity. For the realization of a
superfluid with anisotropic order parameter, spin-polarized fermionic lithium
atoms with strong p-wave interaction are the most promising candidates to date.
We apply rf-spectroscopy techniques that do not suffer from severe final-state
effects \cite{Perali08} with the goal to perform photoemission spectroscopy on
a strongly interacting p-wave Fermi gas similar to that recently applied for
s-wave interactions \cite{Stewart08}. Radiofrequency spectra of both quasibound
p-wave molecules and free atoms in the vicinity of the p-wave Feshbach
resonance located at 159.15\,G \cite{Schunck05} are presented. The observed
relative tunings of the molecular and atomic signals in the spectra with
magnetic field confirm earlier measurements realized with direct rf-association
\cite{Fuchs08}. Furthermore, evidence of bound molecule production using
adiabatic ramps is shown. A scheme to observe anisotropic superfluid gaps, the
most direct proof of p-wave superfluidity, with 1d-optical lattices is
proposed.
