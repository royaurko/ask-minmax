We have obtained deep, multi-band imaging observations around three of the
most distant known quasars at redshifts z>6. Standard accretion theory predicts
that the supermassive black holes present in these quasars were formed at a
very early epoch. If a correlation between black hole mass and dark matter halo
mass is present at these early times, then these rare supermassive black holes
will be located inside the most massive dark matter halos. These are therefore
ideal locations to search for the first clusters of galaxies. We use the
Lyman-break technique to identify star-forming galaxies at high redshifts. Our
observations show no overdensity of star-forming galaxies in the fields of
these quasars. The lack of (dust-free) luminous starburst companions indicates
that the quasars may be the only massive galaxies in their vicinity undergoing
a period of intense activity.
