The results of a numerical study of the growth of solid particles, ranging
from 1 micron to 1 millimeter in size, in the vicinity of an azimuthally
symmetric density enhancement of a protostellar disk are presented. It is shown
that the combined effect of gas drag and pressure gradients, which causes solid
objects to rapidly migrate toward the location of the local maximum density,
can also enhance the rate of growth of dust particles to larger objects. The
results of numerical simulations of such growth processes are presented and the
effects of the changes of the physical properties of particles on the rates of
their growth are also discussed.
