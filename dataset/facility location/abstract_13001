We characterize the frequency-sensitivity of a cavity-stabilized laser to
inertial forces and temperature fluctuations, and perform real-time
feed-forward to correct for these sources of noise. We measure the sensitivity
of the cavity to linear accelerations, rotational accelerations, and rotational
velocities by rotating it about three axes with accelerometers and gyroscopes
positioned around the cavity. The worst-direction linear acceleration
sensitivity of the cavity is $2(1) \times 10^{-11}$/g measured over 0-50 Hz,
which is reduced by a factor of 50 to below $10^{-12}$/g for low-frequency
accelerations by real-time feed-forward corrections of all of the
aforementioned inertial forces. A similar idea is demonstrated in which laser
frequency drift due to temperature fluctuations is reduced by a factor of 70
via real-time feed-forward from a temperature sensor located on the outer wall
of the cavity vacuum chamber.
