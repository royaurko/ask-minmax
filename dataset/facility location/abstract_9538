We report the discovery of a new detached eclipsing binary known as
NSVS01031772 with component masses M_1= 0.5428 +/- 0.0027Msun, M_2= 0.4982 +/-
0.0025Msun, and radii R_1= 0.5260 +/- 0.0028Rsun, R_2= 0.5088 +/- 0.0030Rsun.
The system has an orbital period of 0.3681414(3) days and an apparent magnitude
V ~ 12.6. The estimated effective temperatures of the stars are T_eff1 = 3615
+/- 72K and T_eff2 = 3513 +/- 31K. The space velocities of the system suggest
that it is a main sequence binary and with a metallicity that is approximately
solar. The two stars in this binary are located in a region of the Mass-Radius
relation where no accurate observational data were previously available.
Similarly to other low-mass binaries recently studied, the radius of each star
in NSVS01031772 exceeds the best evolutionary model predictions by about 8.5%
on average.
