In a recent paper, Clusel and Fortin [J. Phys. A.: Math. Gen. 39 (2006) 995]
presented an analytical study of a first-order transition induced by an
inhomogeneous boundary magnetic field in the two-dimensional Ising model. They
identified the transition that separates the regime where the interface is
localized near the boundary from the one where it is propagating inside the
bulk. Inspired by these results, we measured the interface tension by using
multimagnetic simulations combined with parallel tempering to determine the
phase transition and the location of the interface. Our results are in very
good agreement with the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we studied the
spin-spin correlation function for which no analytical results are available.
