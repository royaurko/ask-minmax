The Relativistic Electron Facility for Education and Research (REFER) at
Hiroshima University accepts a 150 MeV electron beam from a microtron, the
injector to the 700 MeV storage ring of the Hiroshima Synchrotron Research
Center, and keep it circulating for 2.5ms without a RF acceleration. It acts as
a beam stretcher and has been used for the following researches: 1) X-ray
generation from an internal multiple foil crystalline target due to the
parametric X-radiation (PXR) and the resonant transition radiation (RTR). 2)
Laser backward Compton scattering. 3) Coherent pair creation from Si crystal by
150 MeV bremsstrahlung. 4) Study of the Ter-Mikaelian effect in the low energy
part of the bremsstrahlung in an extracted electron line. 5) A novel scheme of
beam stabilization by the induction coil. This paper reports the experimental
results and the current status of the REFER electron ring.
