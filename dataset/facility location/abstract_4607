In a finite mixture of location-scale distributions maximum likelihood
estimator does not exist because of the unboundedness of the likelihood
function when the scale parameter of some mixture component approaches zero. In
order to study the strong consistency of maximum likelihood estimator, we
consider the case that the scale parameters of the component distributions are
restricted from below by $c_n$, where $c_n$ is a sequence of positive real
numbers which tend to zero as the sample size $n$ increases. We prove that
under mild regularity conditions maximum likelihood estimator is strongly
consistent if the scale parameters are restricted from below by $c_{n} =
\exp(-n^d)$, $0 < d < 1$.
