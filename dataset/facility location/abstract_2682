A new type of the Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC), sensitive to Vacuum
Ultra-Violet (VUV) light (wavelength {\lambda} < 150 nm), is recently developed
and produced by Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. The basic properties of the new MPPC
are measured at cryogenic facility of Waseda university using liquid nitrogen.
Temperature dependence of breakdown voltage, capacitance, and dark count rate
of the MPPC are also evaluated. In addition, the absolute photon detection
efficiency (PDE) for liquid argon (LAr) scintillation light ({\lambda} = 128
nm) is estimated to be about 7% with uncertainty of 2% by using 241 Am
{\alpha}-ray source. Based on these basic measurements a possible application
of the new MPPC to LAr detector for dark matter search is discussed.
