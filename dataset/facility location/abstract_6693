The crystal structure of SmFeAsO has been investigated by means of Rietveld
refinement of high resolution synchrotron powder diffraction data collected at
300 K and 100 K. The compound crystallizes in the tetragonal P4/nmm space group
at 300 K and in the orthorhombic Cmma space group at 100 K; attempts to refine
the low temperature data in the monoclinic P112/n space group diverged. On the
basis of both resistive and magnetic analyses the tetragonal to orthorhombic
phase transition can be located at T about 140 K.
