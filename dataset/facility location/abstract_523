We present a method for correcting near-infrared medium-resolution spectra
for telluric absorption. The method makes use of a spectrum of an A0V star,
observed near in time and close in airmass to the target object, and a
high-resolution model of Vega, to construct a telluric correction spectrum that
is free of stellar absorption features. The technique was designed specifically
to perform telluric corrections on spectra obtained with SpeX, a 0.8-5.5
micron, medium-resolution cross-dispersed spectrograph at the NASA Infrared
Telescope Facility, and uses the fact that for medium resolutions there exist
spectral regions uncontaminated by atmospheric absorption lines. However, it is
also applicable (in a somewhat modified form) to spectra obtained with other
near-infrared spectrographs. An IDL-based code that carries out the procedures
is available for downloading via the World Wide Web from the IRTF website.
