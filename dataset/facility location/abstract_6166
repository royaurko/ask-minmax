We study D-branes in the background of a gravitational shock wave. We
consider the case of parallel D-branes located on opposite sides with respect
to the shock wave. Their interaction is studied by evaluating the cylinder
diagram using the boundary states technique. Boundary states are defined at
each D-brane and their scalar product is evaluated after propagation through
the shock wave. Taking the limit where the gravitational shock wave vanishes we
show that the amplitude evaluated is consistent with the flat space-time
result.
