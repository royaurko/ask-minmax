For the proposed Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), a post-calibration
point-source location accuracy of 3 seconds of arc is aimed for under favorable
observing conditions and for gamma-ray energies exceeding 100 GeV. In this
contribution, results of first studies on the location accuracy are presented.
These studies are based on a toy Monte Carlo simulation of a typical CTA-South
array layout, taking into account the expected trigger rates of the different
CTA telescope types and the gamma-ray spectrum of the simulated source. With
this simulation code it is possible to study the location accuracy as a
function of arbitrary telescope mis-orientations and for typical observing
patterns on the sky. Results are presented for various scenarios, including one
for which all individual telescopes are randomly mis-oriented within their
specified limits. The study provides solid lower limits for the expected source
location accuracy of CTA, and can be easily extended to include various other
important effects like atmospheric refraction or partial cloud coverage.
