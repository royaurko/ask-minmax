We study the role of strong electron confinement in surface-enhanced Raman
scattering from molecules adsorbed on small noble-metal particles. We describe
a new source of Raman signal enhancement which originates from different
behavior of sp-band and d-band electron densities near the particle boundary.
In small particles, a spillover of sp-electron wave-functions beyond the
classical radius gives rise to a thin layer with diminished population of
d-electrons. In this surface layer, the screening of sp-electrons by d-band
electron background is reduced. We demonstrate that the interplay between
finite-size and underscreening effects results in an increase of the surface
plasmon local field acting on a molecule located in a close proximity to the
particle boundary. Our calculations, based on two-region model, show that the
additional enhancement of Raman signal gets stronger for smaller nanoparticles
due to a larger volume fraction of underscreened region.
