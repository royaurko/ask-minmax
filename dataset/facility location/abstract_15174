We consider a cosmology in which a spherically symmetric large scale
inhomogeneous enhancement or a void are described by an inhomogeneous metric
and Einstein's gravitational equations. For a flat matter dominated universe
the inhomogeneous equations lead to luminosity distance and Hubble constant
formulas that depend on the location of the observer. For a general
inhomogeneous solution, it is possible for the deceleration parameter to differ
significantly from the FLRW result. The deceleration parameter $q_0$ can be
interpreted as $q_0 > 0$ ($q_0=1/2$ for a flat matter dominated universe) in a
FLRW universe and be $q_0 < 0$ as inferred from the inhomogeneous enhancement
that is embedded in a FLRW universe. A spatial volume averaging of local
regions in the backward light cone has to be performed for the inhomogeneous
solution at late times to decide whether the decelerating parameter $q$ can be
negative for a positive energy condition. The CMB temperature fluctuations
across the sky can be unevenly distributed in the northern and southern
hemispheres in the inhomogeneous matter dominated solution, in agreement with
the analysis of the WMAP power spectrum data by several contributors. The model can
possibly explain the anomalous alignment of the quadrupole and octopole moments
observed in the WMAP data.
