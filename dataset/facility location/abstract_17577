The tenuous supersonic solar wind that streams from the top of the corona
passes through a natural boundary -- the Alfv\'en surface -- that marks the
causal disconnection of individual packets of plasma and magnetic flux from the
Sun itself. The Alfv\'en surface is the locus where the radial motion of the
accelerating solar wind passes the radial Alfv\'en speed, and therefore any
displacement of material cannot carry information back down into the corona. It
is thus the natural outer boundary of the solar corona, and the inner boundary
of interplanetary space. Using a new and unique motion analysis to separate
inbound and outbound motions in synoptic visible-light image sequences from the
COR2 coronagraph on board the STEREO-A spacecraft, we have identified inbound
wave motion in the outer corona beyond 6 solar radii for the first time, and
used it to determine that the Alfv\'en surface is at least 12.5 solar radii
from the Sun over the polar coronal holes and 17 solar radii in the streamer
belt, well beyond the distance planned for NASA's upcoming Solar Probe Plus
mission. To our knowledge this is the first measurement of inbound waves in the
outer solar corona, and the first direct measurement of lower bounds for the
Alfv\'en surface.
