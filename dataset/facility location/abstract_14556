We study the evolution of dense neutral clumps located in the outer parts of
planetary nebulae. These clumps will be photo-ionized by the ionizing radiation
from the central star and change their structure in the process. The main
effect of the ionization process is the setting up of a photo-evaporation flow
and a shock running through the clump. Once this shock has moved through the
entire clump it starts to accelerate because of the `rocket effect'. This
continues until the entire clump has been photo-ionized. We present an analytic
model for the shock and accelerating phases and also the results of numerical
simulations which include detailed microphysics. We find a good match between
the analytic description and the numerical results and use the numerical
results to produce some of the clump's observational characteristics at
different phases of its evolution. We compare the results with the properties
of the fast moving low ionization knots (ansae or FLIERs) seen in a number of
planetary nebulae. We find that the models match many of the kinematic and
emission properties of FLIERs.
