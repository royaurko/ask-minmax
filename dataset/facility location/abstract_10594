We are reporting about a scintillating fibre tracker which is proposed for
the precise determination of the absolute luminosity of the CERN LHC at
interaction point 1 where the ATLAS experiment is located. The detector needs
to track protons elastically scattered under micro-rad angles in direct
vicinity to the LHC beam. It is based on square shaped scintillating plastic
fibres read out by multi-anode photomultiplier tubes and is housed in Roman
Pots. We describe the design and construction of prototype detectors and the
results of a beam test experiment at DESY. The excellent detector performance
established in this test validates the detector design and supports the
feasibility of the proposed challenging method of luminosity measurement.
