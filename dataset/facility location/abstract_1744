Studies of muonic hydrogen atoms and molecules have been performed
traditionally in bulk targets of gas, liquid or solid. At TRIUMF, Canada's
meson facility, we have developed a new type of target system using multilayer
thin films of solid hydrogen, which provides a beam of muonic hydrogen atoms in
vacuum. Using the time-of-flight of the muonic atoms, the energy-dependent
information of muonic reactions are obtained in direct manner. We discuss some
unique measurements enabled by the new technique, with emphasis on processes
relevant to muon catalyzed fusion.
