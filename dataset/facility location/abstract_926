Observables in proton-deuteron scattering are sensitive probes of the
nucleon-nucleon interaction and three-nucleon force effects. Several
facilities, including the KVI, allow a detailed study of few-nucleon
interactions below the pion-production threshold exploiting polarized proton
and deuteron beams. In this contribution, some recent results are discussed and
interpreted exploiting rigorous Faddeev calculations. Furthermore, an
experimental inconsistencies between two measurements of the cross section in
elastic proton-deuteron scattering at 135 MeV/nucleon is reviewed.
