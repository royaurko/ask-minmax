In this paper we continued our efforts to understand the star formation
scenario in and around the young cluster NGC 1893. We used a sample of the
young stellar sources (YSOs) identified on the basis of multiwavelength data
(optical, near-infrared (NIR), mid-infrared (MIR) and X-ray) to study the
nature of YSOs associated with the region. The identified YSOs show an age
spread of ~ 5 Myr. The YSOs located near the nebulae at the periphery of the
cluster are relatively younger in comparison to those located within the
cluster region. The present results are in accordance with those obtained by us
in previous studies. Other main results from the present study are: 1) the
fraction of disk bearing stars increases towards the periphery of the cluster;
2) there is an evidence supporting the notion that the mechanisms for disk
dispersal operate less efficiently for low-mass stars; 3) the sample of Class
II sources is found to be relatively older in comparison to that of Class III
sources. A comparison of various properties of YSOs in the NGC 1893 region with
those in the Tr 37/ IC 1396 region is also discussed.
