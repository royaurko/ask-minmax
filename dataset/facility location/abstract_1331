Location information is the major component in location based applications.
This information is used in different safety and service oriented applications
to provide users with services according to their Geolocation. There are many
approaches to locate mobile nodes in indoor and outdoor environments. In this
paper, we are interested in outdoor localization particularly in cellular
networks of mobile nodes and presented a localization method based on cell and
user location information. Our localization method is based on hello message
delay (sending and receiving time) and coordinate information of Base
Transceiver Station (BTSs). To validate our method across cellular network, we
implemented and simulated our method in two scenarios i.e. maintaining database
of base stations in centralize and distributed system. Simulation results show
the effectiveness of our approach and its implementation applicability in
telecommunication systems.
