We present [Ffe/H] abundance results that involve a sample of stars with a
wide range in luminosity from luminous giants to stars near the turnoff in a
globular cluster. Our sample of 25 stars in M71 includes 10 giant stars more
luminous than the RHB, 3 horizontal branch stars, 9 giant stars less luminous
than the RHB, and 3 stars near the turnoff. We analyzed both Fe I and Fe II
lines in high dispersion spectra observed with HIRES at the W. M. Keck
Observatory. We find that the [Fe/H] abundances from both Fe I and Fe II lines
agree with each other and with earlier determinations. Also the [Fe/H] obtained
from Fe I and Fe II lines is constant within the rather small uncertainties for
this group of stars over the full range in Teff and luminosity, suggesting that
NLTE effects are negligible in our iron abundance determination. In this
globular cluster, there is no difference among the mean [Fe/H] of giant stars
located at or above the RHB, RHB stars, giant stars located below the RHB and
stars near the turnoff.
