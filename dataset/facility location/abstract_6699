Lattice QCD calculations locate the QCD critical point at energies accessible
at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). We present average transverse
momentum and multiplicity fluctuations, as well as baryon and anti-baryon
transverse mass spectra which are expected to be sensitive to effects of the
critical point. The future CP search strategy of the NA61/SHINE experiment at
the SPS is also discussed.
