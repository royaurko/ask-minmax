The control system (TICS) for the test interferometer being built to support
the development of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA)will itself be a
prototype for the final ALMA array, providing a test for the distributed
control system under development. TICS will be based on the ALMA Common
Software (ACS) (developed at the European Southern Observatory), which provides
CORBA-based services and a device management framework for the control
software.
  Simple device controllers will run on single board computers, one of which
(known as an LCU) is located at each antenna; whereas complex, compound device
controllers may run on centrally located computers. In either circumstance,
client programs may obtain direct CORBA references to the devices and their
properties. Monitor and control requests are sent to devices or properties,
which then process and forward the commands to the appropriate hardware devices
as required. Timing requirements are met by tagging commands with (future)
timestamps synchronized to a timing pulse, which is regulated by a central
reference generator, and is distributed to all hardware devices in the array.
Monitoring is provided through a publish/subscribe CORBA-based service.
