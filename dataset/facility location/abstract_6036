An electron beam polarization of 80% or greater will be a key feature of a 1
TeV Linear Collider. Accurate measurements of the beam polarization will
therefore be needed. We discuss design considerations and capabilities for a
Compton-scattering polarimeter located in the extraction line from the
Interaction Point. Polarization measurements with 1% accuracy taken parasitic
to collision data look feasible, but detailed simulations are needed.
Polarimeter design issues are similar for both electron-positron and
electron-electron collider modes, though beam disruption creates more
difficulties for the electron-electron mode.
