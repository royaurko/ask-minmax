We present a novel approach that protects trajectory privacy of users who
access location-based services through a moving k nearest neighbor (MkNN)
query. An MkNN query continuously returns the k nearest data objects for a
moving user (query point). Simply updating a user's imprecise location such as
a region instead of the exact position to a location-based service provider
(LSP) cannot ensure privacy of the user for an MkNN query: continuous
disclosure of regions enables the LSP to follow a user's trajectory. We
identify the problem of trajectory privacy that arises from the overlap of
consecutive regions while requesting an MkNN query and provide the first
solution to this problem. Our approach allows a user to specify the confidence
level that represents a bound of how much more the user may need to travel than
the actual kth nearest data object. By hiding a user's required confidence
level and the required number of nearest data objects from an LSP, we develop a
technique to prevent the LSP from tracking the user's trajectory for MkNN
queries. We propose an efficient algorithm for the LSP to find k nearest data
objects for a region with a user's specified confidence level, which is an
essential component to evaluate an MkNN query in a privacy preserving manner;
this algorithm is at least two times faster than the state-of-the-art
algorithm. Extensive experimental studies validate the effectiveness of our
trajectory privacy protection technique and the efficiency of our algorithm.
