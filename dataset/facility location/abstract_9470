Recent radio observations by the VLBA at 7 and 3.5 mm produced the
high-resolution images of the compact radio source located at the center of our
Galaxy--Sgr A*, and detected its wavelength-dependent intrinsic sizes at the
two wavelengths. This provides us with a good chance of testing
previously-proposed theoretical models for Sgr A*. In this {\em Letter}, we
calculate the size based on the radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF)
model proposed by Yuan, Quataert & Narayan (2003). We find that the predicted
sizes after taking into account the scattering of the interstellar electrons
are consistent with the observations. We further predict an image of Sgr A* at
1.3 mm which can be tested by future observations.
