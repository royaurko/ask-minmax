This paper proposes an explanation of the cognitive change that occurs as the
creative process proceeds. During the initial, intuitive phase, each thought
activates, and potentially retrieves information from, a large region
containing many memory locations. Because of the distributed,
content-addressable structure of memory, the diverse contents of these many
locations merge to generate the next thought. Novel associations often result.
As one focuses on an idea, the region searched and retrieved from narrows, such
that the next thought is the product of fewer memory locations. This enables a
shift from association-based to causation-based thinking, which facilitates the
fine-tuning and manifestation of the creative work.
