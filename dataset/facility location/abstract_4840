We define an opinion formation model of agents in a 1d ring, where the
opinion of an agent evolves due to its interactions with close neighbors and
due to its either positive or negative attitude toward the overall mood of all
the other agents. While the dynamics of the agent's opinion is described with
an appropriate differential equation, from time to time pairs of agents are
allowed to change their locations to improve the homogeneity of opinion (or
comfort feeling) with respect to their short range environment. In this way the
time scale of transaction dynamics and that of environment update are well
separated and controlled by a single parameter. By varying this parameter we
discovered a phase change in the number of undecided individuals. This
phenomenon arises from the fact that too frequent location exchanges among
agents result in frustration in their opinion formation. Our mean field
analysis supports this picture.
