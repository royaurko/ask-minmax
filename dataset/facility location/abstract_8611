We analyze the structure of the X-ray emission of a sample of 22 Abell
clusters of galaxies with a cD in their centre, observed with the ROSAT PSPC.
Utilizing the multi-scale power of the Wavelet Transform we detect significant
(~ 50 h^{-1} kpc) offsets between the large scale centroid and the peak of
X-ray emission. Despite the uncertainties on the satellite pointing, the X-ray
to optical correlation indicates a likely association between the X-ray peak
and the dominant galaxy. We develop a model in which the offset is produced by
small amplitude oscillations of the cD galaxy around the bottom of the cluster
potential well and successfully compare it to the observed distribution of
offsets. Within this scenario the offsets are not due to dynamic instabilities
and the number of structured clusters is greatly reduced.
