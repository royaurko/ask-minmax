The IceCube detector, located at the South Pole, is discussed as a detector
for core collapse supernovae. The large flux of $\bar{\nu}_{e}$ from a Galactic
supernova gives rise to Cherenkov light from positrons and electrons created in
neutrino interactions which increase the overall count rate of the
photomultipliers significantly. We will give an overview of the standard, count
rate based, method for supernova detection and present the development of a
novel technique. This technique uses coincident hits to extract additional
information such as the average energy and spectral features. The potential of
this technique increases with a higher sensor density, such as foreseen in
projected extensions of IceCube/DeepCore.
