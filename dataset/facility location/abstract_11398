MnSi is a cubic compound with small magnetic anisotropy, which stabilizes a
helimagnetic spin spiral that reduces to a ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
state in the long- and short-wavelength limit, respectively. We report a
comprehensive inelastic neutron scattering study of the collective magnetic
excitations in the helimagnetic state of MnSi. In our study we observe a rich
variety of seemingly anomalous excitation spectra, as measured in well over
twenty different locations in reciprocal space. Using a model based on only
three parameters, namely the measured pitch of the helix, the measured
ferromagnetic spin wave stiffness and the amplitude of the signal, as the only
free variable, we can simultaneously account for \textit{all} of the measured
spectra in excellent quantitative agreement with experiment. Our study
identifies the formation of intense, strongly coupled bands of helimagnons as a
universal characteristic of systems with weak chiral interactions.
