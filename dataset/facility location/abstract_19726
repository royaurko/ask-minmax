Context. The interpretation of stellar pulsations in terms of internal
structure depends on the knowledge of the fundamental stellar parameters.
Long-base interferometers permit us to determine very accurate stellar radii,
which are independent constraints for stellar models that help us to locate the
star in the HR diagram. Aims: Using a direct interferometric determination of
the angular diameter and advanced three-dimensional (3D) modeling, we derive
the radius of the CoRoT target HD 49933 and reduce the global stellar parameter
space compatible with seismic data. Methods: The VEGA/CHARA
spectro-interferometer is used to measure the angular diameter of the star. A
3D radiative hydrodynamical simulation of the surface is performed to compute
the limb darkening and derive a reliable diameter from visibility curves. The
other fundamental stellar parameters (mass, age, and Teff) are found by fitting
the large and small p-mode frequency separations using a stellar evolution
model that includes microscopic diffusion. Results: We obtain a limb-darkened
angular diameter of {\theta}LD = 0.445 \pm 0.012 mas. With the Hipparcos
parallax, we obtain a radius of R = 1.42 \pm 0.04 Rsun. The corresponding
stellar evolution model that fits both large and small frequency separations
has a mass of 1.20 \pm 0.08 Msun and an age of 2.7 Gy. The atmospheric
parameters are Teff = 6640 \pm 100 K, log g = 4.21 \pm 0.14, and [Fe/H] =
-0.38.
