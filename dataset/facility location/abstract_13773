We compute exact asymptotic of the statistical density of random matrices
belonging to the Generalized Gaussian orthogonal, unitary and symplectic
ensembles such that there no eigenvalues in the interval $[\sigma, +\infty[$.
In particular, we show that the probability that all the eigenvalues of an
$(n\times n)$ random matrix are positive (negative) decreases for large $n$ as
$\sim exp[-\beta\theta(\alpha)n^2]$ where the Dyson index $\beta$ characterizes
the ensemble, $\alpha$ is some extra parameter and the exponent
$\theta(\alpha)$ is a function of $\alpha$ which will be given explicitly. For
$\alpha=0$, $\theta(0)= (\log 3)/4 = 0.274653...$ is universal. We compute the
probability that the eigenvalues lie in the interval $[\sigma,+\infty[$ with
$(\sigma>0,\; {\rm if}\;\alpha>0)$ and $(\sigma\in\mathbb R,\; {\rm if
}\;\alpha=0)$. This generalizing the celebrated Wigner semicircle law to these
restricted ensembles. It is found that the density of eigenvalues generically
exhibits an inverse square-root singularity at the location of the barriers.
These results generalized the case of Gaussian random matrices ensemble studied
in \cite{D}, \cite{S}.
