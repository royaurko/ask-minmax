Nowadays digital image compression and decompression techniques are very much
important. So our aim is to calculate the quality of face and other regions of
the compressed image with respect to the original image. Image segmentation is
typically used to locate objects and boundaries (lines, curves etc.)in images.
After segmentation the image is changed into something which is more meaningful
to analyze. Using Universal Image Quality Index(Q),Structural Similarity
Index(SSIM) and Gradient-based Structural Similarity Index(G-SSIM) it can be
shown that face region is less compressed than any other region of the image.
