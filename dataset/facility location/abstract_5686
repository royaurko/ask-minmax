We present a method of determining the likely triggering mechanisms for
luminous, nearby starbursts based on their optical asymmetry and (B-V) color --
what we term as indices of `physical morphology.' By comparing the starbursts'
locations in a color-asymmetry diagram to an independent, nearby galaxy sample,
we identify which starbursts are likely triggered by an interaction/merger. We
confirm our morphological interpretation based on a comparison to 20% and 50%
HI velocity-width ratios. We further explain how this use of physical
morphology can put constraints on the dynamical history of other galaxies,
including star-forming galaxies at high redshifts.
