We summarize a new analysis of the distribution $\phi_{\eta}^{*}$ of charged
leptons produced in decays of $Z$ and $\gamma^{*}$ bosons in the
Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) formalism for transverse momentum resummation. By
comparing the $\phi_{\eta}^{*}$ distribution measured at the Tevatron with the
resummed CSS cross section with approximate ${\cal O}(\alpha_{s}^{2})$ Wilson
coefficients, we constrain the magnitude of the nonperturbative Gaussian
smearing factor and analyze its uncertainty caused by variations in scale
parameters. We find excellent agreement between the $\phi_{\eta}^{*}$ data and
our theoretical prediction, provided by the \textsc{ResBos} resummation
program. The nonperturbative factor that we obtained can be used to update
resummed QCD predictions for precision measurements in inclusive $W$ and $Z$
production and for comparisons to various models of nonperturbative dynamics.
