An ab initio based theoretical approach to describe nonequilibrium many-body
effects in molecular transport is developed. We introduce a basis of localized
molecular orbitals and formulate the many-body model in this basis. In
particular, the Hubbard-Anderson Hamiltonian is derived for single-molecule
junctions with intermediate coupling to the leads. As an example we consider a
benzenedithiol junction with gold electrodes. An effective few-level model is
obtained, from which spectral and transport properties are computed and
analyzed. Electron-electron interaction crucially affects transport and induces
multiscale Coulomb blockade at low biases. At large bias, transport through
asymmetrically coupled molecular edge states results in the occurrence of
"anomalous" conductance features, i.e., of peaks with unexpectedly large/small
height or even not located at the expected resonance energies.
