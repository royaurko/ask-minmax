The Photo-Neutron Source(PNS,phase 1), is an electron linear accelerator
(linac) based pulsed neutron facility, combined with TOF technique, was
constructed for nuclear data measurement of Thorium Molten Salt Reactor(TMSR)
in Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics(SINAP) at JiaDing campus. The TOF
detector signal, with the arrive time, pulse shape and pulse hight information,
was recorded by a waveform digitizer. Through the pulse-shape
discrimination(PSD) between neutrons and gamma-rays and time of Gamma Flash and
Neutron signal analyse, the neutron TOF spectrum was deduced with this simple
electronics design, and a new DAQ system based on waveform digitizer was used
in this test experiment.
