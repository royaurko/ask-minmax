We study dynamical symmetry breaking in the Standard Model including the
next-to-leading order terms. We introduce at a high, but finite, energy scale
Lambda a top quark condensate H={t {bar t}} and derive, using path integral
methods, the effective potential including quadratic fluctuations in the scalar
field H. We neglect the contributions of all components of the massive
electroweak gauge bosons. The existence of a non-trivial minimum in the
effective potential leads to the condition that the cut-off Lambda is limited
from above: Lambda < Lambda_{crit} approx 4.7 m_t^{phys.} (for N_c = 3), and to
a new lower bound for the 4-fermion coupling a = (G N_c Lambda^2)/(8 pi^2) >
1.60. Similar results are obtained if we demand, instead, that the
next-to-leading order contributions not shift the location
z=(m_t^{bare}/Lambda)^2 of the minimum drastically, e.g.~by not more than a
factor of 2. The results are reproduced diagrammatically, where the leading
plus all the next-to-leading order diagrams in the (1/N_c)-expansion are
included. Dominant QCD effects are also included, but their impact on the
numerical results is shown to be small.
