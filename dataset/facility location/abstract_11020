We study the scaling laws for the throughputs and delays of two coexisting
wireless networks that operate in the same geographic region. The primary
network consists of Poisson distributed legacy users of density n, and the
secondary network consists of Poisson distributed cognitive users of density m,
with m>n. The primary users have a higher priority to access the spectrum
without particular considerations for the secondary users, while the secondary
users have to act conservatively in order to limit the interference to the
primary users. With a practical assumption that the secondary users only know
the locations of the primary transmitters (not the primary receivers), we first
show that both networks can achieve the same throughput scaling law as what
Gupta and Kumar [1] established for a stand-alone wireless network if proper
transmission schemes are deployed, where a certain throughput is achievable for
each individual secondary user (i.e., zero outage) with high probability. By
using a fluid model, we also show that both networks can achieve the same
delay-throughput tradeoff as the optimal one established by El Gamal et al. [2]
for a stand-alone wireless network.
