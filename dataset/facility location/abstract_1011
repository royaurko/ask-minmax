Message Passing Interface (MPI) is widely used to implement parallel
programs. Although Windowsbased architectures provide the facilities of
parallel execution and multi-threading, little attention has been focused on
using MPI on these platforms. In this paper we use the dual core Window-based
platform to study the effect of parallel processes number and also the number
of cores on the performance of three MPI parallel implementations for some
sorting algorithms.
