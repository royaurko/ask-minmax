Offered is a new type of low-cost aerial pipeline for delivery of natural
gas, an important industrial and residential fuel, and freshwater as well as
other payloads over long distances. The offered pipeline dramatically decreases
the construction and operation costs and the time necessary for pipeline
construction. A dual-use type of freight pipeline can improve an arid rural
environment landscape and provide a reliable energy supply for cities. Our
aerial pipeline is a large, self-lofting flexible tube disposed at high
altitude. Presently, the term "natural gas" lacks a precise technical
definition, but the main components of natural gas are methane, which has a
specific weight less than air. A lift force of one cubic meter of methane
equals approximately 0.5 kg. The lightweight film flexible pipeline can be
located in the Earth-atmosphere at high altitude and poses no threat to
airplanes or the local environment. The contributors also suggest using lift force
of this pipeline in tandem with wing devices for cheap shipment of a various
payloads (oil, coal and water) over long distances. The article contains a
computed macroproject in northwest China for delivery of 24 billion cubic meter
of gas and 23 millions tonnes of water annually.
