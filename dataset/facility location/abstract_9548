The X-ray burster 4U1850-087, located in the globular cluster NGC6712, is an
ultracompact binary likely harbouring a degenerate companion.The source has
been observed with INTEGRAL several times, during the monitoring of the
Galactic plane, with an unprecedented exposure time. The broad-band spectrum
(2-100 keV; INTEGRAL together with a quasi-simultaneous XMM-Newton observation)
is well described with a disk-blackbody emission (kTin=0.8keV) together with a
power-law (photon index of 2). We report here the first detection of hard X-ray
emission from this source above 50 keV. A lower limit on the presence of a high
energy cut-off can be placed at Ec>100keV.
