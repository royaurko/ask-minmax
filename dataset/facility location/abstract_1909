Unique spectroscopic possibilities open up if a laser beam interacts with
relativistic lithium-like ions stored in the heavy ion ring accelerator SIS300
at the future Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research FAIR in Darmstadt,
Germany. At a relativistic factor gamma = 36 the 2P 1/2 level can be excited
from the 2S 1/2 ground state for any element with frequency doubled dye-lasers
in collinear geometry. Precise transition energy measurements can be performed
if the fluorescence photons, boosted in forward direction into the X-ray
region, are energetically analyzed with a single crystal monochromator. The
hyperfine structure can be investigated at the 2P 1/2 - 2S 1/2 transition for
all elements and at the 2P 3/2 - 2S 1/2 transition for elements with Z < 50.
Isotope shifts and nuclear moments can be measured with unprecedented
precision, in principle even for only a few stored radioactive species with
known nuclear spin. A superior relative line width in the order of 5E-7 may be
feasible after laser cooling, and even polarized external beams may be prepared
by optical pumping.
