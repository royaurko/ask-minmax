In this paper, we present an efficient resource allocation with user
discrimination framework for 5G Wireless Systems to allocate multiple carriers
resources among users with elastic and inelastic traffic. Each application
running on the user equipment (UE) is assigned an application utility function.
In the proposed model, different classes of user groups are considered and
users are partitioned into different groups based on the carriers coverage
area. Each user has a minimum required application rate based on its class and
the type of its application. Our objective is to allocate multiple carriers
resources optimally among users, that belong to different classes, located
within the carriers' coverage area. We use a utility proportional fairness
approach in the utility percentage of the application running on the UE. Each
user is guaranteed a minimum quality of service (QoS) with a priority criterion
that is based on user's class and the type of application running on the UE. In
addition, we prove the existence of optimal solutions for the proposed resource
allocation optimization problem and present a multi-carrier resource allocation
with user discrimination algorithm. Finally, we present simulation results for
the performance of the proposed algorithm.
