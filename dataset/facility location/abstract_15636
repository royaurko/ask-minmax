In this present work, we report a structural and magnetic study of mixed
Co58Pt42 clusters. MgO, Nb and Si matrix can be used to embed clusters,
avoiding any magnetic interactions between particles. Transmission Electron
Microscopy (TEM) observations show that Co58Pt42 supported isolated clusters
are about 2nm in diameter and crystallized in the A1 fcc chemically disordered
phase. Grazing Incidence Small Angle X-ray Scattering (GISAXS) and Grazing
Incidence Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) reveal that buried clusters
conserve these properties, interaction with matrix atoms being limited to their
first atomic layers. Considering that 60% of particle atoms are located at
surface, this interactions leads to a drastic change in magnetic properties
which were investigated with conventional magnetometry and X-Ray Magnetic
Circular Dichro\"{i}sm (XMCD). Magnetization and blocking temperature are
weaker for clusters embedded in Nb than in MgO, and totally vanish in silicon
as silicides are formed. Magnetic volume of clusters embedded in MgO is close
to the crystallized volume determined by GIWAXS experiments. Cluster can be
seen as a pure ferromagnetic CoPt crystallized core surrounded by a
cluster-matrix mixed shell. The outer shell plays a predominant role in
magnetic properties, especially for clusters embedded in niobium which have a
blocking temperature 3 times smaller than clusters embedded in MgO.
