During the course of our optical deep survey program on L$\alpha$ emitters at
$z \approx 5.7$ in the sky area surrounding the quasar SDSSp
J104433.04$-$012502.2 at $z=5.74$, we found that a faint galaxy with $m_B$(AB)
$\approx 25$ is located at \timeform{1".9} southwest of the quasar. Its
broad-band color properties from $B$ to $z^\prime$ suggest that the galaxy is
located at a redshift of $z \sim 1.5$ -- 2.5. This is consistent with no strong
emission line in our optical spectroscopy. Since the counter image of the
quasar cannot be seen in our deep optical images, the magnification factor
seems not to be very high. Our modest estimate is that this quasar is
gravitationally magnified by a factor of 2.
