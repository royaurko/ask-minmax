In this report, we present the energy calibration of the Hall B
bremsstrahlung tagging system at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator
Facility. The calibration was performed using a magnetic pair spectrometer. The
tagged photon energy spectrum was measured in coincidence with $e^+e^-$ pairs
as a function of the pair spectrometer magnetic field. Taking advantage of the
internal linearity of the pair spectrometer, the energy of the tagging system
was calibrated at the level of $\pm 0.1% E_\gamma$. The absolute energy scale
was determined using the $e^+e^-$ rate measurements close to the end-point of
the photon spectrum. The energy variations across the full tagging range were
found to be $<3$ MeV.
