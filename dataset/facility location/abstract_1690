A short overview is given on how generalized parton distributions (GPDs)
enter in a variety of hard exclusive processes such as deeply virtual Compton
scattering (DVCS) and hard meson electroproduction reactions on the nucleon. We
firstly discuss the links between GPDs and elastic nucleon form factors which
represent powerful constraints on parametrizations of GPDs. Subsequently, we
show some key observables which are sensitive to the various hadron structure
aspects of the GPDs, and which are at present under experimental investigation
at different facilities (HERMES, H1/ZEUS, JLab and Compass), or will be
addressed by experiments in the near future.
