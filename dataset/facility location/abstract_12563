We study the stability of the (87) Sylvia system and of the neighborhood of
its two satellites. We use numerical integrations considering the
non-sphericity of Sylvia, as well as the mutual perturbation of the satellites
and the solar perturbation. Two numerical models have been used, which describe
respectively the short and long-term evolution of the system. We show that the
actual system is in a deeply stable zone, but surrounded by both fast and
secular chaotic regions due to resonances. We then investigate how tidal and
BYORP effects modify the location of the system over time with respect to the
instability zones. Finally, we briefly generalize this study to other known
triple systems and to satellites of asteroids in general, and discuss about
their distance from mean-motion and evection resonances.
