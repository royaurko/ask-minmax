We present high angular resolution (down to 0.3" = 13 AU in diameter)
Submillimeter Array observations of the 880 micron (340 GHz) thermal continuum
emission from circumstellar dust disks in the nearby HD 98800 and Hen 3-600
multiple star systems. In both cases, the dust emission is resolved and
localized around one stellar component - the HD 98800 B and Hen 3-600 A
spectroscopic binaries - with no evidence for circum-system material. Using
two-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations, we compare the SMA
visibilities and broadband spectral energy distributions with truncated disk
models to empirically locate the inner and outer edges of both disks. The HD
98800 B disk appears to be aligned with the spectroscopic binary orbit, is
internally truncated at a radius of 3.5 AU, and extends to only 10-15 AU from
the central stars. The Hen 3-600 A disk is slightly larger, with an inner edge
at 1 AU and an outer radius of 15-25 AU. These inferred disk structures compare
favorably with theoretical predictions of their truncation due to tidal
interactions with the stellar companions.
