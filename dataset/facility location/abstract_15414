Imaging faint companions (exoplanets and brown dwarfs) around nearby stars is
currently limited by speckle noise. To efficiently attenuate this noise, a
technique called simultaneous spectral differential imaging (SSDI) can be used.
This technique consists of acquiring simultaneously images of the field of view
in several adjacent narrow bands and in combining these images to suppress
speckles. Simulations predict that SSDI can achieve, with the acquisition of
three wavelengths, speckle noise attenuation of several thousands. These
simulations are usually performed using the Fraunhofer approximation, i.e.
considering that all aberrations are located in the pupil plane. We have
performed wavefront propagation simulations to evaluate how out-of-pupil-plane
aberrations affect SSDI speckle noise attenuation performance. The Talbot
formalism is used to give a physical insight of the problem; results are
confirmed using a proper wavefront propagation algorithm. We will show that
near-focal-plane aberrations can significantly reduce SSDI speckle noise
attenuation performance at several lambda/D separation. It is also shown that
the Talbot effect correctly predicts the PSF chromaticity. Both differential
atmospheric refraction effects and the use of a coronagraph will be discussed.
