We use imaging polarimetry taken with the HST/ACS/HRC to explore the three
dimensional structure of the circumstellar dust distribution around the red
supergiant VY Canis Majoris. The polarization vectors of the nebulosity
surrounding VY CMa show a strong centro-symmetric pattern in all directions
except directly East and range from 10% - 80% in fractional polarization. In
regions that are optically thin, and therefore likely have only single
scattering, we use the fractional polarization and photometric color to locate
the physical position of the dust along the line-of-sight. Most of the
individual arc-like features and clumps seen in the intensity image are also
features in the fractioanl polarization map. These features must be distinct
geometric objects. If they were just local density enhancements, the fractional
polarization would not change so abruptly at the edge of the feature. The
location of these features in the ejecta of VY CMa using polarimetry provides a
determination of their 3D geometry independent of, but in close agreement with,
the results from our study of their kinematics (Paper I).
