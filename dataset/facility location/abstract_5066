The MINOS experiment uses a beam of predominantly muon-type neutrinos
generated using protons from the Main Injector at Fermilab in Batavia, IL, and
travelling 735 km through the Earth to a disused iron mine in Soudan, MN. The
10{\mu}s-long beam pulse contains fine time structure which allows a precise
measurement of the neutrino time of flight to be made. The time structure of
the parent proton pulse is measured in the beamline after extraction from the
Main Injector, and neutrino interactions are timestamped at the Fermilab site
in the Near Detector (ND), and at the Soudan site in the Far Detector (FD).
Small, transportable auxiliary detectors, consisting of scintillator planes and
associated readout electronics, are used to measure the relative latency
between the two large detectors. Time at each location is measured with respect
to HP5071A Cesium clocks, and time is transferred using GPS Precise Point
Positioning (PPP) solutions for the clock offset at each location. We describe
the timing calibration of the detectors and derive a measurement of the
neutrino velocity, based on data from March and April 2012. We discuss the
prospects for further improvements that would yield a still more accurate
result.
