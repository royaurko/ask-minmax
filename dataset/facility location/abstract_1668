New strong dynamics at the energy scale ~ 1 TeV is an attractive and elegant
theoretical ansatz for the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking. We review
here the theoretical models for strong dynamics, particularly, technicolor
theories and their low energy signatures. We emphasize that the fantastic beam
energy resolution (sigma_E/E ~10^{-4}) expected at the first muon collider
(sqrt{s} = 100-500 GeV) allows the possibility of resolving some
extraordinarily narrow technihadron resonances and, Higgs-like techniscalars
produced in the s-channel. Investigating indirect probes for strong dynamics
such as search for muon compositeness, we find that the muon colliders provide
unparallel reaches. A big muon collider (sqrt{s} =3-4 TeV) would be a
remarkable facility to study heavy technicolor particles such as the topcolor
Z', to probe the dynamics underlying fermion masses and mixings and to fully
explore the strongly interacting electroweak sector.
