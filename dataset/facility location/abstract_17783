The In-Vessel Viewing System (IVVS) units proposed for ITER are deployed to
perform in-vessel examination. During plasma operations, the IVVS is located
beyond the vacuum vessel, with shielding blocks envisaged to protect components
from neutron damage and reduce shutdown dose rate (SDR) levels. Analyses were
conducted to determine the effectiveness of several shielding configurations.
The neutron response of the system was assessed using global variance reduction
techniques and a surface source, and shutdown dose rate calculations were
undertaken using MCR2S. Unshielded, the absorbed dose to piezoelectric motors
(PZT) was found to be below stable limits, however activation of the primary
closure plate (PCP) was prohibitively high. A scenario with shielding blocks at
probe level showed significantly reduced PCP contact dose rate, however still
marginally exceeded port cell requirements. The addition of shielding blocks at
the bioshield plug demonstrated PCP contact dose rates below project
requirements. SDR levels in contact with the isolated IVVS cartridge were found
to marginally exceed the hands-on maintenance limit. For engineering
feasibility, shielding blocks at bioshield level are to be avoided, however the
port cell SDR field requires further consideration. In addition, alternative
low-activation steels are being considered for the IVVS cartridge.
