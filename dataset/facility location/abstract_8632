It has been argued that the solar magnetic cycle consists of two main
periodic components: a low-frequency component (Hale's 22-year cycle) and a
high-frequency component (quasi-biennial cycle). The existence of the double
magnetic cycle on the Sun is confirmed using Stanford, Mount Wilson and Kitt
Peak magnetograph data from 1976 to 1996 (solar cycles 21 and 22). In the frame
of the Parker's dynamo theory a model of the double magnetic cycle is
presented. This model is based on the idea of two dynamo sources separated in
space. The first source of the dynamo action is located near the bottom of the
convection zone, and the second operates near the top. The model is formulated
in terms of two coupled systems of non-linear differential equations. It is
demonstrated that in the case of weak interaction between the two dynamo
sources the basic features of the double magnetic cycle such as existence of
two component and observed temporal variations of high-frequency component can
be reproduced.
