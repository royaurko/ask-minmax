Wireless sensor networks consist of sensor nodes with limited computational
and communication capabilities. In this paper, the whole network of sensor
nodes is divided into clusters based on their physical locations. In addition,
efficient ways of key distribution among the nodes within the cluster and among
controllers of each cluster are discussed. Also, inter and intra cluster
communications are presented in detail. The security of the entire network
through efficient key management by taking into consideration the network's
power capabilities is discussed. A graphical representation of the simulation
on the scheme is also presented.
