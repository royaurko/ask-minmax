Medical images contain metadata information on where, when, and how an image
was acquired, and the majority of this information is stored as pixel data.
Image feature descriptions are often captured only as free text stored in the
image file or in the hospital information system. Correlations between the free
text and the location of the feature are often inaccurate, making it difficult
to link image observations to their corresponding image locations. This limits
the interpretation of image data from a clinical, research, and academic
standpoint. An efficient medical image protection design should allow for
compatibility, usability, and privacy. This paper proposes a medical-content
creation and protection scheme that contains a) a DICOM-compatible multimedia
annotation scheme for medical content creation; b) a DICOM-compatible partial
DRM scheme for medical record transmission under this scheme, contributorized users
can view only information to which they have been granted to access.
