There are many different ways in which change point analysis can be
performed, from purely parametric methods to those that are distribution free.
The ecp package is designed to perform multiple change point analysis while
making as few assumptions as possible. While many other change point methods
are applicable only for univariate data, this R package is suitable for both
univariate and multivariate observations. Estimation can be based upon either a
hierarchical divisive or agglomerative algorithm. Divisive estimation
sequentially identifies change points via a bisection algorithm. The
agglomerative algorithm estimates change point locations by determining an
optimal segmentation. Both approaches are able to detect any type of
distributional change within the data. This provides an advantage over many
existing change point algorithms which are only able to detect changes within
the marginal distributions.
