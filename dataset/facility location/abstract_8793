A month-long observation of two horizontal ZnS(Ag) scintillating screens, 1
m^2 in area and located one above the other a certain distance apart, revealed
about 10 correlated signals, whose time shift corresponds to an average
velocity of only ~10-15 km/s. We assign the origin of these signals to the
negative daemons, i.e. electrically charged Planckian particles, which
supposedly form a part of the DM in the Galactic disk and were captured into
the near-Earth orbits. The estimated flux of daemons is >=10^-4 m^-2 s^-1. The
key part in the detection of daemons is played apparently by two processes: (i)
the daemon shedding the captured heavy nucleus in a few tens of mks as a result
of a relatively rapid decay of the daemon-containing nucleons, and (ii)
emission of numerous Auger electrons and nuclear particles occurring in the
next capture or recapture of a (heavier) nucleus by the daemon.
