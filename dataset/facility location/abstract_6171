Two-branes RS-I 5-dimensional model is generalized in higher dimensional
string-induced theory with dilaton and $n$-form field. It is supposed that
"hidden" and "visible" Randall-Sundrum branes are located at the boundaries of
region of space-time where low-energy supergravity description is valid. This
permits to determine mass scale hierarchy which calculated value proves to be
strongly dependent on dimensionalities of subspaces.
