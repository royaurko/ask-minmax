In this paper, we describe an effective framework for adapting electronic
commerce or e-commerce services in developing countries like Bangladesh. The
internet has opened up a new horizon for commerce, namely electronic commerce
(e-commerce). It entails the use of the internet in the marketing,
identification, payment and delivery of goods and services. At present internet
facilities are available in Bangladesh. Slowly, but steadily these facilities
are holding a strong position in every aspects of our life. E-commerce is one
of those sectors which need more attention if we want to be a part of global
business. Bangladesh is far-far away to adapt the main stream of e-commerce
application. Though government is shouting to take the challenges of
e-commerce, but they do not take the right step, that is why e-commerce dose
not make any real contribution in our socio-economic life. Here we propose a
model which may develop the e-commerce infrastructure of Bangladesh.
