In this invited contribution I briefly review some of the principal topics in
hadron spectroscopy that were studied at the CERN low-energy antiproton
facility LEAR, from its beginnings in the early 1980s to the present. These
topics include the nature of multiquark systems, the short-ranged nuclear
force, and gluonic hadrons, including glueballs and hybrids. Lessons we have
learned from the LEAR program that are relevant to the future GSI project are
given particular emphasis.
