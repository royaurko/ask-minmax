We report on the properties of 89 low mass star clusters located in the
vicinity of luminous young clusters (blue globulars) in the disk of M31. 82 of
the clusters are newly detected. We have determined their integrated magnitudes
and colors, based on a series of Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field/Planetary
Camera 2 exposures in blue and red (HST filters F450W and F814W). The
integrated apparent magnitudes range from F450W = 17.5 to 22.5, and the colors
indicate a wide range of ages. Stellar color-magnitude diagrams for all
clusters were obtained and those with bright enough stars were fit to
theoretical isochrones to provide age estimates. The ages range from 12 Myr to
>500 Myr. Reddenings, which average E(F450 - F814) = 0.59 with a dispersion of
0.21 magnitudes, were derived from the main sequence fitting for those
clusters. Comparison of these ages and integrated colors with single population
theoretical models with solar abundances suggests a color offset of 0.085
magnitudes at the ages tested. Estimated ages for the remaining clusters are
based on their measured colors. The age-frequency diagram shows a steep decline
of number with age, with a large decrease in number per age interval between
the youngest and the oldest clusters detected.
