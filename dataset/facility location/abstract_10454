We present a general framework to study the effect of killing sources on
moving particles, trafficking inside biological cells. We are merely concerned
with the case of spine-dendrite communication, where the number of calcium
ions, modeled as random particles is regulated across the spine microstructure
by pumps, which play the killing role. In particular, we study here the
survival probability of ions in such environment and we present a general
theory to compute the ratio of the number of absorbed particles at specific
location to the number of killed particles during their sojourn inside a
domain. In the case of a dendritic spine, the ratio is computed in terms of the
survival probability of a stochastic trajectory in a one dimensional
approximation. We show that the ratio depends on the distribution of killing
sources. The biological conclusion follows: changing the position of the pumps
is enough to regulate the calcium ions and thus the spine-dendrite
communication.
