Project X is a high intensity proton facility that will support a
world-leading Intensity Frontier research program over the next several decades
at Fermilab. When compared to other facilities in the planning stages elsewhere
in the world Project X is completely unique in its ability to deliver,
simultaneously, up to 6 MW of site-wide beam power to multiple experiments, at
multiple energies, and with flexible beam formats. Project X will support a
wide range of experiments based on neutrinos, muons, kaons, nucleons, and
nuclei. In addition, Project X will lay the foundation for the long-term
development of a Neutrino Factory and/or Muon Collider. A complete concept for
Project X has been developed and is documented in the Project X Reference
Design Report.
