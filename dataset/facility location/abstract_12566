We present spectra and mass composition of cosmic rays incoming to the Earth
in the energy range (0.5-2)10^20 eV. As their sources we consider Seyfert
galaxies located at distances < 40 Mpc, following an acceleration model for
such moderate-power objects. Mass composition of the particles at sources is
assumed to be mixed. Generation spectra are described by a function E^(-g0),
where g0 is an arbitrary parameter. It is shown that the assumptions adopted
make it possible to describe experimental data provided by HiRes and Pierre
Auger Observatory, using different values of g0.
