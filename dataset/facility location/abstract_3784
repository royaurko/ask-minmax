We investigate $B \to K_0^*(1430) K^*$ decays in the perturbative QCD(pQCD)
factorization approach, where $B$ denotes $B_u$, $B_d$ and $B_s$ meson
respectively, and the scalar $K_0^*(1430)$ is considered as a meson based on
the model of conventional two-quark structure. With the light-cone distribution
amplitude of $K_0^*(1430)$ defined in two scenarios, namely Scenario 1 and
Scenario 2, we make the first estimation for the branching ratios and
CP-violating asymmetries for those concerned decay modes in the pQCD
factorization approach. For all considered $B \to K_0^*(1430) K^*$ decays in
this paper, only one preliminary upper limit on the branching ratio of $B^0 \to
{K_0^*(1430)}^0 \bar{K}^{*0}$ measured at 90% C.L. by Belle Collaboration is
available now. It is therefore of great interest to examine the predicted
physical quantities at two $B$ factories, Large Hadron Collider experiments,
and forthcoming Super-$B$ facility, then test the reliability of the pQCD
approach employed to study the considered decay modes involving a $p$-wave
scalar meson as one of the final state mesons. Furthermore, these pQCD
predictions combined with the future precision measurements are also helpful to
explore the complicated QCD dynamics involved in the light scalars.
