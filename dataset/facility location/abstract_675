We present an analysis leading to precise locations of the multicritical
points for spin glasses on regular lattices. The conventional technique for
determination of the location of the multicritical point was previously derived
using a hypothesis emerging from duality and the replica method. In the present
study, we propose a systematic technique, by an improved technique, giving more
precise locations of the multicritical points on the square, triangular, and
hexagonal lattices by carefully examining relationship between two partition
functions related with each other by the duality. We can find that the
multicritical points of the $\pm J$ Ising model are located at $p_c = 0.890813$
on the square lattice, where $p_c$ means the probability of $J_{ij} = J(>0)$,
at $p_c = 0.835985$ on the triangular lattice, and at $p_c = 0.932593$ on the
hexagonal lattice. These results are in excellent agreement with recent
numerical estimations.
