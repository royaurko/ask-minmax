We consider the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $A_\l:=-\D -\l/|x|^2$, $\l\in \rr$,
when the singularity is located on the boundary of a smooth domain
$\Omega\subset \rr^N$, $N\geq 1$
  The aim of this Note is two folded. Firstly, we justify the extension of the
classical Pohozaev identity for the Laplacian to this case. The problem we
address is very much related to Hardy-Poincar\'{e} inequalities with boundary
singularities. Secondly, the new Pohozaev identity allows to develop the
multiplier method for the wave and the Schr\"{o}dinger equations. In this way
we extend to the case of boundary singularities well known observability and
control properties for the classical wave and Schr\"{o}dinger equations when
the singularity is placed in the interior of the domain (Vanconstenoble and
Zuazua \cite{judith}).
