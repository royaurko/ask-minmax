Ambulance demand estimation at fine time and location scales is critical for
fleet management and dynamic deployment. We are motivated by the problem of
estimating the spatial distribution of ambulance demand in Toronto, Canada, as
it changes over discrete 2-hour intervals. This large-scale dataset is sparse
at the desired temporal resolutions and exhibits location-specific serial
dependence, daily and weekly seasonality. We address these challenges by
introducing a novel characterization of time-varying Gaussian mixture models.
We fix the mixture component distributions across all time periods to overcome
data sparsity and accurately describe Toronto's spatial structure, while
representing the complex spatio-temporal dynamics through time-varying mixture
weights. We constrain the mixture weights to capture weekly seasonality, and
apply a conditionally autoregressive prior on the mixture weights of each
component to represent location-specific short-term serial dependence and daily
seasonality. While estimation may be performed using a fixed number of mixture
components, we also extend to estimate the number of components using
birth-and-death Markov chain Monte Carlo. The proposed model is shown to give
higher statistical predictive accuracy and to reduce the error in predicting
EMS operational performance by as much as two-thirds compared to a typical
industry practice.
