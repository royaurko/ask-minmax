Dynamical process of the formation of a soliton pair from a photogenerated
electron-hole pair in polyacetylene is studied numerically by adopting the SSH
Hamiltonian. A weak local disorder is introduced in order to trigger the
formation. Starting from an initial configuration with an electron at the
bottom of the conduction band and a hole at the top of the valence band,
separated by the Peierls gap, the time dependent Schr${\rm \ddot{o}}$ndinger
equation for the electron wave functions and the equation of motion for the
lattice displacements are solved numerically. After several uniform
oscillations of the lattice system at the early stage, a large distortion
corresponding to a pair of a soliton and an anti-soliton develops from a point
which is determined by the location and type of the disorder. In some cases,
two solitons run in opposite directions, leaving breather like oscillations
behind, and in other cases they form a bound state emitting acoustic lattice
vibrational modes.
