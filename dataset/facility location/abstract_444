The paper summarizes our preliminary findings regarding the development and
implementation of a newly proposed system based on ICT and RFID (Radio
Frequency Identification) technologies for campus access and facility usage. It
is generally acknowledged that any educational environment is highly dependent
upon a wide range of resources or variables such as teaching staff, research
and study areas, meeting and accommodation facilities, library services,
restaurant and leisure facilities, etc. The system we have devised using ICT
and RFID technologies supports not only authentic transactions among all
university departments, but also interconnects all levels of academic life and
activity. Thus, the utility of the system ranges from access control (student/
staff/ visitor identification), attendance tracking, library check-out services
and voting to grade book consulting, inventory, cashless vending, parking,
laundry and copying services. Physically, the system consists of several RFID
gates/readers, a data server and some network stations, all of them requiring
specific structuring and integration solutions. The system is quite different
from already existing ones in that it proposes an innovative access solution.
Thus, the search of the ID card holder in a database has been replaced by local
processing. Since one and the same card is employed to perform a variety of
operations, the system has immediate and numerous utilizations.
