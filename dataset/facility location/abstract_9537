We present the results of UBVRI broad-band aperture CCD photometry of 51
compact star clusters located in the South-West part of the M31 disk. The mean
rms errors of all measured star cluster colors are less than 0.02 mag. In color
vs. color diagrams the star clusters show significantly tighter sequences when
compared with the photometric data from the compiled catalog of the M31 star
clusters published by Galleti et al. (2004).
