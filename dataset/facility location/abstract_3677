THGEMs (THick Gas Electron Multiplier) of varying thickness, hole diameter
and hole pitch have been studied. For a thinner-THGEM of thickness 0.2 mm, with
hole diameter 0.2 mm, pitch 0.2 mm and narrow (5-10 {\mu}m) rim, the
performance of gain versus high voltage with different gas mixtures have been
studied using 5.9 keV X-rays. In general, a gain of around 3\times10^3 was
obtained with a single board in Ar/iC4H10, and gains higher than 10^4 were
obtained in Ne mixture at lower voltage. The dependence of the energy
resolution on the drift and induction electric fields was measured and an
energy resolution of 15.9% was obtained. A curved thinner-THGEM chamber with
one-dimensional readout has been assembled for use in the diffraction studies
at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). A cosmic-ray muon
hodoscope based on thinner-THGEM was developed as a teaching experiment for the
Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (GUCAS).
