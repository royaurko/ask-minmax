The Solar Tower Atmospheric Cherenkov Effect Experiment (STACEE) is a
telescope designed to explore the gamma-ray sky between 20 and 250 GeV using
the atmospheric Cherenkov technique. STACEE is currently under construction.
When completed, it will use 48 large heliostat mirrors at the solar research
facility at Sandia National Laboratories (Albuquerque, NM) to reflect Cherenkov
light created in gamma-ray air showers to secondary mirrors on a central tower.
The secondary mirrors image this light onto photomultiplier tube cameras. This
paper provides an overview of the STACEE project, including a description of
the experimental site and an outline of the current design for the detector
components.
