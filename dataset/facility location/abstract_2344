Assessing the impact of astronomical facilities rests upon an evaluation of
the scientific discoveries which their data have enabled. Telescope
bibliographies, which link data products with the literature, provide a way to
use bibliometrics as an impact measure for the underlying data. In this paper
we argue that the creation and maintenance of telescope bibliographies should
be considered an integral part of an observatory's operations. We review the
existing tools, services, and workflows which support these curation
activities, giving an estimate of the effort and expertise required to maintain
an archive-based telescope bibliography.
