We present a study of the structure and dynamics of the star forming region
B1-IRS (IRAS 03301+3057) using the properties of different molecules at high
angular resolution (~4''). We have used VLA observations of NH3, CCS, and H2O
masers at 1 cm. CCS emission shows three clumps around the central source, with
a velocity gradient from red to blueshifted velocities towards the protostar,
probably due to the interaction with outflowing material. Water maser emission
is elongated in the same direction as a reflection nebula detected at 2micron
by 2MASS, with the maser spots located in a structure of some hundreds of AU
from the central source, possibly tracing a jet. We propose a new outflow model
to explain all our observations, consisting of a molecular outflow near the
plane of the sky. Ammonia emission is extended and anticorrelated with CCS. We
have detected for the first time this anticorrelation at small scales (1400 AU)
in a star forming region.
