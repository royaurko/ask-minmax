We discuss the application of simple relativistically-blurred X-ray
reflection models to the determination of the spin and the inner radius of the
disc in accreting black holes. Observationally, the nature of the corona is
uncertain a priori, but a robust determination of the inner disk radius can be
made when the disc emissivity index is tightly constrained. When the inner disc
is well illuminated, the black hole spin can also be determined. Using
reflection modelling derived from ray tracing, we show that robust
determination of disc truncation requires that the location of the coronal
source is quasi-static and at a height and radius less than the truncation
radius of the disc. Robust spin measurements require that at least part of the
corona lies less than about 10 gravitational radii above the black hole in
order that the innermost regions, including the innermost stable circular
orbit, are well illuminated. The width of the blurring kernel (e.g., the iron
line) has a strong dependence on coronal height. These limitations may be
particularly applicable at low Eddington fractions (e.g. the low/hard state,
and low-luminosity AGN) where the height of the corona may be relatively large,
or outflowing, and tied to jet production.
