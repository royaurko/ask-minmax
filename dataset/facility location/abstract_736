The Astrophysical Virtual Observatory (AVO) initiative, jointly funded by the
European Commission and six European organisations, had the task of creating
the foundations of a regional scale infrastructure by conducting a research and
demonstration programme on the VO scientific requirements and necessary
technologies. The AVO project is now formally concluded. I highlight AVO's main
achievements and then describe its successor, the EURO-VO project. With its
three new interlinked structures, the Data Centre Alliance, the Facility
Centre, and the Technology Centre, the EURO-VO is the logical next step for the
deployment of an operational VO in Europe.
