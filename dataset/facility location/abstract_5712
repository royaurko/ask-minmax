The first detection of the molecular ion H3+ in an extragalactic object has
been made toward the highly obscured ultraluminous galaxy, IRAS 08572+3915. Two
absorption features near 3.9 microns in its spectrum are identified as the
redshifted 3.668 microns doublet and 3.716 microns singlet lines of H3+, both
previously detected in a number of galactic molecular and diffuse clouds. We
discuss the probable location of the H3+ in this galaxy.
