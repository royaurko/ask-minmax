We present a catalog of gamma-ray sources at energies above 10 GeV based on
data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) accumulated during the first three
years of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope mission. The first Fermi-LAT
catalog of >10GeV sources (1FHL) has 514 sources. For each source we present
location, spectrum, a measure of variability, and associations with cataloged
sources at other wavelengths. We found that 449 (87%) could be associated with
known sources, of which 393 (76% of the 1FHL sources) are active galactic
nuclei. Of the 27 sources associated with known pulsars, we find 20 (12) to
have significant pulsations in the range >10GeV (>25GeV). In this work we also
report that, at energies above 10 GeV, unresolved sources account for 27+/-8 %
of the isotropic gamma-ray background, while the unresolved Galactic population
contributes only at the few percent level to the Galactic diffuse background.
We also highlight the subset of the 1FHL sources that are best candidates for
detection at energies above 50-100 GeV with current and future ground-based
gamma-ray observatories.
