Preliminary results of a work in collaboration with M.R. Pennington are
presented. Extending a scheme introduced by Tornqvist, we investigate a
dynamical model in which the spectrum of scalar mesons can be derived, with the
aim of locating the lightest glue-state. Adding hadronic interaction
contributions to the bare propagator, to `dress' the bare quark-model $q
\overline q$ states, we are able to write the amplitudes and the phase shifts
in the approximation in which scalar resonances decay only into two
pseudoscalar channels. The fit of these quantities to experimental data gives a
satisfactory understanding of how hadronic interactions modify the underlying
`bare' spectrum. In particular, we examine the case in which a glue-state is
introduced into the model.
