When two perfectly conducting inclusions are located closely to each other,
the electric field concentrates in a narrow region in between two inclusions,
and becomes arbitrarily large as the distance between two inclusions tends to
zero. The purpose of this paper is to derive an asymptotic formula of the
concentration which completely characterizes the singular behavior of the
electric field, when inclusions are balls of the same radii in three
dimensions.
