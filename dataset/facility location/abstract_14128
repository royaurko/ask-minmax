The discovery of a 125 GeV Higgs boson at the LHC marked a breakthrough in
particle physics. The relative lightness of the new particle inspires the
consideration of a high luminosity Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC)
as a Higgs Factory to study the Higgs boson in a clean environment. At the
CEPC, the beamstrahlung might represent one of the most important sources of
beam-induced backgrounds that will impact the detector. It will introduce
additional backgrounds to the CEPC detector through the subsequent
electron-positron pair production and the hadronic process. Therefore its
impacts should be carefully evaluated. In this paper, the beamstrahlung-induced
backgrounds are first estimated with analytical methods and are further
evaluated in detail with Monte Carlo simulation. The detector occupancy due to
the beamstrahlung at the location where the first vertex detector layer may be
placed is found to be well below 0.5%. Radiation levels characterised as
non-ionising energy loss (NIEL) and total ionising dose (TID) are estimated to
be ~ $10^{11} 1 $ MeV $ n_{eq}/cm^2/$yr and ~ 300 kRad/yr, respectively.
