The LHCb Collaboration announced two pentaquark-like structures in the
$J/\psi p$ invariant mass distribution. We show that the current information on
the narrow structure at 4.45 GeV is compatible with kinematical effects of the
rescattering from $\chi_{c1} p$ to $J/\psi p$: First, it is located exactly at
the $\chi_{c1} p$ threshold. Second, the mass of the four-star well-established
$\Lambda(1890)$ is such that a leading Landau singularity from a triangle
diagram can coincidentally appear at the $\chi_{c1} p$ threshold, and third,
there is a narrow structure at the $\chi_{c1}\,p$ threshold but not at the
$\chi_{c0} p$ and $\chi_{c2} p$ thresholds. In order to check whether that
structure corresponds to a real exotic resonance, one has to measure the
process $\Lambda_b^0\to K^-\chi_{c1} p$. If the $P_c(4450)$ structure exists in
the $\chi_{c1} p$ invariant mass distribution as well, then the structure
cannot be just a kinematical effect but is a real resonance, otherwise, one
cannot conclude the $P_c(4450)$ to be another exotic hadron. In addition, it is
also worthwhile to measure the decay $\Upsilon(1S)\to J/\psi p \bar p$: a
narrow structure at 4.45 GeV but not at the $\chi_{c0} p$ and $\chi_{c2} p$
thresholds would exclude the possibility of a pure kinematical effect.
