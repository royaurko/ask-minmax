Over the six years since the discovery of the gamma-ray burst GRB 980425,
associated with the nearby (distance, ~40 Mpc) supernova 1998bw, astronomers
have fiercely debated the nature of this event. Relative to bursts located at
cosmological distances, (redshift, z~1), GRB 980425 was under-luminous in
gamma-rays by three orders of magnitude. Radio calorimetry showed the explosion
was sub-energetic by a factor of 10. Here, we report observations of the radio
and X-ray afterglow of the recent z=0.105 GRB 031203 and demonstrate that it
too is sub-energetic. Our result, when taken together with the low gamma-ray
luminosity, suggest that GRB 031203 is the first cosmic analogue to GRB 980425.
We find no evidence that this event was a highly collimated explosion viewed
off-axis. Like GRB 980425, GRB 031203 appears to be an intrinsically
sub-energetic gamma-ray burst. Such sub-energetic events have faint afterglows.
Intensive follow-up of faint bursts with smooth gamma-ray light curves (common
to both GRBs 031203 and 980425) may enable us to reveal their expected large
population.
