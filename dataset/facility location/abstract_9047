An analysis is made of the masses and spectral features for cosmic rays in
the PeV region, insofar as they have a bearing on the problem of the
interaction of cosmic ray particles. In our Single Source Model we identified
two 'peaks' seen in a summary of the world's data on primary spectra, and
claimed that they are probably due to oxygen and iron nuclei from a local,
recent supernova. In the present work we examine other possible mass
assignments. We conclude that of the other possibilities only Helium and Oxygen
(instead of O and Fe) has much chance of success; the original suggestion is
still preferred, however. Concerning our location with respect to the SNR
shell, the analysis suggests that we are close to it - probably just inside.
