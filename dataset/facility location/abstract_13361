A one-dimensional topological superconductor features a single fermionic zero
mode that is delocalized over two Majorana bound states located at the ends of
the system. We study a pair of spatially separated nanomechanical oscillators
tunnel-coupled to these Majorana modes. Most interestingly, we demonstrate that
the combination of electron-phonon coupling and a finite charging energy on the
mesoscopic topological superconductor can lead to an effective superexchange
between the oscillators via the non-local fermionic zero mode. We further show
that this teleportation mechanism leads to entanglement of the two oscillators
over distances that can significantly exceed the coherence length of the
superconductor.
