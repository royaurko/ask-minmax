Systems tend to become more and more complex. This has a direct impact on
system engineering processes. Two of the most important phases in these
processes are requirements engineering and quality assurance. Two significant
complexity drivers located in these phases are the growing number of product
variants that have to be integrated into the requirements engineering and the
ever growing effort for manual test design. There are modeling techniques to
deal with both complexity drivers like, e.g., feature modeling and model-based
test design. Their combination, however, has been seldom the focus of
investigation. In this paper, we present two approaches to combine feature
modeling and model-based testing as an efficient quality assurance technique
for product lines. We present the corresponding difficulties and approaches to
overcome them. All explanations are supported by an example of an online shop
product line.
