We propose a new optimal Location-Based Beamforming (LBB) scheme for the
wiretap channel, where both the main channel and the eavesdropper's channel are
subject to Rician fading. In our LBB scheme the two key inputs are the location
of the legitimate receiver and the location of the potential eavesdropper.
Notably, our scheme does not require as direct inputs any channel state
information of the main channel or the eavesdropper's channel, making it easy
to deploy in a host of application settings in which the location inputs are
known. Our beamforming solution assumes a multiple-antenna transmitter, a
multiple-antenna eavesdropper, and a single-antenna receiver, and its aim is to
maximize the physical layer security of the channel. To obtain our solution we
first derive the secrecy outage probability of the LBB scheme in a closed-form
expression that is valid for arbitrary values of the Rician K-factors of the
main channel and the eavesdropper's channel. Using this expression we then
determine the location-based beamformer solution that minimizes the secrecy
outage probability. To assess the usefulness of our new scheme, and to quantify
the value of the location information to the beamformer, we compare our scheme
to other schemes, some of which do not utilize any location information. Our
new beamformer solution provides optimal physical layer security for a wide
range of location-based applications.
