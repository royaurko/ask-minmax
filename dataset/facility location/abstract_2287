In the abundance spectrum of r-process nuclei the most prominent features are
the peaks that form when the r-process flow passes through the closed neutron
shells. However, there are also other features in the abundance spectrum that
can not be explained by shell effects, like the peak in the region of the
rare-earth nuclei around mass A=160. It has been argued that this peak is
related to the deformation maximum of the neutron-rich isotopes. Recently, both
experimental and theoretical work has been carried out to study the deformation
of neutron-rich rare-earth nuclei and to search for the point of maximum
deformation. This work has focused on the nuclei around 170Dy in order to
understand the evolution of collectivity in the neutron shell with 82 < N <
126. These investigations will be discussed in terms of the Harris parameters
of the Variable Moment of Inertia model. Finally, we will discuss the future
possibilities to reach further into the neutron-rich rare-earth region at the
new experimental facilities using radioactive beams.
