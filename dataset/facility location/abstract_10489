We report on the formation of dark discrete solitons in a nonlinear periodic
system consisting of evanescently-coupled channel waveguides that are
fabricated in defocusing lithium niobate. Localized nonlinear dark modes
displaying a phase jump in the center that is located either on-channel (mode
A) or in-between channels (mode B) are formed, which is to our knowledge the
first experimental observation of mode B. By numerical simulations we find that
the saturable nature of the nonlinearity is responsible for the improved
stability of mode B. The ability of the induced refractive index structures to
guide light of a low-power probe beam is demonstrated.
