An approximation method to study the properties of a small black hole located
on the TeV brane in the Randall-Sundrum type I scenario is presented. The
method enables us to find the form of the metric close to the matter
distribution when its asymptotic form is given. The short range solution is
found as an expansion in the ratio between the Schwarzschild radius of the
black hole and the curvature length of the bulk. Long range properties are
introduced using the linearized gravity solution as an asymptotic boundary
condition. The solution is found up to first order. It is valid in the region
close to the horizon but is not valid on the horizon. The regularity of the
horizon is still under study.
