The steady state velocity fluctuations of a movable piston located on the top
of a vibrated granular gas are studied by means of molecular dynamics
simulations. From the second moment of the distribution, a temperature
parameter for the piston is defined and compared with the granular temperature
of the gas located just below it. Then the two temperature parameters refer to
two interacting macroscopic systems. The equipartition of energy valid in usual
molecular systems is strongly violated, and the temperature of the piston can
be larger or smaller than the one of the gas, depending of the parameters
defining the system at the particle level. The simulation results for the ratio
of temperatures are in agreement with some theoretical predictions from kinetic
theory assuming the validity of a hydrodynamic description in the limit of weak
inelasticity of the gas.
