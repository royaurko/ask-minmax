We reported the optical observations of GRB 121011A by 0.8-m TNT telescope at
Xinglong observatory, China. The light curve of optical afterglow shows a
smooth and featureless bump during the epoch of $\sim$130 sec and $\sim$5000
sec with a rising index of $1.57\pm0.28$ before the break time of $539\pm44$
sec, and a decaying index of about $1.29\pm0.07$ up to the end of our
observations. Meanwhile, the X-ray light curve decays in a single power-law
with a slop of about $1.51\pm0.03$ observed by $XRT$ onboard ${\rm} Swift$ from
100 sec to about 10000 sec after the burst trigger. The featureless optical
light curve could be understood as an onset process under the external-shock
model. The typical frequency has been below or near the optical one before the
deceleration time, and the cooling frequency is located between the optical and
X-ray wavelengths. The external medium density has a transition from a mixed
stage of ISM and wind-type medium before the peak time to the ISM at the later
phase. The joint-analysis of X-ray and optical light curves shows that the
emission from both frequencies are consistent with the prediction of the
standard afterglow model without any energy injections, indicating that the
central engine has stopped its activity and does not restart anymore after the
prompt phase.
