The ANTARES observatory is currently the largest neutrino telescope in the
Northern Hemisphere. It is well suited to detect high energy neutrinos produced
in astrophysical sources as it can observe a full hemisphere of the sky at all
the times with a high duty cycle and an angular resolution about 0.4 degrees.
Due to its location in the South of France, ANTARES is sensitive to up-going
neutrinos from many potential galactic sources in the TeV to PeV energy regime.
Results from a time-integrated unbinned method as well as the sensitivity of
the detector using 2007-2010 data are presented. Moreover, using a
time-dependent search for the transient sources, the background rejection and
point-source sensitivity can be drastically improved by selecting a narrow time
window around the assumed neutrino production period. The gamma-ray light
curves of blazars measured by the LAT instrument on-board the Fermi satellite
reveal important time variability information. A strong correlation between the
gamma-ray and the neutrino fluxes is expected in a hadronic scenario. First
results on the search for ten bright and variable Fermi sources with the 2008
ANTARES data are also presented.
