During its first six years of operation, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)
has detected >30 MeV gamma-ray emission from more than 40 solar flares, nearly
a factor of 10 more than those detected by EGRET. These include detections of
impulsive and sustained emissions, extending up to 20 hours in the case of the
2012 March 7 X-class flares. We will present an overview of solar flare
detections with LAT, highlighting recent results and surprising features,
including the detection of >100 MeV emission associated with flares located
behind the limb. Such flares may shed new light on the relationship between the
sites of particle acceleration and gamma-ray emission.
