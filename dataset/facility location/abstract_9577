The luminous, oxygen-rich supernova remnant, J1228+441, is located in the
irregular galaxy NGC 4449 and has been observed at radio wavelengths for thirty
years. An analysis of recent VLA observations of NGC 4449, combined with VLA
archive data and previously published VLA and WSRT observations, yields light
curves at 6 and 20 cm from 1972 to 2002. The light curves at all radio
frequencies exhibit a marked decline in radio emission, confirming past
findings. This paper presents and discusses the radio light curves and spectral
index, alpha, variations from 1972 to 2002 where nu propto nu^(-alpha) and
compares J1228+441 with other radio supernovae. The spectral index of J1228+441
appears to have steepened in the last five years at higher frequencies from
alpha=0.64 +- 0.02 in 1996 to alpha=1.01 +- 0.02 in 2001-2002.
