When considering the X-ray spectrum resulting from the reflection off the
surface of accretion discs of AGN, it is necessary to account for the variation
in reflected flux over the disc, i.e. the emissivity profile. This will depend
on factors including the location and geometry of the X-ray source and the disc
characteristics. We directly obtain the emissivity profile of the disc from the
observed spectrum by considering the reflection component as the sum of
contributions from successive radii in the disc and fitting to find the
relative weightings of these components in a relativistically-broadened
emission line. This method has successfully recovered known emissivity profiles
from synthetic spectra and is applied to XMM-Newton spectra of the Narrow Line
Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H 0707-495. The data imply a twice-broken power law form of
the emissivity law with a steep profile in the inner regions of the disc (index
7.8) and then a flat region between 5.6rg and 34.8rg before tending to a
constant index of 3.3 over the outer regions of the disc. The form of the
observed emissivity profile is consistent with theoretical predictions, thus
reinforcing the reflection interpretation.
