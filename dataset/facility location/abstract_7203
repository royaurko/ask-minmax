High velocity outflows from quasars are revealed by the absorption signatures
they produce in the spectrum of the quasar. Clues on the nature and origin of
these flows are important for our understanding of the dynamics of gas in the
central regions of the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGNs) but also of the metal
enrichment of the intergalactic space. Line radiation pressure has often been
suggested to be an important process in driving these outflows, however no
convincing evidence has been given so far. Here we report observation of a
highly structured flow, toward Q~1511+091, where the velocity separations
between distinct components are similar to O VI, N V and C IV doublet
splittings with some of the profiles matching perfectly. This strongly favors
the idea that the absorbing clumps originate at similar physical location and
are driven by radiative acceleration due to resonance lines. The complex
absorption can be understood if the flow is highly collimated so that the
different optically thick clouds are aligned and cover the same region of the
background source. One component shows saturated H I Lyman series lines
together with absorptions from excited levels from C II and Si II but covers
only 40% of the source of continuum. The fact that clouds cover only part of
the small continuum source implies that the flow is located very close to it.
