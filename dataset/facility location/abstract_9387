We report the detection of nonradial g-mode oscillations in the DA white
dwarfs HS1039+4112 (B=15.9) and HE1429-0343 (B=15.8) from time-series
photometry made at the Loiano 1.5 m telescope. The two stars were previously
selected as probable pulsators based on two-color photometry and spectral
analysis respectively. Following our temperature and surface gravity
determinations, HS1039+4112 (Teff=11200 K, logg=8.2) is located near the red
edge of the ZZ Ceti instability strip, whereas HE1429-0343 (Teff=11400 K,
logg=7.8) falls in the middle of the strip. Both stars show a multi-mode
behavior with the main periods at about 850 and 970 s respectively, and
relatively large amplitudes (~7% and ~2.5%).
