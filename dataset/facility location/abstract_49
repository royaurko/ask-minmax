To unambiguously identify baryon resonances the measurement of polarization
observables is of great importance. With the CBELSA/TAPS experiment, located at
the ELSA accelerator facility in Bonn, polarization observables have been
determined. Using a linearly polarized photon beam impinging on a liquid
hydrogen target, the polarization observables I^s and I^c for the reaction
\gamma p -> p \pi^0 \pi^0 have been determined for the first time.
