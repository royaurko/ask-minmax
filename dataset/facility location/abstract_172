The benefits for the e-MERLIN and EVN arrays of using antennae at the
satellite communication station at Goonhilly in Cornwall are discussed. The
location of this site - new to astronomy - will provide an almost equal
distribution of long baselines in the east-west- and north-south directions,
and opens up the possibility to get significantly improved observations of
equatorial fields with e-MERLIN. These additional baselines will improve the
sensitivity on a set of critical spatial scales and will increase the angular
resolution of e-MERLIN by a factor of two. e-MERLIN observations, including
many allocated under the e-MERLIN Legacy programme, will benefit from the
enhanced angular resolution and imaging capability especially for sources close
to or below the celestial equator (where ESO facilities such as ALMA will
operate) of including the Goonhilly telescopes. Furthermore, the baselines
formed between Goonhilly and the existing stations will close the gap between
the baselines of e-MERLIN and those of the European VLBI Network (EVN) and
therefore enhance the legacy value of e-MERLIN datasets.
