The orientation of the local interstellar magnetic field introduces
asymmetries in the heliosphere that affect the location of heliospheric radio
emissions and the streaming direction of ions from the termination shock of the
solar wind. We combine observations of radio emissions and energetic particle
streaming with extensive 3D MHD computer simulations of magnetic field draping
over the heliopause to show that the plane of the local interstellar field is ~
60-90 degrees from the galactic plane. This suggests that the field orientation
in the Local Interstellar Cloud differs from that of a larger scale
interstellar magnetic field thought to parallel the galactic plane.
