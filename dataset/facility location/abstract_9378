We present optical interferometric polarimetry measurements of the Mira-like
variables R Car and RR Sco, using the Sydney University Stellar Interferometer.
By making visibility measurements in two perpendicular polarisations, the
relatively low-surface brightness light scattered by atmospheric dust could be
spatially separated from the bright Mira photospheric flux. This is the first
reported successful use of long-baseline optical interferometric polarimetry.
Observations were able to place constraints on the distribution of
circumstellar material in R Car and RR Sco. The inner radius of dust formation
for both stars was found to be less than 3 stellar radii: much closer than the
expected innermost stable location for commonly-assumed astrophysical ``dirty
silicate'' dust in these systems (silicate dust with a significant iron
content). A model with the dust distributed over a shell which is geometrically
thin compared to the stellar radius was preferred over an outflow. We propose
dust components whose chemistry and opacity properties enable survival at these
extreme inner radii.
