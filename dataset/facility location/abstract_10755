Using first principles, classical potentials, and elasticity theory, we
investigated the structure of a semiconductor/semiconductor interface with a
high lattice mismatch, SiC/Si(001). Among several tested possible
configurations, a heterostructure with (i) a misfit dislocation network pinned
at the interface and (ii) reconstructed dislocation cores with a carbon
substoichiometry is found to be the most stable one. The importance of the slab
approximation in first-principles calculations is discussed and estimated by
combining classical potential techniques and elasticity theory. For the most
stable configuration, an estimate of the interface energy is given. Finally,
the electronic structure is investigated and discussed in relation with the
dislocation array structure. Interface states, localized in the heterostructure
gap and located on dislocation cores, are identified.
