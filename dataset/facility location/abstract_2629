The study of slope parameter is presented for elastic proton-proton and
antiproton-proton scattering with taking into account the resent experimental
data at high energies. The expanded logarithmic approximations allow the
description of the experimental slopes in all available energy range
reasonably. Accounting for the LHC results leads to the dramatic change of
behavior of the quadratic in logarithm approximation at high energies and to
the closer trends for all fitting functions under study in comparison with the
analysis at collision energies up to the 200 GeV. The estimations of the
asymptotic shrinkage parameter $\alpha'_{\cal{P}}$ are discussed. Predictions
for diffraction slope parameter are obtained for some proton-proton and
antiproton-proton facilities.
