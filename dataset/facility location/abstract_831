New experimental data obtained mainly at the GSI/FRS facility allow to modify
the empirical parametrization of fragmentation cross sections, EPAX. It will be
shown that minor modifications of the parameters lead to a much better
reproduction of measured cross sections. The most significant changes refer to
the description of fragmentation yields close to the projectile and of the
memory effect of neutron-deficient projectiles.
