We have determined the distance to M33 using the tip of the red giant branch
(TRGB) and the red clump (RC), from the VI photometry of stars in ten regions
of M33 based on HST/WFPC2 images. The regions used in this study are located at
R=2.6 - 17.8 arcmin from the center of M33. The distance modulus to M33
obtained in this study, for an adopted foreground reddening of E(B-V)=0.04, is
(m-M)_{0,TRGB}=24.81+/-0.04(random)+0.15/-0.11(systematic) from the TRGB, and
(m-M)_{0,RC}=24.80+/-0.04(random)+/-0.05(systematic) from the RC, showing an
excellent agreement between the two (corresponding to a distance of
916+/-17(random) kpc and 912+/-17(random) kpc, respectively). These results are
\~0.3 mag larger than the Cepheid distances based on the same HST/WFPC2 data
and ground-based data. This difference is considered partially due to the
uncertainty in the estimates of the total reddening for Cepheids in M33.
