World Health Organization showed at one year about 287 000 women died most of
them during and following pregnancy and childbirth in Africa and south Asia.
This paper suggests mHealth system for serving pregnant women, that proposed
system is first an effective mHealth system works base on mobile GIS to select
adjacent care centre or hospital maternity on Google map at online registration
for woman pregnant, that is done when the pregnant woman will send SMS via GPRS
network contains her ID and coordinates (Longitude and Latitude) the server
when receive it will search database support that system and using the same
infrastructure for help the pregnant women at her location (home, market, etc)
in emergency cases when the woman send SMS contains her coordinates for
succoring. Implement the proposed pregnant women system shows more effective
from view of cost than other systems because it works in economic (SMS) mode
and from view of serve the system can easy and rapidly manage when achieving
locally registration, succoring in emergency cases, change the review date of
pregnant woman, as well as different types of advising.
