A well-known approach for identifying defect-prone parts of software in order
to focus testing is to use different kinds of product metrics such as size or
complexity. Although this approach has been evaluated in many contexts, the
question remains if there are further opportunities to improve test focusing.
One idea is to identify other types of information that may indicate the
location of defect-prone software parts. Data from software inspections, in
particular, appear to be promising. This kind of data might already lead to
software parts that have inherent difficulties or programming challenges, and
in consequence might be defect-prone. This article first explains how
inspection and product metrics can be used to focus testing activities. Second,
we compare selected product and inspection metrics commonly used to predict
defect-prone parts (e.g., size and complexity metrics, inspection defect
content metrics, and defect density metrics). Based on initial experience from
two case studies performed in different environments, the suitability of
different metrics for predicting defect-prone parts is illustrated. The studies
revealed that inspection defect data seems to be a suitable predictor, and a
combination of certain inspection and product metrics led to the best
prioritizations in our contexts. In addition, qualitative experience is
presented, which substantiates the expected benefit of using inspection results
to optimize testing.
