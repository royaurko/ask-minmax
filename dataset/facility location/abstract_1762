The gamma-decay properties of 24Mg excited states are investigated in the
inverse reaction 24Mg+12C at E(24Mg) = 130 MeV. At this energy the direct
inelastic scattering populates a 24Mg* energy region where 12C+12C breakup
resonances can occur. Very exclusive data were collected with the Binary
Reaction Spectrometer (BRS) in coincidence with EUROBALL installed at the
VIVITRON Tandem facility of the IReS at Strasbourg. The experimental detection
system is decribed and preliminary results of binary reaction coincid data are
presented.
