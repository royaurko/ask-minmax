0103$-$72.6, the second brightest X-ray supernova remnant (SNR) in the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC), has been observed with the {\it Chandra X-Ray
Observatory}. Our {\it Chandra} observation unambiguously resolves the X-ray
emission into a nearly complete, remarkably circular shell surrounding bright
clumpy emission in the center of the remnant. The observed X-ray spectrum for
the central region is evidently dominated by emission from reverse shock-heated
metal-rich ejecta. Elemental abundances in this ejecta material are
particularly enhanced in oxygen and neon, while less prominent in the heavier
elements Si, S, and Fe. We thus propose that 0103$-$72.6 is a new
``oxygen-rich'' SNR, making it only the second member of the class in the SMC.
The outer shell is the limb-brightened, soft X-ray emission from the swept-up
SMC interstellar medium. The presence of O-rich ejecta and the SNR's location
within an H{\small II} region attest to a massive star core-collapse origin for
0103$-$72.6. The elemental abundance ratios derived from the ejecta suggest an
$\sim$18 M$_{\odot}$ progenitor star.
