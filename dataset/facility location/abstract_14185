Because Facebook is available on hundreds of millions of desktop and mobile
computing platforms around the world and because it is available on many
different kinds of platforms (from desktops and laptops running Windows, Unix,
or OS X to hand held devices running iOS, Android, or Windows Phone), it would
seem to be the perfect place to conduct steganography. On Facebook, information
hidden in image files will be further obscured within the millions of pictures
and other images posted and transmitted daily. Facebook is known to alter and
compress uploaded images so they use minimum space and bandwidth when displayed
on Facebook pages. The compression process generally disrupts attempts to use
Facebook for image steganography. This paper explores a method to minimize the
disruption so JPEG images can be used as steganography carriers on Facebook.
