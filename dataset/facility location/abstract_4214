Recently Anishetty, Majumdar and Sharatchandra have proposed a way of
characterizing topologically non-trivial configurations for 2+1-dimensional
Yang-Mills theory in a local and manifestly gauge invariant manner. Here we
develop criteria to locate such objects in lattice gauge theory and find them
in numerical simulations.
