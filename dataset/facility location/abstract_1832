We report a comprehensive set of results for B-meson heavy-to-light
transition form factors calculated using a truncation of, and expression for,
the transition amplitudes in which all elements are motivated by the study of
Dyson-Schwinger equations in QCD. In this relativistic approach, which realises
confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, all physical values of
momentum transfer in the transition form factors are simultaneously accessible.
Our results can be useful in the analysis and correlation of the large body of
data being accumulated at extant facilities, and thereby in probing the
Standard Model and beyond.
