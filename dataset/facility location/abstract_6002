We describe tap tips, a technique for providing touch-screen target location
hints. Tap tips are lightweight in that they are non-modal, appear only when
needed, require a minimal number of user gestures, and do not add to the
standard touchscreen gesture vocabulary. We discuss our implementation of tap
tips in an electronic guidebook system and some usability test results.
