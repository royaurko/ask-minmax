In this study we analyze one year of anonymized telecommunications data for
over one million customers from a large European cellphone operator, and we
investigate the relationship between people's calls and their physical
location. We discover that more than 90% of users who have called each other
have also shared the same space (cell tower), even if they live far apart.
Moreover, we find that close to 70% of users who call each other frequently (at
least once per month on average) have shared the same space at the same time -
an instance that we call co-location. Co-locations appear indicative of
coordination calls, which occur just before face-to-face meetings. Their number
is highly predictable based on the amount of calls between two users and the
distance between their home locations - suggesting a new way to quantify the
interplay between telecommunications and face-to-face interactions.
