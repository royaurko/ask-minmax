In the present work we investigate the properties of 18 embedded clusters
(ECs). The sample includes 11 previously known clusters and we report the
discovery of 7 ECs on WISE images, thus complementing our recent list of 437
new clusters. The main goal is to use such clusters to shed new light on the
Galactic structure by tracing the spiral arms with cluster distances. Our
results favour a four-armed spiral pattern tracing three arms,
Sagitarius-Carina, Perseus, and the Outer arm. The Sagitarius-Carina spiral arm
is probed in the borderline of the third and fourth quadrants at a distance
from the Galactic centre of $d_1\sim6.4$ kpc adopting $R_{\odot}=7.2$ kpc, or
$d_2\sim7.2$ kpc for $R_{\odot}=8.0$ kpc. Most ECs in our sample are located in
the Perseus arm that is traced in the second and third quadrants and appear to
be at Galactocentric distances in the range $d_1=9-10.5$ kpc or $d_2=9.8-11.3$
kpc. Dolidze 25, Bochum 2, and Camargo 445 are located in the Outer arm that
extends along the second and third Galactic quadrants with a distance from the
Galactic centre in the range of $d_1=12.5-14.5$ kpc or $d_2=13.5-15.5$ kpc. We
find further evidence that in the Galaxy ECs are predominantly located within
the thin disc and along spiral arms. They are excellent tools for tracing these
Galactic features and therefore new searches for ECs can contribute to a better
understanding of the Galactic structure. We also report an EC aggregate located
in the Perseus arm.
