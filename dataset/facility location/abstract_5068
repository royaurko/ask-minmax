Borromean nuclear cluster structures are expected at the corresponding
driplines. We locate the regions in the nuclear chart with the most promising
constituents, it being protons and alpha-particles and investigate in details
the properties of the possible borromean two-alpha systems in medium heavy
nuclei. We find in all cases that the alpha-particles are located at the
surface of the core-nucleus as dictated by Coulomb and centrifugal barriers.
The two lowest three-body bound states resemble a slightly contracted
$^{8}\text{Be}$ nucleus outside the core. The next two excited states have more
complex structures but with strong components of linear configurations with the
core in the middle. Alpha-removal cross sections would be enhanced with
specific signatures for these two different types of structures. The even-even
borromean two-alpha nucleus, $^{142}$Ba, is specifically investigated and
predicted to have $^{134}\text{Te}-\alpha-\alpha$ structure in its ground state
and low-lying spectrum.
