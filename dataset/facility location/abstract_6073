The thermodynamic singularities of QCD in the plane of complex baryo-chemical
potential mu are studied. Predictions are made using scaling and universality
arguments in the vicinity of the massless quark limit. The results are
illustrated by a calculation of complex mu singularities in a random matrix
model at finite temperature. Implications for lattice QCD simulations aimed at
locating the QCD critical point are discussed.
