Within the t-t'-J model, the asymmetry of the electron spectrum and
quasiparticle dispersion in hole-doped and electron-doped cuprates is
discussed. It is shown that the quasiparticle dispersions of both hole-doped
and electron-doped cuprates exhibit the flat band around the (\pi,0) point
below the Fermi energy. The lowest energy states are located at the
(\pi/2,\pi/2) point for the hole doping, while they appear at the (\pi,0) point
in the electron-doped case due to the electron-hole asymmetry. Our results also
show that the unusual behavior of the electron spectrum and quasiparticle
dispersion is intriguingly related to the strong coupling between the electron
quasiparticles and collective magnetic excitations.
