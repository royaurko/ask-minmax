We present the numu to nue appearance and the numu disappearance results,
using a total of 1.43 x 10^{20} protons on target collected with the T2K
experiment. T2K is long baseline neutrino experiment in Japan with detectors
located at J-PARC, Tokai, and at Kamioka in the Gifu Prefecture, situated 295
km away from J-PARC. The muon neutrino beam is produced and measured at the
near detectors at J-PARC whilst the neutrino rates after oscillation are
measured with the Super-Kamiokande detector, at Kamioka. A total of six events
pass all the selection criteria for numu to nue oscillations at the far
detector Super-Kamiokande, leading to 0.03(0.04) < sin^2 2theta_{13} <
0.28(0.34) for deltaCP = 0 and normal (inverted) hierarchy at 90% C.L. The numu
disappearance analysis excludes no oscillations at 4.3 sigma. At 90% C.L., the
best fit values are sin^2 2theta_{23} > 0.84 and 2.1 x 10^{-3} < Delta m^2_{23}
(eV^2) < 3.1 x 10^{-3}. Finally, we present an overview of the T2K plans from
2011 onwards.
