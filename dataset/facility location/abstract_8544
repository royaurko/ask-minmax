We report the discovery of pulsed X-ray emission from the compact source 1E
1841-045, using data obtained with the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and
Astrophysics. The X-ray source is located in the center of the small-diameter
supernova remnant (SNR) Kes 73 and is very likely to be the compact
stellar-remnant of the supernova which formed Kes 73. The X-rays are pulsed
with a period of ~ 11.8 s, and a sinusoidal modulation of roughly 30 %. We
interpret this modulation to be the rotation period of an embedded neutron
star, and as such would be the longest spin period for an isolated neutron star
to-date. This is especially remarkable since the surrounding SNR is very young,
at ~ 2000 yr old. We suggest that the observed characteristics of this object
are best understood within the framework of a neutron star with an enormous
dipolar magnetic field, B ~ 8x10^14 G.
