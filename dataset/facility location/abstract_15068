We have measured the absolute proper motion of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal
galaxy from a combination of photographic plate material and HST WFPC2 data
that provide a time baseline of up to 50 years. The extragalactic reference
frame consists of 8 QSO images and 48 galaxies. The absolute proper motion is
mu_alpha cos(delta) = 0.59 +-0.16 mas/yr and mu_delta = -0.15 +- 0.16 mas/yr.
The corresponding orbit of Fornax is polar, with an eccentricity of 0.27, and a
radial period of 4.5 Gyr. Fornax's current location is near pericenter. The
direction of the motion of Fornax supports the notion that Fornax belongs to
the Fornax-LeoI-LeoII-Sculptor-Sextans stream as hypothesized by Lynden-Bell
(1976, 1982) and Majewski (1994).
  According to our orbit determination, Fornax crossed the Magellanic plane
\~190 Myr ago, a time that coincides with the termination of the star-formation
process in Fornax. We propose that ram-pressure stripping due to the passage of
Fornax through a gaseous medium denser than the typical intragalactic medium
left behind from the LMC may have caused the end of star formation in Fornax.
The excess, anomalous clouds within the South Galactic pole region of the
Magellanic Stream whose origin has long been debated in the literature as
constituents of either the Magellanic Stream or of the extragalactic Sculptor
group, are found to lie along the orbit of Fornax. We speculate that these
clouds are stripped material from Fornax as the dwarf crossed the Magellanic
Clouds' orbit.
