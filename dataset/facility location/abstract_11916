This paper presents experimental requirements to determine the neutrino mass
hierarchy using reactor neutrinos. The detector shall be located at a baseline
around 58 km from the reactor(s) to measure the energy spectrum of electron
antineutrinos ($\bar{\nu}_e$) precisely. By applying Fourier cosine and sine
transform to the L/E spectrum, features of the neutrino mass hierarchy can be
extracted from the $|\Delta{m}^2_{31}|$ and $|\Delta{m}^2_{32}|$ oscillations.
To determine the neutrino mass hierarchy above 90% probability, requirements to
the baseline, the energy resolution, the energy scale uncertainty, the detector
mass and the event statistics are studied at different values of
$\sin^2(2\theta_{13})$
