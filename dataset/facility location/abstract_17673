Sky conditions in the remote, dry north-western interior of South Africa are
now the subject of considerable interest in view of the imminent construction
of numerous solar power plants in this area. Furthermore, the part of this
region in which the core of the SKA is to be located (which includes SALT) has
been declared an Astronomical Advantage Zone, for which sky brightness
monitoring will now be mandatory. In this project we seek to characterise the
sky brightness profile under a variety of atmospheric conditions. Key factors
are of course the lunar phase and altitude, but in addition the sky brightness
is also significantly affected by the atmospheric aerosol loading, as that
influences light beam scattering. In this paper we chose to investigate the sky
characteristics soon after the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991, which
resulted in huge ash masses reaching the stratosphere (where they affected
solar irradiance for several years). We re-reduced photometric sky measurements
from the South African Astronomical Observatory archives (and originally
obtained by us) in different wavelengths and in a variety of directions. We use
this data explore relationships between the aerosol loading and the sky
brightness in a range of conditions, including several post-Pinatubo phases and
during the passage of biomass burning induced haze and dust clouds. We use this
data to explore the impact of our findings on the applicability of light
scattering models and light scatterer properties.
