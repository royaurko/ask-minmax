Recent observational evidence suggests that the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy
represents the only major ongoing accretion event in the Galactic halo,
accounting for the majority of stellar debris identified there. This paper
summarizes the recent discovery of another potential Milky Way accretion event,
the Canis Major dwarf galaxy. This dwarf satellite galaxy is found to lie just
below the Galactic plane and appears to be on an equatorial orbit. Unlike
Sagittarius, which is contributing to the Galactic halo, the location and
eventual demise of Canis Major suggests that it represents a building block of
the thick disk.
