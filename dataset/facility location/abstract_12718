The interaction of high energy cosmic rays with the Earth's atmosphere
produces extensive air showers of secondary particles with a large muon
component. By exploiting the sensitivity of neutrino telescopes to high energy
muons, it is possible to use these detectors for precision cosmic ray studies.
The high rate of cosmic-ray muon events provides a high-statistics data sample
that can be used to look for anisotropy in the arrival directions of the parent
particles at the per-mille level.
  This paper reports on the observation of anisotropy in the cosmic ray data
collected with the IceCube neutrino telescope in the 20-400 TeV energy range at
multiple angular scales. New data from the IceTop air shower array, located on
the ice surface above IceCube, shows an anisotropy that is consistent with the
high-energy IceCube results. The sensitivity of IceTop to all the components of
the extensive air shower will allow us to explore in more detail the
characteristics of the primary cosmic rays associated with the observed
anisotropy.
