An extremely deep X-ray survey (about 1 Ms) of the Hubble Deep Field North
and its environs (about 450 arcmin^2) has been performed with the Advanced CCD
Imaging Spectrometer on board the Chandra X-ray Observatory. This is one of the
two deepest X-ray surveys ever performed; for point sources near the aim point
it reaches 0.5-2.0 keV and 2-8 keV flux limits of 3 x 10^{-17} erg/cm^2/s and 2
x 10^{-16} erg/cm^2/s, respectively. Here we provide source catalogs along with
details of the observations, data reduction, and technical analysis. Observing
conditions, such as background, were excellent for almost all of the exposure.
We have detected 370 distinct point sources: 360 in the 0.5-8.0 keV band, 325
in the 0.5-2.0 keV band, 265 in the 2-8 keV band, and 145 in the 4-8 keV band.
Two new Chandra sources in the HDF-N itself are reported and discussed. Source
positions are accurate to within 0.6-1.7 arcsec (at 90% confidence) depending
mainly on the off-axis angle. We also detect two highly significant extended
X-ray sources and several other likely extended X-ray sources. We present basic
number count results for sources located near the center of the field. Source
densities of 7100^{+1100}_{-940} deg^{-2} (at 4.2 x 10^{-17} erg/cm^2/s) and
4200^{+670}_{-580} deg^{-2} (at 3.8 x 10^{-16} erg/cm^2/s) are observed in the
soft and hard bands, respectively.
