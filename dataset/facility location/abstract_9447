We present the first phase-coherent measurement of a braking index for the
young, energetic rotation-powered pulsar PSR J1846-0258. This 324 ms pulsar is
located at the center of the supernova remnant Kes 75 and has a characteristic
age of tau_c = 723 years, a spin-down energy of 8.3x10^{36}erg/s, and inferred
magnetic field of 4.9x10^{13} G. Two independent phase-coherent timing
solutions are derived which together span 5.5 yr of data obtained with the
Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. In addition, a partially phase-coherent timing
analysis confirms the fully phase-coherent result. The measured value of the
braking index, n=2.65+/-0.01, is significantly less than 3, the value expected
from magnetic dipole radiation, implying another physical process must
contribute to the pulsar's rotational evolution. Assuming the braking index has
been constant since birth, we place an upper limit on the spin-down age of
J1846-0258 of 884 yr, the smallest age estimate of any rotation-powered pulsar.
