An electron-proton/ion collider facility (eRHIC) is under consideration at
Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Such a new facility will require the
design and construction of a new optimized detector profiting from the
experience gained from the H1 and ZEUS detectors operated at the HERA collider
at DESY. The details of the design will be closely coupled to the design of the
interaction region, and thus to the machine development work in general. An
overview of the accelerator and detector design concepts will be provided.
