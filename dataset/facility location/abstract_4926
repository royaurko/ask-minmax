In this work, we propose the kernel Pitman-Yor process (KPYP) for
nonparametric clustering of data with general spatial or temporal
interdependencies. The KPYP is constructed by first introducing an infinite
sequence of random locations. Then, based on the stick-breaking construction of
the Pitman-Yor process, we define a predictor-dependent random probability
measure by considering that the discount hyperparameters of the
Beta-distributed random weights (stick variables) of the process are not
uniform among the weights, but controlled by a kernel function expressing the
proximity between the location assigned to each weight and the given
predictors.
