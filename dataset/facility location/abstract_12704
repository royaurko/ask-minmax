We have mapped in the 2.7 mm continuum and 12CO with the PdBI the IR-dark
"tail" that crosses the IC 1396N globule from south to north, and is the most
extincted part of this cloud. These observations have allowed us to distinguish
all possible associations of molecular hydrogen emission features by revealing
the presence of two well-collimated low-mass protostellar outflows at the
northern part of the globule. The outflows are located almost in the plane of
the sky and are colliding with each other towards the position of a strong 2.12
microns H2 line emission feature.
