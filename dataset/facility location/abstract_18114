Instabilities and long term shifts in seasons, whether induced by natural
drivers or human activities, pose great disruptive threats to ecological,
agricultural, and social systems. Here, we propose, quantify, and explore two
fundamental markers of seasonal variations: the Summer and Winter
Teletherms---the on-average annual dates of the hottest and coldest days of the
year. We analyse daily temperature extremes recorded at 1218 stations across
the contiguous United States from 1853--2012 to obtain estimates of the
Teletherms, and to characterize their spatial and temporal dynamics. We observe
substantial regional variation with the Summer Teletherm falling up to 90 days
after the Summer Solstice, and 50 days for the Winter Teletherm after the
Winter Solstice, and that in many locations, the Teletherm is better described
as one or more sequences of dates---the Teletherm Period. We show Teletherm
temporal dynamics are substantive with clear and in some cases dramatic changes
moving across broad regions, suggesting links to climate change. We also
compare recorded daily temperature extremes with output from two weather models
finding considerable though relatively unbiased error.
