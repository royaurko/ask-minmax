We show data from a new type of detector that can be used to determine
neutron flux, energy distribution, and direction of neutron motion for both
fast and thermal neutrons. Many neutron detectors are plagued by large
backgrounds from x-rays and gamma rays, and most current neutron detectors lack
single-event energy sensitivity or any information on neutron directionality.
Even the best detectors are limited by cosmic ray neutron backgrounds. All
applications (neutron scattering and radiography, measurements of solar and
cosmic ray neutron flux, measurements of neutron interaction cross sections,
monitoring of neutrons at nuclear facilities, oil exploration, and searches for
fissile weapons of mass destruction) will benefit from the improved neutron
detection sensitivity and improved measurements of neutron properties made
possible by this detector. The detector is free of backgrounds from x-rays,
gamma rays, beta particles, relativistic singely charged particles and cosmic
ray neutrons. It is sensitive to thermal neutrons, fission neutrons, and high
energy neutrons, with detection features distinctive for each energy range. It
is capable of determining the location of a source of fission neutrons based on
characteristics of elastic scattering of neutrons by helium nuclei. The
detector we have constructed could identify one gram of reactor grade
plutonium, one meter away, with less than one minute of observation time.
