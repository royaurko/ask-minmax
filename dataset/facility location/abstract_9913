We present a high-resolution computer simulation study of the equation of
state of ST2 water, evaluating the liquid-state properties at 2718 state
points, and precisely locating the liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP)
occurring in this model. We are thereby able to reveal the interconnected set
of density anomalies, spinodal instabilities and response function extrema that
occur in the vicinity of a LLCP for the case of a realistic, off-lattice model
of a liquid with local tetrahedral order. In particular, we unambiguously
identify a density minimum in the liquid state, define its relationship to
other anomalies, and show that it arises due to the approach of the liquid
structure to a defect-free random tetrahedral network of hydrogen bonds.
