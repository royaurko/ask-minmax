We study the first passage statistics to adsorbing boundaries of a Brownian
motion in bounded two-dimensional domains of different shapes and
configurations of the adsorbing and reflecting boundaries. From extensive
numerical analysis we obtain the probability P(\omega) distribution of the
random variable \omega=\tau_1/(\tau_1+\tau_2), which is a measure for how
similar the first passage times \tau_1 and \tau_2 are of two independent
realisations of a Brownian walk starting at the same location. We construct a
chart for each domain, determining whether P(\omega) represents a unimodal,
bell-shaped form, or a bimodal, M-shaped behaviour. While in the former case
the mean first passage time (MFPT) is a valid characteristic of the first
passage behaviour, in the latter case it is an insufficient measure for the
process. Strikingly we find a distinct turnover between the two modes of
P(\omega), characteristic for the domain shape and the respective location of
absorbing and reflective boundaries. Our results demonstrate that large
fluctuations of the first passage times may occur frequently in two-dimensional
domains, rendering quite vague the general use of the MFPT as a robust measure
of the actual behaviour even in bounded domains, in which all moments of the
first passage distribution exist.
