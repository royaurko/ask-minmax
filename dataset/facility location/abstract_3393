The reactions gamma p --> K+ Lambda and gamma p --> K+ Sigma0 were measured
in the energy range from threshold up to a photon energy of 2.6 GeV. The data
were taken with the SAPHIR detector at the electron stretcher facility, ELSA.
Results on cross sections and hyperon polarizations are presented as a function
of kaon production angle and photon energy. The total cross section for Lambda
production rises steeply with energy close to threshold, whereas the Sigma0
cross section rises slowly to a maximum at about E_gamma = 1.45 GeV. Cross
sections together with their angular decompositions into Legendre polynomials
suggest contributions from resonance production for both reactions. In general,
the induced polarization of Lambda has negative values in the kaon forward
direction and positive values in the backward direction. The magnitude varies
with energy. The polarization of Sigma0 follows a similar angular and energy
dependence as that of Lambda, but with opposite sign.
