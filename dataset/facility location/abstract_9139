Magnetic field is believed to play an important role in the collapse of a
molecular cloud. In particular, due to the properties of magnetic forces,
collapse should be easier along magnetic field lines, as supported by the
large-scale sheet-like structure of the Taurus giant molecular cloud for
instance. Here we investigate whether such a prefered orientation for collapse
is present at a much smaller scale, that of individual objects. We use recent
high-angular resolution images of T Tauri stars located in the Taurus
star-forming region to find the orientation of the symmetry axis of each
star+jet+disk system and compare it to that of the local magnetic field. We
find that i) the orientations of the symmetry axis of T Tauri stars are not
random with respect to the magnetic field, and ii) that young stars that are
associated to a jet or an outflow are oriented very differently from those
which do not have a detected outflow. We present some implications of this
puzzling new result.
