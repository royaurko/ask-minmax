The CHARA Array is a six 1-m telescope optical/IR interferometric array
located on Mount Wilson California, designed and built by the Center for High
Angular Resolution Astronomy of Georgia State University. In this paper we
describe the main elements of the Array hardware and software control systems
as well as the data reduction methods currently being used. Our plans for
upgrades in the near future are also described.
