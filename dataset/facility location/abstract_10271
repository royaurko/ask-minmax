We propose extension of the numerical method to model effect of Bose-Einstein
correlations (BEC) observed in hadronization processes which allows for
calculations not only correlation functions $C_2(Q_{inv})$ (one-dimensional)
but also corresponding to them $C_2(Q_{x,y,z})$ (i.e., three-dimensional). The
method is based on the bunching of identical bosonic particles in elementary
emitting cells (EEC) in phase space in manner leading to proper Bose-Einstein
form of distribution of energy (this was enough to calculate $C_2(Q_{inv})$).
To obtain also $C_2(Q_{x,y,z})$ one has to add to it also symmetrization of the
multiparticle wave function to properly correlate space-time locations of
produced particles with their energy-momentum characteristics.
