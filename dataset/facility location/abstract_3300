Multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) instruments, such as the Two-degree Field
(2dF) facility of the Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO), have facilitated
large-scale redshift surveys. Yet despite their acclaim, instrument design has
been suspected of introducing subtle selection effects into surveys.
Investigation into these selection effects has been overshadowed by instrument
complexity. We identify the field configuration algorithm (FCA) used to select
targets for observation as mainly responsible for such effects. A FCA can
imprint artificial structure on observed target distributions, which may accrue
over large angular scales, potentially to the detriment of statistical analyses
applied to such surveys. We present here a new FCA developed for 2dF that is
based on simulated annealing (SA), a generic method commonly used to solve
constrained optimisation problems. We generate synthetic fields and utilise
mock 2dF volumes to contrast the behaviour of previous strategies with the SA
FCA. The angular two-point correlation function and other sensitive techniques
reveal that the new FCA achieves unprecedented sampling uniformity and target
yield with improved target priority handling and observational flexibility over
current FCAs. The SA FCA is generic enough to be used by current 2dF-like and
potentially next-generation MOS instruments with little modification.
