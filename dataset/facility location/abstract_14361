This paper presents 28 GHz and 73 GHz millimeter- wave propagation
measurements performed in a typical office environment using a 400
Megachip-per-second broadband sliding correlator channel sounder and highly
directional steerable 15 dBi (30 degrees beamwidth) and 20 dBi (15 degrees
beamwidth) horn antennas. Power delay profiles were acquired for 48
transmitter-receiver location combinations over distances ranging from 3.9 m to
45.9 m with maximum transmit powers of 24 dBm and 12.3 dBm at 28 GHz and 73
GHz, respectively. Directional and omnidirectional path loss models and RMS
delay spread statistics are presented for line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight
environments for both co- and cross-polarized antenna configurations. The LOS
omnidirectional path loss exponents were 1.1 and 1.3 at 28 GHz and 73 GHz, and
2.7 and 3.2 in NLOS at 28 GHz and 73 GHz, respectively, for
vertically-polarized antennas. The mean directional RMS delay spreads were 18.4
ns and 13.3 ns, with maximum values of 193 ns and 288 ns at 28 GHz and 73 GHz,
respectively.
