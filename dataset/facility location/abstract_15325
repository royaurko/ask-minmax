We present Chandra and XMM observations of 12 bright (f(2-10 keV)
 > 10^-13 cgs) sources from the ASCA SHEEP (Search for the High Energy
 Extragalactic Population) survey. Most of these have been either not observed
or not detected previously with the ROSAT mission and therefore they constitute
a sample biased towards hard sources. The Chandra observations are important in
locating with accuracy the optical counterpart of the X-ray sources. Optical
spectroscopic observations show that our sample is associated with both
narrow-line (NL) (six objects), and
 Broad-Line (BL) AGN (five objects) with one source remaining unidentified.
 Our sources cover the redshift range 0.04 to 1.29 spanning luminosities from
10^42 to 10^45 cgs (2-10 keV). The NL sources have preferentially lower
redshift (and luminosity) compared with the BL ones. This can be most easily
explained in a model where the NL AGN are intrinsically less luminous than the
BL ones in line with the results of Steffen et al.
 The X-ray spectral fittings show a roughly equal number of obscured (N_H>10^22
cgs) and unobscured (N_H<10^22 cgs) sources.
 There is a clear tendency for obscured sources to be associated with
 NL AGN and unobscured sources with BL ones. However, there is a marked
exception with the highest obscuring column observed at a BL AGN at a redshift
of z=0.5.
