We present the first unambiguous evidence of a broad (Gaussian width ~330 eV)
component of the iron K-alpha fluorescent emission line in the X-ray obscured
Narrow Line Seyfert 1 Galaxy NGC5506. This is the main results of a
spectroscopic monitoring campaign on this source performed with the XMM-Newton
observatory between February 2001 and January 2009. The broad line lacks
extreme redwards skewness. If modelled with a relativistic component, the
profile of the line is consistent with a flat emissivity radial dependence
(alpha~1.9). The disk inclination (~40 degrees) is nominally larger then
typically observed in unobscured AGN, in agreement with most measurements of
broadened iron lines in Seyfert 2 galaxies. The quality of the data allows us
to decompose the full iron emission line complex, and to study its long-term
(timescales of weeks to years) variability pattern. The intensity of the
neutral and narrow iron K-alpha core remains constant during the monitoring
campaign. This indicates that the optically thick gas responsible for the
non-relativistic reprocessing of the primary AGN continuum in NGC5506 is
probably located in the torus rather than in the optical Broad Line Region.
