The Princeton IQU Experiment (PIQUE) and the Cosmic Anisotropy Polarization
MAPper (CAPMAP) are experiments designed to measure the polarization of the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) on sub-degree scales in an area within 1
degree of the North Celestial Pole using heterodyne correlation polarimeters
and off-axis telescopes located in central New Jersey. PIQUE produced the
tightest limit on the CMB polarization prior to its detection by DASI, while
CAPMAP has recently detected polarization at l~1000. The experimental methods
and instrumentation for these two projects are described in detail with
emphasis on the particular challenges involved in measuring the tiny polarized
component of the CMB.
