We consider the astrophysical implications of the diffusion equation solution
for Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) in the expanding universe, obtained
in paper I (V.Berezinsky & A.Gazizov, ApJ 643 (2006) 8). The UHECR spectra are
calculated in a model with sources located in vertices of the cubic grid with a
linear constant (source separation) d. The calculations are performed for
various magnetic field configurations (B_c,l_c), where l_c is the basic scale
of the turbulence and B_c is the coherent magnetic field on this scale. The
main purpose of these calculations is to demonstrate the validity of the
solution obtained in paper I and to compare this solution with the Syrovatsky
solution used in previous works. The Syrovatsky solution must be necessarily
embedded in the static cosmological model. The formal comparison of the two
solutions with all parameters being fixed identically reveals the appreciable
discrepancies between two spectra. These discrepancies are less if in both
models the different sets of the best-fit parameters are used.
