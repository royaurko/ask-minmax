Observations of the eclipsing dwarf nova IP Peg during outburst reveal metal
lines in emission, such as Mg II 4481 A. Analysis using Doppler tomography
locates emission of helium and metal lines on the inner Roche lobe of the
secondary star. Such multi-line Roche-lobe imaging presents a new tool in
mapping the red star's ionization structure.
