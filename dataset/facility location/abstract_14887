We demonstrate that there is a clear statistical correlation between the
(X,Y,Z,V_r) phase-space distribution of the outer halo Galactic globular
clusters (having 10 kpc <= R_GC <= 40 kpc) and the orbital path of the
Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph), as derived by Ibata & Lewis. At
least 4 of the sample of 35 globular clusters in this distance range were
formerly members of the Sgr galaxy (at the 95 % confidence level), and are now
distributed along the Sgr Stream, a giant tidal structure that surrounds the
Milky Way. This is the first instance that a statistically significant
structure associated with the Sgr dSph has been detected in the globular
cluster population of the Galactic halo. Together with the four well-known
globular clusters that are located near the center of this tidally-disrupting
dwarf galaxy, these clusters constitute ~ 20 % of the population of outer halo
(R_GC >= 10 kpc) clusters. The Sgr dSph was therefore not only an important
contributor to the halo field star population, but it also had a significant
role in the building-up of the globular cluster system of the Milky Way.
