In this paper we give a full classification of all pentapods with mobility 2,
where neither all platform anchor points nor all base anchor points are located
on a line. Therefore this paper solves the famous Borel-Bricard problem for
2-dimensional motions beside the excluded case of five collinear points with
spherical trajectories. But even for this special case we present three new
types as a side-result. Based on our study of pentapods, we also give a
complete list of all non-architecturally singular hexapods with 2-dimensional
self-motions.
