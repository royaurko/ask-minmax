Our aim is to identify and classify mean-motion resonances (MMRs) for the
coplanar circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) for mass ratios between
0.10 and 0.50. Our methods include the maximum Lyapunov exponent, which is used
as an indicator for the location of the resonances, the Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) used for determining what kind of resonances are present, and the
inspection of the orbital elements to classify the periodicity. We show that
the 2:1 resonance occurs the most frequently. Among other resonances, the 3:1
resonance is the second most common, and furthermore both 3:2 and 5:3
resonances occur more often than the 4:1 resonance. Moreover, the resonances in
the coplanar CR3BP are classified based on the behaviour of the orbits. We show
that orbital stability is ensured for high values of resonance (i.e., high
ratios) where only a single resonance is present. The resonances attained are
consistent with the previously established resonances for the Solar System,
i.e., specifically, in regards to the asteroid belt. Previous work employed
digital filtering and Lyapunov characteristic exponents to determine
stochasticity of the eccentricity, which is found to be consistent with our
usage of Lyapunov exponents as an alternate approach based on varying the mass
ratio instead of the eccentricity. Our results are expected to be of principal
interest to future studies, including augmentations to observed or proposed
resonances, of extra-solar planets in binary stellar systems.
