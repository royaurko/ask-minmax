We present FUSE observations toward four stars in the LMC superbubble N70 and
compare these spectra to those of four comparison targets located in nearby
field and diffuse regions. The N70 sight lines show OVI 1032 absorption that is
consistently stronger than the comparison sight lines by ~60%. We attribute the
excess column density (logN_OVI=14.03 cm^-2) to hot gas within N70, potentially
the first detection of OVI associated with a superbubble. In a survey of 12 LMC
sight lines, Howk et al. (2002a) concluded that there was no correlation
between ISM morphology and N_OVI. We present a reanalysis of their measurements
combined with our own and find a clear difference between the superbubble and
field samples. The five superbubbles probed to date with FUSE show a
consistently higher mean N_OVI than the 12 non-superbubble sight lines, though
both samples show equivalent scatter from halo variability. Possible ionization
mechanisms for N70 are discussed, and we conclude that the observed OVI could
be the product of thermal conduction at the interface between the hot, X-ray
emitting gas inside the superbubble and the cooler, photoionized material
making up the shell seen prominently in Halpha. We calculate the total hydrogen
density n_H implied by our OVI measurements and find a value consistent with
expectations. Finally, we discuss emission-line observations of OVI from N70.
