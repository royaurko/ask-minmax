Electronic Geometry Textbook is a knowledge management system that manages
geometric textbook knowledge to enable users to construct and share dynamic
geometry textbooks interactively and efficiently. Based on a knowledge base
organizing and storing the knowledge represented in specific languages, the
system implements interfaces for maintaining the data representing that
knowledge as well as relations among those data, for automatically generating
readable documents for viewing or printing, and for automatically discovering
the relations among knowledge data. An interface has been developed for users
to create geometry textbooks with automatic checking, in real time, of the
consistency of the structure of each resulting textbook. By integrating an
external geometric theorem prover and an external dynamic geometry software
package, the system offers the facilities for automatically proving theorems
and generating dynamic figures in the created textbooks. This paper provides a
comprehensive account of the current version of Electronic Geometry Textbook.
