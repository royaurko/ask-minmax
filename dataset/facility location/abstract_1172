The purpose of this paper is to present some functionalities of the HyperPro
System. HyperPro is a hypertext tool which allows to develop Constraint Logic
Programming (CLP) together with their documentation. The text editing part is
not new and is based on the free software Thot. A HyperPro program is a Thot
document written in a report style. The tool is designed for CLP but it can be
adapted to other programming paradigms as well. Thot offers navigation and
editing facilities and synchronized static document views. HyperPro has new
functionalities such as document exportations, dynamic views (projections),
indexes and version management. Projection is a mechanism for extracting and
exporting relevant pieces of code program or of document according to specific
criteria. Indexes are useful to find the references and occurrences of a
relation in a document, i.e., where its predicate definition is found and where
a relation is used in other programs or document versions and, to translate
hyper-texts links into paper references. It still lack importation facilities.
