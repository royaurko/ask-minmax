Conical refraction occurs when a beam of light travels through an
appropriately cut biaxial crystal. By focussing the conically refracted beam
through a high numerical aperture microscope objective, conical refraction
optical tweezers can be created, allowing for particle manipulation in both
Raman spots and in the Lloyd/Poggendorff rings. We present a thorough
quantification of the trapping properties of such a beam, focussing on the trap
stiffness and how this varies with trap power and trapped particle location. We
show that the lower Raman spot can be thought of as a single-beam optical
gradient force trap, while radiation pressure dominates in the upper Raman
spot, leading to optical levitation rather than trapping. Particles in the
Lloyd/Poggendorff rings experience a lower trap stiffness than particles in the
lower Raman spot but benefit from rotational control.
