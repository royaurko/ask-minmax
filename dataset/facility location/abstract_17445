This paper provides a statistical characterization of the individual
achievable rates in bits/s/Hz and the spatial throughput of bipolar Poisson
wireless networks in bits/s/Hz/m$^2$. We assume that all transmitters have a
cognitive ability to know the distance to their receiver's closest interferers
so they can individually tune their coding rates to avoid outage events for
each spatial realization. Considering that the closest interferer approximates
the aggregate interference of all transmitters treated as noise, we derive
closed-form expressions for the probability density function of the achievable
rates under two decoding rules: treating interference as noise, and jointly
detecting the strongest interfering signals treating the others as noise. Based
on these rules and the bipolar model, we approximate the expected maximum
spatial throughput, showing the best performance of the latter decoding rule.
These results are also compared to the reference scenario where the
transmitters do not have cognitive ability, coding their messages at
predetermined rates that are chosen to optimize the expected spatial throughput
-- regardless of particular realizations -- which yields outages. We prove
that, when the same decoding rule and network density are considered, the
cognitive spatial throughput always outperforms the other option.
