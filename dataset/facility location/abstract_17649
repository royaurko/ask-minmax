Using the H$\alpha$ observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope at
Fuxian Solar Observatory, we focus on the fine structures of three confined
flares and the issue why all the three flares are confined instead of eruptive.
All the three confined flares take place successively at the same location and
have similar morphologies, so can be termed homologous confined flares. In the
simultaneous images obtained by the Solar Dynamics Observatory, many
large-scale coronal loops above the confined flares are clearly observed in
multi-wavelengths. At the pre-flare stage, two dipoles emerge near the negative
sunspot, and the dipolar patches are connected by small loops appearing as
arch-shaped H$\alpha$ fibrils. There exists a reconnection between the small
loops, and thus the H$\alpha$ fibrils change their configuration. The
reconnection also occurs between a set of emerging H$\alpha$ fibrils and a set
of pre-existing large loops, which are rooted in the negative sunspot, a nearby
positive patch, and some remote positive faculae, forming a typical
three-legged structure. During the flare processes, the overlying loops, some
of which are tracked by activated dark materials, do not break out. These
direct observations may illustrate the physical mechanism of confined flares,
i.e., magnetic reconnection between the emerging loops and the pre-existing
loops triggers flares and the overlying loops prevent the flares from being
eruptive.
