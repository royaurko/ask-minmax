Recent obserbations by Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope of gamma-ray pulsars
have revealed further details of the structure of the emission region. We
investigate the emission region for the multi-wavelength light curve using
outer gap model. We assume that gamma-ray and non-thermal X-ray photons are
emitted from a particle acceleration region in the outer magnetosphere, and
UV/optical photons originate above that region. We also assume that gamma-rays
are radiated only by outwardly moving particles, whereas the other photons are
produced by particles moving inward and outward. We parametrize the altitude of
the emission region. We find that the outer gap model can explain the
multi-wavelength pulse behavior. From observational fitting, we also find a
general tendency for the altitude of the gamma-ray emission region to depend on
the inclination angle. In particular, the emission region for low inclination
angle is required to be located in very low altitude, which corresponds to the
inner region within the last-open field line of rotating dipole in vacuum. This
model suggests a modification of statistics about observed gamma-ray pulsars.
