Research reactors host a wide range of activities that make use of the
intense neutron fluxes generated at these facilities. Recent interest in
performing measurements with relatively low event rates, e.g. reactor
antineutrino detection, at these facilities necessitates a detailed
understanding of background radiation fields. Both reactor-correlated and
naturally occurring background sources are potentially important, even at
levels well below those of importance for typical activities. Here we describe
a comprehensive series of background assessments at three high-power research
reactors, including $\gamma$-ray, neutron, and muon measurements. For each
facility we describe the characteristics and identify the sources of the
background fields encountered. The general understanding gained of background
production mechanisms and their relationship to facility features will prove
valuable for the planning of any sensitive measurement conducted therein.
