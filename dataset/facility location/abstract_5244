Thirteen targets with mass numbers from 58 to 238 were irradiated with the
antiproton beam from the Low Energy Antiproton Ring facility at CERN leading to
the formation of antiprotonic atoms of these heavy elements. The antiproton
capture at the end of an atomic cascade results in the production of more or
less excited residual nuclei. The targets were selected with the criterion that
both reaction products with one nucleon less than the proton and neutron number
of the target be radioactive. The yield of these radioactive products after
stopped-antiproton annihilation was determined using gamma-ray spectroscopy
techniques. This yield is related to the proton and neutron density in the
target nucleus at a radial distance corresponding to the antiproton
annihilation site. The experimental data clearly indicate the existence of a
neutron-rich nuclear periphery, a "neutron halo", strongly correlated with the
target neutron separation energy Bn and observed for targets with Bn < 10 MeV.
For two-target nuclei 106Cd and 144Sm, with larger neutron binding energies, a
proton-rich nuclear periphery was observed. Most of the experimental data are
in reasonable agreement with calculations based on current antiproton-nucleus
and pion-nucleus interaction potentials and on nuclear densities deduced with
the help of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approach. This approach was, however,
unable to account for the 106Cd and 144Sm results.
