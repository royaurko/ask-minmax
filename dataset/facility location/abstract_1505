The soon-to-be-launched Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) shall
produce image data with an a-posteriori pointing knowledge of 1.4 arcsec (1
sigma radial) with a goal of 1.2 arcsec in the International Celestial
Reference System (ICRS). To perform robust image coaddition, mosaic generation,
extraction and position determination of faint sources, the pointing will need
to be refined to better than a few-tenths of an arcsecond. We use a
linear-sparse matrix solver to find a "global-minimization" of all relative
image offsets in a mosaic from which refined pointings and orientations can be
computed. This paper summarizes the pointing-refinement algorithm and presents
the results of testing on simulated data.
