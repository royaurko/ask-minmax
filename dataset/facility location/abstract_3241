RAVE (RAdial Velocity Experiment) is an ambitious program to conduct an
all-sky survey (complete to V = 16) to measure the radial velocities,
metallicities and abundance ratios of 50 million stars using the 1.2-m UK
Schmidt Telescope of the Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO), together with a
northern counterpart, over the period 2006 - 2010. The survey will represent a
giant leap forward in our understanding of our own Milky Way galaxy, providing
a vast stellar kinematic database three orders of magnitude larger than any
other survey proposed for this coming decade. RAVE will offer the first truly
representative inventory of stellar radial velocities for all major components
of the Galaxy.
  The survey is made possible by recent technical innovations in multi-fiber
spectroscopy; specifically the development of the 'Echidna' concept at the AAO
for positioning fibers using piezo-electric ball/spines. A 1m-class Schmidt
telescope equipped with an Echidna fiber-optic positioner and suitable
spectrograph would be able to obtain spectra for over 20 000 stars per clear
night.
  Although the main survey cannot begin until 2006, a key component of the RAVE
survey is a pilot program of 100 000 stars which may be carried out using the
existing 6dF facility in unscheduled bright time over the period 2003--2005.
