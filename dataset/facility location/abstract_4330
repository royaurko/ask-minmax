An integro-differential equation describing the angular distribution of beams
is analyzed for a medium with random inhomogeneities. Beams are trapped because
inhomogeneities give rise to wave localization at random locations and random
times. The expressions obtained for the mean square deviation from the initial
direction of beam propagation generalize the "3/2 law".
