A facility for sub-nanosecond time-resolved (pump-probe) infrared
spectroscopy has been developed at the National Synchrotron Light Source of
Brookhaven National Laboratory. A mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser produces 2 ps
duration, tunable near-IR pump pulses synchronized to probe pulses from a
synchrotron storage ring. The facility is unique on account of the broadband
infrared from the synchrotron, which allows the entire spectral range from 2
cm-1 (0.25 meV) to 20,000 cm-1 (2.5 eV) to be probed. A temporal resolution of
200 ps, limited by the infrared synchrotron-pulse duration, is achieved. A
maximum time delay of 170 ns is available without gating the infrared detector.
To illustrate the performance of the facility, a measurement of electron-hole
recombination dynamics for an HgCdTe semiconductor film in the far- and mid
infrared range is presented.
