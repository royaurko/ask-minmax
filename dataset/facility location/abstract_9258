High resolution G-band images of the interior of a supergranulation cell show
ubiquitous Bright Points (some 0.3 BPs per Mm^2). They are located in
intergranular lanes and often form chains of elongated blobs whose smallest
dimension is at the resolution limit (135 km on the Sun). Most of them live for
a few minutes, having peak intensities from 0.8 to 1.8 times the mean
photospheric intensity. These BPs are probably tracing intense magnetic
concentrations, whose existence has been inferred in spectro-polarimetric
measurements. Our finding provides a new convenient tool for the study of the
inter-network magnetism, so far restricted to the interpretation weak
polarimetric signals.
