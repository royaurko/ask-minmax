We estimate the spatial locations of sources of the the observed features in
the Fermi-LAT photon spectrum at $E_\gamma=110$ and $E_\gamma=130$ GeV. We
determine whether they are consistent with emission from a single source, as
would be expected in their interpretation as $\gamma\gamma$ and $\gamma Z$
lines from dark matter annhiliation, as well as whether they are consistent
with a dark matter halo positioned at the center of the galaxy. We take
advantage of the per-photon measured incident angle in reconstructing the line
features. In addition, we use a data-driven background model rather than making
the assumption of a feature-less background. We localize the sources of the
features at 110 and 130 GeV. Assuming an Einasto (NFW) density model we find
the 130 GeV line to be offset from the galactic center by 285 (280) pc, the 110
GeV line by 60 (30) pc with a large relative separation of 220 (240) pc.
However, we find this displacement of each source from the galactic center, as
well as their relative displacement to be statistically consistent with a
single Einasto or NFW dark matter halo at the center of the galaxy.
