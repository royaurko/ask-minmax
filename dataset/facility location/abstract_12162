Local multipoint distribution system (LMDS) uses cellular-like network
architecture of microwave radios placed at the client's location and at the
company's base station to deliver fixed services, mainly telephony, video and
Internet access. The use of time-division multiple access (TDMA) and FDMA
(frequency DMA) technology allows multiple customers within a 3-5 mile coverage
radius to share the same radio channel. Customers can receive data rates
between 64kbps to 155Mbps. LMDS was conceived as a broadband, fixed wireless,
point-to-multipoint technology for utilization in the last mile. Throughput
capacity and reliable distance of the link depends on common radio link
constraints and the modulation method used - either phase-shift keying or
amplitude modulation. In general deployment links of up to 5 miles (8 km) from
the base station are possible, but distance is typically limited to about 1.5
miles due to rain fading attenuation constraints. Point-to-point systems are
also capable of using the LMDS frequencies and can reach slightly farther
distances due to increased antenna gain.LMDS uses a scalable architecture
combined with industry standards to ensure service can be expanded as customer
demand increases.
