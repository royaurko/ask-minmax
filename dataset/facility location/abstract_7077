We study three convolutions of polynomials that are inspired by free
probability. We define these to be the expected characteristic polynomials of
certain random matrices. The symmetric additive and multiplicative convolutions
have been studied for a century. The asymmetric additive convolution, and the
connection of all of them with random matrices, appears new. We prove that
these convolutions produce real rooted polynomials and provide strong bounds on
the locations of the roots of these polynomials.
