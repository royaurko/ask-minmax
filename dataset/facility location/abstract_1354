A dominating set of a graph $G$ is a set $D$ of vertices of $G$ such that
every vertex outside $D$ is adjacent to a vertex in $D$. A locating-dominating
set of $G$ is a dominating set $D$ of $G$ with the additional property that
every two distinct vertices outside $D$ have distinct neighbors in $D$; that
is, for distinct vertices $u$ and $v$ outside $D$, $N(u) \cap D \ne N(v) \cap
D$ where $N(u)$ denotes the open neighborhood of $u$. A graph is twin-free if
every two distinct vertices have distinct open and closed neighborhoods. The
location-domination number of $G$, denoted $\gamma_L(G)$, is the minimum
cardinality of a locating-dominating set in $G$. It is conjectured [D. Garijo,
A. Gonz\'alez and A. M\'arquez. Resolving sets for breaking symmetries of
graphs. arXiv pre-print:1401.3686, 2014] that if $G$ is a twin-free graph of
order $n$ without isolated vertices, then $\gamma_L(G)\le \frac{n}{2}$. We
prove the conjecture for cubic graphs. We rely heavily on proof techniques from
matching theory to prove our result.
