We consider the Derrida-Higgs (DH) statistical model of species formation in
the case where the population is geographically distributed in discrete
locations, and mating only takes place within one location. Keeping the rate of
migration between neighbouring locations at a fixed value, we change the
mutation rate, changing therefore the average overlap between genotypes. When
the overlap between individuals living in different locations falls below a
fecundity threshold, speciation occurs. When more species coexist, the genetic
structure of the population (as described by the overlap distribution $P(q)$)
fluctuates. However, the average overlap, both within one location and among
neighbouring locations, appears to vary according to the same laws as in the
absence of speciation. The model provides a reasonable estimate of the
parameter values necessary to observe geographic speciation, which is found to
be much more likely than the sympatric speciation of the original DH model.
Applications to the case of circular invasion, where the concept of biological
species appears to run into difficulties, are sketched.
