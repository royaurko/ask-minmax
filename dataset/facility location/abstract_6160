We analyse the spectrum of perturbations of the de Sitter space on the one
hand, while on the other hand we compute the location of the poles in the
Conformal Field Theory (CFT) propagator at the border. The coincidence is
striking, supporting a dS/CFT correspondence. We show that the spectrum of
thermal excitations of the CFT at the past boundary $I^{-}$ together with that
spectrum at the future boundary $I^{+}$ is contained in the quasi-normal mode
spectrum of the de Sitter space in the bulk.
