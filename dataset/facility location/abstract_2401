An accelerator-driven subcritical reactor functions well in incinerating
high-level radiotoxic waste (HLW) as well as providing energy. China is on his
way to establish such a facility to transmutate the annual 1000 tons of HLW. A
neutronic analysis has been performed for a reference core with a special task
of burning minor actinides 237Np, 241Am, 243Am and 244Cm. Instant operation
parameters are determined, including neutron energy spectra, thermal power
distribution and transmutation validation. Burning-up analysis is carried out
to further confirm the incineration efficiency. The core parameters optimized
in this work will be applied to simulate in-core fuel behavior in future
research.
