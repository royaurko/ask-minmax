This paper presents a procedure for testing the hypothesis that the
underlying distribution of the data is elliptical when using robust location
and scatter estimators instead of the sample mean and covariance matrix. Under
mild assumptions that include elliptical distributions without first moments,
we derive the test statistic asymptotic behaviour under the null hypothesis and
under special alternatives. Numerical experiments allow to compare the
behaviour of the tests based on the sample mean and covariance matrix with that
based on robust estimators, under various elliptical distributions and
different alternatives. This comparison was done looking not only at the
observed level and power but we rather use the size-corrected relative exact
power which provides a tool to assess the test statistic skill to detect
alternatives. We also provide a numerical comparison with other competing
tests.
