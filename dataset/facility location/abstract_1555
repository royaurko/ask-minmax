Radio spectroscopy offers a number of tools for studying a large variety of
astrophysical phenomena, ranging from stars and their environment to
interstellar and intergalactic medium, active galactic nuclei (AGN) and distant
quasars. Main targets of extragalactic radio spectroscopy are atomic and
molecular material in galaxies, HII regions, and maser emission originating in
the dense, circumnuclear regions. These studies cover all galactic types and
span an impressive range of angular scales and distances. Molecular emission,
hydrogen absorption and maser lines have become the tools of choice for making
an assessment of physical conditions in the nuclear regions of galaxies. In
this contribution, some of the recent advances in the aforementioned fields
will be reviewed and discussed in connection with future radio astronomical
facilities.
