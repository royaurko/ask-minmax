Within the framework of a model representing the potential of a graphene
sheet U(z) as an electro-neutral layer formed by smeared carbon atoms, the
effect of this potential on spectral characteristics of atoms adsorbed on a
graphene sheet has been studied. Since the distance between the adsorbed atom
nucleus and sheet surface significantly exceeds the radii of inner atomic
shells the potential U(z) makes influence on the continuum wave functions only.
Their behavior in the upper semi-space (z>0) and in the lower one (z<0) where
the adsorbed atom is located is defined by a jump of the logarithmic derivative
of the wave function for z=0. The photoelectron angular distributions have been
calculated for different mutual positions of the polarization vector e and the
axis Z normal to the sheet surface. It has been shown that the existence of the
electron waves reflected from the potential U(z) leads to evident asymmetry of
the angular distribution relative to the plane z=0. The experimental
observation of this effect is of great interest for photoelectron spectroscopy
of atoms localized on graphene structures.
