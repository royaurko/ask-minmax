We investigate the kinematic signatures induced by spiral and bar structure
in a set of simulations of Milky Way-sized spiral disc galaxies. The set
includes test particle simulations that follow a quasi-stationary density
wave-like scenario with rigidly rotating spiral arms, and $N$-body simulations
that host a bar and transient, co-rotating spiral arms. From a location similar
to that of the Sun, we calculate the radial, tangential and line-of-sight
peculiar velocity fields of a patch of the disc and quantify the fluctuations
by computing the power spectrum from a two-dimensional Fourier transform. We
find that the peculiar velocity power spectrum of the simulation with a bar and
transient, co-rotating spiral arms fits very well to that of APOGEE red clump
star data, while the quasi-stationary density wave spiral model without a bar
does not. We determine that the power spectrum is sensitive to the number of
spiral arms, spiral arm pitch angle and position with respect to the spiral
arm. However, it is necessary to go beyond the line of sight velocity field in
order to distinguish fully between the various spiral models with this method.
We compute the power spectrum for different regions of the spiral discs, and
discuss the application of this analysis technique to external galaxies.
