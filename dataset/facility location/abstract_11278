I report the analysis of an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) located in the
galaxy NGC 1291. This X-ray point source is denominated IXO6 in the Catalog of
Candidate IXO (Colbert & Ptak). An Intermediate-luminosity X-ray Object (IXO)
is defined as an off-nuclear, compact object with luminosity Lx [2-10keV] >=
1039 erg s-1. The cutoff Lx is defined as a value greater than the Eddington
luminosity of a 1.4 Mo black hole (10 38.3 erg s-1). IXO is an early
denomination of what is call now a ULX point source. The Catalog was derived
from a ROSAT survey and represents 87 IXOS in 54 galaxies. IXO6 was selected
because of being positioned in the outer disk of the galaxy, with no near X-ray
source neighbors. The study of this ULX pretends to confirm certain assumptions
related to this class of objects (Roberts et al.)
