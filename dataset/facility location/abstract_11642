The cycle-by-cycle variations in heat release for a simulated spark-ignited
engine are analyzed within a turbulent combustion model in terms of some basic
parameters: the characteristic length of the unburned eddies entrained within
the flame front, a characteristic turbulent speed, and the location of the
ignition kernel. The evolution of the simulated time series with the fuel-air
equivalence ratio, phi, from lean mixtures to over stoichiometric conditions,
is examined and compared with previous experiments. Fluctuations on the
characteristic length of unburned eddies are found to be essential to simulate
heat release cycle-to-cycle variations and recover experimental results.
Relative to the non-linear analysis of the system, it is remarkable that at
fuel ratios around phi=0.65, embedding and surrogate procedures show that the
dimensionality of the system is small.
