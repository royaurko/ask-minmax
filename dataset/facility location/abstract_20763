Twelve high schools in Japan (of which six are in Fukushima Prefecture), four
in France, eight in Poland and two in Belarus cooperated in the measurement and
comparison of individual external doses in 2014. In total 216 high-school
students and teachers participated in the study. Each participant wore an
electronic personal dosimeter "D-shuttle" for two weeks, and kept a journal of
his/her whereabouts and activities. The distributions of annual external doses
estimated for each region overlap with each other, demonstrating that the
personal external individual doses in locations where residence is currently
allowed in Fukushima Prefecture and in Belarus are well within the range of
estimated annual doses due to the background radiation level of other
regions/countries.
