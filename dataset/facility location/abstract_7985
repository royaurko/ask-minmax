We present the ROSAT All-Sky Survey data in a 126 deg^2 area in and around
the CrA star forming region. With low-resolution spectroscopy of unidentified
ROSAT sources we could find 19 new pre-main sequence stars, two of which are
classical T Tauri stars, the others being weak-lined. The spectral types of
these new T Tauri stars range from F7 to M6. The two new classical T Tauri
stars are located towards two small cloud-lets outside of the main CrA cloud.
They appear to be ~10 Myrs old, by comparing their location in the H-R diagram
with isochrones for an assumed distance of 130 pc, the distance of the main CrA
dark cloud. The new off-cloud weak-line T Tauri stars may have formed in
similar cloud-lets, which have dispersed recently. High-resolution spectra of
our new T Tauri stars show that they have significantly more lithium absorption
than zero-age main-sequence stars of the same spectral type, so that they are
indeed young. From those spectra we also obtained rotational and radial
velocities. For some stars we found the proper motion in published catalogs.
The direction and velocity of the 3D space motion - south relative to the
galatic plane - of the CrA T Tauri stars is consistent with the dark cloud
being formed originally by a high-velocity cloud impact onto the galactic
plane, which triggered the star formation in CrA. We also present VRIJHK
photometry for most of the new T Tauri stars to derive their luminosities,
ages, and masses.
