We present the first multi-epoch radial velocity study of embedded young
massive stars using near-infrared spectra obtained with ISAAC mounted at the
ESO Very Large Telescope, with the aim to detect massive binaries. Our 16
targets are located in high-mass star-forming regions and many of them are
associated to known ultracompact HI I regions, whose young age ensures that
dynamic evolution of the clusters did not influence the intrinsic binarity
rate. We identify two stars with about 90 km/s velocity differences between two
epochs proving the presence of close massive binaries. The fact that 2 out of
the 16 observed stars are binary systems suggests that at least 20% of the
young massive stars are formed in close multiple systems, but may also be
consistent with most if not all young massive stars being binaries. In
addition, we show that the radial velocity dispersion of the full sample is
about 35 km/s, significantly larger than our estimated uncertainty (25 km/s).
This finding is consistent with similar measurements of the young massive
cluster 30 Dor which might have a high intrinsic binary rate. Furthermore, we
argue that virial cluster masses derived from the radial velocity dispersion of
young massive stars may intrinsically overestimate the cluster mass due to the
presence of binaries.
