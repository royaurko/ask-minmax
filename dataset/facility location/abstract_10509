A microscopic treatment of eta-nucleus system is presented. Using this, the
poles of the amplitude describing elastic scattering of eta-meson off the light
nuclei ^2H, ^3H, ^3He, and ^4He have been located in the second quadrant of the
complex plane of the eta-nucleus relative momentum. The results obtained
indicate that, within the existing uncertainties in the eta-Nucleon input data,
a bound state could exist. By a qualitative consideration it is shown that such
bound-states, cannot be narrow. It is further shown that scattering length
calculations cannot provide a definite answer on the question concerning the
existence of eta-nucleus bound states.
