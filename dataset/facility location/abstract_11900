We present a numerical method for scalar conservation laws in one space
dimension. The solution is approximated by local similarity solutions. While
many commonly used approaches are based on shocks, the presented method uses
rarefaction and compression waves. The solution is represented by particles
that carry function values and move according to the method of characteristics.
Between two neighboring particles, an interpolation is defined by an analytical
similarity solution of the conservation law. An interaction of particles
represents a collision of characteristics. The resulting shock is resolved by
merging particles so that the total area under the function is conserved. The
method is variation diminishing, nevertheless, it has no numerical dissipation
away from shocks. Although shocks are not explicitly tracked, they can be
located accurately. We present numerical examples, and outline specific
applications and extensions of the approach.
