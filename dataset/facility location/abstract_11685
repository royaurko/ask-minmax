In this paper based on agent and semantic web technologies we propose an
approach .i.e., Semantic Oriented Agent Based Search (SOAS), to cope with
currently existing challenges of Meta data extraction, modeling and information
retrieval over the web. SOAS is designed by keeping four major requirements
.i.e., Automatic user request handling, Dynamic unstructured full text reading,
Analysing and modeling, Semantic query generation and optimized result
classifier. The architecture of SOAS is consisting of an agent called Personal
Agent (PA) and five dynamic components .i.e., Request Processing Unit (RPU),
Agent Locator (AL), Agent Communicator (AC), List Builder (LB) and Result
Generator (RG). Furthermore, in this paper we briefly discuss Semantic Web and
some already existing in time proposed and implemented semantic based
approaches.
