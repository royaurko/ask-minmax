In this paper we present X-Learn, an XML-based, multi-agent system for
supporting "user-device" adaptive e-learning. X-Learn is characterized by the
following features: (i) it is highly subjective, since it handles quite a rich
and detailed user profile that plays a key role during the learning activities;
(ii) it is dynamic and flexible, i.e., it is capable of reacting to variations
of exigencies and objectives; (iii) it is device-adaptive, since it decides the
learning objects to present to the user on the basis of the device she/he is
currently exploiting; (iv) it is generic, i.e., it is capable of operating in a
large variety of learning contexts; (v) it is XML based, since it exploits many
facilities of XML technology for handling and exchanging information connected
to e-learning activities. The paper reports also various experimental results
as well as a comparison between X-Learn and other related e-learning management
systems already presented in the literature.
