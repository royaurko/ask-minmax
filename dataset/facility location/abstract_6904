We argue that the cosmic ray positron excess observed in ATIC-2, Fermi LAT,
PAMELA, HESS and recently in the precision AMS-02 experiment can be attributed
to the production in a local, middle-aged supernova remnant (SNR). Using the
prediction of our model of cosmic ray acceleration in SNR we estimate that the
SNR responsible for the observed positron excess is located between 250 and
320pc from the Sun and is 170-380 kyear old. The most probable candidate for
such a source is the SNR which gave birth to the well-known Geminga pulsar, but
is no longer visible. Other contenders are also discussed.
