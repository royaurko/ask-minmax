If a source star is gravitationally microlensed by a multiple lens system,
the resulting light curve can have significant deviations from the standard
form of a single lens event. The chance to produce significant deviations
becomes important when the separations between the component lenses are
equivalent to the combined angular Einstein ring radius of the system. For
multiple lens systems composed of more than two lenses, however, this condition
is difficult to meet because the orbits of such systems are unstable. Even if
events are caused by a multiple lens system with stable orbits where a pair of
lenses are closely located and the other component (third body) has a wide
separation from the pair, photometrically identifying the lens multiplicity
will be difficult because the event will be identified either by a binary lens
event caused by the close pair lenses or a single lens event caused by the
third body. In this paper, we show that if a seemingly binary lens event is
astrometrically followed up by using future high precision interferometers, the
existence of an additional third body can be identified via a repeating event.
We show that the signatures of third bodies can be unambiguously identified
from the characteristic distortions they make in the centroid shift
trajectories. We also show that due to the long range astrometric effect of
third bodies, the detection efficiency will be considerable even for third
bodies with large separations from their close lens pairs.
