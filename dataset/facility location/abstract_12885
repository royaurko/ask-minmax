A body of literature has developed concerning "cloaking by anomalous
localized resonance". The mathematical heart of the matter involves the
behavior of a divergence-form elliptic equation in the plane, $\nabla\cdot
(a(x)\nabla u(x)) = f(x)$. The complex-valued coefficient has a
matrix-shell-core geometry, with real part equal to 1 in the matrix and the
core, and -1 in the shell; one is interested in understanding the resonant
behavior of the solution as the imaginary part of $a(x)$ decreases to zero (so
that ellipticity is lost). Most analytical work in this area has relied on
separation of variables, and has therefore been restricted to radial
geometries. We introduce a new approach based on a pair of dual variational
principles, and apply it to some non-radial examples. In our examples, as in
the radial setting, the spatial location of the source $f$ plays a crucial role
in determining whether or not resonance occurs.
