Using the facilities of the KASCADE Central Detector EAS muon arrival time
distributions, observed with reference to the arrival time of the first locally
registered muon, and their correlations with other EAS observables have been
experimentally investigated. The experimental data enable a study of the
sensitivity of such local arrival time distributions to the mass composition of
cosmic rays in the energy region around the knee. For that purpose,
nonparametric multivariate even-by-event analyses have been performed specified
by three different mass groups for an estimate of the mass composition. It
turns out that local muon arrival time distributions display a minor
sensitivity to the mass of the EAS inducing particle, at least for distances
from the shower axis R < 100m. The measurements comprise a subset of all EAS
events registered by KASCADE due to the observation conditions of the arrival
time distributions, with a threshold of the muon energy E = 2.4 GeV and a
minimum multiplicity n for being accepted in the observed data samples. By
studying the event acceptance in the registered samples on basis of Monte Carlo
simulations a test of the consistency of the Monte Carlo simulations with the
data is enabled. Within the present uncertainties the results of such a test
show a remarkable agreement of the experimental findings with the Monte Carlo
simulations, using the QGSJET model as generator of the high-energy hadronic
interactions.
