We estimate the thermalization time in two colliding shock waves holographic
model of heavy-ion collisions. For this purpose we model the process by the
Vaidya metric with a horizon defined by the trapped surface location. We
consider two bottom-up AdS/QCD models that give, within the colliding shock
waves approach, the dependence of multiplicity on the energy compatible with
RHIC and LHC results. One model is a bottom-up AdS/QCD confining model and the
other is related to an anisotropic thermalization. We estimate the
thermalization time and show that increasing the confining potential decreases
the thermalization time as well as an anisotropy accelerates the
thermalization.
