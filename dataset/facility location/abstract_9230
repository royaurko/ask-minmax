We explore theoretical models of the ionization ratios of the Li-like
absorbers NV, OVI, and CIV, in the Galactic halo. These ions are believed to
form in nonequilibrium processes such as shocks, evaporative interfaces, or
rapidly cooling gas, all of which trace the dynamics of the interstellar
medium. As a useful new diagnostic, we focus on velocity-resolved signatures of
several common physical structures: (1) a cooling Galactic fountain flow that
rises, cools, and recombines as it returns to the disk; (2) shocks moving
toward the observer; (3) a conductive interface with the observer located in
the hotter gas. This last geometry occurs with the solar system inside a hot
bubble, or when one looks out through the fragmenting top shell of our local
bubble blown into the halo as part of the Galactic fountain. In Paper II, these
models are compared to ionization-ratio data from FUSE and Hubble Space
Telescope.
