Multi-turn Injection scheme with gaseous stripper is usually used in high
intensity and super heavy ion injection process. With its advantage of long
lifetime and uniformity, a gaseous stripper is proposed based on the under
construction hadrontherapy facility HIMM (Heavy Ion Medical Machine). In this
paper, the physical process between the injecting beam and the gaseous target
is studied, and a simulation work is conducted based on the former developed
code.
