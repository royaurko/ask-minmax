We deform the interaction between nonrelativistic point particles on a plane
and a Chern-Simons field to obtain an action invariant with respect to
time-dependent area-preserving diffeomorphisms. The deformed and undeformed
Lagrangians are connected by a point transformation leading to a classical
Seiberg-Witten map between the corresponding gauge fields. The Schroedinger
equation derived by means of Moyal-Weyl quantization from the effective
two-particle interaction exhibits - a singular metric, leading to a splitting
of the plane into an interior (bag-) and an exterior region, - a singular
potential (quantum correction) with singularities located at the origin and at
the edge of the bag. We list some properties of the solutions of the radial
Schroedinger equation.
