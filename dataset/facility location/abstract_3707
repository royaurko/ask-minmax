We have investigated multiphoton multiple ionization dynamics of argon and
xenon atoms using a new x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) facility, SPring-8
Angstrom Compact free electron LAser (SACLA) in Japan, and identified that
highly charged Xe ions with the charge state up to +26 are produced
predominantly via four-photon absorption as well as highly charged Ar ions with
the charge state up to +10 are produced via two-photon absorption at a photon
energy of 5.5 keV. The absolute fluence of the XFEL pulse, needed for
comparison between theory and experiment, has been determined using two-photon
processes in the argon atom with the help of benchmark ab initio calculations.
Our experimental results, in combination with a newly developed theoretical
model for heavy atoms, demonstrate the occurrence of multiphoton absorption
involving deep inner shells.
