Recent far-infrared vibration-rotation tunneling (FIR-VRT) experiments pose
new challenges to theory because the interpretation and prediction of such
spectra requires a detailed understanding of the potential energy surface (PES)
away from minima. In particular we need a global description of the PES in
terms of a complete reaction graph. Hence all the transition states and
associated mechanisms which might give rise to observable tunneling splittings
must be characterized. It may be possible to guess the detailed permutations of
atoms from the transition state alone, but experience suggests this is unwise.
  In this contribution a brief overview of the issues involved in treating the
large amplitude motions of such systems will be given, with references to more
detailed discussions and some specific examples. In particular we will consider
the effective molecular symmetry group, the classification of rearrangement
mechanisms, the location of minima and transition states and the calculation of
reaction pathways. The application of these theories to small water clusters
ranging from water dimer to water hexamer will then be considered. More details
can be found in recent reviews.
