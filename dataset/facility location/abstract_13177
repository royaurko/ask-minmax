In Fermionic Molecular Dynamics antisymmetrized products of Gaussian wave
packets are projected on angular momentum, linear momentum, and parity. An
appropriately chosen set of these states span the many-body Hilbert space in
which the Hamiltonian is diagonalized. The wave packet parameters - position,
momentum, width and spin - are obtained by variation under constraints. The
great flexibility of this basis allows to describe not only shell-model like
states but also exotic states like halos, e.g. the two-proton halo in 17Ne, or
cluster states as they appear for example in 12C close to the \alpha-breakup
threshold where the Hoyle state is located. Even a fully microscopic
calculation of the 3He(\alpha,\gamma)7Be capture reaction is possible and
yields an astrophysical S-factor that compares very well with newer data. As
representatives of numerous results these cases will be discussed in this
contribution, some of them not published so far. The Hamiltonian is based on
the realistic Argonne V18 nucleon-nucleon interaction.
