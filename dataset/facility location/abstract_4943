We present the recent robust determination of the value of the Dark Matter
density at the Sun's location ($\rho_\odot$) with a technique that does not
rely on a global mass-modeling of the Galaxy. The method is based on the local
equation of centrifugal equilibrium and depends on local and quite well known
quantities such as the angular Sun's velocity, the disk to dark contribution to
the circular velocity at the Sun, and the thin stellar disk scale length. This
determination is independent of the shape of the dark matter density profile,
the knowledge of the rotation curve at any radius, and the very uncertain
bulge/disk/dark-halo mass decomposition. The result is: $\rho_\odot=0.43
(0.11)(0.10)\,$GeV/cm$^{3}$, where the quoted uncertainties are due to the
uncertainty a) in the slope of the circular-velocity at the Sun location and b)
in the ratio between this radius and the exponential length scale of the
stellar disk. The devised technique is also able to take into account any
future improvement in the data relevant for the estimate.
