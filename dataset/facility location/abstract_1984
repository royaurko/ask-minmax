The next-generation high-energy facilities, the CERN Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) and the prospective $e^+e^-$ International Linear Collider (ILC), are
expected to unravel new structures of matter and forces from the electroweak
scale to the TeV scale. In this report we review the complementary role of LHC
and ILC in drawing a comprehensive and high-precision picture of the mechanism
breaking the electroweak symmetries and generating mass, and the unification of
forces in the frame of supersymmetry.
