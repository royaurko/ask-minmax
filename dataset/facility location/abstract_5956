The work presents a simple formalism which proposes an estimate of the ground
state energy from a single reference function. It is based on a perturbative
expansion but leads to non linear coupled equations. It can be viewed as well
as a modified coupled cluster formulation. Applied to a series of spin lattices
governed by model Hamiltonians the method leads to simple analytic solutions.
The so-calculated cohesive energies are surprisingly accurate. Two examples
illustrate its applicability to locate phase transition.
