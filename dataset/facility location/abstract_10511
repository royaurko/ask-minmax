Ground-state properties of spherical even-even nuclei $14\leq Z \leq 28$ and
$N=18,20,22$ are described in the framework of Relativistic Hartree Bogoliubov
(RHB) theory. The model uses the NL3 effective interaction in the mean-field
Lagrangian, and describes pairing correlations by the pairing part of the
finite range Gogny interaction D1S. Binding energies, two-proton separation
energies, and proton $rms$ radii that result from fully self-consistent RHB
solutions are compared with experimental data. The model predicts the location
of the proton drip-line. The isospin dependence of the effective spin-orbit
potential is discussed, as well as pairing properties that result from the
finite range interaction in the $pp$ channel.
