Donsker's theorem shows that random walks behave like Brownian motion in an
asymptotic sense. This result can be used to approximate expectations
associated with the time and location of a random walk when it first crosses a
nonlinear boundary. In this paper, correction terms are derived to improve the
accuracy of these approximations.
