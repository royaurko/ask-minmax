The recent distance determinations by HIPPARCOS have allowed to locate very
precisely a reasonable set of subdwarfs in the HR diagram. A detailed
comparison with evolutionary models is now possible and it has been recently
claimed that the observed lower part of the main-sequence is cooler than the
computed one. In this paper we show that microscopic diffusion could be the
physical explanation of such a systematic shift. We emphazise the fact that, as
diffusion alters surface abundances, the initial metal content of the stellar
material is higher than the present one. A "calibration" procedure is necessary
when comparing observed and theoretical HR diagram, to take into account this
effect.
