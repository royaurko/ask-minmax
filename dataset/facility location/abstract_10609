In this paper we present a methodology to adress the problem of brain tissue
deformation referred to as "brainshift". This deformation occurs throughout a
neurosurgery intervention and strongly alters the accuracy of the
neuronavigation systems used to date in clinical routine which rely solely on
preoperative patient imaging to locate the surgical target, such as a tumour or
a functional area. After a general description of the framework of our
intraoperative image-guided system, we propose a biomechanical model of the
brain which can take into account interactively such deformations as well as
surgical procedures that modify the brain structure, like tumour or tissue
resection.
