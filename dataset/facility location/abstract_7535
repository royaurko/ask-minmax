It is widely accepted that solar active regions including sunspots are formed
by the emerging magnetic flux from the deep convection zone. In previous
numerical simulations, we found that the horizontal divergent flow (HDF) occurs
before the flux emergence at the photospheric height. This Paper reports the
HDF detection prior to the flux emergence of NOAA AR 11081, which is located
away from the disk center. We use SDO/HMI data to study the temporal changes of
the Doppler and magnetic patterns from those of the reference quiet Sun. As a
result, the HDF appearance is found to come before the flux emergence by about
100 minutes. Also, the horizontal speed of the HDF during this time gap is
estimated to be 0.6 to 1.5 km s^-1, up to 2.3 km s^-1. The HDF is caused by the
plasma escaping horizontally from the rising magnetic flux. And the interval
between the HDF and the flux emergence may reflect the latency during which the
magnetic flux beneath the solar surface is waiting for the instability onset to
the further emergence. Moreover, SMART Halpha images show that the
chromospheric plages appear about 14 min later, located co-spatial with the
photospheric pores. This indicates that the plages are caused by plasma flowing
down along the magnetic fields that connect the pores at their footpoints. One
importance of observing the HDF may be the possibility to predict the sunspot
appearances that occur in several hours.
