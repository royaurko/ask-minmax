Given a sample from a discretely observed compound Poisson process, we
consider non-parametric estimation of the density $f_0$ of its jump sizes, as
well as of its intensity $\lambda_0.$ We take a Bayesian approach to the
problem and specify the prior on $f_0$ as the Dirichlet location mixture of
normal densities. An independent prior for $\lambda_0$ is assumed to be
compactly supported and possess a positive density with respect to the Lebesgue
measure. We show that under suitable assumptions the posterior contracts around
the pair $(\lambda_0,f_0)$ at essentially (up to a logarithmic factor) the
$\sqrt{n\Delta}$-rate, where $n$ is the number of observations and $\Delta$ is
the mesh size at which the process is sampled. The emphasis is on high
frequency data, $\Delta\to 0$, but the obtained results are also valid for
fixed $\Delta$. In either case we assume that $n\Delta\rightarrow\infty$. Our
main result implies existence of Bayesian point estimates converging (in the
frequentist sense, in probability) to $(\lambda_0,f_0)$ at the same rate.
Simulations complement the theory.
