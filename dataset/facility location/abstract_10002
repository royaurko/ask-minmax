When a fluid surface adheres to a substrate, the location of the contact line
adjusts in order to minimize the overall energy. This adhesion balance implies
boundary conditions which depend on the characteristic surface deformation
energies. We develop a general geometrical framework within which these
conditions can be systematically derived. We treat both adhesion to a rigid
substrate as well as adhesion between two fluid surfaces, and illustrate our
general results for several important Hamiltonians involving both curvature and
curvature gradients. Some of these have previously been studied using very
different techniques, others are to our knowledge new. What becomes clear in
our approach is that, except for capillary phenomena, these boundary conditions
are not the manifestation of a local force balance, even if the concept of
surface stress is properly generalized. Hamiltonians containing higher order
surface derivatives are not just sensitive to boundary translations but also
notice changes in slope or even curvature. Both the necessity and the
functional form of the corresponding additional contributions follow readily
from our treatment.
