We measure the metal abundance ratios in the X-ray photoionized gas located
near the narrow line region of a sample of Seyfert 2 AGN. The high-resolution
X-ray spectra observed with the Chandra high- and low-energy transmission
grating spectrometers are compared with models of the resonant scattering and
recombination emission from a plasma in thermal balance, and with multiple
temperature zones. The abundance ratios in the sample are close to the Solar
values, with slight over-abundances of N in NGC 1068, and of Ne in NGC 4151.
Our X-ray spectral models use fewer degrees of freedom than previous works.
