The H\'enon--Heiles system in the general form is studied. In a nonintegrable
case new solutions have been found as formal Laurent series, depending on three
parameters. One of parameters determines a location of the singularity point,
other parameters determine coefficients of the Laurent series. For some values
of these two parameters the obtained Laurent series coincide with the Laurent
series of the known exact solutions.
