Based on the turbulent convection model (TCM) of Li & Yang (2007), we have
studied the characteristics of turbulent convection in the envelopes of 2 and
5M stars at the RGB and AGB phases. The TCM has been applied successfully in
the whole convective envelopes including the convective unstable zone and the
overshooting regions. We find that the convective motions become stronger and
stronger when the stellar models are located upper and upper along the Hayashi
line. In the convective unstable zone, we find that the turbulent correlations
are proportional to functions of a common factor $(\nabla-\nabla_{ad})\bar{T}$,
which explains similar distributions of those correlations. For the TCM we find
that if the obtained stellar structure of temperature is close to that of the
MLT, the convective motion will be at a much larger velocity and thus more
violent. However, if the turbulent velocity is adjusted to close to that of the
MLT, the superadiabatic convection zone is much more extended inward and a
lower effective temperature of the stellar model will be obtained. For the
overshooting distance we find that the e-folding lengths of the turbulent
kinetic energy k in both the top and bottom overshooting regions decrease as
the stellar model is located up along the Hayashi line, but both the extents of
the decrease are not obvious. And the overshooting distances of the turbulent
correlation $\bar{u_{r}^{'}T^{'}}$ are almost the same for the different
stellar models with a same set of TCM's parameters. ...
