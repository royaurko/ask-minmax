The properties of kaons and antikaons and their modification in isospin
asymmetric nuclear matter are investigated using a chiral SU(3) model. These
isospin dependent medium effects are important for asymmetric heavy ion
collision experiments. In the present work, the medium modifications of the
energies of the kaons and antikaons, within the asymmetric nuclear matter,
arise due to the interactions of kaons and antikaons with the nucleons and
scalar mesons. The values of the parameters in the model are obtained by
fitting the saturation properties of nuclear matter and kaon-nucleon scattering
lengths. The pion-nucleon scattering lengths are also calculated within the
chiral effective model and compared with earlier results from the literature.
The density dependence of the isospin asymmetry is seen to be appreciable for
the kaon and antikaon optical potentials. This can be particularly relevant for
the future accelerator facility FAIR at GSI, where experiments using neutron
rich beams are planned to be used in the study of compressed baryonic matter.
