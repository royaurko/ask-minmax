The mobility behavior of human beings is predictable to a varying degree e.g.
depending on the traits of their personality such as the trait extraversion -
introversion: the mobility of introvert users may be more dominated by routines
and habitual movement patterns, resulting in a more predictable mobility
behavior on the basis of their own location history while, in contrast,
extrovert users get about a lot and are explorative by nature, which may hamper
the prediction of their mobility. However, socially more active and extrovert
users meet more people and share information, experiences, believes, thoughts
etc. with others. which in turn leads to a high interdependency between their
mobility and social lives. Using a large LBSN dataset, his paper investigates
the interdependency between human mobility and social proximity, the influence
of social networks on enhancing location prediction of an individual and the
transmission of social trends/influences within social networks.
