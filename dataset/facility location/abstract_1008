The electromagnetic decay $\Sigma^0(1385) \to \Lambda \gamma$ was studied
using the CLAS detector at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.
A real photon beam with a maximum energy of 3.8 GeV was incident on a proton
target, producing an exclusive final state of $K^+\Sigma^{*0}$. We report the
decay widths ratio $\Sigma^0(1385) \to \Lambda\gamma$/ $\Sigma^0(1385) \to
\Lambda\pi^0$ = $1.42 \pm 0.12(\text{stat})_{-0.07}^{+0.11}(\text{sys})$%. This
ratio is larger than most theoretical predictions by factors ranging from
1.5-3, but is consistent with the only other experimental measurement. From the
reported ratio we calculate the partial width and electromagnetic transition
magnetic moment for $\Sigma^0(1385) \to \Lambda\gamma$.
