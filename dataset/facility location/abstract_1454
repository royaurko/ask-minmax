During 1996 the soft-X-ray transient and superluminal jet source GRO J1655-40
was observed in outburst with a multiwavelength campaign including HST, RXTE,
CGRO and ground based facilities. Here we focus on a key question raised by the
observations: where and how does the outburst optical flux originate? Any model
must not only fit the optical spectra, but must account for the observation
that X-ray fluxes continued to rise slowly while the optical flux declined,
contrary to predictions of standard models for the outburst of SXTs and dwarf
novae.
