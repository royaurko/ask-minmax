Vortex-type motions have been measured by tracking bright points in
high-resolution observations of the solar photosphere. These small-scale
motions are thought to be determinant in the evolution of magnetic footpoints
and their interaction with plasma and therefore likely to play a role in
heating the upper solar atmosphere by twisting magnetic flux tubes. We report
the observation of magnetic concentrations being dragged towards the center of
a convective vortex motion in the solar photosphere from high-resolution
ground-based and space-borne data. We describe this event by analyzing a series
of images at different solar atmospheric layers. By computing horizontal proper
motions, we detect a vortex whose center appears to be the draining point for
the magnetic concentrations detected in magnetograms and well-correlated with
the locations of bright points seen in G-band and CN images.
