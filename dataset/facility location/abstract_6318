The Hamiltonian for a particle constrained to move on the surface of a curved
nanotube is derived using the methods of differential forms. A two-dimensional
Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization procedure is employed to calculate basis
functions for determining the eigenvalues and eigenstates of a tubular arc (a
nanotube in the shape of a hyperbolic cosine) with several hundred scattering
centers. The curvature of the tube is shown to induce bound states that are
dependent on the curvature parameters and bend location of the tube.
