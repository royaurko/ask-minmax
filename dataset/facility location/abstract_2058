One goal of XFEL facilities is the production of narrow bandwidth X-ray
radiation. The self-seeding scheme was proposed to obtain a bandwidth narrower
than that achievable with conventional X-ray SASE FELs. A self-seeded FEL is
composed of two undulators separated by a monochromator and an electron beam
bypass that must compensate for the path delay of X-rays in the monochromator.
This leads to a long bypass, with a length in the order of 40-60 m, which
requires modifications of the baseline undulator configuration. As an attempt
to get around this obstacle, together with a study of the self-seeding scheme
for the European XFEL, here we propose a novel technique based on a pulse
doubler concept. Using a crystal monochromator installed within a short
magnetic chicane in the baseline undulator, it is possible to decrease the
bandwidth of the radiation well beyond the XFEL design down to 10^(-5). The
magnetic chicane can be installed without any perturbation of the XFEL focusing
structure, and does not interfere with the baseline mode of operation. We
present a feasibility study and we make exemplifications with the parameters of
the SASE2 line of the European XFEL.
