LI-LMC 1813 is a dust-enshrouded Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star, located
in the small open cluster KMHK 1603 near the rim of the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC). Optical and infrared photometry between 0.5 and 60 micron is obtained to
constrain the spectral energy distribution of LI-LMC 1813. Near-infrared
spectra unambiguously show it to be a carbon star. Modelling with the radiation
transfer code Dusty yields accurate values for the bolometric luminosity, L=1.5
x 10^4 Lsun, and mass-loss rate, Mdot=3.7(+/-1.2) x 10^-5 Msun/yr. On the basis
of colour-magnitude diagrams, the age of the cluster KMHK 1603 is estimated to
be t=0.9-1.0 Gyr, which implies a Zero-Age Main Sequence mass for LI-LMC 1813
of M(ZAMS)=2.2+/-0.1 Msun. This makes LI-LMC 1813 arguably the object with the
most accurately and reliably determined (circum)stellar parameters amongst all
carbon stars in the superwind phase.
