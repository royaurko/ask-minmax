As part of our radial velocity survey of low Galactic latitude structures
that surround the Galactic disc, we report the detection of the so called
Monoceros Ring in the foreground of the Carina dwarf galaxy at Galactic
coordinates (l,b)=(260,-22) based on VLT/FLAMES observations of the dwarf
galaxy. At this location, 20 degrees in longitude greater than previous
detections, the Ring has a mean radial velocity of 145+/-5 km/s and a velocity
dispersion of only 17+/-5 km/s. Based on Keck/DEIMOS observations, we also
determine that the Ring has a mean radial velocity of -75+/-4 km/s in the
foreground of the Andromeda galaxy at (l,b)\sim(122,-22), along with a velocity
dispersion of 26+/-3 km/s. These two kinematic detections are both highly
compatible with known characteristics of the structure and, along with previous
detections provide radial velocity values of the Ring over the 120<l<260 range.
This should add strong constraints on numerical models of the accretion of the
dwarf galaxy that is believed to be the progenitor of the Ring.
