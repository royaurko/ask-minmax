A system of two coupled non-autonomous oscillators is considered. Dynamics of
complex amplitudes is governed by differential equations with periodic
piecewise continuous dependence of the coefficients on time. The Poincar\'{e}
map is derived explicitly. With exclusion of the overall phase, on which the
evolution of other variables does not depend, the Poincar\'{e} map is reduced
to 3D mapping. It possesses an attractor of Plykin type located on an invariant
sphere. Computer verification of the cone criterion confirms the hyperbolic
nature of the attractor in the 3D map. Some results of numerical studies of the
dynamics for the coupled oscillators are presented, including the attractor
portraits, Lyapunov exponents, and the power spectral density.
