The $^{18}$Ne($\alpha$,$p$)$^{21}$Na reaction is one key for the break-out
from the hot CNO-cycles to the $rp$-process. Recent papers have provided
reaction rate factors $N_A < \sigma v >$ which are discrepant by at least one
order of magnitude. The compatibility of the latest experimental results is
tested, and a partial explanation for the discrepant $N_A<\sigma v>$ is given.
A new rate factor is derived from the combined analysis of all available data.
The new rate factor is located slightly below the higher rate factor by Matic
{\it et al.}\ at low temperatures and significantly below at higher
temperatures whereas it is about a factor of five higher than the lower rate
factor recently published by Salter {\it et al.}
