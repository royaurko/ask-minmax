We present our analysis of the three HII-buried-AGN: SDSS J091053+333008,
SDSS J121837+091324, and SDSS J153002-020415, by studying their optical spectra
extracted from SDSS. The location in the BPT diagnostic diagrams of the three
galaxies indicates that the narrow emission lines are mainly exited from HII
regions. However, after the removal of the host galaxy's stellar emission, the
emission lines display the typical feature of Narrow-line Seyfert 1-like. All
of the three objects have large Eddington ratio, small black hole mass, and low
star formation rate. We propose that the three galaxies are at the transit
stage from the starburst-dominated phase to AGN-dominated phase.
