We present predictions of centimeter and millimeter radio emission from
reverse shocks in the early afterglows of gamma-ray bursts with the goal of
determining their detectability with current and future radio facilities. Using
a range of GRB properties, such as peak optical brightness and time, isotropic
equivalent gamma-ray energy and redshift, we simulate radio light curves in a
framework generalized for any circumburst medium structure and including a
parametrization of the shell thickness regime that is more realistic than the
simple assumption of thick- or thin-shell approximations. Building on earlier
work by Mundell et al. (2007) and Melandri et al. (2010) in which the typical
frequency of the reverse shock was suggested to lie at radio, rather than
optical wavelengths at early times, we show that the brightest and most
distinct reverse-shock radio signatures are detectable up to 0.1 -- 1 day after
the burst, emphasizing the need for rapid radio follow-up. Detection is easier
for bursts with later optical peaks, high isotropic energies, lower circumburst
medium densities, and at observing frequencies that are less prone to
synchrotron self-absorption effects - typically above a few GHz. Given recent
detections of polarized prompt gamma-ray and optical reverse-shock emission, we
suggest that detection of polarized radio/mm emission will unambiguously
confirm the presence of low-frequency reverse shocks at early time.
