We present the first results from a survey of the relative spatial
distributions of galaxies, intergalactic neutral hydrogen, and intergalactic
metals at high redshift. We obtained high-resolution spectra of 8 bright QSOs
at 3.1<z<4.1 and spectroscopic redshifts for 431 Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at
slightly lower redshifts. Comparing the locations of galaxies to the absorption
lines in the QSO spectra shows that the intergalactic medium contains less
neutral hydrogen than the global average within r<0.5h^-1 comoving Mpc of LBGs
and more than average at slightly larger distances 1<r<5 h^-1 comoving Mpc. The
intergalactic medium within the largest overdensities at z~3, which will
presumably evolve into the intracluster medium by z~0, is rich in neutral
hydrogen and CIV. The lack of HI absorption at small distances from LBGs
appears unlikely to be produced solely by the Lyman continuum radiation they
emit; it may show that the galaxies' supernovae-driven winds maintain their
measured outflow velocities of ~600 km/s for a few hundred million years and
drive away nearby intergalactic gas. We present correlation functions of
galaxies with Lyman-alpha forest flux decrements, with CIV systems, and with
other galaxies. We describe the association of galaxies with damped Lyman-a
systems and with intergalactic HeII opacity. A strong observed correlation of
galaxies with intergalactic metals supports the idea that Lyman-break galaxies'
winds have enriched their surroundings.
