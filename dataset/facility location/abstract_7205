A new catalog of 8382 close quasar-galaxy pairs is presented. The catalog was
composed using published catalogs of quasars and active galactic nuclei
containing 11358 objects, as well as the LEDA catalog of galaxies, which
contains on the order of 100 thousand objects. The search for pairs was carried
out in such a way that the linear distance between the galaxy and projected
quasar does not exceed 150kpc. Based on these new data, the dependence of the
number of pairs on a=z_G/z_Q is analysed, where z_G and z_Q are the redshifts
of the galaxy and quasar, respectively, revealing an excess of pairs with a<0.1
and a>0.9. This means that the galaxies in pairs are preferably located close
to either the observer or the quasar and avoid intermediate distances along the
line of sight to the quasar. Computer simulations demonstrate that it is not
possible to explain this number of pairs with the observed distribution in a as
the result of chance positional coincidences with a uniform spatial
distribution of galaxies. Data on globular clusters show that the excess of
pairs with a<0.1 and a>0.9 is consistent with the hypothesis that we are
observing distant compact objects that are strongly gravitationally lensed by
transparent lenses with a King mass distribution located in the halos of nearby
galaxies. The Hubble diagram for galaxies and quasars is presented.
Observational tests of the mesolensing hypothesis are formulated.
