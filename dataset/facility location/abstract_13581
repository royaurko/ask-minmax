We describe the computation of the one-loop muon anomalous magnetic moment
and radiative penguin transitions in the minimal and custodially protected
Randall-Sundrum model. A fully five-dimensional (5D) framework is employed to
match the 5D theory onto the Standard Model extended by dimension-six
operators. The additional contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment from
the gauge-boson exchange contributions is Delta a_mu \approx 8.8 (27.2) x
10^(-11) x (1 TeV/T)^2, where the first (second) number refers to the minimal
(custodially-protected) model. Here $1/T$ denotes the location of the TeV brane
in conformal coordinates, and is related to the mass of the lowest gauge-boson
KK excitation by M_KK \approx 2.35 T. We also determine the Higgs-exchange
contribution, which depends on the 5D Yukawa structure and the precise
interpretation of the localisation of the Higgs field near or at the TeV brane.
