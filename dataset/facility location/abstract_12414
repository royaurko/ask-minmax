In this work, we extensively investigate the terrestrial planetary formation
for the inclined planetary systems (considering the OGLE-2006-BLG-109L system
as prototype) in the late stage. In the simulations, we show that the
occurrence of terrestrial planets is quite common, in the final assembly stage.
Moreover, we find that 40% of the runs finally occupy one planet in the
habitable zone (HZ). On the other hand, the numerical results also indicate
that the inner region of the planetesimal disk, ranging from $\sim 0.1$ to 0.3
AU, plays an important role in building up terrestrial planets. By examining
all simulations, we note that the survivals are located either between
0.1$\sim$1.0 AU or beyond 7 AU, or at the 1:1 mean motion resonance of
OGLE-2006-BLG-109Lb at $\sim$2.20 AU. The outcomes suggest that it may exist
moderate possibility for the inclined systems to harbor terrestrial planets,
even planets in the HZs.
