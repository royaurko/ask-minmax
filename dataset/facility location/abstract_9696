Low-frequency vibrations of glassy and crystalline orthoterphenyl are studied
by means of neutron scattering. Phonon dispersions are measured along the main
axes of a single crystal, and the corresponding longitudinal and transversal
sound velocities are obtained. For glassy and polycrystalline samples, a
density of vibrational states is determined and cross-checked against other
dynamic observables. In the crystal, low-lying zone-boundary modes lead to an
excess over the Debye density of states. In the glass, the boson peak is
located at even lower frequencies. With increasing temperature, both glass and
crystal show anharmonicity.
