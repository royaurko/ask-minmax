It is now accepted that accretion onto classical T Tauri stars is controlled
by the stellar magnetosphere, yet to date most accretion models have assumed
that their magnetic fields are dipolar. By considering a simple steady state
accretion model with both dipolar and complex magnetic fields we find a
correlation between mass accretion rate and stellar mass of the form $\dot{M}
\propto M_{\ast}^{\alpha}$, with our results consistent within observed
scatter. For any particular stellar mass there can be several orders of
magnitude difference in the mass accretion rate, with accretion filling factors
of a few percent. We demonstrate that the field geometry has a significant
effect in controlling the location and distribution of hot spots, formed on the
stellar surface from the high velocity impact of accreting material. We find
that hot spots are often at mid to low latitudes, in contrast to what is
expected for accretion to dipolar fields, and that particularly for higher mass
stars, the accretion flow is predominantly carried by open field lines.
