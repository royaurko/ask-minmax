In this article, the results from a series of muon flux measurements
conducted at the Kimballton Underground Research Facility (KURF), Virginia,
United States, are presented. The detector employed for these investigations,
is made of plastic scintillator bars readout by wavelength shifting fibers and
multianode photomultiplier tubes. Data was taken at several locations inside
KURF, spanning rock overburden values from ~ 200 to 1450 m.w.e. From the
extracted muon rates an empirical formula was devised, that estimates the muon
flux inside the mine as a function of the overburden. The results are in good
agreement with muon flux calculations based on analytical models and MUSIC.
