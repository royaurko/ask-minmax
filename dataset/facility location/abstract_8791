We have carried out a search for the optical and infrared counterpart of the
Anomalous X-ray Pulsar 1E 1841-045, which is located at the center of the
supernova remnant Kes73. We present the first deep optical and infrared images
of the field of 1E 1841-045, as well as optical spectroscopy results that
exclude the brightest objects in the error circle as possible counterparts. A
few of the more reddened objects in this region can be considered as
particularly interesting candidates, in consideration of the distance and
absorption expected from the association with Kes73. The strong interstellar
absorption in the direction of the source does not allow to completely exclude
the presence of main sequence massive companions.
