The solar neutrino experiment Borexino, which is located in the Gran Sasso
underground laboratories, is in a unique position to study muon-induced
backgrounds in an organic liquid scintillator. In this study, a large sample of
cosmic muons is identified and tracked by a muon veto detector external to the
liquid scintillator, and by the specific light patterns observed when muons
cross the scintillator volume. The yield of muon-induced neutrons is found to
be Yn =(3.10+-0.11)10-4 n/({\mu} (g/cm2)). The distance profile between the
parent muon track and the neutron capture point has the average value {\lambda}
= (81.5 +- 2.7)cm. Additionally the yields of a number of cosmogenic
radioisotopes are measured for 12N, 12B, 8He, 9C, 9Li, 8B, 6He, 8Li, 11Be, 10C
and 11C. All results are compared with Monte Carlo simulation predictions using
the Fluka and Geant4 packages. General agreement between data and simulation is
observed for the cosmogenic production yields with a few exceptions, the most
prominent case being 11C yield for which both codes return about 50% lower
values. The predicted {\mu}-n distance profile and the neutron multiplicity
distribution are found to be overall consistent with data.
