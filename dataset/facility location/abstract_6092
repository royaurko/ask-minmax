A new, very forward proton spectrometer (VFPS) with large acceptance is
proposed to be installed in the proton beam of the H1 experiment after the
luminosity upgrade in the year 2000. The spectrometer, located at 220 m
downstream of the interaction point is based on the Roman Pot technique and
consists of two stations situated in the cold section of the proton beam line.
Physics motivations and a brief description of the proton spectrometer are
presented.
