Van der Waals heterostructures built with 2D materials are of wide scientific
and technological interests, with potential to combine and extend the appealing
properties of differing 2D building blocks. One example under intensive
experimental investigation is heterobilayer of transition metal dichalcogenides
where the observation of interlayer exciton with electron and hole constituents
in different monolayers has implied rich device physics. Here we show that,
because of the inevitable twisting and lattice mismatch in heterobilayers,
interlayer excitons have six-fold degenerate light cones anomalously located at
finite velocities on the parabolic energy dispersion. With the change of
twisting angle, the polarization selection rules of these light cones evolve
from circularly polarized to elliptically polarized, with helicity specified by
the valley indices of the electron and hole. These finite-velocity light cones
allow unprecedented possibilities to optically inject valley polarization and
valley current, and the observation of both direct and inverse valley Hall
effects, by exciting interlayer excitons. Our findings suggest potential
excitonic circuits with valley functionalities, and unique opportunities to
study exciton dynamics and condensation phenomena in semiconducting 2D
heterostructures.
