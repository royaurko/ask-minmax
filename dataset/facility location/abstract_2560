In this paper we describe the support for data feed ingestion in AsterixDB,
an open-source Big Data Management System (BDMS) that provides a platform for
storage and analysis of large volumes of semi-structured data. Data feeds are a
mechanism for having continuous data arrive into a BDMS from external sources
and incrementally populate a persisted dataset and associated indexes. The need
to persist and index "fast-flowing" high-velocity data (and support ad hoc
analytical queries) is ubiquitous. However, the state of the art today involves
'gluing' together different systems. AsterixDB is different in being a unified
system with "native support" for data feed ingestion.
  We discuss the challenges and present the design and implementation of the
concepts involved in modeling and managing data feeds in AsterixDB. AsterixDB
allows the runtime behavior, allocation of resources and the offered degree of
robustness to be customized to suit the high-level application(s) that wish to
consume the ingested data. Initial experiments that evaluate scalability and
fault-tolerance of AsterixDB data feeds facility are reported.
