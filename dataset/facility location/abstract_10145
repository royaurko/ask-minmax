A telescope of two coaxial scintillation detectors (an upper thin CsJ crystal
of d63x0,35mm2 and a lower thick NaJ crystal of d150x100 mm2) located
vertically on the surface of the Earth was used to have during T=106 hours 20
events registered with increased specific ionization in each detector that
turned out to exceed 10 times the specific ionization caused by cosmic rays.
All the events excluding three background events are within two standard
deviations from a curve calculated for non-relativistic single charged
particles with mass M=(175 +/- 25)GeV/C2, flying vertically along the
telescope. Based upon the condition of being non-relativistic and the
limitations on the dimentions of the experimental set-up, it follows that their
life-time t >1,5*10-9s. Their intensity in cosmic rays on the Earth surface is
J=(1,8 +/- 0,4)*10-6cm-2 ster-1 s-1 (at E<6 GeV, P<50 GeV/C). The events
disclosed are in full correspondence with our phenomenological predictions,
with previous experimental results in the course of searching them for, and
with the predictions of the "mirror model" which interpreters a possibility of
existing hypothetical stable heavy hadrons (Erzions).
