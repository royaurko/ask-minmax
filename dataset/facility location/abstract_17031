We summarize radio and optical SETI programs based at the University of
California, Berkeley. The SEVENDIP optical pulse search looks for ns time scale
pulses at visible wavelengths using an automated 30 inch telescope. The ongoing
SERENDIP V.v sky survey searches for radio signals at the 300 meter Arecibo
Observatory. The currently installed configuration supports 128 million
channels over a 200 MHz bandwidth with ~1.6 Hz spectral resolution. SETI@home
uses the desktop computers of volunteers to analyze over 160 TB of data at
taken at Arecibo looking for two types of continuous wave signals and two types
of pulsed signals. A version to be released this summer adds autocorrelation
analysis to look for complex wave forms that have been repeated (and overlayed)
after a short delay. SETI@home will soon be processing data of Kepler exoplanet
systems collected at the GBT. The Astropulse project is the first SETI search
for $\mu$s time scale dispersed pulses in the radio spectrum. We recently
reobserved 114 sky locations where microsecond pulses were detected. This data
is in process of being transferred to Berkeley for analysis.
