Experiments are performed in which dust particles are levitated at varying
heights above the powered electrode in a RF plasma discharge by changing the
discharge power. The trajectories of particles dropped from the top of the
discharge chamber are used to reconstruct the vertical electric force acting on
the particles. The resulting data, together with the results from a
selfconsistent fluid model, are used to determine the lower levitation limit
for dust particles in the discharge and the approximate height above the lower
electrode where quasineutrality is attained, locating the sheath edge. These
results are then compared with current sheath models. It is also shown that
particles levitated within a few electron Debye lengths of the sheath edge are
located outside the linearly increasing portion of the electric field.
