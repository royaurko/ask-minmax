We propose to investigate the properties of nuclear matter by measuring the
elastic scattering of J/\psi on nuclei with high precision. The J/\psi mesons
are produced from the photons emitted in high energy electron-proton or
electron-nucleus scattering in the low-x region. The measurement could be
performed at the future ENC, EIC or LHeC facilities.
