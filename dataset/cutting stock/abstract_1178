A convex polyhedron $P$ is $k$-equiprojective if all of its orthogonal
projections, i.e., shadows, except those parallel to the faces of $P$ are
$k$-gon for some fixed value of $k$. Since 1968, it is an open problem to
construct all equiprojective polyhedra. Recently, Hasan and Lubiw [CGTA
40(2):148-155, 2008] have given a characterization of equiprojective polyhedra.
Based on their characterization, in this paper we discover some new
equiprojective polyhedra by cutting and gluing existing polyhedra.
