Three jets events in the e$^+$e$^-$ collisions at 91.2 GeV are investigated
using both HERWIG and JETSET Monte Carlo generators. The angles between the
three jets are used to identify the quark and gluon jets. The analysis at
parton level is done to ensure the reasonableness of this method and an angular
cut is ultilized to improve the purity of this identification. The multiplicity
inside the identified quark or gluon jets agree with the QCD predictions.
