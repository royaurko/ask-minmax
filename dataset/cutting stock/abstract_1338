We apply the semi-analytical galaxy formation code of Cole et al. to
investigate the formation of globular cluster (GC) systems in hierarchical
clustering scenarios. The nature of the model allows us to investigate the
properties of GC systems and their parent galaxies within a cosmological
framework, over a wide dynamic range of mass and time resolution. Assuming GCs
form during mergers of gaseous systems, the metal-rich peak of the classical
'bimodal' metallicity distribution of GCs naturally falls out of our model,
where such merging occurs over a wide range of redshifts. The physical origin
of old, metal-poor GCs (the metal-poor peak) is harder to understand, since
their formation must be decoupled from the ongoing star formation in these
systems at high redshift (z~5). Within the context of semi-analytic models in
general, a possible solution lies in a cut-off in the GC formation efficiency
at a characteristic local star formation rate.
