PSR J1903+0327 is a mili-second pulsar with a mass of 1.67 M_{\odot} in a
highly eccentric orbit (e=0.44) around a main-sequence star. This unique system
cannot be reconciled with current observations where milli-second pulsars are
generally seen to orbit white dwarfs in almost exactly circular orbits. Current
theoretical models of binary and stellar formation and evolution cannot explain
the high eccentricity of this system either. In this work, we present three new
epochs of optical spectroscopy for the companion to PSR J1903+0327, obtained to
confirm the association of the main-sequence star with the pulsar. These 3 new
epochs together with the 2 previous ones obtained by Freire et al. (2011)
firmly establish the high eccentricity of the companion's orbit as predicted by
pulsar timing. Using all five epochs of optical data, we have provided an
independent estimate of the mass-ratio, R=1.56\pm0.15 as well as the systemic
radial velocity of the binary, \gamma= 42.1\pm2.5 km/s. We constrain the
spectral type of the pulsar companion to lie between F5 V -- G0 V (a slightly
earlier type than suggested previously) by measuring the equivalent widths of
two of the three Ca-triplet lines (8498 \AA, 8542 \AA) and the Paschen line at
8598 \AA (P14); we also broadly constrain the metallicity of the companion.
Additionally, we have placed a somewhat better limit on the rotational velocity
of the pulsar companion of v_{rot}\sin{i} \leq 66 km/s which is still not
sufficient to allow a test of general relativity using this system.
