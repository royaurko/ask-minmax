We correct a mistake in the published version of our paper. Our new
conclusion is that the "implied leverage effect" for single stocks is
underestimated by option markets for short maturities and overestimated for
long maturities, while it is always overestimated for OEX options, except for
the shortest maturities where the revised theory and data match perfectly.
