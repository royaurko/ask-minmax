We analyze empirical data from the internet auction site Aukro.cz. The time
series of activity shows truncated fractal structure on scales from about 1
minute to about 1 day. The distribution of waiting times as well as the
distribution of number of auctions within fixed interval is a power law, with
exponents $1.5$ and $3$, respectively. Possible implications for the modeling
of stock-market fluctuations are briefly discussed.
