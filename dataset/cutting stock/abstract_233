We consider in a market model the cooperative emergence of value due to a
positive feedback between perception of needs and demand. Here we consider also
a negative feedback from production of the traded products, and find that this
cooperativity is robust, provided that the production rate is slow.
Cooperativity is found to be critically linked to the ability to minimize the
overall need, and thus disappears when the agents are poor, when the production
rate is large or when there is little trade. We further observe that a
cooperative economy may self-organize to compensate for an eventual slow
production rate of certain products, so that these products are found in
sizeable stocks. This differs qualitatively from an economy where cooperativity
did not develop, in which case no product has a stock larger than what its bare
production rate justifies. We also find that these results are robust in
relation to the spatial restriction of the agents.
