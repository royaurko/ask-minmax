We propose here a two-round relativistic bit commitment scheme where
committer commits in the first round and then confirms his/her commitment in
the second round. The scheme offers indefinite commitment time where both
committer and receiver extract non-locally correlated measurement outcomes
during the scheme that can be stored and revealed after arbitrarily long time.
We show that the proposed scheme turns out to be a multiparty bit commitment
scheme where both parties commit and reveal simultaneously. The multiparty
generalization would have applications in business and secure multiparty
computations such as managing joint bank account, holding joint shares in stock
exchange and blind bidding. The same bit commitment scheme can also be used for
the commitment of arbitrarily long classical bit strings. The scheme can be
applied efficiently with existing technologies; entanglement is required only
for time t=x/c where x is the special distance, can be as small as possible,
between the committer and receiver.
