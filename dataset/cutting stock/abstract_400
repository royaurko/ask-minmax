The scaling properties of the time series of asset prices and trading volumes
of stock markets are analysed. It is shown that similarly to the asset prices,
the trading volume data obey multi-scaling length-distribution of
low-variability periods. In the case of asset prices, such scaling behaviour
can be used for risk forecasts: the probability of observing next day a large
price movement is (super-universally) inversely proportional to the length of
the ongoing low-variability period. Finally, a method is devised for a
multi-factor scaling analysis. We apply the simplest, two-factor model to
equity index and trading volume time series.
