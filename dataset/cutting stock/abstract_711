In this article we derive the Bekenstein-Hawking formula of black hole
entropy from a single string. We consider a open string in the Rindler metric
which can be obtained in the large mass limit from the Schwarzschild black hole
metric. By solving the field equations we find a nontrivial solution with the
exact value of the Hawking temperature. We see that this solution gives us the
Bekenstein-Hawking formula of black hole entropy to leading order of
approximation. This string has effectively a rescaled string tension having a
relation with a redshift factor. It is also pointed out that this formalism is
extensible to other black holes in an arbitrary spacetime dimension. The
present work might lead us to a surprising idea that the recent picture which
the black hole entropy arises from D-brane excitations has the root of the
picture that the black hole entropy is stocked in a single long string with a
rescaled string tension.
