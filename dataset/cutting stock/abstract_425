In these notes, we present some methods and applications of large deviations
to finance and insurance. We begin with the classical ruin problem related to
the Cramer's theorem and give en extension to an insurance model with
investment in stock market. We then describe how large deviation approximation
and importance sampling are used in rare event simulation for option pricing.
We finally focus on large deviations methods in risk management for the
estimation of large portfolio losses in credit risk and portfolio performance
in market investment.
