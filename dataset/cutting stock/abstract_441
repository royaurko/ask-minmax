The analysis of observed conditional distributions of both lagged and
simultaneous intraday price increments of a basket of stocks reveals phenomena
of dependence - induced volatility smile and kurtosis reduction. A model based
on multivariate t-Student distribution shows that the observed effects are
caused by colelctive non-gaussian dependence properties of financial time
series.
