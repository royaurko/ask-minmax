The Equivalent Effect Function (EEF) is defined as having the identical
integral values on the control points of the original time series data; the EEF
can be obtained from the derivative of the spline function passing through the
integral values on the control points. By choosing control points with
different criteria, the EEF can be used to find the intrinsic mode
function(IMF, fluctuation) and the residue (trend); to fit the curve of the
original data function; and to take samples on original data with equivalent
effect. As examples of application, results of trend and fluctuation on real
stock historical data are calculated on different time scales. A new approach
to extend the EEF to 2D intrinsic mode decomposition is introduced to resolve
the inter slice non continuity problem, some photo image decomposition examples
are presented.
