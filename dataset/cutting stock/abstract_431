Elastic ed scattering, with deuteron polarization, up to high momentum
transfer provides detailed information on the deuteron wave function. This
determines the range dependence of the orbital and spin components of the one-
and two-body currents, restricting contributions of isobar and meson-exchange
currents and of quark/gluon degrees of freedom, as well as the nucleon
component. The R-matrix boundary condition model combines all these effects,
predicting nucleon-nucleon reactions and the deuteron form-factors
simultaneously. A brief description of the model is followed by a comparison of
its results with data, emphasizing the restrictions placed on the model by ed
elastic form-factors.
