In the framework of a strong dynamics for Electro-Weak Symmetry Breaking
(EWSB), both vector and scalar degrees of freedom have been studied in the
literature within an effective Lagrangian approach. Here we consider the case
in which both a scalar, $h$, and a vector, $V$ - respectively an iso-singlet
and an iso-triplet under a custodial SU(2) - are relevant with a mass below the
cut-off $\Lambda \approx 4\pi v$. We study the amplitudes for the processes
$W_L W_L \to W_L W_L, hh, V_{L}V_{L}, V_{L}h$. Requiring unitarity for the
elastic channel $W_L W_L \to W_L W_L$ we can reduce the parameter space to two
free parameters for given masses of the heavy vector and the scalar. We study
the numerical total cross sections for the associated productions $pp\to Vhjj$
by Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) and $pp\to Vh$ by Drell-Yan (DY) annihilation as
functions of these free parameters. The expected rates of same-sign di-lepton
and tri-lepton events from the decay of the $Vh$ final state are also given.
