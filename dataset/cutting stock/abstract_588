The new digital revolution of big data is deeply changing our capability of
understanding society and forecasting the outcome of many social and economic
systems. Unfortunately, information can be very heterogeneous in the
importance, relevance, and surprise it conveys, affecting severely the
predictive power of semantic and statistical methods. Here we show that the
aggregation of web users' behavior can be elicited to overcome this problem in
a hard to predict complex system, namely the financial market. Specifically, we
show that the combined use of sentiment analysis of news and browsing activity
of users of Yahoo! Finance allows to forecast intra-day and daily price changes
of a set of 100 highly capitalized US stocks traded in the period 2012-2013.
Sentiment analysis or browsing activity when taken alone have very small or no
predictive power. Conversely, when considering a news signal where in a given
time interval we compute the average sentiment of the clicked news, weighted by
the number of clicks, we show that for more the 50% of the companies such
signal Granger-causes price returns. Our result indicates a
"wisdom-of-the-crowd" effect that allows to exploit users' activity to identify
and weigh properly the relevant and surprising news, enhancing considerably the
forecasting power of the news sentiment.
