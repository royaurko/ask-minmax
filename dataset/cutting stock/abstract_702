The usual derivation of the Fokker-Planck partial differential eqn. assumes
the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation for a Markov process. Starting instead with an
Ito stochastic differential equation we argue that finitely many states of
memory are allowed in Kolmogorov's two pdes, K1 (the backward time pde) and K2
(the Fokker-Planck pde), and show that a Chapman-Kolmogorov eqn. follows as
well. We adapt Friedman's derivation to emphasize that finite memory is not
excluded. We then give an example of a Gaussian transition density with 1 state
memory satisfying both K1, K2, and the Chapman-Kolmogorov eqns. We begin the
paper by explaining the meaning of backward diffusion, and end by using our
interpretation to produce a new, short proof that the Green function for the
Black-Scholes pde describes a Martingale in the risk neutral discounted stock
price.
