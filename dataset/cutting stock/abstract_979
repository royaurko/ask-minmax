We discuss and solve a model for a game with many players, where a subset of
truely deciding players is embedded into a hierarchy of dependent agents.
  These interdependencies modify the game matrix and the Nash equilibria for
the deciding players. In a concrete example, we recognize the partition
function of the Ising model and for high dependency we observe a phase
transition to a new Nash equilibrium, which is the Pareto-efficient outcome.
  An example we have in mind is the game theory for major shareholders in a
stock market, where intermediate companies decide according to a majority vote
of their owners and compete for the final profit. In our model, these
interdependency eventually forces cooperation.
