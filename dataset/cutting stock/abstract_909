This paper studies a continuous-time market {under stochastic environment}
where an agent, having specified an investment horizon and a target terminal
mean return, seeks to minimize the variance of the return with multiple stocks
and a bond. In the considered model firstly proposed by [3], the mean returns
of individual assets are explicitly affected by underlying Gaussian economic
factors. Using past and present information of the asset prices, a
partial-information stochastic optimal control problem with random coefficients
is formulated. Here, the partial information is due to the fact that the
economic factors can not be directly observed. Via dynamic programming theory,
the optimal portfolio strategy can be constructed by solving a deterministic
forward Riccati-type ordinary differential equation and two linear
deterministic backward ordinary differential equations.
