We study quivers with potential (QPs) whose Jacobian algebras are finite
dimensional selfinjective. They are an analogue of the `good QPs' studied by
Bocklandt whose Jacobian algebras are 3-Calabi-Yau. We show that
2-representation-finite algebras are truncated Jacobian algebras of
selfinjective QPs, which are factor algebras of Jacobian algebras by certain
sets of arrows called cuts. We show that selfinjectivity of QPs is preserved
under successive mutation with respect to orbits of the Nakayama permutation.
We give a sufficient condition for all truncated Jacobian algebras of a fixed
QP to be derived equivalent. We introduce planar QPs which provide us with a
rich source of selfinjective QPs.
