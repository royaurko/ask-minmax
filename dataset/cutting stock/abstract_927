Lions and Musiela (2007) give sufficient conditions to verify when a
stochastic exponential of a continuous local martingale is a martingale or a
uniformly integrable martingale. Blei and Engelbert (2009) and Mijatovi\'c and
Urusov (2012c) give necessary and sufficient conditions in the case of perfect
correlation (\rho=1). For financial applications, such as checking the
martingale property of the stock price process in correlated stochastic
volatility models, we extend their work to the arbitrary correlation case
(-1<=\rho<=1). We give a complete classification of the convergence properties
of integral functionals of time-homogeneous diffusions and generalize results
in Mijatovi\'c and Urusov (2012b) (2012c) with alternate proofs avoiding the
use of separating times (concept introduced by Cherny and Urusov (2004) and
extensively used in the proofs of Mijatovi\'c and Urusov (2012c)).
