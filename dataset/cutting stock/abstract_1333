We present an analysis of different sets of gravitational N-body simulations,
all describing the dynamics of discrete particles with a small initial velocity
dispersion. They encompass very different initial particle configurations,
different numerical algorithms for the computation of the force, with or
without the space expansion of cosmological models. Despite these differences
we find in all cases that the non-linear clustering which results is
essentially the same, with a well-defined simple power-law behaviour in the
two-point correlations in the range from a few times the lower cut-off in the
gravitational force to the scale at which fluctuations are of order one. We
argue, presenting quantitative evidence, that this apparently universal
behaviour can be understood by the domination of the small scale contribution
to the gravitational force, coming initially from nearest neighbor particles.
