We derive a generalized zero-range pseudopotential applicable to all partial
wave solutions to the Schroedinger equation based on a delta-shell potential in
the limit that the shell radius approaches zero. This properly models all
higher order multipole moments not accounted for with a monopolar delta
function at the origin, as used in the familiar Fermi pseudopotential for
s-wave scattering. By making the strength of the potential energy dependent, we
derive self-consistent solutions for the entire energy spectrum of the
realistic potential. We apply this to study two particles in an isotropic
harmonic trap, interacting through a central potential, and derive analytic
expressions for the energy eigenstates and eigenvalues.
