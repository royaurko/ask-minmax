We consider options that pays the complexity deficiency of a sequence of up
and down ticks of a stock upon exercise. We study the price of European and
American versions of this option numerically for automatic complexity, and
theoretically for Kolmogorov complexity. We also consider the case of run
complexity, which is a restricted form of automatic complexity.
