Classical technical analysis methods of stock evolution are recalled, i.e.
the notion of moving averages and momentum indicators. The moving averages lead
to define death and gold crosses, resistance and support lines. Momentum
indicators lead the price trend, thus give signals before the price trend turns
over. The classical technical analysis investment strategy is thereby sketched.
Next, we present a generalization of these tricks drawing on physical
principles, i.e. taking into account not only the price of a stock but also the
volume of transactions. The latter becomes a time dependent generalized mass.
The notion of pressure, acceleration and force are deduced. A generalized
(kinetic) energy is easily defined. It is understood that the momentum
indicators take into account the sign of the fluctuations, while the energy is
geared toward the absolute value of the fluctuations. They have different
patterns which are checked by searching for the crossing points of their
respective moving averages. The case of IBM evolution over 1990-2000 is used
for illustrations.
