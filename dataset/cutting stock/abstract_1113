Ranking temporal data has not been studied until recently, even though
ranking is an important operator (being promoted as a firstclass citizen) in
database systems. However, only the instant top-k queries on temporal data were
studied in, where objects with the k highest scores at a query time instance t
are to be retrieved. The instant top-k definition clearly comes with
limitations (sensitive to outliers, difficult to choose a meaningful query time
t). A more flexible and general ranking operation is to rank objects based on
the aggregation of their scores in a query interval, which we dub the aggregate
top-k query on temporal data. For example, return the top-10 weather stations
having the highest average temperature from 10/01/2010 to 10/07/2010; find the
top-20 stocks having the largest total transaction volumes from 02/05/2011 to
02/07/2011. This work presents a comprehensive study to this problem by
designing both exact and approximate methods (with approximation quality
guarantees). We also provide theoretical analysis on the construction cost, the
index size, the update and the query costs of each approach. Extensive
experiments on large real datasets clearly demonstrate the efficiency, the
effectiveness, and the scalability of our methods compared to the baseline
methods.
