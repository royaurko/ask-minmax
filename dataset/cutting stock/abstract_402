We propose an improvement of the known DFT-based indexing technique for fast
retrieval of similar time sequences. We use the last few Fourier coefficients
in the distance computation without storing them in the index since every
coefficient at the end is the complex conjugate of a coefficient at the
beginning and as strong as its counterpart. We show analytically that this
observation can accelerate the search time of the index by more than a factor
of two. This result was confirmed by our experiments, which were carried out on
real stock prices and synthetic data.
