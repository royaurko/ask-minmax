We construct thin-shell electrically charged wormholes in d-dimensional
general relativity with a cosmological constant. The wormholes constructed can
have different throat geometries, namely, spherical, planar and hyperbolic.
Unlike the spherical geometry, the planar and hyperbolic geometries allow for
different topologies and in addition can be interpreted as higher-dimensional
domain walls or branes connecting two universes. In the construction we use the
cut-and-paste procedure by joining together two identical vacuum spacetime
solutions. Properties such as the null energy condition and geodesics are
studied. A linear stability analysis around the static solutions is carried
out. A general result for stability is obtained from which previous results are
recovered.
