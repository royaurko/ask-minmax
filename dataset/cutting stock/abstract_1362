We have measured the microwave dissipation at 10 GHz in a Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8
single crystal, between 75 and 50 K, as a function of the static magnetic field
applied parallel to the c axis. We observe a clear-cut onset in the dissipation
precisely at the melting field Hm(T), that we identify in the same sample by a
step in the static magnetization. We show that this onset can be assigned to
the c-axis resistivity becoming finite in our whole temperature range, whereas
the in-plane resistivity displays a thermally activated behavior. This suggests
that pinning is efficient even at 10 GHz. The normal state dissipation is
recovered at field much higher than the melting field, implying that decoupling
develops mostly gradually over a large field range.
