During the execution of large scale construction projects performed by
Virtual Organizations (VO), relatively complex technical models have to be
exchanged between the VO members. For linking the trade and transfer of these
models, a so-called multi-model container format was developed. Considering the
different skills and tasks of the involved partners, it is not necessary for
them to know all the models in every technical detailing. Furthermore, the
model size can lead to a delay in communication. In this paper an approach is
presented for defining model cut-outs according to the current project context.
Dynamic dependencies to the project context as well as static dependencies on
the organizational structure are mapped in a context-sensitive rule. As a
result, an approach for dynamic filtering of multi-models is obtained which
ensures, together with a filtering service, that the involved VO members get a
simplified view of complex multi-models as well as sufficient permissions
depending on their tasks.
