We discuss the signature of the anomalous breaking of the superconformal
symmetry in $\mathcal{N}=1$ super Yang Mills theory, mediated by the
Ferrara-Zumino hypercurrent ($\mathcal{J}$) with two vector ($\mathcal V$)
supercurrents $(\mathcal{JVV})$ and its manifestation in the anomaly action, in
the form of anomaly poles. This allows to investigate in a unified way both
conformal and chiral anomalies. The analysis is performed in parallel to the
Standard Model, for comparison. We investigate, in particular, massive
deformations of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ theory and the spectral densities of the
anomaly form factors which are extracted from the components of this
correlator. In this extended framework it is shown that all the anomaly form
factors are characterized by spectral densities which flow with the mass
deformation. In particular, the continuum contributions from the two-particle
cuts of the intermediate states turn into into poles in the zero mass limit,
with a single sum rule satisfied by each component. Non anomalous form factors,
instead, in the same anomalous correlators, are characterized by non-integrable
spectral densities. These tend to uniform distributions as one moves towards
the conformal point, with a clear dual behaviour. As in a previous analysis of
the dilaton pole of the Standard Model, also in this case the poles can be
interpreted as signaling the exchange of a composite dilaton/axion/dilatino
(ADD) multiplet in the effective Lagrangian.[...]
