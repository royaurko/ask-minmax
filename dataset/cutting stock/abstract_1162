The statistical property of a growing scale-free network is studied based on
an earlier model proposed by Krapivsky, Rodgers, and Redner [Phys. Rev. Lett.
86, 5401 (2001)], with the additional constraints of forbidden of
self-connection and multiple links of the same direction between any two nodes.
Scaling exponents in the range of 1-2 are obtained through Monte Carlo
simulations and various clustering coefficients are calculated, one of which,
$C_{\rm out}$, is of order $10^{-1}$, indicating the network resembles a
small-world. The out-degree distribution has an exponential cut-off for large
out-degree.
