We present optical images for 9 new clusters of galaxies we have found in a
reanalysis of the Einstein IPC images comprising the Extended Medium
Sensitivity Survey (EMSS). Based on the presence of a red sequence of galaxies
in a color-magnitude (CM) diagram, a redshift is estimated for each cluster.
Galaxy overdensities (cluster richnesses) are measured in each field using the
B_gc statistic which allows their plausible identification with the X-ray
emission. The nature of our X-ray detection algorithm suggests that most of
these clusters have low X-ray surface brightness (LSB) compared to the
previously known EMSS clusters. We compare the optical and X-ray observations
of these clusters with the well-studied Canadian Network for Observational
Cosmology (CNOC) subsample of the EMSS, and conclude that the new clusters
exhibit a similar range of optical richnesses, X-ray luminosities, and,
somewhat surprisingly, galaxy populations as the predominantly rich, relaxed
EMSS/CNOC clusters.
