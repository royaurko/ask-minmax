Quasars representative of the populous faint end of the luminosity function
are frustratingly dim with m~24 at intermediate redshift; moreover groundbased
surveys for such faint QSOs suffer substantial morphological contamination by
compact galaxies having similar colors. In order to establish a more reliable
ultrafaint QSO sample, we used the APO 3.5-m telescope to take deep groundbased
U-band CCD images in fields previously imaged in V,I with WFPC2/HST. Our
approach hence combines multicolor photometry with the 0.1" spatial resolution
of HST, to establish a morphological and multicolor survey for QSOs extending
about 2 magnitudes fainter than most extant groundbased surveys. We present
results for the "Groth-Westphal Strip", in which we identify 10 high likelihood
UV-excess candidates having stellar or stellar-nucleus+galaxy morphology in
WFPC2. For m(606)<24.0 (roughly B<24.5) the surface density of such QSO
candidates is 420 (+180,-130) per square degree, or a surface density of 290
(+160,-110) per square degree with an additional V-I cut that may further
exclude compact emission line galaxies. Even pending confirming spectroscopy,
the observed surface density of QSO candidates is already low enough to yield
interesting comparisons: our measures agree extremely well with the predictions
of several recent luminosity function models.
