We present a self-interaction corrected local spin density (SIC-LSD) study of
the electronic structure and possible charge order of magnetite,
Fe$_{3}$O$_{4}$. The issue of charge order in magnetite is explored in both
cubic and orthorhombic structures, the latter being an approximation to the
true, low temperature, monoclinic structure. We find that the Verwey charge
ordered phase is not the groundstate solution for this compound neither in
cubic nor orthorhombic structure.
