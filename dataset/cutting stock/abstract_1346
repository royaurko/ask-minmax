We present the analysis of a 100ksec Integral(3-100kev) observation of the
transient X-ray pulsar V0332+53 inoutburst. The source is pulsating at
P=4.3751+/-0.0002s with a clear double pulse from 6 kev to 60 kev. The average
flux was ~550mCrab between 20 kev and 60 kev. We modeled the broad band
continuum from 5 kev to 100 kev with a power-law modified by an exponential cut
off. We observe three cyclotron lines: the fundamental line at 24.9+/-0.1 kev,
the first harmonic at 50.5+/-0.1 kev as well as the second harmonic
at71.7+/-0.8 kev, thus confirming the discovery of the harmonic lines by Coburn
et al. (2005) in RXTE data.
