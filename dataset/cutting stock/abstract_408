I review what is known about the quark and gluon spin distributions in the
nucleon. I discuss in some detail (a) the existence of sum rules for angular
momentum; (b) the interpretation and possible measurement of the nucleon's
transversity distributions; and (c) the uses of spin-dependent fragmentation
functions.
