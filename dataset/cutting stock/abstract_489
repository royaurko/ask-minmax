We propose a nonparametric procedure to test for changes in correlation
matrices at an unknown point in time. The new test requires only mild
assumptions on the serial dependence structure and has considerable power in
finite samples. We derive the asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis
of no change as well as local power results and apply the test to stock
returns.
