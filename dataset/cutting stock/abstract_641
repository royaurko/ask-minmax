The concepts of scale invariance, self-similarity and scaling have been
fruitfully applied to the study of price fluctuations in financial markets.
After a brief review of the properties of stable Levy distributions and their
applications to market data we indicate the shortcomings of such models and
describe the truncated Levy flight as an alternative model for price movements.
Furthermore, studying the dependence structure of the price increments shows
that while their autocorrelation function decreases rapidly to zero, the
correlation of their squares and absolute values shows a slow power law decay,
indicating persistence in the scale of fluctuations, a property which can be
related to the anomalous scaling of the kurtosis. In the last section we
review, in the light of these empirical facts, recent attempts to draw
analogies between scaling in financial markets and in turbulent flows.
