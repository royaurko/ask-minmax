We review the results of a model of how nucleation of a new universe occurs,
assuming a di quark identification for soliton-anti soliton constituent parts
of a scalar field. The intial potential system employed is semi classical in
nature, becoming non-classical at the end of chaotic inflation at the same time
cosmological expansion is dominated by the Einstein cosmological constant. We
use Scherrer's derivation of a sound speed being zero during initial
inflationary cosmology, and cange it afterwards as the slope of the scalar
field moves away from a thin wall approximation. All this is to aid in a data
reconstruction problem of how to account for the initial origins of CMB due to
dark matter since effective field theories as presently constructed require a
cut off value for applicability of their potential structure. This is often at
the cost of, especially in early universe theoretical models, of clearly
defined baryogenesis, and of a well defined mechanism of phase transitions. The
material below is now a proposal, in part accepted as a point of discussion as
a white paper (appropriately) submitted to the Dark Energy Task Force, in its
mission to advise (through its parent committees) the NSF, NASA and DOE. This
was for helping to select both ground-based and space-based techniques for
analyzing data as well as recommending the science requirements for a
space-based dark energy mission.
