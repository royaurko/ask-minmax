Based on the observables $\MW$, $\Gamma_l$, $\bar\sw^2(\MZ^2)$, we evaluate
the parameters $\Delta x, \Delta y$ and $\varepsilon$ at one-loop level within
an electroweak massive vector-boson theory, which does not employ the Higgs
mechanism. The theoretical results are consistent with the experimental ones on
$\Delta x$, $\Delta y$, $\varepsilon$. The theoretical prediction for $\Delta
y$ coincides with the standard-model one (apart from numerically irrelevant
terms which vanish for $\MH\to\infty$). Non-renormalizability only affects
$\Delta x$ and $\varepsilon$, which differ from the standard-model results by
the replacement $\log\MH\to\log\Lambda$ for a heavy Higgs mass, $\MH$ (where
$\Lambda$ denotes an effective UV cut-off).
