One of the main challenges in building a large scale publish-subscribe
infrastructure in an enterprise network, is to provide the subscribers with the
required information, while minimizing the consumed host and network resources.
Typically, previous approaches utilize either IP multicast or point-to-point
unicast for efficient dissemination of the information.
  In this work, we propose a novel hybrid framework, which is a combination of
both multicast and unicast data dissemination. Our hybrid framework allows us
to take the advantages of both multicast and unicast, while avoiding their
drawbacks. We investigate several algorithms for computing the best mapping of
publishers' transmissions into multicast and unicast transport.
  Using extensive simulations, we show that our hybrid framework reduces
consumed host and network resources, outperforming traditional solutions. To
insure the subscribers interests closely resemble those of real-world settings,
our simulations are based on stock market data and on recorded IBM WebShpere
subscriptions.
