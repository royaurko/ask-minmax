This paper presents the preliminary results of a multicolour photometric
study of the young open cluster Stock 14 and adjacent fields. The reddening,
distance and age of the cluster were determined from colour-colour and
colour-magnitude diagrams by means of isochrone fitting. Fourier analysis of
the acquired time-series data was performed, which resulted in the discovery of
new pulsating variable stars and candidates for such objects.
