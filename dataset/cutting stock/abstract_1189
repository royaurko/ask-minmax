Cut-and-paste operations on symplectic manifolds called star surgery were
introduced and shown to be an effective tool in constructing examples of exotic
4-manifolds in [11]. Here we provide more examples of star surgery operations,
and define an operation called sprouting which generates and infinite family of
star surgeries from a single star surgery. Through these examples we begin to
establish a broader correspondence between two different methods of finding and
classifying symplectic fillings. We also prove that star surgeries always
decrease Euler characteristic, and that there are examples of star surgeries
which cannot be realized by a sequence of symplectic rational blow-downs.
