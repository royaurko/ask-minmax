We study the analytical properties of a one-side order book model in which
the flows of limit and market orders are Poisson processes and the distribution
of lifetimes of cancelled orders is exponential. Although simplistic, the model
provides an analytical tractability that should not be overlooked. Using basic
results for birth-and-death processes, we build an analytical formula for the
shape (depth) of a continuous order book model which is both founded by market
mechanisms and very close to empirically tested formulas. We relate this shape
to the probability of execution of a limit order, highlighting a law of
conservation of the flows of orders in an order book. We then extend our model
by allowing random sizes of limit orders, hereby allowing to study the
relationship between the size of the incoming limit orders and the shape of the
order book. Our theoretical model shows that, for a given total volume of
incoming limit orders, the less limit orders are submitted (i.e. the larger the
average size of these limit orders), the deeper is the order book around the
spread. This theoretical relationship is finally empirically tested on several
stocks traded on the Paris stock exchange.
