In this review, we look back upon the literature, which had the GREGOR solar
telescope project as its subject including science cases, telescope subsystems,
and post-focus instruments. The articles date back to the year 2000, when the
initial concepts for a new solar telescope on Tenerife were first presented at
scientific meetings. This comprehensive bibliography contains literature until
the year 2012, i.e., the final stages of commissioning and science
verification. Taking stock of the various publications in peer-reviewed
journals and conference proceedings also provides the "historical" context for
the reference articles in this special issue of Astronomische
Nachrichten/Astronomical Notes.
