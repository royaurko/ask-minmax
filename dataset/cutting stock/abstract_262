In the paper we compare the modelling ability of discrete-time multivariate
Stochastic Volatility models to describe the conditional correlations between
stock index returns. We consider four trivariate SV models, which differ in the
structure of the conditional covariance matrix. Specifications with zero,
constant and time-varying conditional correlations are taken into account. As
an example we study trivariate volatility models for the daily log returns on
the WIG, SP500, and FTSE100 indexes. In order to formally compare the relative
explanatory power of SV specifications we use the Bayesian principles of
comparing statistic models. Our results are based on the Bayes factors and
implemented through Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. The results indicate
that the most adequate specifications are those that allow for time-varying
conditional correlations and that have as many latent processes as there are
conditional variances and covariances. The empirical results clearly show that
the data strongly reject the assumption of constant conditional correlations.
