In this paper, we present the possibility of using the Ising like models to
explain by Statistical Physics means the connection between the financial
discontinuities (herd behavior, bubbles, crashes) and "critical points" in
physical of phase transitions due to cooperative effects. For this purpose
there are investigated 1/2 and 3/2 Ising like spin models which involve one or
more macroscopical order parameters, which can have nonanlitical behavior in
the critical domain.
