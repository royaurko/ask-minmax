We report the first INTEGRAL timing and spectral analysis of the high mass
X-ray binary source 2S 0114+65 at high energies (5-100 keV). The pulse period
was found at 2.668 hr with a high pulsed fraction, ~80% in both the 20-40 keV
and 40-80 keV energy bands. The spin-up trend over ~8 years was measured to be
-8.9 * 10^{-7}. The hard X-ray spectrum obtained with JEM-X/ISGRI is well
described by a high energy exponential cut-off power law model where the
estimated luminosity is 1.8 * 10^{36} erg/s in the 5-100 keV energy band, for a
source distance of 7.2 kpc. We tentatively identify a cyclotron resonance
scattering feature at ~22 keV with one harmonic, implying a magnetic field of
2.5 * 10^{12} G.
