Levy processes with completely monotone jumps appear frequently in various
applications of Probability. For example, all popular stock price models based
on Levy processes (such as the Variance Gamma, CGMY/KoBoL and Normal Inverse
Gaussian) belong to this class. In this paper we continue the work started in
[10,18] and develop a simple yet very efficient method for approximating the
processes with completely monotone jumps by processes with hyperexponential
jumps, the latter being the most convenient class for performing numerical
computations. Our approach is based on connecting Levy processes with
completely monotone jumps with several areas of classical analysis, including
Pade approximations, Gaussian quadrature and orthogonal polynomials.
