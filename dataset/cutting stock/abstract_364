We call attention against what seems to a widely held misconception according
to which large crashes are the largest events of distributions of price
variations with fat tails. We demonstrate on the Dow Jones Industrial index
that with high probability the three largest crashes in this century are
outliers. This result supports suggestion that large crashes result from
specific amplification processes that might lead to observable pre-cursory
signatures.
