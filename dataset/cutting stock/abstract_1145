Enzyme sequences and structures are routinely used in the biological sciences
as queries to search for functionally related enzymes in online databases. To
this end, one usually departs from some notion of similarity, comparing two
enzymes by looking for correspondences in their sequences, structures or
surfaces. For a given query, the search operation results in a ranking of the
enzymes in the database, from very similar to dissimilar enzymes, while
information about the biological function of annotated database enzymes is
ignored.
  In this work we show that rankings of that kind can be substantially improved
by applying kernel-based learning algorithms. This approach enables the
detection of statistical dependencies between similarities of the active cleft
and the biological function of annotated enzymes. This is in contrast to
search-based approaches, which do not take annotated training data into
account. Similarity measures based on the active cleft are known to outperform
sequence-based or structure-based measures under certain conditions. We
consider the Enzyme Commission (EC) classification hierarchy for obtaining
annotated enzymes during the training phase. The results of a set of sizeable
experiments indicate a consistent and significant improvement for a set of
similarity measures that exploit information about small cavities in the
surface of enzymes.
