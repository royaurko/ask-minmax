Nuclear waste cleanup is challenged by the handling of feed stocks that are
both unknown and complex. Plasma filtering, operating on dissociated elements,
offers advantages over chemical methods in processing such wastes. The costs
incurred by plasma mass filtering for nuclear waste pretreatment, before
ultimate disposal, are similar to those for chemical pretreatment. However,
significant savings might be achieved in minimizing the waste mass. This
advantage may be realized over a large range of chemical waste compositions,
thereby addressing the heterogeneity of legacy nuclear waste.
