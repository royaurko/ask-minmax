The ALICE detector was designed to identify hadrons over a wide range of
transverse momentum at mid-rapidity. Here measurements of light charged ({\pi},
K, p) and neutral ({\Lambda}, K0S) hadrons in Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN) =
2.76 TeV are presented with additional data from a pp reference at sqrt(s) = 7
TeV. Such measurements are crucial for understanding the properties of the
fireball produced in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. The particle-type
dependence of the spectra and the yields of particles extracted give
information on the expansion dynamics and chemical composition respectively. In
addition studying the ratio of baryons to mesons may help in understanding the
mechanisms by which hadronisation takes place. We find that, when comparing to
data at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC, a more strongly
expanding system is created with a similar relative population of hadron
species. We also see that collective effects or complex mechanisms responsible
for a relative enhancement of baryons have an influence at a much higher pT
than was previously seen.
