A generalized semitoric system F:=(J,H): M --> R^2 on a symplectic 4-manifold
is an integrable system whose essential properties are that F is a proper map,
its set of regular values is connected, J generates an S^1-action and is not
necessarily proper. These systems can exhibit focus-focus singularities, which
correspond to fibers of F which are topologically multipinched tori. The image
F(M) is a singular affine manifold which contains a distinguished set of
isolated points in its interior: the focus-focus values {(x_i,y_i)} of F. By
performing a vertical cutting procedure along the lines {x:=x_i}, we construct
a homeomorphism f : F(M) --> f(F(M)), which restricts to an affine
diffeomorphism away from these vertical lines, and generalizes a construction
of Vu Ngoc. The set \Delta:=f(F(M)) in R^2 is a symplectic invariant of
(M,\omega,F), which encodes the affine structure of F. Moreover, \Delta may be
described as a countable union of planar regions of four distinct types, where
each type is defined as the region bounded between the graphs of two functions
with various properties (piecewise linear, continuous, convex, etc). If F is a
toric system, \Delta is a convex polygon (as proven by Atiyah and
Guillemin-Sternberg) and f is the identity.
