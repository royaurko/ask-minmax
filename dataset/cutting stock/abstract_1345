We present a specific periodicity of the Galaxy images in the multipole
domain which can be used for separation of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) signal from the Galaxy and foreground component.
  This method takes into consideration all the coefficients of the expansion of
the signal from the sky \Delta T(\Theta, \phi) into spherical harmonics and
dealing with combination of multipoles a_{l,m} and a_{l+\Delta,m} for each
multipole mode (\ell, -\ell \le m \le \ell) from the whole sky without galactic
cut, masks or any dissection of the whole sky into disjoint regions. For the
polar coordinate system we use particular values for \Delta=4n, n=1,2,... which
remove all bright point-like sources localized in the Galactic plane and strong
diffused component down to the CMB level. To illustrate that significant
correlations of the point like sources and foregrounds a_{l,m},a_{l+\Delta,m}
coefficients we apply this method to the WMAP Q,V and W bands in order to
remove these marks of Galaxy from the maps. We believe that our method would be
useful for separation of the CMB signal from different kind of "noises" in the
maps.
