Until recently, punctuation has received very little attention in the
linguistics and computational linguistics literature. Since the publication of
Nunberg's (1990) monograph on the topic, however, punctuation has seen its
stock begin to rise: spurred in part by Nunberg's ground-breaking work, a
number of valuable inquiries have been subsequently undertaken, including Hovy
and Arens (1991), Dale (1991), Pascual (1993), Jones (1994), and Briscoe
(1994). Continuing this line of research, I investigate in this paper how
Nunberg's approach to presenting punctuation (and other formatting devices)
might be incorporated into NLG systems. Insofar as the present paper focuses on
the proper syntactic treatment of punctuation, it differs from these other
subsequent works in that it is the first to examine this issue from the
generation perspective.
