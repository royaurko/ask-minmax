Volatility of intra-day stock market indices computed at various time
horizons exhibits a scaling behaviour that differs from what would be expected
from a fractional Brownian motion (fBm). We investigate this anomalous scaling
by using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method, which separates time series
into a set of cyclical components at different time-scales. By applying EMD to
fBm, we retrieve a scaling law that relates the variance of the components to a
power law of the oscillating period. In contrast, when analysing 22 different
stock market indices, we observe deviations from the fBm and Brownian motion
scaling behaviour. We discuss and quantify these deviations, associating them
to the characteristics of financial markets, with the larger deviations
corresponding to the less developed markets.
