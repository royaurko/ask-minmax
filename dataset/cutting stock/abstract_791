L-shape probability distributions are extremely non-Gaussian distributions
that have been surprisingly successful in describing the frequency of
occurrence of extreme events, ranging from stock market crashes and natural
disasters, the structure of biological systems, fractals, and optical rogue
waves. In this paper, we show that fluctuations in stimulated Raman scattering
in silicon, as well as in coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, can follow
extreme value statistics and provide mathematical insight into the origin of
this behavior. As an example of the experimental observations, we find that 16%
of the Stokes pulses account for 84% of the pump energy transfer, an uncanny
resemblance to the empirical Pareto principle or the 80/20 rule that describes
important observation in socioeconomics.
