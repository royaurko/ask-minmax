In this work, we present different representations of Khuri-Treiman equation,
the advantage and disadvantage of each representations are discussed. Using a
toy model for scattering amplitude, we study the sensitivity of solution of KT
equation to the left hand cut of this toy model and to the different
approximate methods. At last, we briefly discuss Watson's theorem when three
particles in final states are involved.
