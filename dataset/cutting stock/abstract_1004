Light cones of Schwarzschild geometry are studied in connection to the Null
Surface Formulation and gravitational lensing. The paper studies the light cone
cut function's singularity structure, gives exact gravitational lensing
equations, and shows that the "pseudo-Minkowski" coordinates are well defined
within the model considered.
