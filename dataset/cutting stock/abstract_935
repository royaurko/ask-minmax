Identifying and characterizing the parent phases of iron-based
superconductors is an important step towards understanding the mechanism for
their high temperature superconductivity. We present an investigation into the
magnetic interactions in the Mott insulator La2O2Fe2OSe2. This iron oxyselenide
adopts a 2-k magnetic structure with low levels of magnetic frustration. This
magnetic ground state is found to be dominated by next-nearest neighbor
interactions J2 and J2' and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the Fe2+ site,
leading to 2D-Ising-like spin S=2 fluctuations. In contrast to calculations,
the values are small and confine the spin excitations below ~ 25 meV. This is
further corroborated by sum rules of neutron scattering. This indicates that
superconductivity in related materials may derive from a weakly coupled and
unfrustrated magnetic structure.
