Consider a process satisfying a stochastic differential equation with unknown
drift parameter, and suppose that discrete observations are given. It is known
that a simple least squares estimator (LSE) can be consistent, but unstable
under finite samples when the noise process has jumps. We propose a filter to
cut large shocks from data, and construct the same LSE from data selected by
the filter. The proposed estimator can be asymptotically equivallent to the
usual LSE, whose asymptotic distribution strongly depends on the noise process.
However it is interesting to note that it could be asymptotically normal by
choosing the filter suitably if the noise is a L\'evy process. We try to
justify this phenomenon theoretically.
