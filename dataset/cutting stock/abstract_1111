Ultraviolet observations of the QSO 3C 263 (zem = 0.652) with COS and FUSE
reveal O VI absorption systems at z = 0.06342 and 0.14072 . WIYN multi-object
spectrograph observations provide information about the galaxies associated
with the absorbers. The multi-phase system at z = 0.06342 traces cool
photoionized gas and warm collisionally ionized gas associated with a L ~
0.31L* compact spiral emission line galaxy with an impact parameter of 63 kpc.
The cool photoionized gas in the absorber is well modeled with log U ~ -2.6,
log N(H) ~17.8, log n(H) ~ -3.3 and [Si/H] = -0.14\pm0.23. The collisionally
ionized gas containing C IV and O VI probably arises in cooling shock heated
transition temperature gas with log T ~ 5.5. The absorber is likely tracing
circumgalactic gas enriched by gas ejected from the spiral emission line
galaxy. The simple system at z = 0.14072 only contains O VI and broad and
narrow H I. The O VI with b = 33.4\pm11.9 km s-1 is likely associated with the
broad H I {\lambda}1215 absorption with b = 86.7\pm15.4 km s-1. The difference
in Doppler parameters implies the detection of a very large column of warm gas
with log T = 5.61(+0.16, -0.25), log N(H) = 19.54(+0.26, -0.44) and [O/H] =
-1.48 (+0.46, -0.26). This absorber is possibly associated with a 1.6L*
absorption line galaxy with an impact parameter of 617 kpc although an origin
in warm filament gas or in the halo of a fainter galaxy is more likely.
