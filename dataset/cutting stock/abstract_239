It has been assumed that arbitrage profits are not possible in efficient
markets, because future prices are not predictable. Here we show that
predictability alone is not a sufficient measure of market efficiency. We
instead propose to measure inefficiencies of markets in terms of the maximal
profit an ideal trader can take out from a market. In a stock market model with
an evolutionary selection of agents this method reveals that the mean relative
amount of realizable profits $P$ is very limited and we find that it decays
with rising number of agents in the markets. Our results show that markets may
self-organize their collective dynamics such that it becomes very sensitive to
profit attacks which demonstrates that a high degree of market efficiency can
coexist with predictability.
