We investigate production and detection prospects of the quintuplet heavy
leptons at the LHC in the context of a new model which is proposed as a viable
and testable solution to the neutrino masses problem. We classify the signals,
carry out a full simulation on the signals and the relevant backgrounds at the
14 TeV LHC. After applying suitable kinematic cuts, the background events are
substantially suppressed. The signals of the heavy leptons might be detected at
the 14 TeV LHC.
