Using public data (Forbes Global 2000) we show that the asset sizes for the
largest global firms follow a Pareto distribution in an intermediate range,
that is ``interrupted'' by a sharp cut-off in its upper tail, where it is
totally dominated by financial firms. This flattening of the distribution
contrasts with a large body of empirical literature which finds a Pareto
distribution for firm sizes both across countries and over time. Pareto
distributions are generally traced back to a mechanism of proportional random
growth, based on a regime of constant returns to scale. This makes our findings
of an ``interrupted'' Pareto distribution all the more puzzling, because we
provide evidence that financial firms in our sample should operate in such a
regime. We claim that the missing mass from the upper tail of the asset size
distribution is a consequence of shadow banking activity and that it provides
an (upper) estimate of the size of the shadow banking system. This estimate --
which we propose as a shadow banking index -- compares well with estimates of
the Financial Stability Board until 2009, but it shows a sharper rise in shadow
banking activity after 2010. Finally, we propose a proportional random growth
model that reproduces the observed distribution, thereby providing a
quantitative estimate of the intensity of shadow banking activity.
