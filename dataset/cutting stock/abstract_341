We present evidence that the best model for empirical volume-price
distributions is not always the same and it strongly depends in (i) the region
of the volume-price spectrum that one wants to model and (ii) the period in
time that is being modelled. To show these two features we analyze stocks of
the New York stock market with four different models: Gamma, inverse-gamma,
log-normal, and Weibull distributions. To evaluate the accuracy of each model
we use standard relative deviations as well as the Kullback-Leibler distance
and introduce an additional distance particularly suited to evaluate how
accurate are the models for the distribution tails (large volume-price).
Finally we put our findings in perspective and discuss how they can be extended
to other situations in finance engineering.
