The measurement of the last undetermined neutrino mixing angle \theta_{13} is
the main goal of the future experimental research on neutrino oscillations. At
present, \theta_{13} is only known to be much smaller than the two other mixing
angles, \theta_{12} and \theta_{23}. The present bound, which is dominated by
the result of the CHOOZ reactor experiment, is \sin^{2}2\theta_{13}<0.08 (at 90
% confidence level). However, it is widely recognized that the potential of
reactor anti-neutrino disappearance experiments has not been fully exploited
yet. A rich experimental program is underway, which aims at exploring in the
near future up to \sin^{2}2\theta_{13}\lesssim0.01. The targeted sensitivity
requires a clear-cut strategy to reduce significantly both statistical and
systematical errors with respect to past reactor experiments. A key feature for
the success of all projects is the installation of one or more near identical
detectors. The experimental concept and the status of the upcoming or proposed
reactor experiments, and as well the prospects of the reactor-based search for
\theta_{13} are reviewed.
