We introduce a new approach to a century old assumption which enhances not
only planetary interior calculations but also high pressure material physics.
We show that the polytropic index is the derivative of the bulk modulus with
respect to pressure. We then augment the traditional polytrope theory by
including a variable polytrope index within the confines of the Lane-Emden
differential equation. To investigate the possibilities of this method we
create a high quality universal equation of state, transforming the traditional
polytrope method to a tool with the potential for excellent predictive power.
The theoretical foundation of our equation of state is the same elastic
observable which we found equivalent to the polytrope index, the derivative of
the bulk modulus with respect to pressure. We calculate the density-pressure of
six common materials up to 10$^{18}$ Pa, mass-radius relationships for the same
materials, and produce plausible density-radius models for the rocky planets of
our solar system. We argue that the bulk modulus and its derivatives have been
under utilized in previous planet formation methods. We constrain the material
surface observables for the inner core, outer core, and mantle of planet Earth
in a systematic way including pressure, bulk modulus, and the polytrope index
in the analysis. We believe this variable polytrope method has the necessary
apparatus to be extended further to gas giants and stars. As supplemental
material we provide computer code to calculate multi-layered planets.
