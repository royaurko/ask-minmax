Observations of metal-poor extragalactic H II regions allow the determination
of the primordial helium abundance, Y_p. The He I emissivities are the
foundation of the model of the H II region's emission. Porter, Ferland, Storey,
& Detisch (2012) have recently published updated He I emissivities based on
improved photoionization cross-sections. We incorporate these new atomic data
and update our recent Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of the dataset
published by Izotov, Thuan, & Stasinska (2007). As before, cuts are made to
promote quality and reliability, and only solutions which fit the data within
95% confidence level are used to determine the primordial He abundance. The
previously qualifying dataset is almost entirely retained and with strong
concordance between the physical parameters. Overall, an upward bias from the
new emissivities leads to a decrease in Y_p. In addition, we find a general
trend to larger uncertainties in individual objects (due to changes in the
emissivities) and an increased variance (due to additional objects included).
From a regression to zero metallicity, we determine Y_p = 0.2465 +/- 0.0097, in
good agreement with the Planck result of Y_p = 0.2485 +/- 0.0002. In the
future, a better understanding of why a large fraction of spectra are not well
fit by the model will be crucial to achieving an increase in the precision of
the primordial helium abundance determination.
