We study CP violations in the B_s-> K+K- and Bs->K0K0 decays in order to find
the contribution of the supersymmetry, which comes from the gluino-squark
mediated flavor changing current. We obtain the allowed region of the squark
flavor mixing parameters by putting the experimental data, the mass difference
Delta M_Bs, the CP violating phase phi_s in Bs to J/psi phi decay and the b to
s gamma branching ratio. In addition to these data, we take into account the
constraint from the asymmetry of B0->K+pi because the Bs->K+K- decay is related
with the B0->K+pi- decay by replacing the spectator s with d. Under these
constraints, we predict the magnitudes of the CP violation in the Bs->K+K- and
Bs->K0K0 decays. The predicted region of the CP violation C_{K+K-} is strongly
cut from the direct CP violation of barB0 to K-pi+, therefore, the deviation
from the SM prediction of C_{K+K-} is not found. On the other hand, the CP
violation S_{K+K-} is possibly deviated from the SM prediction considerably, in
the region of 0.1- 0.5. Since the standard model predictions of C_{K0bar K0}
and S_{K0bar K0} are very small, the squark contribution can be detectable in
C_{K0bar K0} and S_{K0bar K0}. These magnitudes are expected in the region
C_{K0bar K0}=-0.06-0.06 and S_{K0bar K0}=-0.5-0.3. More precise data of these
CP violations provide us a crucial test for the gluino-squark mediated flavor
changing current.
