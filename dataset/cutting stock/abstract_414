Various fluid mechanical systems enjoy a hidden, higher-dimensional dynamical
Poincare symmetry, which arises owing to their descent from a Nambu-Goto
action. Also, for the same reason, there are equivalence transformations
between different models. These interconnections are discussed in our paper.
