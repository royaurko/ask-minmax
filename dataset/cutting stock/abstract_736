In the past few decades considerable effort has been expended in
characterizing and modeling financial time series. A number of stylized facts
have been identified, and volatility clustering or the tendency toward
persistence has emerged as the central feature. In this paper we propose an
appropriately defined conditional probability as a new measure of volatility
clustering. We test this measure by applying it to different stock market data,
and we uncover a rich temporal structure in volatility fluctuations described
very well by a scaling relation. The scale factor used in the scaling provides
a direct measure of volatility clustering; such a measure may be used for
developing techniques for option pricing, risk management, and economic
forecasting. In addition, we present a stochastic volatility model that can
display many of the salient features exhibited by volatilities of empirical
financial time series, including the behavior of conditional probabilities that
we have deduced.
