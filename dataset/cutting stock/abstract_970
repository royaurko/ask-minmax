Linear models that contain a time-dependent response and explanatory
variables have attracted much interest in recent years. The most general form
of the existing approaches is of a linear regression model with autoregressive
moving average residuals. The addition of the moving average component results
in a complex model with a very challenging implementation. In this paper, we
propose to account for the time dependency in the data by explicitly adding
autoregressive terms of the response variable in the linear model. In addition,
we consider an autoregressive process for the errors in order to capture
complex dynamic relationships parsimoniously. To broaden the application of the
model, we present an $l_1$ penalized likelihood approach for the estimation of
the parameters and show how the adaptive lasso penalties lead to an estimator
which enjoys the oracle property. Furthermore, we prove the consistency of the
estimators with respect to the mean squared prediction error in
high-dimensional settings, an aspect that has not been considered by the
existing time-dependent regression models. A simulation study and real data
analysis show the successful applications of the model on financial data on
stock indexes.
