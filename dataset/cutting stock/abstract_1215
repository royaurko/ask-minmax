We propose a DBI vertex brane + $N_c$ fundamental strings configuration for a
probe baryon in the finite-temperature thermal gauge field via AdS/CFT
correspondence. In particular, we investigate properties of this configuration
in QCD_4 and warped AdS_6\times S^4. We find that, in D4-D8 system, a
holographic probe baryon can be described as N_c fundamental strings connecting
through a vertex D4 brane wrapped on S^4. In QCD_4 background, a closed vertex
can exist in confined phase and can not exist in deconfined phase. In the low
temperature region, screening effect still exist in confined phase like meson
and the vertex D4 brane dominates the baryon mass. The lower energy state
corresponds to vertex brane closer to the radial cut off position (r=r_c) and
the higher energy state corresponds to vertex brane a little far away from the
cut off position. The high energy limit of this configuration is just like the
unclosed vertex brane configuration in a higher temperature deconfined phase.
In warped AdS_6\times S^4 background, a closed vertex can exist in deconfined
phase and the vertex contains a spike, while fundamental strings are relatively
short. Screening length should be defined through the distance between top
position of the vertex spike and the boundary.
