Motivated by potential applications in spintronics, we study frequency
dependent spin transport in nonitinerant one-dimensional spin chains. We
propose a system that behaves as a capacitor for the spin degree of freedom. It
consists of a spin chain with two impurities a distance $d$ apart. We find that
at low energy (frequency) the impurities flow to strong coupling, thereby
effectively cutting the chain into three parts, with the middle island
containing a discrete number of spin excitations. At finite frequency spin
transport through the system increases. We find a strong dependence of the
finite frequency characteristics both on the anisotropy of the spin chain and
the applied magnetic field. We propose a method to measure the finite-frequency
conductance in this system.
