We review the ongoing debate about the relationship between low redshift
Lyman Alpha absorbers and luminous galaxies. In particular, we discuss the
difficulty of `assigning' a particular absorber to a particular galaxy, and
consider methods of circumventing this problem. We also provide a status report
on an ongoing project collecting more data to address this issue, and show some
results for a close together pair of QSOs providing two adjacent lines of sight
through the inter-galactic medium.
