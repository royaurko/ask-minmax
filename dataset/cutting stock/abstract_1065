Econophysics is a science in its infancy, born about ten years ago at this
time of writing, at the crossing roads of physics, mathematics, computing and
of course economics and finance. It also covers human sciences, because all
economics is ultimately driven by human decision. From this human factor,
econophysics has no hope to achieve the status of an exact science, but it is
interesting to discover what can be achieved, discovering potential limits and
trying try to push further away these limits. A few data analysis techniques
are described with emphasis on the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis ($DFA$) and
the Zipf Analysis Technique ($ZAT$). Information about the original data
aresketchy, but the data concerns mainly the foreign currency exchange market.
The robustness of the $DFA$ technique is underlined. Additional remarks are
given for suggesting further work. Models about financial value evolutions are
recalled, again without going into elaborate work discussing typical agent
behaviors, but rather with hopefully sufficient information such that the basic
ingredients can be memorized before reading some of the vast literature on
price formation. Crashes being spectacular phenomena retain our attention and
do so through data analysis and basic intuitive models. A few statistical and
microscopic models are outlined.
