The rareness of blazars, combined with the previous history of relatively
shallow, single-band surveys, has dramatically colored our perception of these
objects. Despite a quarter-century of research, it is not at all clear whether
current samples can be combined to give us a relatively unbiased view of blazar
properties, or whether they present a view so heavily affected by biases
inherent in single-band surveys that a synthesis is impossible. We will use the
coverage of X-ray/radio flux space for existing surveys to assess their biases.
Only new, deeper blazar surveys approach the level needed in depth and coverage
of parameter space to give us a less biased view of blazars. These surveys have
drastically increased our knowledge of blazars' properties. We will
specifically review the discovery of ``blue'' blazars, objects with broad
emission lines but broadband spectral characteristics similar to HBL BL Lac
objects.
