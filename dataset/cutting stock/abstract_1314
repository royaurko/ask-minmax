Suzaku X-ray observations of a young supernova remnant, Cassiopeia A, were
carried out. K-shell transition lines from highly ionized ions of various
elements were detected, including Chromium (Cr-Kalpha at 5.61 keV). The X-ray
continuum spectra were modeled in the 3.4--40 keV band, summed over the entire
remnant, and were fitted with a simplest combination of the thermal
bremsstrahlung and the non-thermal cut-off power-law models. The spectral fits
with this assumption indicate that the continuum emission is likely to be
dominated by the non-thermal emission with a cut-off energy at > 1 keV. The
thermal-to-nonthermal fraction of the continuum flux in the 4-10 keV band is
best estimated as ~0.1. Non-thermal-dominated continuum images in the 4--14 keV
band were made. The peak of the non-thermal X-rays appears at the western part.
The peak position of the TeV gamma-rays measured with HEGRA and MAGIC is also
shifted at the western part with the 1-sigma confidence. Since the location of
the X-ray continuum emission was known to be presumably identified with the
reverse shock region, the possible keV-TeV correlations give a hint that the
accelerated multi-TeV hadrons in Cassiopeia A are dominated by heavy elements
in the reverse shock region.
