For common people, in contrast to brokers, bankers, and those who play on
rising and falling prices of stocks, the stock market law is based on the
simple fact that the depositors aim for financial profit at any given concrete
stage. The common depositor cannot cause any significant variations in prices.
This concept suggests an analogy with the quasistable physics, i.e.,
thermodynamics, in the situation in which the temperature varies slowly along
with the external conditions. Therefore, in the quasistable market, we can see
phase transitions similar to those in the situation of the Bose-condesate in
thermodynamics. We stress the positive role of information for common
depositors and the possibility of changing bonds of large denomination into
bonds of small denomination.
