In this reply, we point out several criticisms of the analysis in
arXiv:0909.2633 and show that the comment does not change the underlying
conclusion presented by ourselves that there is no measurable deficit in the
scattering cross section of hydrogen. We therefore consider that our original
conclusions are correct namely that the previous anomalies in the cross section
are due to experimental effects related to the use of indirect geometry
spectrometers.
