The invariant mass spectrum of the lepton pair in inclusive semileptonic
$\bar B\to X_u \ell\bar\nu$ decay yields a model independent determination of
$|V_{ub}|$. Unlike the lepton energy and hadronic invariant mass spectra,
nonperturbative effects are only important in the resonance region, and play a
parametrically suppressed role when $d\Gamma / dq^2$ is integrated over $q^2 >
(m_B-m_D)^2$, which is required to eliminate the $\bar B\to X_c \ell\bar\nu$
background. We discuss these backgrounds for $q^2$ slightly below
$(m_B-m_D)^2$, and point out that instead of $q^2 > (m_B-m_D)^2 = 11.6 GeV^2$,
the cut can be lowered to $q^2 \gtrsim 10.5 GeV^2$. This is important
experimentally, particularly when effects of a finite neutrino reconstruction
resolution are included.
