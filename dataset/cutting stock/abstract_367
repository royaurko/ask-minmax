The generalised hydrodynamic theory of an electron gas, which does not rely
on an assumption of a local equilibrium, is derived as the long-wave limit of a
kinetic equation. Apart from the common hydrodynamics variables the theory
includes the tensor fields of the higher moments of the distribution function.
In contrast to the Bloch hydrodynamics, the theory leads to the correct plasmon
dispersion and in the low frequency limit recovers the Navies-Stocks
hydrodynamics. The linear approximation to the generalised hydrodynamics is
closely related to the theory of highly viscous fluids.
