We have developed techniques to extract arbitrary fractions of antiprotons
from an accumulated reservoir, and to inject them into a Penning-trap system
for high-precision measurements. In our trap-system antiproton storage times >
1.08 years are estimated. The device is fail-safe against power-cuts of up to
10 hours. This makes our planned comparisons of the fundamental properties of
protons and antiprotons independent from accelerator cycles, and will enable us
to perform experiments during long accelerator shutdown periods when background
magnetic noise is low. The demonstrated scheme has the potential to be applied
in many other precision Penning trap experiments dealing with exotic particles.
