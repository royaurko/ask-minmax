We study a bivariate mean reverting stochastic volatility model, finding an
explicit expression for the decay of cross-asset correlations over time. We
compare our result with the empirical time series of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average and the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 in the period 1984-2013,
finding an excellent agreement. The main features of the model consist in the
jumps in the volatilities and a nonlinear mean reversion. Based on these
features, we propose an algorithm for the detection of jumps in the volatility.
