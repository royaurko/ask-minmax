We consider a possible technique for mode-locking an atom laser, based on the
generation of a dark soliton in a ring-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate, with
repulsive atomic interactions. The soliton is a kink, with angular momentum per
particle equal to \hbar/2. It emerges naturally, when the condensate is stirred
at the soliton velocity, and subsequently outcoupled with a periodic Raman
pulse-train. The result is a replicating coherent field inside the atom laser.
We give a numerical demonstration of the generation and stabilization of the
soliton.
