Based on a recent theorem due to the contributors, it is shown how the extreme
tail dependence between an asset and a factor or index or between two assets
can be easily calibrated. Portfolios constructed with stocks with minimal tail
dependence with the market exhibit a remarkable degree of decorrelation with
the market at no cost in terms of performance measured by the Sharpe ratio.
