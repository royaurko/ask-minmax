Simplified models have become a widely used and important tool to cover the
more diverse phenomenology beyond constrained SUSY models. However, they come
with a substantial number of caveats themselves, and great care needs to be
taken when drawing conclusions from limits based on the simplified approach. To
illustrate this issue with a concrete example, we examine the applicability of
simplified model results to a series of full SUSY model points which all
feature a small stau-LSP mass difference, and are compatible with electroweak
and flavor precision observables as well as current LHC results. Various
channels have been studied using the Snowmass Combined LHC detector
implementation in the Delphes simulation package, as well as the Letter of
Intent or Technical Design Report simulations of the ILD detector concept at
the ILC. We investigated both the LHC and ILC capabilities for discovery,
separation and identification of all parts of the spectrum. While parts of the
spectrum would be discovered at the LHC, there is substantial room for further
discoveries and property determination at the ILC.
