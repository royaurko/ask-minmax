We extend approximate next-to-next-to-leading order results for top-pair
production to include the semi-leptonic decays of top quarks in the
narrow-width approximation. The new hard-scattering kernels are implemented in
a fully differential parton-level Monte Carlo that allows for the study of any
IR-safe observable constructed from the momenta of the decay products of the
top. Our best predictions are given by approximate NNLO corrections in the
production matched to a fixed order calculation with NLO corrections in both
the production and decay subprocesses. Being fully differential enables us to
make comparisons between approximate results derived via different (PIM and
1PI) kinematics for arbitrary distributions. These comparisons reveal that the
renormalization-group framework, from which the approximate results are
derived, is rather robust in the sense that applying a realistic error estimate
allows us to obtain a reliable prediction with a reduced theoretical error for
generic observables and analysis cuts.
