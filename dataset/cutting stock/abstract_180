We study trade-based manipulation of stock prices from the perspective of
complex trading networks constructed by using detailed information of trades. A
stock trading network consists of nodes and directed links, where every trader
is a node and a link is formed from one trader to the other if the former sells
shares to the latter. Specifically, three abnormal network motifs are
investigated, which are found to be formed by a few traders, implying potential
intention of price manipulation. We further investigate the dynamics of
volatility, trading volume, average trade size and turnover around the
transactions associated with the abnormal motifs for large, medium and small
trades. It is found that these variables peak at the abnormal events and
exhibit a power-law accumulation in the pre-event time period and a power-law
relaxation in the post-event period. We also find that the cumulative excess
returns are significantly positive after buyer-initiated suspicious trades and
exhibit a mild price reversal after seller-initiated suspicious trades. These
findings can be better understood in favor of price manipulation. Our work shed
new lights into the detection of price manipulation resorting to the abnormal
motifs of complex trading networks.
