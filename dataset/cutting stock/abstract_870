We take stock of recent observations that identify the episodic plasma
heating and injection of Alfvenic energy at the base of fast solar wind (in
coronal holes). The plasma heating is associated with the occurrence of
chromospheric spicules that leave the lower solar atmosphere at speeds of order
100km/s, the hotter coronal counterpart of the spicule emits radiation
characteristic of root heating that rapidly reaches temperatures of the order
of 1MK. Furthermore, the same spicules and their coronal counterparts
("Propagating Coronal Disturbances"; PCD) exhibit large amplitude, high speed,
Alfvenic (transverse) motion of sufficient energy content to accelerate the
material to high speeds. We propose that these (disjointed) heating and
accelerating components form a one-two punch to supply, and then accelerate,
the fast solar wind. We consider some compositional constraints on this
concept, extend the premise to the slow solar wind, and identify future avenues
of exploration.
