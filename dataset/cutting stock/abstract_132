Highly accurate interval forecasting of a stock price index is fundamental to
successfully making a profit when making investment decisions, by providing a
range of values rather than a point estimate. In this study, we investigate the
possibility of forecasting an interval-valued stock price index series over
short and long horizons using multi-output support vector regression (MSVR).
Furthermore, this study proposes a firefly algorithm (FA)-based approach, built
on the established MSVR, for determining the parameters of MSVR (abbreviated as
FA-MSVR). Three globally traded broad market indices are used to compare the
performance of the proposed FA-MSVR method with selected counterparts. The
quantitative and comprehensive assessments are performed on the basis of
statistical criteria, economic criteria, and computational cost. In terms of
statistical criteria, we compare the out-of-sample forecasting using
goodness-of-forecast measures and testing approaches. In terms of economic
criteria, we assess the relative forecast performance with a simple trading
strategy. The results obtained in this study indicate that the proposed FA-MSVR
method is a promising alternative for forecasting interval-valued financial
time series.
