We study the effects of the Kaluza-Klein gravitons in the Randall-Sundrum
model on the recent BNL measurements of the muon (g-2) deviation from the
standard model prediction. By examining the J-partial wave unitarity bounds of
the elastic process gamma+gamma->gamma+gamma, the cut-off on the number of
massive KK gravitons, n_c, has been introduced. We found that the recently
measured (Delta a_mu) can be accommodated in the RS model, within the natural
parameter space allowed by the perturbative unitarity. For example, dozens
(hundreds) of the n_c for Lambda_pi=1-2 TeV (3 TeV) can explain the reported
Delta a_mu.
