We define a generalized index of jump activity, propose estimators of that
index for a discretely sampled process and derive the estimators' properties.
These estimators are applicable despite the presence of Brownian volatility in
the process, which makes it more challenging to infer the characteristics of
the small, infinite activity jumps. When the method is applied to high
frequency stock returns, we find evidence of infinitely active jumps in the
data and estimate their index of activity.
