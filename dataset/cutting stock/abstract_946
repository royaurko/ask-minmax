We introduce two self-reinforced point processes on the unit interval that
appear to exhibit self-organized criticality, somewhat reminiscent of the
well-known Bak Sneppen model. The first process takes values in the finite
subsets of the unit interval and evolves according to the following rules. In
each time step, a particle is added at a uniformly chosen position, independent
of the particles that are already present. If there are any particles to the
left of the newly arrived particle, then the left-most of these is removed. We
show that all particles arriving to the left of $p_{\rm c}=1-e^{-1}$ are a.s.
eventually removed, while for large enough time, particles arriving to the
right of $p_{\rm c}$ stay in the system forever. Our second process of interest
has particles of two types and models traders placing buy and sell limit orders
at a stock market. The behavior of this process appears to be similar to the
previous one, but we can prove only partial results for it.
