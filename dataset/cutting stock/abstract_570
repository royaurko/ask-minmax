We have characterized the dynamics of the polar nanoregions in
Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_{3}$ (PMN) through high-resolution neutron
backscattering and spin-echo measurements of the diffuse scattering cross
section. We find that the diffuse scattering intensity consists of \emph{both}
static and dynamic components. The static component first appears at the Curie
temperature $\Theta \sim 400$ K, while the dynamic component freezes completely
at the temperature T$_{f} \sim 200$ K; together, these components account for
all of the observed spectral weight contributing to the diffuse scattering
cross section. The integrated intensity of the dynamic component peaks near the
temperature at which the frequency-dependent dielectric constant reaches a
maximum (T$_{max}$) when measured at 1 GHz, i. e. on a timescale of $\sim 1$
ns. Our neutron scattering results can thus be directly related to dielectric
and infra-red measurements of the polar nanoregions. Finally, the global
temperature dependence of the diffuse scattering can be understood in terms of
just two temperature scales, which is consistent with random field models.
