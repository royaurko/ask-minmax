In this paper, we present a multi-period trading model in the style of Kyle
(1985)'s inside trading model, by assuming that there are at least two insiders
in the market with long-lived private information, under the requirement that
each insider publicly discloses his stock trades after the fact. Based on this
model, we study the influences of "public disclosure" and "competition among
insiders" on the trading behaviors of insiders. We find that the "competition
among insiders" leads to higher effective price and lower insiders' profits,
and the "public disclosure" makes each insider play a mixed strategy in every
round except the last one. An interesting find is that as the total number of
auctions goes to infinity, the market depth and the trading intensity at the
first auction are all constants with the requirement of "public disclosure",
while the market depth at the first auction goes to zero and the trading
intensity of the first period goes to infinity without the requirement of
"public disclosure".Moreover, we give the exact speed of the revelation of the
private information, and show that all information is revealed immediately and
the market depth goes to infinity immediately as trading happens infinitely
frequently.
