We study the relation between serial correlation of financial returns and
volatility at intraday level for the S&P500 stock index. At daily and weekly
level, serial correlation and volatility are known to be negatively correlated
(LeBaron effect). While confirming that the LeBaron effect holds also at
intraday level, we go beyond it and, complementing the efficient market
hyphotesis (for returns) with the heterogenous market hyphotesis (for
volatility), we test the impact of unexpected volatility, defined as the part
of volatility which cannot be forecasted, on the presence of serial
correlations in the time series. We show that unexpected volatility is instead
positively correlated with intraday serial correlation.
