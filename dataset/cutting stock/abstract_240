The temperature and zone dependence of the lattice dynamics in
Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_{3}$ is characterized using neutron inelastic
scattering. A strong correlation between the diffuse and phonon scattering is
measured. The lattice dynamics in Brillouin zones where the diffuse scattering
is strong is observed to display qualitatively different behavior than those
zones where the diffuse scattering is weak. In the (220) and (200) zones, where
there is a weak diffuse component, the dynamics are well described by coupled
harmonic oscillators. Compared with SrTiO$_{3}$, the coupling is weak and
isotropic, resulting in only a small transfer of spectral weight from one mode
to another. A comparison of the scattering in these zones to the (110) zone,
where a strong diffuse component is present, reveals a strong coupling of the
diffuse (or central) component to the acoustic mode. We speculate that the
coupling to the central peak is the reason for several recent conflicting
interpretations of the lattice dynamics based on data from zones with a strong
diffuse component.
