We consider the calculation of threshold effects due to Kaluza Klein and
winding modes in string theory. We show that for a large radius of
compactification these effects may be approximated by an effective field theory
applicable below the string cut-off scale. Using this formalism we show that
the radiative contribution to gauge couplings involving only massive Kaluza
Klein and winding modes may be calculated to all orders in perturbation theory
and determine the full two loop contribution involving light modes and estimate
the magnitude of the higher-order contributions. For the case of the weakly
coupled heterotic string we also discuss how an improved calculation can be
made incorporating the string theory threshold corrections which avoids the
limitations of the effective field theory approach. Using this formalism we
determine the implications for gauge coupling unification for one
representative model including the effects of two loop corrections above the
compactification scale. Finally we discuss the prospects for gauge unification
in Type I models with a low string scale and point out potential fine tuning
problems in this case.
