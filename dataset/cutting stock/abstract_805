Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is a simple but very efficient method
for investigating the power-law long-term correlations of non-stationary time
series, in which a detrending step is necessary to obtain the local
fluctuations at different timescales. We propose to determine the local trends
through empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and perform the detrending operation
by removing the EMD-based local trends, which gives an EMD-based DFA method.
Similarly, we also propose a modified multifractal DFA algorithm, called an
EMD-based MFDFA. The performance of the EMD-based DFA and MFDFA methods is
assessed with extensive numerical experiments based on fractional Brownian
motion and multiplicative cascading process. We find that the EMD-based DFA
method performs better than the classic DFA method in the determination of the
Hurst index when the time series is strongly anticorrelated and the EMD-based
MFDFA method outperforms the traditional MFDFA method when the moment order $q$
of the detrended fluctuations is positive. We apply the EMD-based MFDFA to the
one-minute data of Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite index, and the presence of
multifractality is confirmed.
