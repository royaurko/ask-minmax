Projecting a non-Abelian SU(2) vacuum gauge field - a pure gauge constructed
from the group element U - onto a fixed (electromagnetic) direction in isospace
gives rise to a nontrivial magnetic field, with nonvanishing magnetic helicity,
which coincides with the winding number of U. Although the helicity is not
conserved under Maxwell (vacuum) evolution, it retains one-half its initial
value at infinite time.
