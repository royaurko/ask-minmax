We investigate the two components of the total daily return (close-to-close),
the overnight return (close-to-open) and the daytime return (open-to-close), as
well as the corresponding volatilities of the 2215 NYSE stocks from 1988 to
2007. The tail distribution of the volatility, the long-term memory in the
sequence, and the cross-correlation between different returns are analyzed. Our
results suggest that: (i) The two component returns and volatilities have
similar features as that of the total return and volatility. The tail
distribution follows a power law for all volatilities, and long-term
correlations exist in the volatility sequences but not in the return sequences.
(ii) The daytime return contributes more to the total return. Both the tail
distribution and the long-term memory of the daytime volatility are more
similar to that of the total volatility, compared to the overnight records. In
addition, the cross-correlation between the daytime return and the total return
is also stronger. (iii) The two component returns tend to be anti-correlated.
Moreover, we find that the cross-correlations between the three different
returns (total, overnight, and daytime) are quite stable over the entire
20-year period.
