Many big data applications collect a large number of time series, for
example, the financial data of companies quoted in a stock exchange, the health
care data of all patients that visit the emergency room of a hospital, or the
temperature sequences continuously measured by weather stations across the US.
A first task in the analytics of these data is to derive a low dimensional
representation, a graph or discrete manifold, that describes well the
interrelations among the time series and their intrarelations across time. This
paper presents a computationally tractable algorithm for estimating this graph
structure from the available data. This graph is directed and weighted,
possibly representing causation relations, not just correlations as in most
existing approaches in the literature. The algorithm is demonstrated on random
graph and real network time series datasets, and its performance is compared to
that of related methods. The adjacency matrices estimated with the new method
are close to the true graph in the simulated data and consistent with prior
physical knowledge in the real dataset tested.
