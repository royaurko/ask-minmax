We discuss models of primordial density perturbations where the
non-Gaussianity is strongly scale-dependent. In particular, the non-Gaussianity
may have a sharp cut-off and be very suppressed on large cosmological scales,
but sizeable on small scales. This may have an impact on probes of
non-Gaussianity in the large-scale structure and in the cosmic microwave
background radiation anisotropies.
