We consider a financial market in which two securities are traded: a stock
and an index. Their prices are assumed to satisfy the Black-Scholes model.
Besides assuming that the index is a tradable security, we also assume that it
is efficient, in the following sense: we do not expect a prespecified
self-financing trading strategy whose wealth is almost surely nonnegative at
all times to outperform the index greatly. We show that, for a long investment
horizon, the appreciation rate of the stock has to be close to the interest
rate (assumed constant) plus the covariance between the volatility vectors of
the stock and the index. This contains both a version of the Capital Asset
Pricing Model and our earlier result that the equity premium is close to the
squared volatility of the index.
