While the SUSY flavor, CP and gravitino problems seem to favor a very heavy
spectrum of matter scalars, fine-tuning in the electroweak sector prefers low
values of superpotential mass \mu. In the limit of low \mu, the two lightest
neutralinos and light chargino are higgsino-like. The light charginos and
neutralinos may have large production cross sections at LHC, but since they are
nearly mass degenerate, there is only small energy release in three-body
sparticle decays. Possible dilepton and trilepton signatures are difficult to
observe after mild cuts due to the very soft p_T spectrum of the final state
isolated leptons. Thus, the higgsino-world scenario can easily elude standard
SUSY searches at the LHC. It should motivate experimental searches to focus on
dimuon and trimuon production at the very lowest p_T(\mu) values possible. If
the neutralino relic abundance is enhanced via non-standard cosmological dark
matter production, then there exist excellent prospects for direct or indirect
detection of higgsino-like WIMPs. While the higgsino-world scenario may easily
hide from LHC SUSY searches, a linear e^+e^- collider or a muon collider
operating in the \sqrt{s}\sim 0.5-1 TeV range would be able to easily access
the chargino and neutralino pair production reactions.
