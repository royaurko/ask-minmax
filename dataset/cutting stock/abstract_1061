We investigate the Heston model with stochastic volatility and exponential
tails as a model for the typical price fluctuations of the Brazilian S\~ao
Paulo Stock Exchange Index (IBOVESPA). Raw prices are first corrected for
inflation and a period spanning 15 years characterized by memoryless returns is
chosen for the analysis. Model parameters are estimated by observing volatility
scaling and correlation properties. We show that the Heston model with at least
two time scales for the volatility mean reverting dynamics satisfactorily
describes price fluctuations ranging from time scales larger than 20 minutes to
160 days. At time scales shorter than 20 minutes we observe autocorrelated
returns and power law tails incompatible with the Heston model. Despite major
regulatory changes, hyperinflation and currency crises experienced by the
Brazilian market in the period studied, the general success of the description
provided may be regarded as an evidence for a general underlying dynamics of
price fluctuations at intermediate mesoeconomic time scales well approximated
by the Heston model. We also notice that the connection between the Heston
model and Ehrenfest urn models could be exploited for bringing new insights
into the microeconomic market mechanics.
