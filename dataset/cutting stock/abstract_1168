In this paper, the new information system development methodology will be
proposed. This methodology will enable the whole data model to be built and
adjusted at the run time, without rebuilding the application. This will make
the user much more powerful and independent on the manufacturer of the system.
It will also cut the price and shorten the development time of the information
systems dramatically, because common business logic will not have to be
implemented for each individual table and the major part of the user interface
will be generated automatically.
