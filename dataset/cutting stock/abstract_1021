We present a comparison of the leftover satellites at z=0 in a cold dark
matter dominated simulation of the formation of the Local Group to the
distribution of observed neutral hydrogen high-velocity clouds and compact
high-velocity clouds. The ~2000 leftover satellites in the simulation have dark
matter masses which range between 0.5 to 10 x 10^9 Msun, sizes between 3 to 30
kpc, and distances between 100 kpc and 2 Mpc. The dark matter halos show a
clear bias in their distribution towards M31 and to a lesser extent towards the
Local Group anti-barycenter. If the Local Group halos contain ~1% of their dark
matter mass in neutral hydrogen they should have been easily detected by the
current HI surveys. The only HI objects detected with the potential to be the
Local Group halos are the high-velocity clouds. Here the spatial, kinematic,
and HI flux properties of the clouds and dark matter halos are compared.
Several different subsets of halos which may be more likely to contain neutral
hydrogen are investigated, and the HVCs are found to have some similar
properties to those halos within 500 kpc of the Galaxy and those halos with
dark matter masses > 2 x 10^8 Msun. The compact high-velocity clouds do not
show similar properties to the halos.
