We investigate the probability distribution of the volatility return
intervals $\tau$ for the Chinese stock market. We rescale both the probability
distribution $P_{q}(\tau)$ and the volatility return intervals $\tau$ as
$P_{q}(\tau)=1/\bar{\tau} f(\tau/\bar{\tau})$ to obtain a uniform scaling curve
for different threshold value $q$. The scaling curve can be well fitted by the
stretched exponential function $f(x) \sim e^{-\alpha x^{\gamma}}$, which
suggests memory exists in $\tau$. To demonstrate the memory effect, we
investigate the conditional probability distribution $P_{q} (\tau|\tau_{0})$,
the mean conditional interval $<\tau|\tau_{0}>$ and the cumulative probability
distribution of the cluster size of $\tau$. The results show clear clustering
effect. We further investigate the persistence probability distribution
$P_{\pm}(t)$ and find that $P_{-}(t)$ decays by a power law with the exponent
far different from the value 0.5 for the random walk, which further confirms
long memory exists in $\tau$. The scaling and long memory effect of $\tau$ for
the Chinese stock market are similar to those obtained from the United States
and the Japanese financial markets.
