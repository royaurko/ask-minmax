For purposes of Value-at-Risk estimation, we consider several multivariate
families of heavy-tailed distributions, which can be seen as multidimensional
versions of Paretian stable and Student's t distributions allowing different
marginals to have different tail thickness. After a discussion of relevant
estimation and simulation issues, we conduct a backtesting study on a set of
portfolios containing derivative instruments, using historical US stock price
data.
