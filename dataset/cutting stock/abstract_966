We show that the behaviour of Bitcoin has interesting similarities to stock
and precious metal markets, such as gold and silver. We report that whilst
Litecoin, the second largest cryptocurrency, closely follows Bitcoin's
behaviour, it does not show all the reported properties of Bitcoin. Agreements
between apparently disparate complexity measures have been found, and it is
shown that statistical, information-theoretic, algorithmic and fractal measures
have different but interesting capabilities of clustering families of markets
by type. The report is particularly interesting because of the range and novel
use of some measures of complexity to characterize price behaviour, because of
the IRS designation of Bitcoin as an investment property and not a currency,
and the announcement of the Canadian government's own electronic currency
MintChip.
