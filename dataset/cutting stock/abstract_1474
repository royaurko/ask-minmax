The configuration interaction (CI) method for calculating the exact
eigenstates of a quantum-mechanical few-body system is problematic when applied
to contact interactions between the particles. In two and three dimensions, the
approach fails due to the pathology of the Dirac delta-potential, making it
impossible to reach convergence by gradually increasing the size of the Hilbert
space. However, for practical applications this problem may be cured in a
rather simple manner, by renormalizing the STRENGTH of the contact potential,
which must be diagonalized in a TRUNCATED Hilbert space. The procedure relies
on the comparison of CI energies and wave functions with those obtained by the
exact solution of the two-body Schrodinger equation for the regularized contact
interaction. The rather simple scheme, while keeping the numerical procedures
still elementary, nevertheless provides both cut-off-independent few-body
physical observables and an estimate of the error of the CI calculation.
