The High Level Trigger (HLT) of the ALICE experiment requires massive
parallel computing. One of the main tasks of the HLT system is two-dimensional
cluster finding on raw data of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), which is the
main data source of ALICE. To reduce the number of computing nodes needed in
the HLT farm, FPGAs, which are an intrinsic part of the system, will be
utilized for this task. VHDL code implementing the Fast Cluster Finder
algorithm, has been written, a testbed for functional verification of the code
has been developed, and the code has been synthesized
