We address the problem of how to extract the signal of a Higgs within the
intermediate mass range at a photon-photon collider that has a wide energy
spectrum. All backgrounds from two-jets production are included: direct,
so-called resolved and twice-resolved as well as single $Z$ and $W$ production.
Uncertainties in the evaluation of the QCD-initiated processes such as the
choice of structure function and the issue of radiative corrections are
discussed. We consider various combinations of the polarizations and invariant
mass resolutions as well as jet-tagging strategies with different efficiencies.
The analysis is based on an automatized technique that, given a specific
detector and machine configuration, returns the optimal set of cuts
corresponding to the best significance one may hope to achieve for each
particular Higgs mass. We find that at a photon machine obtained from a 500GeV
\epm\ linear collider with $\int\!{\cal L}=10$~fb$^{-1}$ it will be possible to
extract a Higgs signal in the range 110--140~GeV, while with the same
luminosity, a 350~GeV option not only extends the discovery limit down to
90~GeV but gives much better significance levels.
