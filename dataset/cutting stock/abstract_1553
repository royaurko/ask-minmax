In this paper we study the renormalization effects of the quark flavor
mixings and the Higgs self- coupling in a five dimensional model where the
boson fields are propagating in the bulk whilst the matter fields are localized
to the brane. We first explore the evolution behaviors for the Cabibbo-
Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix in this scenario. Then, in light of the recent LHC
bounds on the Higgs mass, we find that the Higgs self-coupling evolution has an
improved vacuum stability condition, which is in contrast with that of Standard
Model and the Universal Extra Dimension scenario, where the theory has a much
lower ultraviolet cut-off.
