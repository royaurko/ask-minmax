QCD sheds considerable light on several of the most basic features of the
natural world including the origin of mass, the feebleness of gravity, the
extent to which the properties of matter can be determined conceptually, the
possible utility of the anthropic principle, and the metatheoretic notions of
effectiveness and computability. I discuss these applications here.
