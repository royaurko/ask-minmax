We analyze hadrochemical freeze-out in central Pb+Pb collisions at CERN SPS
energies, employing the hybrid version of the Ultrarelativistic Quantum
Molecular Dynamics model, which describes the transition from a hydrodynamic
stage to hadrons by the Cooper-Frye mechanism, and matches to a final
hadron-resonance cascade. We fit the results both before and after the cascade
stage using the Statistical Model, to assess the effect of the cascade phase.
We observe a strong effect on antibaryon yields except anti-Omega, resulting in
a shift in T and mu_B of the freeze-out curve. We discuss indications of a
similar effect in SPS and RHIC data, and propose a method to recover the bulk
hadron freeze-out conditions.
