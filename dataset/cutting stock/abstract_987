We focus on the influence of external sources of information upon financial
markets. In particular, we develop a stochastic agent-based market model
characterized by a certain herding behavior as well as allowing traders to be
influenced by an external dynamic signal of information. This signal can be
interpreted as a time-varying advertising, public perception or rumor, in favor
or against one of two possible trading behaviors, thus breaking the symmetry of
the system and acting as a continuously varying exogenous shock. As an
illustration, we use a well-known German Indicator of Economic Sentiment as
information input and compare our results with Germany's leading stock market
index, the DAX, in order to calibrate some of the model parameters. We study
the conditions for the ensemble of agents to more accurately follow the
information input signal. The response of the system to the external
information is maximal for an intermediate range of values of a market
parameter, suggesting the existence of three different market regimes:
amplification, precise assimilation and undervaluation of incoming information.
