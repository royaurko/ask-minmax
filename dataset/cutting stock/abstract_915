A class of Gaussian processes generalizing the usual fractional Brownian
motion for Hurst indices in (1/2,1) and multifractal Brownian motion introduced
in Ralchenko and Shevchenko (Theory Probab Math Stat 80, 2010) and Boufoussi et
al. (Bernoulli 16(4), 2010) is presented. Any measurable function assuming
values in this interval can now be chosen as a variable Hurst parameter. These
processes allow for modeling of phenomena where the regularity properties can
change with time either continuously or through jumps, such as in the
volatility of a stock or in Internet traffic. Some properties of the sample
paths of the new process class, including different types of continuity and
long-range dependence, are discussed. It is found that the regularity
properties of the Hurst function chosen directly correspond to the regularity
properties of the sample paths of the processes. The long-range dependence
property of fractional Brownian motion is preserved in the larger process
class. As an application, Fokker-Planck-type equations for a time-changed
fractional Brownian motion with variable Hurst parameter are found.
