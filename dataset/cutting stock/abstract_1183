In this article, a localisation result is proved for the biased random walk
on the range of a simple random walk in high dimensions (d \geq 5). This
demonstrates that, unlike in the supercritical percolation setting, a slowdown
effect occurs as soon a non-trivial bias is introduced. The proof applies a
decomposition of the underlying simple random walk path at its cut-times to
relate the associated biased random walk to a one-dimensional random walk in a
random environment in Sinai's regime.
