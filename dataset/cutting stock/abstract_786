An algorithm based on Renormalization Group (RG) to analyze time series
forecasting was proposed in cond-mat/0110285. In this paper we explicitly code
and test it. We choose in particular some financial time series (stocks,
indexes and commodities) with daily data and compute one step ahead forecasts.
We then construct some indicators to evaluate performances. The algorithm is
supposed to prescribe the future development of the time series by using the
self-similarity property intrinsically present in RG approach. This property
could be potentially very attractive for the purpose of building winning
trading systems. We discuss some relevant points along this direction. Although
current performances have to be improved the algorithm seems quite reactive to
various combinations of input parameters and different past values sequences.
This makes it a potentially good candidate to detect sharp market movements. We
finally mention current drawbacks and sketch how to improve them.
