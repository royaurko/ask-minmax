A survey is given of recent QCD theory advances concerning the phase diagram,
in particular the indications for a critical point and adjacent first order
phase transition at high baryo-chemical potential, and the new ideas concerning
a further phase at high $\mu_{B}$, the quarkyonic matter phase. The latter
state might finally explain the hadro-chemical equilibrium freeze-out points
from A+A collisions at energies below SPS energy. We review several
event-by-event fluctuation signals that promise to shed a light on the
existence of a critical point, and we discuss its possible reflection in recent
lattice QCD calculations.
