This is a short letter summarizing the long paper cond-mat/0106047 in which
we present a simple two-dimensional dynamical system reaching a singularity in
finite time decorated by accelerating oscillations due to the interplay between
nonlinear positive feedback and reversal in the inertia. This provides a
fundamental equation for the dynamics of (1) stock market prices in the
presence of nonlinear trend-followers and nonlinear value investors, (2) the
world human population with a competition between a population-dependent growth
rate and a nonlinear dependence on a finite carrying capacity and (3) the
failure of a material subject to a time-varying stress with a competition
between positive geometrical feedback on the damage variable and nonlinear
healing. The rich fractal scaling properties of the dynamics are traced back to
the self-similar spiral structure in phase space unfolding around an unstable
spiral point at the origin.
