Using Chandrasekhar's S-type coupling between rotational and intrinsic
vortical modes one may simply reproduce the HFB dynamical properties of
rotating nuclei within Routhian HF calculations free of pairing correlations
yet constrained on the relevant so-called Kelvin circulation operator. From the
analogy between magnetic and rotating systems, one derives a model for the
quenching of pairing correlations with rotation, introducing a critical angular
velocity -- analogous to the critical field in supraconductors -- above which
pairing vanishes. Taking stock of this usual model, it is then shown that the
characteristic behavior of the vortical mode angular velocity as a function of
the global rotation angular velocity can be modelised by a simple two parameter
formula, both parameters being completely determined from properties of the
band-head (zero-spin) HFB solution. From calculation in five nuclei, the
validity of this modelised Routhian approach is assessed. It is clearly shown
to be very good in cases where the evolution of rotational properties is only
governed by the coupling between the global rotation and the pairing-induced
intrinsic vortical currents. It therefore provides a sound ground base for
evaluating the importance of coupling of rotation with other modes (shape
distortions, quasiparticle degrees of freedom).
