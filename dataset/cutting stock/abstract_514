This paper introduces a new method to estimate the spectral distribution of a
population covariance matrix from high-dimensional data. The method is founded
on a meaningful generalization of the seminal Marcenko-Pastur equation,
originally defined in the complex plan, to the real line. Beyond its easy
implementation and the established asymptotic consistency, the new estimator
outperforms two existing estimators from the literature in almost all the
situations tested in a simulation experiment. An application to the analysis of
the correlation matrix of S&P stocks data is also given.
