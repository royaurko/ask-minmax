In the Standard Model the Fermi constant is associated with the vacuum
expectation value of the Higgs field $<\Phi>$, `the condensate', usually
believed to be a nearly cut-off independent quantity. General arguments related
to the `triviality' of $\lambda\Phi^4$ theory in 4 space-time dimensions
suggest, however, a dramatic renormalization effect in the continuum theory.
This effect is visible on the relatively large lattices (such as $32^4$)
available today. The result is suggestive of a certain `Higgs-gravity
connection', as discussed some years ago. The space-time structure is
determined by symmetry breaking and the Planck scale is essentially a rescaling
of the Fermi scale. The resulting picture may lead to quite substantial changes
in the usual phenomenology associated with the Higgs particle.
