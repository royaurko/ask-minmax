Market Mill is a complex dependence pattern leading to nonlinear correlations
and predictability in intraday dynamics of stock prices. The present paper puts
together previous efforts to build a dynamical model reflecting the market mill
asymmetries. We show that certain properties of the conditional dynamics at a
single time scale such as a characteristic shape of an asymmetry generating
component of the conditional probability distribution result in the
"elementary" market mill pattern. This asymmetry generating component matches
the empirical distribution obtained from the market data. We discuss these
properties as a mixture of trend-preserving and contrarian strategies used by
market agents. Three basic types of asymmetry patterns characterizing
individual stocks are outlined. Multiple time scale considerations make the
resulting "composite" mill similar to the empirical market mill patterns.
Multiscale model also reflects a multi-agent nature of the market.
