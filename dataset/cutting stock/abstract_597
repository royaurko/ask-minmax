Many Ore Reserves are harvested by a combination of open cut and underground
methods. In these cases there is often a choice to be made as to whether to
mine particular material by either open cut or underground, typically when an
open cut mine is above a proposed underground mine. The area, in which this
decision is to be made is referred to as the transition zone. This paper
provides a review of existing methods encompassing: graph-theory based
optimisation employing an opportunity cost approach; heuristics and
meta-heuristics; mixed integer programming and experience-based approaches.
This paper also presents a novel extension of the opportunity cost approach,
allowing it to take into account a crown pillar.
