A nonlocal chiral quark model is consistently extended beyond mean field
using a strict 1/Nc expansion scheme. The parameters of the nonlocal model are
refitted so that the physical values of the pion mass and the weak pion decay
constant are obtained. The size of the 1/Nc correction to the quark condensate
is carefully studied and compared with the usual local Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
model. It is found that even the sign of the corrections can be different. This
can be attributed to the mesonic cut-off of the local model. The model is also
applied to finite temperature. We find that the 1/Nc corrections dominate the
melting of the chiral condensate at low temperatures, T<100 MeV, in agreement
with chiral perturbation theory. On the other hand, the relative importance of
the 1/Nc corrections in the cross-over regime depends on the parameter T0 of
the Polyakov loop potential. For T0=270 MeV, corresponding to a fit of lattice
data for pure gluodynamics, the correction terms are large and lead to a
lowering of the chiral phase transition temperature in comparison with the
mean-field result. Near the phase transition the 1/Nc expansion breaks down and
a non-perturbative scheme is needed to include mesonic correlations in that
regime. Lowering T0 leads to a more rapid cross-over even at the mean-field
level and the unstable region for the 1/Nc corrections shrinks. For T0< 220 MeV
the temperatures of deconfinement and chiral restoration are practically
synchronized.
