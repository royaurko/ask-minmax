We investigate the recently introduced variety of a set of stock returns
traded in a financial market. This investigation is done by considering daily
and intraday time horizons in a 15-day time period centered at the August 31st,
1998 crash of the S&P500 index. All the stocks traded at the NYSE during that
period are considered in the present analysis. We show that the statistical
properties of the variety observed in analyses of daily returns also hold for
intraday returns. In particular the largest changes of the variety of the
return distribution turns out to be most localized at the opening or (to a less
degree) at the closing of the market.
