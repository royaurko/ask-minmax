We used the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph of the ESO-Very Large
Telescope to obtain a high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum
of Stock 16-12, an early-type star which previous Delta-a photometric
observations suggest being a chemically peculiar (CP) star. We used spectral
synthesis to perform a detailed abundance analysis obtaining an effective
temperature of 8400 +/- 400 K, a surface gravity of 4.1 +/- 0.4, a
microturbulence velocity of 3.4 +0.7/-0.3 km/s, and a projected rotational
velocity of 68 +/- 4 km/s. We provide photometric and spectroscopic evidence
showing the star is most likely a member of the young Stock 16 open cluster
(age 3-8 Myr). The probable cluster membership, the star's position in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and the found infrared excess strongly suggest the
star is still in the pre-main-sequence (PMS) phase. We used PMS evolutionary
tracks to determine the stellar mass, which ranges between 1.95 and 2.3 Msun,
depending upon the adopted spectroscopic or photometric data results.
Similarly, we obtained a stellar age ranging between 4 and 6 Myr, in agreement
with that of the cluster. Because the star's chemical abundance pattern
resembles well that known of main sequence CP metallic line (Am) stars, the
object sets important constraints to the diffusion theory. Additional
spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric data allowed us to conclude that the
object is probably a single non-magnetic star.
