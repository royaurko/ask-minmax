Several aspects of the general theory for the critical states of a vortex
lattice and the magnetic flux dynamics in type-II superconductors are examined
by a direct variational optimisation method and widespread physical principles.
Our method allows to unify a number of conventional models describing the
complex vortex configurations in the critical state regime. Special attention
is given to the discussion of the relation between the flux-line cutting
mechanism and the depinning threshold limitation. This is done by using a
smooth double critical state concept which incorporates the so-called
isotropic, elliptical, T and CT models as well-defined limits of our general
treatment. Starting from different initial configurations for a superconducting
slab in a 3D magnetic field, we show that the predictions of the theory range
from the collapse to zero of transverse magnetic moments in the isotropic
model, to nearly force free configurations in which paramagnetic values can
arbitrarily increase with the applied field for magnetically anisotropic
current voltage laws. Noteworthily, the differences between the several model
predictions are minimal for the low applied field regime.
