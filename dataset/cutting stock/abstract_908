The word-stock of a language is a complex dynamical system in which words can
be created, evolve, and become extinct. Even more dynamic are the short-term
fluctuations in word usage by individuals in a population. Building on the
recent demonstration that word niche is a strong determinant of future rise or
fall in word frequency, here we introduce a model that allows us to distinguish
persistent from temporary increases in frequency. Our model is illustrated
using a 10^8-word database from an online discussion group and a 10^11-word
collection of digitized books. The model reveals a strong relation between
changes in word dissemination and changes in frequency. Aside from their
implications for short-term word frequency dynamics, these observations are
potentially important for language evolution as new words must survive in the
short term in order to survive in the long term.
