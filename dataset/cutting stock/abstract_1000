We present Window To The Stars, a graphical user interface to the popular
TWIN single/binary stellar evolution code, for novices, students and
professional astrophysicists.
  It removes the drudgery associated with the traditional approach to running
the code, while maintaining the power, output quality and flexibility a modern
stellar evolutionist requires. It is currently being used for cutting edge
research and interactive teaching.
