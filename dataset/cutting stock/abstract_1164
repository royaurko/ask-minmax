In a superconductor electrons form pairs for which the end states of normal
and umklapp scattering may overlap. This cuts electron pairing off at a phonon
frequency, $\omega_c$, low compared with the Debye frequency, $\omega_D$. Using
this insight, correct values of $2\Delta/k_BT_c$ (average error 8.9%) for 12
superconductive metals, including Hg and Pb, are achieved from simple BCS
formalism with an average $\omega_c/\omega_D$ of 0.148: Landau's idea of a
Fermi liquid may cover strong-coupling superconductors. The cancellation
between normal and umklapp scattering may be more important than a strong
electron-phonon interaction in reaching a high critical temperature $T_c$.
