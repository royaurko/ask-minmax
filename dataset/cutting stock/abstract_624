We discuss our recent results on the statistical properties of damped Lyman
alpha systems (DLAs) at low redshift (z<1.65) (Rao & Turnshek 2000). Contrary
to expectations, we found that the cosmological neutral gas mass density as
traced by DLAs, $\Omega_{DLA}$, does not evolve from redshifts $z \approx 4$ to
$z \approx 0.5$ and that extrapolation to z=0 results in a value that is a
factor of ~6.5 times higher than what is derived from galaxies at the current
epoch using HI 21 cm emission measurements. We review the current status of HI
measurements at low redshift and at the current epoch, and discuss possible
causes of this discrepancy.
