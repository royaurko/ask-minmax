We investigate multifractality in the Korean stock-market index KOSPI. The
generalized $q$th order height-height correlation function shows multiscaling
properties. There are two scaling regimes with a crossover time around $t_c
=40$ min. We consider the original data sets and the modified data sets
obtained by removing the daily jumps, which occur due to the difference between
the closing index and the opening index. To clarify the origin of the
multifractality, we also smooth the data through convolution with a Gaussian
function. After convolution we observe that the multifractality disappears in
the short-time scaling regime $t<t_c$, but remains in the long-time scaling
regime $t>t_c$, regardless of whether or not the daily jumps are removed. We
suggest that multifractality in the short-time scaling regime is caused by the
local fluctuations of the stock index. But the multifractality in the long-time
scaling regime appears to be due to the intrinsic trading properties, such as
herding behavior, information outside the market, the long memory of the
volatility, and the nonlinear dynamics of the stock market.
