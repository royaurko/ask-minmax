We examine the analytic properties of the photon polarization function in a
background magnetic field, using the technique of inverse Mellin transform. The
photon polarization function is first expressed as a power series of the photon
energy $\omega$ with $\omega< 2m_e$. Based upon this energy expansion and the
branch cut of the photon polarization function in the complex $\omega$ plane,
we compute the absorptive part of the polarization function with the inverse
Mellin transform. Our results are valid for arbitrary photon energies and
magnetic-field strengths. The applications of our approach are briefly
discussed.
