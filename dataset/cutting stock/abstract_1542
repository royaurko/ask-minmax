We present a study of the capability of a 500 GeV e+e- collider based on CLIC
technology for precision measurements of top quark properties. The analysis is
based on full detector simulations of the CLIC_ILD detector concept using
Geant4, including realistic background contributions from two photon processes.
Event reconstruction is performed using a particle flow algorithm with
stringent cuts to control the influence of background. The mass and width of
the top quark are studied in fully-hadronic and semi-leptonic decays of ttbar
pairs using event samples of signal and standard model background processes
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 100/fb. Statistical uncertainties
of the top mass given by the invariant mass of its decay products of 0.08 GeV
and 0.09 GeV are obtained for the fully-hadronic and the semi-leptonic decay
channel, respectively, demonstrating that similar precision to that at ILC can
be achieved at CLIC despite less favorable experimental conditions.
