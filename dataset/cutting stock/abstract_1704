During geomagnetic field reversals the radiation belt high-energy proton
populations become depleted. Their energy spectra become softer, with the
trapped particles of highest energies being lost first, and eventually
recovering after a field reversal. The radiation belts rebuild in a dynamical
way with the energy spectra flattening on the average during the course of many
millennia, but without ever reaching complete steady state equilibrium between
successive geomagnetic storm events determined by southward turnings of the IMF
orientation. Considering that the entry of galactic cosmic rays and the solar
energetic particles with energies above a given threshold are strongly
controlled by the intensity of the northward component of the interplanetary
magnetic field, we speculate that at earlier epochs when the geomagnetic dipole
was reversed, the entry of these energetic particles into the geomagnetic field
was facilitated when the interplanetary magnetic field was directed northward.
Unlike in other complementary work where intensive numerical simulations have
been used, our demonstration is based on a simple analytical extension of
Stormer's theory. The access of GCR and SEP beyond geomagnetic cut-off
latitudes is enhanced during epochs when the Earth's magnetic dipole is
reduced, as already demonstrated earlier.
