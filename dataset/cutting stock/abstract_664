We present a simple two-dimensional dynamical system where two nonlinear
terms, exerting respectively positive feedback and reversal, compete to create
a singularity in finite time decorated by accelerating oscillations. The power
law singularity results from the increasing growth rate. The oscillations
result from the restoring mechanism. As a function of the order of the
nonlinearity of the growth rate and of the restoring term, a rich variety of
behavior is documented analytically and numerically. The dynamical behavior is
traced back fundamentally to the self-similar spiral structure of trajectories
in phase space unfolding around an unstable spiral point at the origin. The
interplay between the restoring mechanism and the nonlinear growth rate leads
to approximately log-periodic oscillations with remarkable scaling properties.
Three domains of applications are discussed: (1) the stock market with a
competition between nonlinear trend-followers and nonlinear value investors;
(2) the world human population with a competition between a
population-dependent growth rate and a nonlinear dependence on a finite
carrying capacity; (3) the failure of a material subjected to a time-varying
stress with a competition between positive geometrical feedback on the damage
variable and nonlinear healing.
