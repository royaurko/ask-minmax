IGMtransmission is a Java graphical user interface that implements Monte
Carlo simulations to compute the corrections to colours of high-redshift
galaxies due to intergalactic attenuation based on current models of the
Intergalactic Medium. The effects of absorption due to neutral hydrogen are
considered, with particular attention to the stochastic effects of Lyman Limit
Systems. Attenuation curves are produced, as well as colours for a wide range
of filter responses and model galaxy spectra. Alternative filter response
curves and spectra may be readily uploaded. The code is freely available from
