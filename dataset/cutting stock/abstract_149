In this paper we seek to demonstrate the predictability of stock market
returns and explain the nature of this return predictability. To this end, we
further develop the news-driven analytic model of the stock market derived in
Gusev et al. (2015). This enables us to capture market dynamics at various
timescales and shed light on mechanisms underlying certain market behaviors
such as transitions between bull- and bear markets and the self-similar
behavior of price changes. We investigate the model and show that the market is
nearly efficient on timescales shorter than one day, adjusting quickly to
incoming news, but is inefficient on longer timescales, where news may have a
long-lasting nonlinear impact on dynamics attributable to a feedback mechanism
acting over these horizons. Using the model, we design the prototypes of
algorithmic strategies that utilize news flow, quantified and measured, as the
only input to trade on market return forecasts over multiple horizons, from
days to months. The backtested results suggest that the return is predictable
to the extent that successful trading strategies can be constructed to harness
this predictability.
