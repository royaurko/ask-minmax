We have investigated the spin fluctuations in the langasite compound
Ba3NbFe3Si2O14 in both the ordered state and as a function of temperature. The
low temperature magnetic structure is defined by a spiral phase characterized
by magnetic Bragg peaks at q=(0,0,tau ~ 1/7) onset at TN=27 K as previously
reported by Marty et al. The nature of the fluctuations and temperature
dependence of the order parameter is consistent with a classical second order
phase transition for a two dimensional triangular antiferromagnet. We will show
that the physical properties and energy scales including the ordering
wavevector, Curie-Weiss temperature, and the spin-waves can be explained
through the use of only symmetric exchange constants without the need for the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This is accomplished through a set of
``helical" exchange pathways along the c direction imposed by the chiral
crystal structure and naturally explains the magnetic diffuse scattering which
displays a strong vector chirality up to high temperatures well above the
ordering temperature. This illustrates a strong coupling between magnetic and
crystalline chirality in this compound.
