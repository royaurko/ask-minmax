Starting from the observation of the real trading activity, we propose a
model of a stockmarket simulating all the typical phases taking place in a
stock exchange. We show that there is no need of several classes of agents once
one has introduced realistic constraints in order to confine money, time, gain
and loss within an appropriate range. The main ingredients are local and global
coupling, randomness, Zipf distribution of resources and price formation when
inserting an order. The simulation starts with the initial public offer and
comprises the broadcasting of news/advertisements and the building of the book,
where all the selling and buying orders are stored. The model is able to
reproduce fat tails and clustered volatility, the two most significant
characteristics of a real stockmarket, being driven by very intuitive
parameters.
