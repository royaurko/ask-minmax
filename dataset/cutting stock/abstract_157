Previous analyses of a large ensemble of stock markets have demonstrated that
a log-periodic power law (LPPL) behavior of the prices constitutes a qualifying
signature of speculative bubbles that often land with a crash. We detect such a
LPPL signature in the foreign capital inflow during the bubble on the US
markets culminating in March 2000. We detect a weak synchronization and lag
with the NASDAQ 100 LPPL pattern. We propose to rationalize these observations
by the existence of positive feedback loops between market-appreciation /
increased-spending / increased-deficit-of-balance-of-payment /
larger-foreign-surplus / increased-foreign-capital-inflows and so on. Our
analysis suggests that foreign capital inflow have been following rather than
causing the bubble. We then combine a macroeconomic analysis of feedback
processes occurring between the economy and the stock market with a technical
analysis of more than two hundred years of the DJIA to investigate possible
scenarios for the future, three years after the end of the bubble and deep into
a bearish regime. We also detect a LPPL accelerating bubble on the EURO against
the US dollar and the Japanese Yen. In sum, our analyses is in line with our
previous work on the LPPL ``anti-bubble'' representing the bearish market that
started in 2000.
