This paper will examine a model with many agents, each of whom has a
different belief about the dynamics of a risky asset. The agents are Bayesian
and so learn about the asset over time. All agents are assumed to have a finite
(but random) lifetime. When an agent dies, he passes his wealth (but not his
knowledge) onto his heir. As a result, the agents never become sure of the
dynamics of the risky asset. We derive expressions for the stock price and
riskless rate. We then use numerical examples to exhibit their behaviour.
