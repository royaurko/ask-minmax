Intertrade duration of equities is an important financial measure
characterizing the trading activities, which is defined as the waiting time
between successive trades of an equity. Using the ultrahigh-frequency data of a
liquid Chinese stock and its associated warrant, we perform a comparative
investigation of the statistical properties of their intertrade duration time
series. The distributions of the two equities can be better described by the
shifted power-law form than the Weibull and their scaled distributions do not
collapse onto a single curve. Although the intertrade durations of the two
equities have very different magnitude, their intraday patterns exhibit very
similar shapes. Both detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and detrending moving
average analysis (DMA) show that the 1-min intertrade duration time series of
the two equities are strongly correlated. In addition, both multifractal
detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) and multifractal detrending moving
average analysis (MFDMA) unveil that the 1-min intertrade durations possess
multifractal nature. However, the difference between the two singularity
spectra of the two equities obtained from the MFDMA is much smaller than that
from the MFDFA.
