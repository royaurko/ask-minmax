There is widespread agreement that cloud computing have proven cost cutting
and agility benefits. However, security and regulatory compliance issues are
continuing to challenge the wide acceptance of such technology both from social
and commercial stakeholders. An important facture behind this is the fact that
clouds and in particular public clouds are usually deployed and used within
broad geographical or even international domains. This implies that the
exchange of private and other protected data within the cloud environment would
be governed by multiple jurisdictions. These jurisdictions have a great degree
of harmonisation; however, they present possible conflicts that are hard to
negotiate at run time. So far, important efforts were played in order to deal
with regulatory compliance management for large distributed systems. However,
measurable solutions are required for the context of cloud. In this position
paper, we are suggesting an approach that starts with a conceptual model of
explicit regulatory requirements for exchanging private data on a
multijurisdictional environment and build on it in order to define metrics for
non-compliance or, in other terms, risks to compliance. These metrics will be
integrated within usual data access-control policies and will be checked at
policy analysis time before a decision to allow/deny the data access is made.
