Our article considers a regression model with observed factors. The observed
factors have a flexible stochastic volatility structure that has separate
dynamics for the volatilities and the correlation matrix. The correlation
matrix of the factors is time-varying and its evolution is described by an
inverse Wishart process. The model specifies the evolution of the observed
volatilities flexibly and is particularly attractive when the dimension of the
observations is high. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed to
estimate the model. It is straightforward to use this algorithm to obtain the
predictive distributions of future observations and to carry out model
selection. The model is illustrated and compared to other Wishart-type factor
multivariate stochastic volatility models using various empirical data
including monthly stock returns and portfolio weighted returns. The evidence
suggests that our model has better predictive performance. The paper also
allows the idiosyncratic errors to follow individual stochastic volatility
processes in order to deal with more volatile data such as daily or weekly
stock returns.
