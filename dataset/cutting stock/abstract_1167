We construct a model of a rotating wormhole made by cutting and pasting two
Kerr spacetimes. As a result, we obtain a rotating thin-shell wormhole with
exotic matter at the throat. Two candidates for the exotic matter are
considered: (i) a perfect fluid; (ii) an anisotropic fluid. We show that a
perfect fluid is unable to support a rotating thin-shall wormhole. On the
contrary, the anisotropic fluid with the negative energy density can be a
source for such a geometry.
