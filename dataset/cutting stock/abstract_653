High frequency data in finance have led to a deeper understanding on
probability distributions of market prices. Several facts seem to be well
stablished by empirical evidence. Specifically, probability distributions have
the following properties: (i) They are not Gaussian and their center is well
adjusted by Levy distributions. (ii) They are long-tailed but have finite
moments of any order. (iii) They are self-similar on many time scales. Finally,
(iv) at small time scales, price volatility follows a non-diffusive behavior.
We extend Merton's ideas on speculative price formation and present a dynamical
model resulting in a characteristic function that explains in a natural way all
of the above features. The knowledge of such distribution opens a new and
useful way of quantifying financial risk. The results of the model agree -with
high degree of accuracy- with empirical data taken from historical records of
the Standard & Poor's 500 cash index.
