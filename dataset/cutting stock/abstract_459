In this paper a new dissimilarity measure to identify groups of assets
dynamics is proposed. The underlying generating process is assumed to be a
diffusion process solution of stochastic differential equations and observed at
discrete time. The mesh of observations is not required to shrink to zero. As
distance between two observed paths, the quadratic distance of the
corresponding estimated Markov operators is considered. Analysis of both
synthetic data and real financial data from NYSE/NASDAQ stocks, give evidence
that this distance seems capable to catch differences in both the drift and
diffusion coefficients contrary to other commonly used metrics.
