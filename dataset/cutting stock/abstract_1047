We describe the relation between spin fluctuations and superconductivity in a
highly-ordered sample of YBaCu3O6.5 using both polarized and unpolarized
neutron inelastic scattering. The spin susceptibility in the superconducting
phase exhibits one-dimensional incommensurate modulations at low-energies,
consistent with hydrodynamic stripes. With increasing energy the susceptibility
curves upward to a commensurate, intense, well-defined and asymmetric resonance
at 33 meV with a precipitous high-energy cutoff. In the normal phase, which we
show is gapless, the resonance remains surprisingly strong and persists clearly
in Q scans and energy scans. Its similar asymmetric spectral form above Tc=59 K
suggests that incoherent superconducting pairing fluctuations are present in
the normal state. On cooling, the resonance and the stripe modulations grow in
well above Tc below a temperature that is comparable to the pseudogap
temperature where suppression occurs in local and low-momentum properties. The
spectral weight that accrues to the resonance is largely acquired by transfer
from suppressed low-energy fluctuations. We find the resonance to be
isotropically polarized, consistent with a triplet carrying ~2.6% of the total
spectral weight of the Cu spins in the planes.
