I describe two difficulties with current research into the cosmic evolution
of BL Lacertae Objects: (1). Possible sample incompleteness due to unrecognized
(i.e., ``hidden'') BL Lacs; and (2). The absence of a viable physical model of
the evolution, to which current and future observations can be compared.
