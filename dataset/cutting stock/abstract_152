Stock price changes occur through transactions, just as diffusion in physical
systems occurs through molecular collisions. We systematically explore this
analogy and quantify the relation between trading activity - measured by the
number of transactions $N_{\Delta t}$ - and the price change $G_{\Delta t}$,
for a given stock, over a time interval $[t, t+\Delta t]$. To this end, we
analyze a database documenting every transaction for 1000 US stocks over the
two-year period 1994-1995. We find that price movements are equivalent to a
complex variant of diffusion, where the diffusion coefficient fluctuates
drastically in time. We relate the analog of the diffusion coefficient to two
microscopic quantities: (i) the number of transactions $N_{\Delta t}$ in
$\Delta t$, which is the analog of the number of collisions and (ii) the local
variance $w^2_{\Delta t}$ of the price changes for all transactions in $\Delta
t$, which is the analog of the local mean square displacement between
collisions. We study the distributions of both $N_{\Delta t}$ and $w_{\Delta
t}$, and find that they display power-law tails. Further, we find that
$N_{\Delta t}$ displays long-range power-law correlations in time, whereas
$w_{\Delta t}$ does not. Our results are consistent with the interpretation
that the pronounced tails of the distribution of $G_{\Delta t} are due to
$w_{\Delta t}$, and that the long-range correlations previously found for $|
G_{\Delta t} |$ are due to $N_{\Delta t}$.
