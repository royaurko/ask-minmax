We study effects of nonmagnetic impurities in a Spin Bose-Metal (SBM) phase
discovered in a two-leg triangular strip spin-1/2 model with ring exchanges (D.
N. Shenget al, arXiv:0902.4210). This phase is a quasi-1D descendant of a 2D
spin liquid with spinon Fermi sea, and the present study aims at interpolating
between the 1D and 2D cases. Different types of defects can be treated as local
energy perturbations, which we find are always relevant. As a result, a
nonmagnetic impurity generically cuts the system into two decoupled parts. We
calculate bond energy and local spin susceptibility near the defect, both of
which can be measured in experiments. The Spin Bose-Metal has dominant
correlations at characteristic incommensurate wavevectors that are revealed
near the defect. Thus, the bond energy shows a static texture oscillating as a
function of distance from the defect and decaying as a slow power law. The
local spin susceptibility also oscillates and actually {\it increases} as a
function of distance from the defect, similar to the effect found in the 1D
chain [S. Eggert and I. Affleck, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 75}, 934 (1995)]. We
calculate the corresponding power law exponents for the textures as a function
of one Luttinger parameter of the SBM theory.
