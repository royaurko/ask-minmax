Transverse modes in the 3.9 GHz cavities, designed and fabricated by FNAL,
are reported on. These modes have the potential to cause significant emittance
dilution if they are not sufficiently suppressed. Recent
probe-based-experiments have indicated significant discrepancies between modes
predicted in stand-alone 9-cell cavities compared to those in 4-cavity modules.
We employ the code HFSS to analyze these modes, coupled through beam tubes
whose cut-off is above that of the first dipole band.
