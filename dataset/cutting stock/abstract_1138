This paper studies the switching of trading strategies and its effect on the
market volatility in a continuous double auction market. We describe the
behavior when some uninformed agents, who we call switchers, decide whether or
not to pay for information before they trade. By paying for the information
they behave as informed traders. First we verify that our model is able to
reproduce some of the stylized facts in real financial markets. Next we
consider the relationship between switching and the market volatility under
different structures of investors. We find that there exists a positive
relationship between the market volatility and the percentage of switchers. We
therefore conclude that the switchers are a destabilizing factor in the market.
However, for a given fixed percentage of switchers, the proportion of switchers
that decide to buy information at a given moment of time is negatively related
to the current market volatility. In other words, if more agents pay for
information to know the fundamental value at some time, the market volatility
will be lower. This is because the market price is closer to the fundamental
value due to information diffusion between switchers.
