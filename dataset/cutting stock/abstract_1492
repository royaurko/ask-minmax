This talk discusses the effective field theory view of deep inelastic
scattering. In such an approach, the standard factorization formula of a hard
coefficient multiplied by a parton distribution function arises from matching
of QCD onto an effective field theory. The DGLAP equations can then be viewed
as the standard renormalization group equations that determines the cut-off
dependence of the non-local operator whose forward matrix element is the parton
distribution function. As an example, the non-singlet quark splitting functions
is derived directly from the renormalization properties of the non-local
operator itself. This approach, although discussed in the literature, does not
appear to be well known to the larger high energy community. In this talk we
give a pedagogical introduction to this subject.
