In this paper, a procedure for estimating parameters of zero intelligence
models by means of tick-by-tick trade and quote data is proposed and applied to
a general setting, covering a large class of existing zero intelligence models,
and its generalisation allowing for non-unit market orders and shifts of
quotations. Consequently, the procedure is successfully applied to real-life
data of three stocks from nine US electronic markets. It is found, however,
that more complex variants of the model, despite being significant and
possessing a substantial prediction power, do not give significantly better
predictions than a simple model by Smith at al. (2003).
