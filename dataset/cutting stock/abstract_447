We introduce a mathematical criterion defining the bubbles or the crashes in
financial market price fluctuations by considering exponential fitting of the
given data. By applying this criterion we can automatically extract the periods
in which bubbles and crashes are identified. From stock market data of
so-called the Internet bubbles it is found that the characteristic length of
bubble period is about 100 days.
