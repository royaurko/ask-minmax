The high energy limit of QCD is controlled by very high energy density
gluonic matter, the Color Glass Condensate. In the first instants of the
collisions of two sheets of Colored Glass Condensate, a Glasma is formed with
longitudinal flux tubes of color electric and magnetic fields. These flux tubes
decay and might form a turbulent liquid that eventually thermalizes into a
Quark Gluon Plasma
