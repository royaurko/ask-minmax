We empirically investigated the relationships between the degree of
efficiency and the predictability in financial time-series data. The Hurst
exponent was used as the measurement of the degree of efficiency, and the hit
rate calculated from the nearest-neighbor prediction method was used for the
prediction of the directions of future price changes. We used 60 market indexes
of various countries. We empirically discovered that the relationship between
the degree of efficiency (the Hurst exponent) and the predictability (the hit
rate) is strongly positive. That is, a market index with a higher Hurst
exponent tends to have a higher hit rate. These results suggested that the
Hurst exponent is useful for predicting future price changes. Furthermore, we
also discovered that the Hurst exponent and the hit rate are useful as
standards that can distinguish emerging capital markets from mature capital
markets.
