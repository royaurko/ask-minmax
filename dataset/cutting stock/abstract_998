The temporal magnetic correlations of the triangular lattice antiferromagnet
NiGa$_2$S$_4$ are examined through thirteen decades ($10^{-13}-1$~sec) using
ultra-high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering, muon spin relaxation, AC
and nonlinear susceptibility measurements. Unlike the short-ranged {\it
spatial} correlations, the temperature dependence of the {\it temporal}
correlations show distinct anomalies. The spin fluctuation rate decreases
precipitously upon cooling towards $T^{\ast}=8.5$~K, but fluctuations on the
microsecond time scale then persist in an anomalous dynamical regime for 4 K
$<T\le T^{\ast}$. As this time scale exceeds that of single site dynamics by
six orders of magnitude, these fluctuations bear evidence of emergent degrees
of freedom within the short-range correlated incommensurate state of
NiGa$_2$S$_4$.
