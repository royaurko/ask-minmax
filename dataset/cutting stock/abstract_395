Econophysics is a new area developed recently by the cooperation between
economists, mathematicians and physicists. It's not a tool to predict future
prices of stocks and exchange rates. It applies idea, method and models in
Statistical Physics and Complexity to analyze data from economical phenomena.
In this paper, three examples from three active main topics in Econophysics are
presented first. Then using these examples, we analyze the role of Physics in
Econophysics. Some comments and emphasis on Physics of Econophysics are
included. New idea of network analysis for economy systems is proposed, while
the actual analysis is still in progress.
