We discuss exclusive central production of Higgs boson, quark-antiquark and
digluon dijets. Some differential distributions are shown and disussed.
Irreducible leading-order $b \bar b $ background to Higgs production is
calculated. The signal-to-background ratio is shown and improvements are
suggested by imposing cuts on $b$ ($\bar b$) transverse momenta and rapidities.
We disuss also gluonic dijet production. Here we use rather
reggeon-reggeon-gluon vertices. We discuss briefly also a new mechanism of
emission of gluons from different $t$-channel gluons (reggeons). The latter
contribution turned out to be rather small. When gluons are missidentified as
$b$ or $\bar b$ jets the latter contribution constitutes a reducible but large
contribution to exclusive Standard Model Higgs boson.
