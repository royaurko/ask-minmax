This paper continues a series of studies of dependence patterns following
from properties of the bivariate probability distribution P(x,y) of two
consecutive price increments x (push) and y (response). The paper focuses on
individual differences of the P(x,y) for 2000 stocks using a methodology of
identification of asymmetric market mill patterns developed in [1,2]. We show
that individual asymmetry patterns (portraits) are remarkably stable over time
and can be classified into three major groups - correlation, anticorrelation
and market mill. We analyze the conditional dynamics resulting from the
properties of P(x,y) for all groups and demonstrate that it is trend-following
at small push magnitudes and contrarian at large ones
