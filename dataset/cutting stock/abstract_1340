We develop a model for gamma-ray emission from the outer magnetosphere of
pulsars (the outer-gap model). The charge depletion causes a large electric
field which accelerates electrons and positrons. We solve the electric field
with radiation and pair creation processes self-consistently, and calculate
curvature spectrum and Inverse-Compton (IC) spectrum. We apply this theory to
PSR B0833-45 (Vela) and B1706-44 for which their surface magnetic fields,
observed thermal X-rays are similar to each other. We find that each observed
cut-off energies of the gamma-rays are well explained. By inclusion of emission
outside the gap, the spectrum is in better agreement with the observations than
the spectrum arising only from the inside of the gap. The expected TeV fluxes
are much smaller than that observed by CANGAROO group in the direction of
B1706-44.
