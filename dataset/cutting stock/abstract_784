Local inhomogeneities known as polar nanoregions (PNR) play a key role in
governing the dielectric properties of relaxor ferroelectrics - a special class
of material that exhibits an enormous electromechanical response and is easily
polarized with an external field. Using neutron inelastic scattering methods,
we show that the PNR can also significantly affect the structural properties of
the relaxor ferroelectric Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3-4.5%PbTiO3 (PZN-4.5%PT). A strong
interaction is found between the PNR and the propagation of sound waves, i.e.
acoustic phonons, the visibility of which can be enhanced with an external
electric field. A comparison between acoustic phonons propagating along
different directions reveals a large asymmetry in the lattice dynamics that is
induced by the PNR. We suggest that a phase instability induced by this
PNR-phonon interaction may contribute to the ultrahigh piezoelectric response
of this and related relaxor ferroelectric materials. Our results also naturally
explain the emergence of the various observed monoclinic phases in these
systems.
