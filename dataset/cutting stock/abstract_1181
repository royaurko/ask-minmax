For the present analysis we simulate the reaction 129Xe 54+197Au79 at E=50
MeV/nucleon respectively[3]. This reaction is simulated at different impact
parameters using hard equation of state. The stored phase space is then
analyzed by using MST, MSTP and MSTB algorithms. MSTB and MSTP identifies the
free nucleons as early as possible. In the two cases, a check in the form of
binding energy and momentum cut helps to identify the fragments quite early.
The normal MST takes quite a long time to identify the stable fragments which
are residual of excited fragments.
