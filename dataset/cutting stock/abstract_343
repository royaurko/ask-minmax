When modelling stock market dynamics, the price formation is often based on
an equilbrium mechanism. In real stock exchanges, however, the price formation
is goverend by the order book. It is thus interesting to check if the resulting
stylized facts of a model with equilibrium pricing change, remain the same or,
more generally, are compatible with the order book environment. We tackle this
issue in the framework of a case study by embedding the
Bornholdt-Kaizoji-Fujiwara spin model into the order book dynamics. To this
end, we use a recently developed agent based model that realistically
incorporates the order book. We find realistic stylized facts. We conclude for
the studied case that equilibrium pricing is not needed and that the
corresponding assumption of a "fundamental" price may be abandoned.
