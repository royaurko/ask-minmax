Recently, in order to explore the mechanism behind wealth or income
distribution, several models have been proposed by applying principles of
statistical mechanics. These models share some characteristics, such as
consisting of a group of individual agents, a pile of money and a specific
trading rule. Whatever the trading rule is, the most noteworthy fact is that
money is always transferred from one agent to another in the transferring
process. So we call them money transfer models. Besides explaining income and
wealth distributions, money transfer models can also be applied to other
disciplines. In this paper we summarize these areas as statistical
distribution, economic mobility, transfer rate and money creation. First, money
distribution (or income distribution) can be exhibited by recording the money
stock (flow). Second, the economic mobility can be shown by tracing the change
in wealth or income over time for each agent. Third, the transfer rate of money
and its determinants can be analyzed by tracing the transferring process of
each one unit of money. Finally, money creation process can also be
investigated by permitting agents go into debts. Some future extensions to
these models are anticipated to be structural improvement and generalized
mathematical analysis.
