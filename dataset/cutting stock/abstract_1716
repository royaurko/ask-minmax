The apparent absence of light superpartners at the LHC strongly constrains
the viability of the MSSM as a solution to the hierarchy problem. These
constraints can be significantly alleviated by R-parity violation (RPV).
Bilinear R-parity violation, with the single operator L H_u, does not require
any special flavor structure and can be naturally embedded in a GUT while
avoiding constraints from proton decay (unlike baryon-number-violating RPV).
The LSP in this scenario can be naturally long-lived, giving rise to displaced
vertices. Many collider searches, particularly those selecting b-jets or
leptons, are insensitive to events with such detector-scale displaced decays
owing to cuts on track quality and impact parameter. We demonstrate that for
decay lengths in the window ~1-1000 mm, constraints on superpartner masses can
be as low as ~450 GeV for squarks and ~40 GeV for LSPs. In some parts of
parameter space light LSPs can dominate the Higgs decay width, hiding the Higgs
from existing searches. This framework motivates collider searches for
detector-scale displaced vertices. LHCb may be ideally suited to trigger on
such events, while ATLAS and CMS may need to trigger on missing energy in the
event.
