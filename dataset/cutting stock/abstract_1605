The results of the Tenerife Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments are
presented. These observations cover 5000 and 6500 square degrees on the sky at
10 and 15 GHz respectively centred around Dec.~ +35 degrees. The experiments
are sensitive to multipoles l=10-30 which corresponds to the Sachs-Wolfe
plateau of the CMB power spectra. The sensitivity of the results are ~31 and
\~12 microK at 10 and 15 GHz respectively in a beam-size region (5 degrees
FWHM). The data at 15 GHz show clear detection of structure at high Galactic
latitude; the results at 10 GHz are compatible with these, but at lower
significance. A likelihood analysis of the 10 and 15 GHz data at high Galactic
latitude, assuming a flat CMB band power spectra gives a signal Delta
T_l=30+10-8 microK (68 % C.L.). Including the possible contaminating effect due
to the diffuse Galactic component, the CMB signal is Delta T_l=30+15-11 microK.
These values are highly stable against the Galactic cut chosen. Assuming a
Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum for the primordial fluctuations, the above values
imply an expected quadrupole Q_RMS-PS=20+10-7 microK which confirms previous
results from these experiments, and which are compatible with the COBE DMR.
