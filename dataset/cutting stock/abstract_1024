The NGC4410 group of galaxies provides us a rare opportunity to study a
nearby (97 h75^-1 Mpc) example of a radio galaxy (NGC4410A) embedded in an
extended X-ray source, with evidence for star formation that can be readily
spatially distinguished from regions dominated by the AGN and shocks. We
present broadband and narrowband optical images along with optical and IUE
ultraviolet spectroscopy for the radio galaxy NGC 4410A and its companion NGC
4410B. Our H-alpha+[NII] images reveal six luminous HII regions (L_H-alpha ~
1e40 erg/s distributed in an arc near NGC 4410A. Partially completing the ring
is a prominent stellar loop containing diffuse ionized gas. This filamentary
gas, in contrast to the H II regions, shows spectroscopic signatures of shock
ionization. The star formation in this system may have been triggered by a
collision or interaction between the two galaxies, perhaps by an expanding
density wave, as in classical models of ring galaxies. Alternatively, the star
formation may have been induced by the impact of a radio jet on the
interstellar matter. Extended Ly-alpha is detected in the ultraviolet IUE
spectrum. The ultraviolet continuum, which is presumably radiated by the
nucleus of NGC4410A, is not extended. NGC4410A appears to be interacting with
its neighbors in the NGC4410 group, and could be an example of a spiral galaxy
transforming into an elliptical.
