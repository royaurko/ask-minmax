We examine the possibility of observing exotic top quark decays via
R-violating SUSY interactions at the Fermilab Tevatron and CERN LHC. We present
cross-sections for $t\bar t$ production followed by the subsequent decay of
either $t$ or $\bar t$ via the R-violating interaction while the other
undergoes the SM decay. With suitable kinematic cuts, we find that the exotic
decays can possibly be detected over standard model backgrounds at the future
runs of the Tevatron and LHC, but not at Run 1 of the Tevatron due to limited
statistics. Discovery limits for R-Violating couplings in the top sector are
presented.
