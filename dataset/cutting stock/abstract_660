We develop a theory for option pricing with perfect hedging in an inefficient
market model where the underlying price variations are autocorrelated over a
time tau. This is accomplished by assuming that the underlying noise in the
system is derived by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, rather than from a Wiener process.
With a modified portfolio consisting in calls, secondary calls and bonds we
achieve a riskless strategy which results in a closed expression for the
European call price which is always lower than Black-Scholes price. We also
obtain a partial differential equation for the option price and study the
sensitivity to several parameters and the risk of the dynamics of the call
price.
