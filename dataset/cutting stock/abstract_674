We investigate present some new statistical properties of order books. We
analyse data from the Nasdaq and investigate (a) the statistics of incoming
limit order prices, (b) the shape of the average order book, and (c) the
typical life time of a limit order as a function of the distance from the best
price. We also determine the `price impact' function using French and British
stocks, and find a logarithmic, rather than a power-law, dependence of the
price response on the volume. The weak time dependence of the response function
shows that the impact is, surprisingly, quasi-permanent, and suggests that
trading itself is interpreted by the market as new information.
