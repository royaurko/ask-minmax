Recent wide-field photometric surveys (Lee et al.; Pancino et al.) have shown
the existence of a previously unknown metal-rich ([Fe/H] -0.6) stellar
population in the galactic globular cluster omega Centauri. The discovery of
this new component, which comprises only a small percentage (~5%) of the entire
cluster population, has added a new piece to the already puzzling picture of
the star formation and chemical evolution of this stellar system. In this
Letter we show that stars belonging to the newly discovered metal-rich
population have a coherent bulk motion with respect to the other cluster stars,
thus demonstrating that they formed in an independent self-gravitating stellar
system. This is the first clear-cut evidence that extreme metal-rich stars were
part of a small stellar system (a satellite of omega Centauri?) that has been
accreted by the main body of the cluster. In this case, we are witnessing an in
vivo example of hierarchical merging on the sub-galactic scale.
