This paper offers a new method for estimation and forecasting of the
volatility of financial time series when the stationarity assumption is
violated. Our general local parametric approach particularly applies to general
varying-coefficient parametric models, such as GARCH, whose coefficients may
arbitrarily vary with time. Global parametric, smooth transition, and
change-point models are special cases. The method is based on an adaptive
pointwise selection of the largest interval of homogeneity with a given
right-end point by a local change-point analysis. We construct locally adaptive
estimates that can perform this task and investigate them both from the
theoretical point of view and by Monte Carlo simulations. In the particular
case of GARCH estimation, the proposed method is applied to stock-index series
and is shown to outperform the standard parametric GARCH model.
