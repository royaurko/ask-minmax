General relativity has very specific predictions for the gravitational
waveforms from inspiralling compact binaries obtained using the post-Newtonian
(PN) approximation. We investigate the extent to which the measurement of the
PN coefficients, possible with the second generation gravitationalwave
detectors such as the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
Observatory (LIGO) and the third generation gravitational-wave detectors such
as the Einstein Telescope (ET), could be used to test post-Newtonian theory and
to put bounds on a subclass of parametrized-post-Einstein theories which differ
from general relativity in a parametrized sense. We demonstrate this
possibility by employing the best inspiralling waveform model for nonspinning
compact binaries which is 3.5PN accurate in phase and 3PN in amplitude. Within
the class of theories considered, Advanced LIGO can test the theory at 1.5PN
and thus the leading tail term. Future observations of stellar mass black hole
binaries by ET can test the consistency between the various PN coefficients in
the gravitational-wave phasing over the mass range of 11-44 Msun. The choice of
the lower frequency cut off is important for testing post-Newtonian theory
using the ET. The bias in the test arising from the assumption of nonspinning
binaries is indicated.
