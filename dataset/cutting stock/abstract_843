A complex system is a system composed of many interacting parts, often called
agents, which displays collective behavior that does not follow trivially from
the behaviors of the individual parts. Examples include condensed matter
systems, ecosystems, stock markets and economies, biological evolution, and
indeed the whole of human society. Substantial progress has been made in the
quantitative understanding of complex systems, particularly since the 1980s,
using a combination of basic theory, much of it derived from physics, and
computer simulation. The subject is a broad one, drawing on techniques and
ideas from a wide range of areas. Here I give a survey of the main themes and
methods of complex systems science and an annotated bibliography of resources,
ranging from classic papers to recent books and reviews.
