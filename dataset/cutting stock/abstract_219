While BL Lacertae objects are widely believed to be highly beamed,
low-luminosity radio galaxies, many radio-selected BL Lacs have extended radio
power levels and optical emission lines that are too luminous to be
low-luminosity radio galaxies. Also, Stocke & Rector discovered an excess of
MgII absorption systems along BL Lac sightlines compared to quasars, suggesting
that gravitational lensing may be another means of creating the BL Lac
phenomenon in some cases. We present a search for gravitationally-lensed BL
Lacs with deep, high-resolution, two-frequency VLA radio maps of seven lensing
candidates from the 1 Jansky BL Lac sample. We find that none of these objects
are resolved into an Einstein ring like B 0218+357, nor do any show multiple
images of the core. All of the lensing candidates that were resolved show a
flat-spectrum core and very unusual, steep-spectrum extended morphology that is
incompatible with a multiply lensed system. Thus, while these observations do
not rule out microlensing, no macrolensing is observed.
