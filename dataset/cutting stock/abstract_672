High energy x-ray diffraction measurements on Pb(Zn$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$
(PZN) single crystals show that the system does not have a rhombohedral
symmetry at room temperature as previously believed. The new phase (X) in the
bulk of the crystal gives Bragg peaks similar to that of a nearly cubic lattice
with a slight tetragonal distortion. The Bragg profile remains sharp with no
evidence of size broadening due to the polar micro crystals (MC). However, in
our preliminary studies of the skin, we have found the expected rhombohedral
(R) phase as a surface state. On the other hand, studies on an electric-field
poled PZN single crystal clearly indicate a rhombohedral phase at room
temperature.
