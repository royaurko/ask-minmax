The capacity of a class of multi-way relay channels, where L users
communicate via a relay (at possibly different rates), is derived for the case
where the channel outputs are modular sums of the channel inputs and the
receiver noise. The cut-set upper bound to the capacity is shown to be
achievable. More specifically, the capacity is achieved using (i) rate
splitting, (ii) functional-decode-forward, and (iii) joint source-channel
coding. We note that while separate source-channel coding can achieve the
common-rate capacity, joint source-channel coding is used to achieve the
capacity for the general case where the users are transmitting at different
rates.
