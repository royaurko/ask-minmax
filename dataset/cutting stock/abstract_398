This paper is devoted to problem of detecting critical events at finiacial
markets using methods of multifractal analysis. Namely, the local regularity of
time-series is studied. As a result, one can find out a special behavior or
signal of regularity before crashes. This spesial behaviour of local Hoelder
exponents inherent in financial time series can be used in detecting critcal
events or crashes at financial markets.
