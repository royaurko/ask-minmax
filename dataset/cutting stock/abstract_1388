The strangeness magnetic moment of the proton is shown to be small in the
chiral quark model. The dominant loop contribution is due to kaons. The K^*
loop contributions are proportional to the difference between the strange and
light constituent quark masses or $m_{K^*}^{-2}$ and therefore small. The loop
fluctuations that involve radiative transitions between K^* mesons and kaons
are small, when the cut-off scale in the loops is taken to be close to the
chiral symmetry restoration scale. The net loop amplitude contribution to the
strangeness magnetic moment of the proton is about -0.05, which falls within
the uncertainty range of the experimental value.
