The dynamics of generic stochastic Lotka-Volterra (discrete logistic) systems
of the form \cite{Solomon96a} $w_i (t+1) = \lambda(t) w_i (t) + a {\bar w (t)}
- b w_i (t) {\bar w(t)}$ is studied by computer simulations. The variables
$w_i$, $i=1,...N$, are the individual system components and ${\bar w (t)} =
{1\over N} \sum_i w_i (t)$ is their average. The parameters $a$ and $b$ are
constants, while $\lambda(t)$ is randomly chosen at each time step from a given
distribution. Models of this type describe the temporal evolution of a large
variety of systems such as stock markets and city populations. These systems
are characterized by a large number of interacting objects and the dynamics is
dominated by multiplicative processes. The instantaneous probability
distribution $P(w,t)$ of the system components $w_i$, turns out to fulfill a
(truncated) Pareto power-law $P(w,t) \sim w^{-1-\alpha}$. The time evolution of
${\bar w (t)} $ presents intermittent fluctuations parametrized by a truncated
L\'evy distribution of index $\alpha$, showing a connection between the
distribution of the $w_i$'s at a given time and the temporal fluctuations of
their average.
