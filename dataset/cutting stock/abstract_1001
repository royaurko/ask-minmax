We consider the jump in resistance at the melting transition, which is
experimentally observed to be constant, independent of magnetic field (vortex
density). We present an explanation of this effect based on vortex cuttings,
and universalities of the structure factor at the freezing transition (the
Hansen-Verlet criterion).
