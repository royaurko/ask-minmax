We present a generalization of the sl(2) algebra where the algebraic
relations are constructed with the help of a general function of one of the
generators. When this function is linear this algebra is a deformed sl(2)
algebra. In the non-linear case, the finite dimensional representations are
constructed in two different ways. In the first case, which provides finite
dimensional representations only for the non-linear case, these representations
come from solutions to a dynamical equation and we show how to construct
explicitly these representations for a general quadratic non-linear function.
The other type of finite dimensional representation comes from solutions to a
cut condition equation. We give examples of solutions of this type in the
non-linear case as well.
