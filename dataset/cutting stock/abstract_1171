We give a complete description of exceptional surgeries on pretzel knots of
type $(-2, p, p)$ with $p \ge 5$. It is known that such a knot admits a unique
toroidal surgery yielding a toroidal manifold with a unique incompressible
torus. By cutting along the torus, we obtain two connected components, one of
which is a twisted $I$-bundle over the Klein bottle. We show that the other is
homeomorphic to the one obtained by certain Dehn filling on the magic manifold.
On the other hand, we show that all such pretzel knots admit no Seifert fibered
surgeries.
