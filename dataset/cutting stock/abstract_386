Recently we reported on an application of the Tsallis non-extensive
statistics to the S&P500 stock index. There we argued that the statistics are
applicable to a broad range of markets and exchanges where anamolous (super)
diffusion and 'heavy' tails of the distribution are present, as they are in the
S&P500. We have characterized the statistics of the underlying security as
non-extensive, and now we seek to generalize to the non-extensive statistics
the excess demand models of investors that drive the price formation in a
market.
