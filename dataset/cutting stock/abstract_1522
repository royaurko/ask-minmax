It is well-known from numerical and experimental results that the fraction of
Rydberg states (excited neutral atoms) created by tunnel ionization declines
dramatically with increasing ellipticity of laser light. We present a method to
analyze this dependence on ellipticity, deriving a probability distribution of
Rydberg states that agrees closely with recent experimental [1] and numerical
results. In particular, contradicting the existing proposed mechanism [1] and
general expectations, our results indicate that the dependence of Rydberg yield
on laser ellipticity is not caused by a rescattering process. Rather, we show
that most Rydberg electrons never come back to the vicinity of the exit point
after ionization, and end up relatively far from the atom (compared to the exit
point) after the laser pulse has passed. We also present experimental data
revealing a bifurcation that corresponds to a cut-off in Rydberg generation,
and present an analytic derivation with a perturbative inclusion of the Coloumb
force. [1] T. Nubbemeyer, K. Gorling, A. Saenz, U. Eichmann, and W. Sandner,
