We study a generalization of the Heston model, which consists of two coupled
stochastic differential equations, one for the stock price and the other one
for the volatility. We consider a cubic nonlinearity in the first equation and
a correlation between the two Wiener processes, which model the two white noise
sources. This model can be useful to describe the market dynamics characterized
by different regimes corresponding to normal and extreme days. We analyze the
effect of the noise on the statistical properties of the escape time with
reference to the noise enhanced stability (NES) phenomenon, that is the noise
induced enhancement of the lifetime of a metastable state. We observe NES
effect in our model with stochastic volatility. We investigate the role of the
correlation between the two noise sources on the NES effect.
