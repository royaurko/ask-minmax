In order to simulate the complex phenomena manifested in stock markets, we
introduce a continuous asynchronous model in which millions of individual
traders interact through a central orders matching mechanism, just as it
happens in real stock markets. Each trader has a unique decision function,
which allows him/ her to trade at any time, to react to external news, to
respond to price changes (or volume, volatility, etc.), and to consider the
"fundamental price". As a simple example we consider three "generic" decision
functions, which correspond to three trader profiles: Noisy, Fundamentalist and
Chartist.
