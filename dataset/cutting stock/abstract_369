The self-similar analysis of time series is generalized by introducing the
notion of scenario probabilities. This makes it possible to give a complete
statistical description for the forecast spectrum by defining the average
forecast as a weighted fixed point and by calculating the corresponding a
priori standard deviation and variance coefficient. Several examples of
stock-market time series illustrate the method.
