Motivated by the apparent order-of-magnitude discrepancy between the observed
number of Local Group satellite galaxies, and that predicted by Lambda-CDM
hierarchical clustering cosmologies, we explore an alternate suggestion -
perhaps the missing satellites are not actually ``missing'', but are instead
``in disguise''. The disguise we consider here is that of the classical HI
High-Velocity Clouds. Is it possible that what have been thought of
traditionally as a ``Galactic'' phenomenon, are actually the building blocks of
the Local Group? We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this hypothesis,
and highlight avenues of future research which may provide an unequivocal
resolution to this contentious issue.
