Recently the interest of researchers has shifted from the analysis of
synchronous relationships of financial instruments to the analysis of more
meaningful asynchronous relationships. Both of those analyses are concentrated
only on Pearson's correlation coefficient and thus intraday lead-lag
relationships associated with such. Under Efficient Market Hypothesis such
relationships are not possible as all information is embedded in the prices. In
this paper we analyse lead-lag relationships of financial instruments and
extend known methodology by using mutual information instead of Pearson's
correlation coefficient, which not only is a more general measure, sensitive to
non-linear dependencies, but also can lead to a simpler procedure of
statistical validation of links between financial instruments. We analyse
lagged relationships using NYSE 100 data not only on intraday level but also
for daily stock returns, which has usually been ignored.
