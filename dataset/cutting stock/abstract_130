We propose that predictability is a prerequisite for profitability on
financial markets. We look at ways to measure predictability of price changes
using information theoretic approach and employ them on all historical data
available for NYSE 100 stocks. This allows us to determine whether frequency of
sampling price changes affects the predictability of those. We also relations
between price changes predictability and the deviation of the price formation
processes from iid as well as the stock's sector. We also briefly comment on
the complicated relationship between predictability of price changes and the
profitability of algorithmic trading.
