We present high energy x-ray (67 keV) and neutron scattering measurements on
a single crystal of K$_{1-x}$Li$_x$TaO$_3$ for which the Li content ($x=0.02$)
is less than $x_c = 0.022$, the critical value below which no structural phase
transitions have been reported in zero field. While the crystal lattice does
remain cubic down to T=10 K under both zero-field and field-cooled ($E \le 4$
kV/cm) conditions, indications of crystal symmetry lowering are seen at
$T_C=63$ K where the Bragg peak intensity changes significantly. A strong and
frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity is observed at ambient pressure, a
defining characteristic of relaxors. However an extensive search for static
polar nanoregions, which is also widely associated with relaxor materials,
detected no evidence of elastic neutron diffuse scattering between 300 K and 10
K. Neutron inelastic scattering methods were used to characterize the
transverse acoustic and optic phonons (TA1 and TO1 modes) near the (200) and
(002) Bragg peaks. The zone center TO1 mode softens monotonically with cooling
but never reaches zero energy in either zero field or in external electric
fields of up to 4 kV/cm. These results are consistent with the behavior
expected for a dipolar glass in which the local polar moments are frozen and
exhibit no long-range order at low temperatures.
