We study the single chargino production $e^+ e^- \to \tilde \chi^{\pm}
\mu^{\mp}$ at linear colliders which occurs through the $\l_{121}$ R-parity
violating coupling constant. We focus on the final state containing 4 leptons
and some missing energy. The largest background is \susyq and can be reduced
using the initial beam polarization and some cuts based on the specific
kinematics of the single chargino production. Assuming the highest allowed
supersymmetric background, a center of mass energy of $\sqrt s=500GeV$ and a
luminosity of ${\cal L}=500fb^{-1}$, the sensitivities on the $\l_{121}$
coupling constant obtained from the single chargino production study improve
the low-energy experimental limit over a range of $\Delta m_{\tilde \nu}
\approx 500GeV$ around the sneutrino resonance, and reach values of $\sim
10^{-4}$ at the $\tilde \nu$ pole. The single chargino production also allows
to reconstruct the $\tilde \chi_1^{\pm}$, $\tilde \chi_2^{\pm}$ and $\tilde
\nu$ masses. The initial state radiation plays a fundamental role in this
study.
