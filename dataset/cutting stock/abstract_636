Stochastic resonance (SR) - a counter-intuitive phenomenon in which the
signal due to a weak periodic force in a nonlinear system can be {\it enhanced}
by the addition of external noise - is reviewed. A theoretical approach based
on linear response theory (LRT) is described. It is pointed out that, although
the LRT theory of SR is by definition restricted to the small signal limit, it
possesses substantial advantages in terms of simplicity, generality and
predictive power. The application of LRT to overdamped motion in a bistable
potential, the most commonly studied form of SR, is outlined. Two new forms of
SR, predicted on the basis of LRT and subsequently observed in analogue
electronic experiments, are described.
