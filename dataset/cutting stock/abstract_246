Sales data in a commodity market (supermarket sales to consumers) has been
analysed by studying the fluctuation spectrum and noise correlations. Three
related products (ketchup, mayonnaise and curry sauce) have been analysed. Most
noise in sales is caused by promotions, but here we focus on the fluctuations
in baseline sales. These characterise the dynamics of the market. Four hitherto
unnoticed effects have been found that are difficult to explain from simple
econometric models. These effects are: (1) the noise level in baseline sales is
much higher than can be expected for uncorrelated sales events; (2) weekly
baseline sales differences are distributed according to a broad non-Gaussian
function with fat tails; (3) these fluctuations follow a Levy distribution of
exponent alpha = 1.4, similar to financial exchange markets and in stock
markets; and (4) this noise is correlated over a period of 10 to 11 weeks, or
shows an apparent power law spectrum. The similarity to stock markets suggests
that models developed to describe these markets may be applied to describe the
collective behaviour of consumers.
