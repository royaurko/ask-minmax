Using the correlation matrix formalism we study the temporal aspects of the
Warsaw Stock Market evolution as represented by the WIG20 index. The high
frequency (1 min) WIG20 recordings over the time period between January 2001
and October 2005 are used. The entries of the correlation matrix considered
here connect different distinct periods of the stock market dynamics, like days
or weeks. Such a methodology allows to decompose the price fluctuations into
the orthogonal eigensignals that quantify different modes of the underlying
dynamics. The magnitudes of the corresponding eigenvalues reflect the strengths
of such modes. One observation made in this paper is that strength of the daily
trend in the WIG20 dynamics systematically decreases when going from 2001 to
2005. Another is that large events in the return fluctuations are primarily
associated with a few most collective eigensignals.
