We study the holographic entanglement entropy for singular surfaces in
theories described holographically by hyperscaling violating backgrounds. We
consider singular surfaces consisting of cones or creases in diverse
dimensions. The structure of UV divergences of entanglement entropy exhibits
new logarithmic terms whose coefficients, being cut-off independent, could be
used to define new central charges in the nearly smooth limit. We also show
that there is a relation between these central charges and the one appearing in
the two-point function of the energy-momentum tensor. Finally we examine how
this relation is affected by considering higher-curvature terms in the
gravitational action.
