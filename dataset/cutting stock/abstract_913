We consider a nondominated model of a discrete-time financial market where
stocks are traded dynamically, and options are available for static hedging. In
a general measure-theoretic setting, we show that absence of arbitrage in a
quasi-sure sense is equivalent to the existence of a suitable family of
martingale measures. In the arbitrage-free case, we show that optimal
superhedging strategies exist for general contingent claims, and that the
minimal superhedging price is given by the supremum over the martingale
measures. Moreover, we obtain a nondominated version of the Optional
Decomposition Theorem.
