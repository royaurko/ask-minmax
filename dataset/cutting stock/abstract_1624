We present the first comprehensive derivation of the intrinsic electronic
phase diagram of the iron-oxypnictide superconductors in the normal state based
on the analysis of the electrical resistivity $\rho$ of both
LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$ and SmFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$ for a wide range of doping. Our
data give clear-cut evidence for unusual normal state properties in these new
materials. In particular, the emergence of superconductivity at low doping
levels is accompanied by distinct anomalous transport behavior in $\rho$ of the
normal state which is reminiscent of the spin density wave (SDW) signature in
the parent material. At higher doping levels $\rho$ of LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$
shows a clear transition from this pseudogap-like behavior to Fermi liquid-like
behavior, mimicking the phase diagram of the cuprates. Moreover, our data
reveal a correlation between the strength of the anomalous features and the
stability of the superconducting phase. The pseudogap-like features become
stronger in SmFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$ where superconductivity is enhanced and vanish
when superconductivity is reduced in the doping region with Fermi liquid-like
behavior.
