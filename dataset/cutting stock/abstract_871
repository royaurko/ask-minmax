We consider a financial market with liquidity cost as in \c{C}etin, Jarrow
and Protter [2004], where the supply function $S^{\epsilon}(s,\nu)$ depends on
a parameter $\epsilon\geq 0$ with $S^0(s,\nu)=s$ corresponding to the perfect
liquid situation. Using the PDE characterization of \c{C}etin, Soner and Touzi
[2010] of the super-hedging cost of an option written on such a stock, we
provide a Taylor expansion of the super-hedging cost in powers of $\epsilon$.
In particular, we explicitly compute the first term in the expansion for a
European Call option and give bounds for the order of the expansion for a
European Digital Option.
