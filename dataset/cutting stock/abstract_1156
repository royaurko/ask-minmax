Recent years have seen an unprecedented rise of the role that technology
plays in all aspects of human activities. Unavoidably, technology has heavily
entered the Capital Markets trading space, to the extent that all major
exchanges are now trading exclusively using electronic platforms. The ultra
fast speed of information processing, order placement, and cancelling generates
new dynamics which is still not completely deciphered. Analyzing a large
dataset of stocks traded on the US markets, our study evidences that since 2001
the level of synchronization of large price movements across assets has
significantly increased. Even though the total number of over-threshold events
has diminished in recent years, when an event occurs, the average number of
assets swinging together has increased. Quite unexpectedly, only a minor
fraction of these events -- regularly less than 40% along all years -- can be
connected with the release of pre-announced macroeconomic news. We also
document that the larger is the level of sistemicity of an event, the larger is
the probability -- and degree of sistemicity -- that a new event will occur in
the near future. This opens the way to the intriguing idea that systemic events
emerge as an effect of a purely endogenous mechanism. Consistently, we present
a high-dimensional, yet parsimonious, model based on a class of self- and
cross-exciting processes, termed Hawkes processes, which reconciles the
modeling effort with the empirical evidence.
