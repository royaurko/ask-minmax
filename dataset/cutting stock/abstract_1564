Unusual chemical bonds are proposed. Each bond is almost covalent but is
characterized by the thread of a small radius $\sim 0.6\times 10^{-11}$cm,
between two nuclei in a molecule. The main electron density is concentrated
outside the thread as in a covalent bond. The thread is formed by the electron
wave function which has a tendency to be singular on it. The singularity along
the thread is cut off by electron "vibrations" due to the interaction with zero
point electromagnetic oscillations. The electron energy has its typical value
of (1-10)eV. Due to the small tread radius the uncertainty of the electron
momentum inside the thread is large resulting in a large electron kinetic
energy $\sim 1 MeV$. This energy is compensated by formation of a potential
well due to the reduction of the energy of electromagnetic zero point
oscillations. This is similar to formation of a negative van der Waals
potential. Thread bonds are stable and cannot be created or destructed in
chemical or optical processes.
