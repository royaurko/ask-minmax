This paper is concerned with a pairs trading rule. The idea is to monitor two
historically correlated securities. When divergence is underway, i.e., one
stock moves up while the other moves down, a pairs trade is entered which
consists of a pair to short the outperforming stock and to long the
underperforming one. Such a strategy bets the "spread" between the two would
eventually converge. In this paper, a difference of the pair is governed by a
mean-reverting model. The objective is to trade the pair so as to maximize an
overall return. A fixed commission cost is charged with each transaction. In
addition, a stop-loss limit is imposed as a state constraint. The associated
HJB equations (quasi-variational inequalities) are used to characterize the
value functions. It is shown that the solution to the optimal stopping problem
can be obtained by solving a number of quasi-algebraic equations. We provide a
set of sufficient conditions in terms of a verification theorem. Numerical
examples are reported to demonstrate the results.
