This technical report provides the supplementary material for a paper
entitled "Information based clustering", to appear shortly in Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences (USA). In Section I we present in detail the
iterative clustering algorithm used in our experiments and in Section II we
describe the validation scheme used to determine the statistical significance
of our results. Then in subsequent sections we provide all the experimental
results for three very different applications: the response of gene expression
in yeast to different forms of environmental stress, the dynamics of stock
prices in the Standard and Poor's 500, and viewer ratings of popular movies. In
particular, we highlight some of the results that seem to deserve special
attention. All the experimental results and relevant code, including a freely
available web application, can be found at
