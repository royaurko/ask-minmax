We develop a general out-of-equilibrium framework for a typical
three-terminal setup of common use: an injector, which can be interacting,
coupled by both extended tunneling and Coulomb interactions to an inhomogeneous
wire with any range of interactions and scattering processes. Some of the
crucial results we obtain are of relevance to other muti-terminal geometries.
We show that the voltage of the injector does not cut the flow of relevant
scattering processes in the wire. Either a grounded or a semi-infinite wire at
too low temperature is driven into the strong coupling regime.
  We show that the injector induce invasive effects. They are due to non-local
backscattering processes generated both by virtual higher order tunneling
processes and by Coulomb interactions with the injector. The latter induce in
addition screening of interactions in the wire. For an STM, those effects can
drastically mask the probed density of states (DOS). In the limit of zero
temperature, a long and grounded wire is driven to its fixed point where it is
disconnected at the tunneling point. Thus instead of the bulk expected DOS, the
STM probes the end one. We analyze current auto- and cross-correlations. We
show that the cross-correlations are dominated by their value in the
two-terminal geometry. As these are opposite to the current auto-correlations,
they are always negative for local scattering processes. We give novel scaling
laws to all orders with respect to a local backscattering.
