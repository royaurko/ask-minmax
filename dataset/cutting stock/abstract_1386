We investigate the effect of long range magnetic interactions on the
renormalization group (RG) evolution of local Cooper pairing interactions near
the Fermi surface in high density QCD. We use an explicit cut-off on momentum
modes, with special emphasis on screening effects such as Landau damping, to
derive the RG equations in a gauge invariant, weak coupling expansion. We
obtain the Landau pole $\Delta \sim \mu g^{-5} \exp(- \frac{3 \pi^2}{\sqrt{2}
g})$, although the structure of our equations differs from previous results. We
also investigate the gap equation, including condensates of higher angular
momentum. We show that rotational invariance is unbroken at asymptotically high
density, and verify that $\Delta$ is the correct value of the gap when higher
modes are included in the analysis.
