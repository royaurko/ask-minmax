We have collated multiplicity data for five clusters (Taurus, Chamaeleon I,
Ophiuchus, IC348, and the Orion Nebula Cluster). We have applied the same mass
ratio (flux ratios of delta K <= 2.5) and primary mass cuts (~0.1-3.0 Msun) to
each cluster and therefore have directly comparable binary statistics for all
five clusters in the separation range 62-620 au, and for Taurus, Chamaeleon I,
and Ophiuchus in the range 18-830 au. We find that the trend of decreasing
binary fraction with cluster density is solely due to the high binary fraction
of Taurus, the other clusters show no obvious trend over a factor of nearly 20
in density.
  With N-body simulations we attempt to find a set of initial conditions that
are able to reproduce the density, morphology and binary fractions of all five
clusters. Only an initially clumpy (fractal) distribution with an initial total
binary fraction of 73 per cent (17 per cent in the range 62-620 au) is able to
reproduce all of the observations (albeit not very satisfactorily). Therefore,
if star formation is universal the initial conditions must be clumpy and with a
high (but not 100 per cent) binary fraction. This could suggest that most
stars, including M-dwarfs, form in binaries.
