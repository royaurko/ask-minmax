Phi meson production is studied by the NA49 Collaboration in central Pb+Pb
collisions at 20A, 30A, 40A, 80A and 158A GeV beam energy. The data are
compared with measurements at lower and higher energies and to microscopic and
thermal models. The energy dependence of yields and spectral distributions is
compatible with the assumption that partonic degrees of freedom set in at low
SPS energies.
