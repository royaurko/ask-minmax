Strategy evaluation schemes are a crucial factor in any agent-based market
model, as they determine the agents' strategy preferences and consequently
their behavioral pattern. This study investigates how the strategy evaluation
schemes adopted by agents affect their performance in conjunction with the
market circumstances. We observe the performance of three strategy evaluation
schemes, the history-dependent wealth game, the trend-opposing minority game,
and the trend-following majority game, in a stock market where the price is
exogenously determined. The price is either directly adopted from the real
stock market indices or generated with a Markov chain of order $\le 2$. Each
scheme's success is quantified by average wealth accumulated by the traders
equipped with the scheme. The wealth game, as it learns from the history, shows
relatively good performance unless the market is highly unpredictable. The
majority game is successful in a trendy market dominated by long periods of
sustained price increase or decrease. On the other hand, the minority game is
suitable for a market with persistent zig-zag price patterns. We also discuss
the consequence of implementing finite memory in the scoring processes of
strategies. Our findings suggest under which market circumstances each
evaluation scheme is appropriate for modeling the behavior of real market
traders.
