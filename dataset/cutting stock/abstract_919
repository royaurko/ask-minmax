This paper deals with the super-replication of non path-dependent European
claims under additional convex constraints on the number of shares held in the
portfolio. The corresponding super-replication price of a given claim has been
widely studied in the literature and its terminal value, which dominates the
claim of interest, is the so-called facelift transform of the claim. We
investigate under which conditions the super-replication price and strategy of
a large class of claims coincide with the exact replication price and strategy
of the facelift transform of this claim. In one dimension, we observe that this
property is satisfied for any local volatility model. In any dimension, we
exhibit an analytical necessary and sufficient condition for this property,
which combines the dynamics of the stock together with the characteristics of
the closed convex set of constraints. To obtain this condition, we introduce
the notion of first order viability property for linear parabolic PDEs. We
investigate in details several practical cases of interest: multidimensional
Black Scholes model, non-tradable assets or short selling restrictions.
