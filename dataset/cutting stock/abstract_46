In recent publications, the contributors have considered inverse statistics of the
Dow Jones Industrial Averaged (DJIA) [1-3]. Specifically, we argued that the
natural candidate for such statistics is the investment horizons distribution.
This is the distribution of waiting times needed to achieve a predefined level
of return obtained from detrended historic asset prices. Such a distribution
typically goes through a maximum at a time coined the {\em optimal investment
horizon}, $\tau^*_\rho$, which defines the most likely waiting time for
obtaining a given return $\rho$. By considering equal positive and negative
levels of return, we reported in [2,3] on a quantitative gain/loss asymmetry
most pronounced for short horizons. In the present paper, this gain/loss
asymmetry is re-visited for 2/3 of the individual stocks presently in the DJIA.
We show that this gain/loss asymmetry established for the DJIA surprisingly is
{\em not} present in the time series of the individual stocks. The most
reasonable explanation for this fact is that the gain/loss asymmetry observed
in the DJIA as well as in the SP500 and Nasdaq are due to movements in the
market as a whole, {\it i.e.}, cooperative cascade processes (or
``synchronization'') which disappear in the inverse statistics of the
individual stocks.
