Using tools from spectral analysis, singular and regular perturbation theory,
we develop a systematic method for analytically computing the approximate price
of a derivative-asset. The payoff of the derivative-asset may be
path-dependent. Additionally, the process underlying the derivative may exhibit
killing (i.e. jump to default) as well as combined local/nonlocal stochastic
volatility. The nonlocal component of volatility is multiscale, in the sense
that it is driven by one fast-varying and one slow-varying factor. The
flexibility of our modeling framework is contrasted by the simplicity of our
method. We reduce the derivative pricing problem to that of solving a single
eigenvalue equation. Once the eigenvalue equation is solved, the approximate
price of a derivative can be calculated formulaically. To illustrate our
method, we calculate the approximate price of three derivative-assets: a
vanilla option on a defaultable stock, a path-dependent option on a
non-defaultable stock, and a bond in a short-rate model.
