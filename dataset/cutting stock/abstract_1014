Hubble Space Telescope WFPC-2 I-band (F814W) images of the BL Lacertae object
OJ 287 and the surrounding field are presented. We find evidence of associated
extended nebulosity near OJ 287, as well as a small nebulosity to the West,
which may be spatially coincident with the position of previously observed
radio emission. The brightness of a host galaxy is difficult to determine due
to the brightness of the active nucleus, but it lies in the range -21.5 > M_R >
-23.1 (H_0 = 100 km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}, q_0 = 0). No evidence is seen for the
previously reported optical ``jet'' at position angle 220 degrees to a surface
brightness limit of I = 24.3 mag arcsec^{-2}. There are several resolved and
unresolved objects within 17'' of OJ~287 in the field to limits of I=25 (point
source 5\sigma detections). The magnitudes and relative positions of these
objects are reported. An offset in the centroid position between the OJ 287
point source and the underlying nebulosity reported by Wurtz, Stocke and Yee is
confirmed and measured to be about 0.4 (1.2h^{-1} kpc at the redshift of
OJ~287). This offset is tentatively interpreted as evidence for recent merger
activity rather than a sign of gravitational microlensing.
