In the context of altmetrics, tweets have been discussed as potential
indicators of immediate and broader societal impact of scientific documents.
However, it is not yet clear to what extent Twitter captures actual research
impact. A small case study (Thelwall et al., 2013b) suggests that tweets to
journal articles neither comment on nor express any sentiments towards the
publication, which suggests that tweets merely disseminate bibliographic
information, often even automatically. This study analyses the sentiments of
tweets for a large representative set of scientific papers by specifically
adapting different methods to academic articles distributed on Twitter. Results
will help to improve the understanding of Twitter's role in scholarly
communication and the meaning of tweets as impact metrics.
