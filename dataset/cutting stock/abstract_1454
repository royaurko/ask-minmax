We describe a comprehensive survey of two-particle correlations from p-p
collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV. Correlations on transverse rapidity $y_t$
are separated into a soft component (string fragments) and a hard component
(parton fragments). Fragment correlations on transverse rapidity $y_t$ are
compared to fragmentation functions on logarithmic momentum variable $\xi$.
Cuts on transverse rapidity isolate angular correlations on $(\eta,\phi)$ for
the two components. Hard-component angular correlations are compared to results
from conventional leading-particle jet analysis. Angular correlations for
low-$p_t$ fragments, corresponding to low-$Q^2$ parton scattering, reveal a
large asymmetry about the jet thrust axis.
