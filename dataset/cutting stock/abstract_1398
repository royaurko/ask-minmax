We study the distribution of lepton pairs from the second lightest neutralino
decay \tilde{\chi}^0_2-->\tilde{l}l followed by \tilde{l}\to \tilde{\chi}^0_1
l. The distribution of the ratio of lepton transverse momenta A_T shows peak
structure if m_{ll}< m^{max}_{ll}/2 is required. The peak position A_T^{peak}
is described by a simple function of the ino and slepton masses in the
m_{ll}\sim 0 limit. When a moderate m_{ll} cut is applied, A_T^{peak} depends
on the \tilde{\chi}^0_2 velocity distribution, but the dependence would be
corrected by studying the lepton P_T distribution. A_T^{peak} and the edge of
m_{ll} distributions are used to determine the mass parameters involved in the
decay for parameters of interest to LHC experiments. For some cases the ino and
slepton masses may be determined within 10% by the lepton distribution only
independent of model assumptions. Correct combinations of A_{T}^{peak} and
m_{ll}^{edge} would be identified even if different \tilde{\chi}^0_2 decay
chains are co-existing. The analysis could be extended to the Tevatron energy
scale or other cascade decays.
