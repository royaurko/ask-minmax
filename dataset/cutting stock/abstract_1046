The evolution of the probability distributions of Japan and US major market
indices, NIKKEI 225 and NASDAQ composite index, and $JPY/DEM$ and $DEM/USD$
currency exchange rates is described by means of the Fokker-Planck equation
(FPE). In order to distinguish and quantify the deterministic and random
influences on these financial time series we perform a statistical analysis of
their increments $\Delta x(\Delta(t))$ distribution functions for different
time lags $\Delta(t)$. From the probability distribution functions at various
$\Delta(t)$, the Fokker-Planck equation for $p(\Delta x(t), \Delta(t))$ is
explicitly derived. It is written in terms of a drift and a diffusion
coefficient. The Kramers-Moyal coefficients, are estimated and found to have a
simple analytical form, thus leading to a simple physical interpretation for
both drift $D^{(1)}$ and diffusion $D^{(2)}$ coefficients. The Markov nature of
the indices and exchange rates is shown and an apparent difference in the
NASDAQ $D^{(2)}$ is pointed out.
