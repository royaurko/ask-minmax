The current status of the searches for the SM Higgs boson in the
$H$$\rightarrow$$ZZ^{(*)}$$\rightarrow$$4\ell$ decay channel with the CMS
experiment is presented. The selection cuts for suppressing the backgrounds
while keeping very high signal efficiencies are described, along with the
data-driven algorithms implemented to estimate the background yields and the
systematic uncertainties. With an integrated luminosity of $1.66
\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, upper limits at 95% CL on the SM-like Higgs cross section
$\times$ branching ratio exclude cross sections from about one to two times the
expected value from the Standard Model in the range $150 < m_{H} < 420
\mathrm{GeV}$. No evidence for the existence of the SM Higgs boson has been
found so far.
