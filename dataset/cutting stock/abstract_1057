The Gari-Krumpelmann (GK) models of nucleon electromagnetic form factors, in
which the rho, omega, and phi vector meson pole contributions evolve at high
momentum transfer to conform to the predictions of perturbative QCD (pQCD), was
recently extended to include the width of the rho meson by substituting the
result of dispersion relations for the pole and the addition of rho' (1450)
isovector vector meson pole. This extended model was shown to produce a good
overall fit to all the available nucleon electromagnetic form factor (emff)
data. Since then new polarization data shows that the electric to magnetic
ratios R_p and R_n obtained are not consistent with the older G_{Ep} and G_{En}
data in their range of momentum transfer. The model is further extended to
include the omega' (1419) isoscalar vector meson pole. It is found that while
this GKex cannot simultaneously fit the new R_p and the old G_{En} data, it can
fit the new R_p and R_n well simultaneously. An excellent fit to all the
remaining data is obtained when the inconsistent G_{Ep} and G_{En} is omitted.
The model predictions are shown up to momentum transfer squared, Q^2, of 8
GeV^2/c^2.
