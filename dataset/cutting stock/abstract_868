In this paper linear canonical correlation analysis (LCCA) is generalized by
applying a structured transform to the joint probability distribution of the
considered pair of random vectors, i.e., a transformation of the joint
probability measure defined on their joint observation space. This framework,
called measure transformed canonical correlation analysis (MTCCA), applies LCCA
to the data after transformation of the joint probability measure. We show that
judicious choice of the transform leads to a modified canonical correlation
analysis, which, in contrast to LCCA, is capable of detecting non-linear
relationships between the considered pair of random vectors. Unlike kernel
canonical correlation analysis, where the transformation is applied to the
random vectors, in MTCCA the transformation is applied to their joint
probability distribution. This results in performance advantages and reduced
implementation complexity. The proposed approach is illustrated for graphical
model selection in simulated data having non-linear dependencies, and for
measuring long-term associations between companies traded in the NASDAQ and
NYSE stock markets.
