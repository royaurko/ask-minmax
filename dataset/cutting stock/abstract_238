We apply random matrix theory to compare correlation matrix estimators C
obtained from emerging market data. The correlation matrices are constructed
from 10 years of daily data for stocks listed on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange (JSE) from January 1993 to December 2002. We test the spectral
properties of C against random matrix predictions and find some agreement
between the distributions of eigenvalues, nearest neighbour spacings,
distributions of eigenvector components and the inverse participation ratios
for eigenvectors. We show that interpolating both missing data and illiquid
trading days with a zero-order hold increases agreement with RMT predictions.
For the more realistic estimation of correlations in an emerging market, we
suggest a pairwise measured-data correlation matrix. For the data set used,
this approach suggests greater temporal stability for the leading eigenvectors.
An interpretation of eigenvectors in terms of trading strategies is given in
lieu of classification by economic sectors.
