The neutral Higgs pair production at the LHC is studied in the MSSM, the
large extra dimensional (ADD) model and the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model, where
the total cross section can be significantly enhanced compared to that in the
SM. The $p_{_T}$, invariant mass and rapidity distributions of each model have
been shown to be distinctive: The ADD model raises the $p_T$ and invariant mass
distributions at high scales of $p_T$ and invariant mass; in the RS model
resonant peaks appear after the SM contribution dies away; the SM and the MSSM
distributions drop rapidly at those high scales; in the ADD and the RS models
the rapidity distributions congregate more around the center. It is concluded
that various distributions of the Higgs pair production at the LHC with
restrictive kinematic cuts would provide one of the most robust signals for the
extra dimensional effects.
