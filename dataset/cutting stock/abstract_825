It is a common belief that power-law distributed avalanches are inherently
unpredictable. This idea affects phenomena as diverse as evolution,
earthquakes, superconducting vortices, stock markets, etc; from atomic to
social scales. It mainly comes from the concept of ``Self-organized
criticality" (SOC), where criticality is interpreted in the way that at any
moment, any small avalanche can eventually cascade into a large event.
Nevertheless, this work demonstrates experimentally the possibility of
avalanche prediction in the classical paradigm of SOC: a sandpile. By knowing
the position of every grain in a two-dimensional pile, avalanches of moving
grains follow a distinct power-law distribution. Large avalanches, although
uncorrelated, are preceded by continuous, detectable variations in the internal
structure of the pile that are monitored in order to achieve prediction.
