Given a network and a partition in communities, we consider the issues "how
communities influence each other" and "when two given communities do
communicate". Specifically, we address these questions in the context of
small-world networks, where an arbitrary quenched graph is given and long range
connections are randomly added. We prove that, among the communities, a
superposition principle applies and gives rise to a natural generalization of
the effective field theory already presented in [Phys. Rev. E 78, 031102]
(n=1), which here (n>1) consists in a sort of effective TAP (Thouless, Anderson
and Palmer) equations in which each community plays the role of a microscopic
spin. The relative susceptibilities derived from these equations calculated at
finite or zero temperature, where the method provides an effective percolation
theory, give us the answers to the above issues. Unlike the case n=1,
asymmetries among the communities may lead, via the TAP-like structure of the
equations, to many metastable states whose number, in the case of negative
short-cuts among the communities, may grow exponentially fast with n. As
examples we consider the n Viana-Bray communities model and the n
one-dimensional small-world communities model. Despite being the simplest ones,
the relevance of these models in network theory, as e.g. in social networks, is
crucial and no analytic solution were known until now. Connections between
percolation and the fractal dimension of a network are also discussed. Finally,
as an inverse problem, we show how, from the relative susceptibilities, a
natural and efficient method to detect the community structure of a generic
network arises.
