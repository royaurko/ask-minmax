We propose statistical tests to discriminate between the finite and infinite
activity of jumps in a semimartingale discretely observed at high frequency.
The two statistics allow for a symmetric treatment of the problem: we can
either take the null hypothesis to be finite activity, or infinite activity.
When implemented on high-frequency stock returns, both tests point toward the
presence of infinite-activity jumps in the data.
