We study the potential of hadron colliders in the search for the pair
production of neutral Higgs bosons in the framework of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model. We perform a detailed signal and background
analysis, working out efficient kinematical cuts for the extraction of the
signal. The important role of squark loop contributions to the signal is
re--emphasized. If the signal is sufficiently enhanced by these contributions,
it could even be observable at the next run of the upgraded Tevatron collider
in the near future. At the LHC the pair production of light and heavy Higgs
bosons might be detectable simultaneously.
