In this article, we investigate whether exchange rate risk is priced. We use
a multivariate GARCH-in-Mean specification and test alternative conditional
international CAPM versions. Our results support strongly the international
asset-pricing model that includes exchange rate risk for both developed and
emerging stock markets. However, there are important time and cross-country
variations in the relative size and dynamics of different risk premia.
