We study analytically and numerically Minority Games in which agents may
invest in different assets (or markets), considering both the canonical and the
grand-canonical versions. We find that the likelihood of agents trading in a
given asset depends on the relative amount of information available in that
market. More specifically, in the canonical game players play preferentially in
the stock with less information. The same holds in the grand canonical game
when agents have positive incentives to trade, whereas when agents payoff are
solely related to their speculative ability they display a larger propensity to
invest in the information-rich asset. Furthermore, in this model one finds a
globally predictable phase with broken ergodicity.
