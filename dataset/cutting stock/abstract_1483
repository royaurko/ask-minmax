Statistics of molecular random walks in a fluid is considered with the help
of the Bogolyubov equation for generating functional of distribution functions.
An invariance group of solutions to this equation as functions of the fluid
density is discovered. It results in many exact relations between probability
distribution of the path of a test particle and its irreducible correlations
with the fluid. As the consequence, significant restrictions do arise on
possible shapes of the path distribution. In particular, the hypothetical
Gaussian form of its long-range asymptotic proves to be forbidden (even in the
Boltzmann-Grad limit). Instead, a diffusive asymptotic is allowed which
possesses power-law long tail (cut off by ballistic flight length).
