A variety of evidence from lattice QCD is presented revealing the dominant
role of instantons in the propagation of light quarks in the QCD vacuum and in
light hadron structure. The instanton content of lattice gluon configurations
is extracted, and observables calculated from the instantons alone are shown to
agree well with those calculated using all gluons. The lowest 128
eigenfunctions of the Dirac operator are calculated and shown to exhibit zero
modes localized at the instantons. Finally, the zero mode contributions to the
quark propagator alone are shown to account for essentially the full strength
of the rho and pion resonances in the vector and pseudoscalar correlation
functions.
