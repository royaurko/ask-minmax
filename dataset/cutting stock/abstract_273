The existence of forbidden patterns, i.e., certain missing sequences in a
given time series, is a recently proposed instrument of potential application
in the study of time series. Forbidden patterns are related to the permutation
entropy, which has the basic properties of classic chaos indicators, thus
allowing to separate deterministic (usually chaotic) from random series;
however, it requires less values of the series to be calculated, and it is
suitable for using with small datasets. In this Letter, the appearance of
forbidden patterns is studied in different economical indicators like stock
indices (Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite), NYSE stocks (IBM
and Boeing) and others (10-year Bond interest rate), to find evidences of
deterministic behavior in their evolutions.
