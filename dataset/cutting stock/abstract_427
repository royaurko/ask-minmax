The aim of this paper is to propose a heterogeneous agent model of stock
markets that develop complicated endogenous price fluctuations. We find
occurrences of non-stationary chaos, or speculative bubble, are caused by the
heterogeneity of traders' strategies. Furthermore, we show that the
distributions of returns generated from the heterogeneous agent model have fat
tails, a remarkable stylized fact observed in almost all financial markets.
