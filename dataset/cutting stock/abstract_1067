One of the mechanisms that ensure cancer robustness is tumor heterogeneity,
and its effects on tumor cells dynamics have to be taken into account when
studying cancer progression. There is no unifying theoretical framework in
mathematical modeling of carcinogenesis that would account for parametric
heterogeneity. Here we formulate a modeling approach that naturally takes stock
of inherent cancer cell heterogeneity and illustrate it with a model of
interaction between a tumor and an oncolytic virus. We show that several
phenomena that are absent in homogeneous models, such as cancer recurrence,
tumor dormancy, an others, appear in heterogeneous setting. We also demonstrate
that, within the applied modeling framework, to overcome the adverse effect of
tumor cell heterogeneity on cancer progression, a heterogeneous population of
an oncolytic virus must be used. Heterogeneity in parameters of the model, such
as tumor cell susceptibility to virus infection and virus replication rate, can
lead to complex, time-dependent behaviors of the tumor. Thus, irregular,
quasi-chaotic behavior of the tumor-virus system can be caused not only by
random perturbations but also by the heterogeneity of the tumor and the virus.
The modeling approach described here reveals the importance of tumor cell and
virus heterogeneity for the outcome of cancer therapy. It should be
straightforward to apply these techniques to mathematical modeling of other
types of anticancer therapy.
