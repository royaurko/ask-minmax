Statistics of molecular random walks in a fluid is considered with the help
of Bogolyubov equation for generating functional of distribution functions. An
invariance group of this equation is found. It results in many exact relations
between path probability distribution of a test particle and its correlations
with the fluid. As the consequence, significant restrictions on possible shape
of the path distribution do arise. In particular, the hypothetical Gaussian
form of long-range asymptotic proves to be forbidden, even (and first of all)
under the Boltzmann-Grad limit. An allowed diffusive asymptotic possesses
power-law long tail (cut off by free flight length).
