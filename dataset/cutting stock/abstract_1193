Next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the QCD-induced $pp \rightarrow
l^+l^- \gamma j j +X$ and $pp \rightarrow \bar{\nu}_l \nu_l \gamma jj+X$
processes are presented. The latter is used to find an optimal cut to reduce
the contribution of radiative photon emission off the charged leptons in the
first channel. As expected, the scale uncertainties are significantly reduced
at NLO and the QCD corrections are phase space dependent and important for
precise measurements at the LHC.
