Researchers have constantly asked whether stock returns can be predicted by
some macroeconomic data. However, it is known that macroeconomic data may
exhibit nonstationarity and/or heavy tails, which complicates existing testing
procedures for predictability. In this paper we propose novel empirical
likelihood methods based on some weighted score equations to test whether the
monthly CRSP value-weighted index can be predicted by the log dividend-price
ratio or the log earnings-price ratio. The new methods work well both
theoretically and empirically regardless of the predicting variables being
stationary or nonstationary or having an infinite variance.
