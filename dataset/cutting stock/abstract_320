In this paper we present an approach that integrates interactive
visualizations in the exploratory search process. In this model visualizations
can act as hubs where large amounts of information are made accessible in easy
user interfaces. Through interaction techniques this information can be
combined with related information on the World Wide Web. We applied the new
search concept to the domain of stock market information and conducted a user
study. Participants could use this interface without instructions, could
complete complex tasks like identifying related information items, link
heterogeneous information types and use different interaction techniques to
access related information more easily. In this way, users could quickly
acquire knowledge in an unfamiliar domain.
