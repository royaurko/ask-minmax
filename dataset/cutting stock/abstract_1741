The presence of R-parity ($\mathcal{R}_p$) violation offers intersting decay
channels for the gluinos. In this work we present a new search strategy for the
gluinos in the presence of semileptonic $\mathcal{R}_p$ violating couplings
$\lambda^{'}_{133}$ and $\lambda^{'}_{233}$. We consider two scenarios (i)
$\lambda^{'}$ induced 3-body decay of gluinos to a top quark ($t$), a bottom
quark ($b$) and a light lepton ($\ell$) (ii) cascade decay of gluinos to top
quarks and neutralinos ($\widetilde{\chi}_1^0$) followed by the decay of
$\widetilde{\chi}_1^0$ to $t$, $b$ and $\ell$ through $\lambda^{'}$ couplings.
We present two different search procedures which are common to both the
scenarios. While the first one involves the traditional approach with
multi-leptons and $b$-tagged jets, the second one employs the more recent
technique to reconstruct highly energetic hadronically decaying top quarks. We
perform a detailed simulation of the signal as well as all the relevant
Standard Model backgrounds to show that the second procedure offers slightly
better sensitivity for gluino discovery. In both the procedures, a $\geq$
5$\sigma$ discovery is possible for the gluino mass in the range 1.5 -1.7 TeV
at 14 TeV LHC with 50 fb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity.
