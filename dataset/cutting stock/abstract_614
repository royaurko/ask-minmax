The main focus of this work is to understand the dynamics of non regulated
markets. The present model can describe the dynamics of any market where the
pricing is based on supply and demand. It will be applied here, as an example,
for the German stock market presented by the Deutscher Aktienindex (DAX), which
is a measure for the market status. The duality of the present model consists
of the superposition of the two components - the long and the short term
behaviour of the market. The long term behaviour is characterised by a stable
development which is following a trend for time periods of years or even
decades. This long term growth (or decline) is based on the development of
fundamental market figures. The short term behaviour is described as a
dynamical evaluation (trading) of the market by the participants. The trading
process is described as an exchange between supply and demand. In the framework
of this model there the trading is modelled by a system of nonlinear
differential equations. The model also allows to explain the chaotic behaviour
of the market as well as periods of growth or crashes.
