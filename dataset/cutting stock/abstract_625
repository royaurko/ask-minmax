Images of five QSO fields containing six damped Lyman alpha (DLA) systems at
redshifts 0.09<z<0.53 are presented. Identifications for the DLA galaxies
giving rise to the DLA systems are made. The observed and modeled
characteristics of the DLA galaxies are discussed. The DLA galaxies have impact
parameters ranging from < 4 kpc to \approx 34 kpc and luminosities in the range
\approx 0.03L* to \approx 1.3L*. Their morphologies include amorphous low
surface brightness systems, a probable dwarf spiral, and luminous spirals.
