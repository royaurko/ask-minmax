In general, charged Higgs bosons $H^\pm$ appear in non-minimal Higgs models.
The $H^\pm W^\mp Z$ vertex is known to be related to the violation of the
global symmetry (custodial symmetry) in the Higgs sector. Its magnitude
strongly depends on the structure of the exotic Higgs models which contain
higher isospin $SU(2)_L$ representations such as triplet Higgs bosons. We study
the possibility of measuring the $H^\pm W^\mp Z$ vertex via single charged
Higgs boson production associated with the $W^\pm$ boson at the International
Linear Collider (ILC) by using the recoil method. The feasibility of the signal
$e^+e^-\to H^\pm W^\mp \to \ell \nu jj$ is analyzed assuming the polarized
electron and positron beams and the expected detector performance for the
resolution of the two-jet system at the ILC. The background events can be
reduced to a considerable extent by imposing the kinematic cuts even if we take
into account the initial state radiation. For a relatively light charged Higgs
boson whose mass $m_{H^\pm}$ is in the region of 120-130 GeV $< m_{H^\pm} <
m_W+m_Z$, the $H^\pm W^\mp Z$ vertex would be precisely testable especially
when the decay of $H^\pm$ is lepton specific. The exoticness of the extended
Higgs sector can be explored by using combined information for this vertex and
the rho parameter.
