If the SM Higgs boson does not exist, electroweak symmetry breaking may be
realized via a strong interaction with a typical scale Lambda > 1 TeV.
Resonances from the strong sector may help to unitarize WW scattering, which
becomes strong in the absence of an Higgs field, and could be detected at the
LHC. In this paper we describe such a scenario, in the minimal case in which
only one new vector resonance is present, via a chiral SU(2) x SU(2)/SU(2)
lagrangian also including all possible invariant terms up to O(p^4) order
(assuming a parity symmetry in the strong sector). The O(p^4) invariants are
not usually taken into account in similar studies in the literature; however,
they have been shown to be potentially important, at least, to reconcile this
kind of scheme with electroweak precision tests. Here we use the O(p^4)
lagrangian to study the scattering amplitudes for the pi pi sector,
investigating the partial wave unitarity properties of the model and its
cut-off energy scale. We obtain constraints on the parameter space and compare
our result to the one obtained with just the O(p^2) lagrangian, finding that
the contribution of the new operators is indeed significant.
