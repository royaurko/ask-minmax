We have measured the periods and light curves of 148 RR Lyrae variables from
V=13.5 to 19.7 from the first 100 sq. degrees of the QUEST RR Lyrae survey.
Approximately 55% of these stars belong to the clump of stars detected earlier
by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. According to our measurements, this feature
has ~10 times the background density of halo stars, spans at least 37.5 deg by
3.5 deg in right ascension and declination (>=30 by >=3 kpc), lies ~50 kpc from
the Sun, and has a depth along the line of sight of ~5 kpc (1 sigma). These
properties are consistent with the recent models that suggest it is a tidal
stream from the Sgr dSph galaxy. The mean period of the type ab variables, 0.58
d, is also consistent. In addition, we have found two smaller over-densities in
the halo, one of which may be related to the globular cluster Pal 5.
