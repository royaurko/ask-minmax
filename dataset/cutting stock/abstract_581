The thesis is composed of three parts. Part I introduces the mathematical and
statistical tools that are relevant for the study of dependences, as well as
statistical tests of Goodness-of-fit for empirical probability distributions. I
propose two extensions of usual tests when dependence is present in the sample
data and when observations have a fat-tailed distribution. The financial
content of the thesis starts in Part II. I present there my studies regarding
the "cross-sectional" dependences among the time series of daily stock returns,
i.e. the instantaneous forces that link several stocks together and make them
behave somewhat collectively rather than purely independently. A calibration of
a new factor model is presented here, together with a comparison to
measurements on real data. Finally, Part III investigates the temporal
dependences of single time series, using the same tools and measures of
correlation. I propose two contributions to the study of the origin and
description of "volatility clustering": one is a generalization of the
ARCH-like feedback construction where the returns are self-exciting, and the
other one is a more original description of self-dependences in terms of
copulas. The latter can be formulated model-free and is not specific to
financial time series. In fact, I also show here how concepts like recurrences,
records, aftershocks and waiting times, that characterize the dynamics in a
time series can be written in the unifying framework of the copula.
