We propose that imitation between traders and their herding behaviour not
only lead to speculative bubbles with accelerating over-valuations of financial
markets possibly followed by crashes, but also to ``anti-bubbles'' with
decelerating market devaluations following all-time highs. For this, we propose
a simple market dynamics model in which the demand decreases slowly with
barriers that progressively quench in, leading to a power law decay of the
market price decorated by decelerating log-periodic oscillations. We document
this behaviour on the Japanese Nikkei stock index from 1990 to present and on
the Gold future prices after 1980, both after their all-time highs. We perform
simultaneously a parametric and non-parametric analysis that are fully
consistent with each other. We extend the parametric approach to the next order
of perturbation, comparing the log-periodic fits with one, two and three
log-frequencies, the latter one providing a prediction for the general trend in
the coming years. The non-parametric power spectrum analysis shows the
existence of log-periodicity with high statistical significance, with a
prefered scale ratio of $\lambda \approx 3.5$ for the Nikkei index $\lambda
\approx 1.9$ for the Gold future prices, comparable to the values obtained for
speculative bubbles leading to crashes.
