Using the Generalised Lotka Volterra (GLV) model adapted to deal with muti
agent systems we can investigate economic systems from a general viewpoint and
obtain generic features common to most economies. Assuming only weak generic
assumptions on capital dynamics, we are able to obtain very specific
predictions for the distribution of social wealth. First, we show that in a
'fair' market, the wealth distribution among individual investors fulfills a
power law. We then argue that 'fair play' for capital and minimal
socio-biological needs of the humans traps the economy within a power law
wealth distribution with a particular Pareto exponent $\alpha \sim 3/2$. In
particular we relate it to the average number of individuals L depending on the
average wealth: $\alpha \sim L/(L-1)$. Then we connect it to certain power
exponents characterising the stock markets. We obtain that the distribution of
volumes of the individual (buy and sell) orders follows a power law with
similar exponent $\beta \sim \alpha \sim 3/2$. Consequently, in a market where
trades take place by matching pairs of such sell and buy orders, the
corresponding exponent for the market returns is expected to be of order
$\gamma \sim 2 \alpha \sim 3$. These results are consistent with recent
experimental measurements of these power law exponents ([Maslov 2001] for
$\beta$ and [Gopikrishnan et al. 1999] for $\gamma$).
