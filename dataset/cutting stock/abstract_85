This paper presents a statistical analysis of Tehran Price Index (TePIx) for
the period of 1992 to 2004. The results present asymmetric property of the
return distribution which tends to the right hand of the mean. Also the return
distribution can be fitted by a stable Levy distribution and the tails are very
fatter than the gaussian distribution. We estimate the tail index of the TePIx
returns with two different methods and the results are consistent with the
previous studies on the stock markets. A strong autocorrelation has been
detected in the TePIx time series representing a long memory of several trading
days. We have also applied a Zipf analysis on the TePIx data presenting strong
correlations between the TePIx daily fluctuations. We hope that this paper be
able to give a brief description about the statistical behavior of financial
data in Iran stock market.
