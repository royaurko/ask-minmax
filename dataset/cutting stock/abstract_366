Weak form of the Efficiency Market Hypothesis (EMH) excludes predictions of
future market movements from historical data and makes the technical analysis
(TA) out of law. However the technical analysis is widely used by traders and
speculators who steadely refuse to consider the market as a "fair game" and
survive with such believe. In the paper we make a conjecture that TA and EMH
correspond to different time regimes and show how both technical analysis
predictions for short times and realistic statistical data for larger times can
be obtained in a simple single stock model of Gauge Theory of Arbitrage.
