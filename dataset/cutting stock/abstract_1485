We investigate the geometry of a particular class of null surfaces in
space-time called vacuum Non-Expanding Horizons (NEHs). Using the
spin-coefficient equation, we provide a complete description of the horizon
geometry, as well as fixing a canonical choice of null tetrad and coordinates
on a NEH. By looking for particular classes of null geodesic congruences which
live exterior to NEHs but have the special property that their shear vanishes
at the intersection with the horizon, a good cut formalism for NEHs is
developed which closely mirrors asymptotic theory. In particular, we show that
such null geodesic congruences are generated by arbitrary choice of a complex
world-line in a complex four dimensional space, each such choice induces a CR
structure on the horizon, and a particular world-line (and hence CR structure)
may be chosen by transforming to a privileged tetrad frame.
