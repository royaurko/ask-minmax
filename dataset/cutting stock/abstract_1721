Maintaining competitive advantage is significant in this present day of
globalization, knowledge management and enormous economic activities. An
organization's future developments are influenced by its managements'
decisions. Businesses today are facing a lot of challenges in terms of
competition and they have to be in the lead by strengthening their research and
development strategies with the aid of cutting edge technologies. Hence
marketing intelligence is now a key to the success of any business in today's
rapidly changing business environment. With all the technologies available in
marketing research, businesses still struggle with how to gather information
and make decisions in a short time and real-time about their customers' needs
and purchasing patterns in various geographical areas.
  This paper is set out to contribute to the body of knowledge in the area of
the application of Geographic Information Systems technology solutions to
businesses by developing a model for integrating Geographic Information Systems
into existing Marketing Information Systems for effective marketing research.
This model will interconnect organizations at the highest levels, providing
reassurance to enable broad scope of checks and balances as well as benefiting
many business activities including operational, tactical and strategic decision
making due to its analytical and solution driven functions.
