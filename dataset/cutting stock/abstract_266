Testing symmetry of a probability distribution is a common question arising
from applications in several fields. Particularly, in the study of observables
used in the analysis of stock market index variations, the question of symmetry
has not been fully investigated by means of statistical procedures. In this
work a distribution-free test statistic Tn for testing symmetry, derived by
Einmahl and McKeague, based on the empirical likelihood approach, is used to
address the study of symmetry of financial returns. The asymptotic points of
the test statistic Tn are also calculated and a procedure for assessing
symmetry for the analysis of the returns of stock market indices is presented.
