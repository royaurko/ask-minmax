In this work, a statistical analysis of the distribution of daily
fluctuations of the IPC, the Mexican Stock Market Index is presented. A sample
of the IPC covering the 13-year period 04/19/1990 - 08/21/2003 was analyzed and
the cumulative probability distribution of its daily logarithmic variations
studied. Results showed that the cumulative distribution function for extreme
variations, can be described by a Pareto-Levy model with shape parameters
alpha=3.634 +- 0.272 and alpha=3.540 +- 0.278 for its positive and negative
tails respectively. This result is consistent with previous studies, where it
has been found that 2.5< alpha <4 for other financial markets worldwide.
