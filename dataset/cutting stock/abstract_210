The paper discusses various practical consequences of treating economics and
finance as an inherently dynamic and chaotic system. On the theoretical side
this looks at the general applicability of the market-making pricing approach
to economics in general. The paper also discuses the consequences of the
endogenous creation of liquidity and the role of liquidity as a state variable.
On the practical side, proposals are made for reducing chaotic behaviour in
both housing markets and stock markets.
