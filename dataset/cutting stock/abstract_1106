Using a suitable change of probability measure, we obtain a novel Poisson
series representation for the arbitrage- free price process of vulnerable
contingent claims in a regime-switching market driven by an underlying
continuous- time Markov process. As a result of this representation, along with
a short-time asymptotic expansion of the claim's price process, we develop an
efficient method for pricing claims whose payo?s may depend on the full path of
the underlying Markov chain. The proposed approach is applied to price not only
simple European claims such as defaultable bonds, but also a new type of
path-dependent claims that we term self-decomposable, as well as the important
class of vulnerable call and put options on a stock. We provide a detailed
error analysis and illustrate the accuracy and computational complexity of our
method on several market traded instruments, such as defaultable bond prices,
barrier options, and vulnerable call options. Using again our Poisson series
representation, we show differentiability in time of the pre-default price
function of European vulnerable claims, which enables us to rigorously deduce
Feynman-Kac representations for the pre-default pricing function and new
semimartingale representations for the price process of the vulnerable claim
under both risk-neutral and objective probability measures.
