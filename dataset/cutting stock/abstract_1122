We investigate the nature of 48 low-level stellar overdensities (from
Froebrich, Scholz, and Raftery catalogue - FSR07) projected towards the
Galactic anticentre and derive fundamental parameters for the confirmed
clusters, thus improving the open cluster (OC) census in that direction.
Parameters are derived with field-star decontaminated photometry,
colour-magnitude filters and stellar radial density profiles. Among the 48
targets, we identified 18 star clusters, 6 previously studied OCs, and 7
probable clusters that require deeper photometry to establish the nature. We
discovered 7 new clusters, 6 of them forming an association of clusters with
BPI 14, FSR 777, Kronberger 1, and Stock 8 in the region of the nebula IC 417
and related to the Aur OB2 association, and one embedded in the nebula Sh2-229.
We also derive parameters for these three non-FSR07 clusters, because they are
important in determining the structure of the Galactic anticentre. Thus, 58
objects are analysed in this work and we could derive fundamental parameters
for 28 of them. The scenario in the IC 417 star forming region is consistent
with a sequential event. FSR 888 and FSR 890 are embedded in Sh2-249 within the
Gem OB1 association. According to the distance derived for these clusters and
those in the association of clusters, both Aur OB2 and Gem OB1 are located in
the Perseus arm.
