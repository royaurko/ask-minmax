Financial markets worldwide do not have the same working hours. As a
consequence, the study of correlation or causality between financial market
indices becomes dependent on wether we should consider in computations of
correlation matrices all indices in the same day or lagged indices. The answer
this article proposes is that we should consider both. In this work, we use 79
indices of a diversity of stock markets across the world in order to study
their correlation structure, and discover that representing in the same network
original and lagged indices, we obtain a better understanding of how indices
that operate at different hours relate to each other.
