A method using jets is investigated for detecting the Higgs boson at LHC in
the mass range about 114 \GeVc2, suggested by LEP experiments. Higgs bosons are
produced in association with a $t \bar{t}$ pair, and both t and $\bar{t}$
decay semileptonically to reduce the QCD background. After appropriate cuts,
the signal is compared with the main background, $t \bar{t} + 2$ jets. This
estimate, using a reasonable approximation for the dominant background $t\bar
{t}gg$, suggests a $5.1\sigma$ effect. This method is seen to be complimentary
to the two gamma signal. The $t\bar{t}Z$ channel, with Z decaying to $l^+
l^-$, may be used to reduce theoretical uncertainties in determining the $t
\bar{t}H$ signal.
