We consider an instability of rapidly rotating neutron stars in low-mass
X-ray binaries (LMXBs) with respect to excitation of r-modes (which are
analogous to Earth's Rossby waves controlled by the Coriolis force). We argue
that finite temperature effects in the superfluid core of a neutron star lead
to a resonance coupling and enhanced damping (and hence stability) of
oscillation modes at certain stellar temperatures. Using a simple
phenomenological model we demonstrate that neutron stars with high spin
frequency may spend a substantial amount of time at these `resonance'
temperatures. This finding allows us to explain puzzling observations of hot
rapidly rotating neutron stars in LMXBs and to predict a new class of hot,
non-accreting, rapidly rotating neutron stars, some of which may have already
been observed and tentatively identified as quiescent LMXB (qLMXB) candidates.
We also impose a new theoretical limit on the neutron star spin frequency,
explaining the cut-off spin frequency ~730 Hz, following from the statistical
analysis of accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars. Besides explaining the
observations, our model provides a new tool to constrain superdense matter
properties comparing measured and theoretically predicted resonance
temperatures.
