This paper poses some basic questions about instances (hard to find) of a
special problem in 3-manifold topology. "Important though the general concepts
and propositions may be with the modern industrious passion for axiomatizing
and generalizing has presented us...nevertheless I am convinced that the
special problems in all their complexity constitute the stock and the core of
mathematics; and to master their difficulty requires on the whole the harder
labor." Hermann Weyl 1885-1955, cited in the preface of the first edition
(1939) of \cite{whitehead1997}.
