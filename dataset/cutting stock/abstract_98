There is more and more empirical evidence that multifractality constitutes
another and perhaps the most significant financial stylized fact. A realistic
model of the financial dynamics should therefore incorporate this effect. The
most promising in this respect is the Multifractal Model of Asset Returns
(MMAR) introduced by Mandelbrot in which multifractality is carried by time
deformation. In our study we focus on the Lux extension to MMAR and empirical
data from Warsaw Stock Exchange. We show that this model is able to reproduce
relevant aspects of the real stock market dynamics.
