data we use various methods like as, rescaled range analysis ($R/S$), modified
rescaled range analysis (Lo's method), Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) and
generalized Hurst exponents analysis. Based on numerical results, the scaling
range of TEPIX returns is specified, long memory effect or long range
