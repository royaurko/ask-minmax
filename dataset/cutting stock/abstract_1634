We consider the prospects for measuring squark flavor violation through the
signal of single top production at the LHC. We study this signal in the context
of R-symmetric supersymmetry, which allows for large flavor violation in the
squark sector, however the results can also be generalized to the MSSM. The
single top signal arises from squark pair production in which one squark decays
to a top and gaugino, whereas the other squark decays to a non-top quark and
gaugino. We study three decay patterns: (I) squark decay into a quark and
neutralino LSP; (II) squark decay into a quark and neutralino NLSP, with
subsequent decay of the NLSP to a photon and gravitino; (III) squark decay into
a quark and chargino NLSP, with subsequent decay of the NLSP to a H^\pm/W^\pm
and gravitino. Case II is the most promising, when the NLSP decay is prompt,
since every event contains two hard photons that can be used to tag the events,
reducing the background to a negligible level. Case I is promising if the
neutralino LSP is bino-like. We carefully consider large SM backgrounds and
identify a series of cuts to isolate the signal. Case III can occur in the
MRSSM with Higgsino-like lightest gauginos. Due to the large Higgs coupling,
squarks preferentially decay to top quarks, substantially reducing the
potential flavor violating signal. Nevertheless, the flavor violating signal
might still be identifiable if the chargino NLSP is long-lived.
