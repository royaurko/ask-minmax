Sparsity-promoting priors have become increasingly popular over recent years
due to an increased number of regression and classification applications
involving a large number of predictors. In time series applications where
observations are collected over time, it is often unrealistic to assume that
the underlying sparsity pattern is fixed. We propose here an original class of
flexible Bayesian linear models for dynamic sparsity modelling. The proposed
class of models expands upon the existing Bayesian literature on sparse
regression using generalized multivariate hyperbolic distributions. The
properties of the models are explored through both analytic results and
simulation studies. We demonstrate the model on a financial application where
it is shown that it accurately represents the patterns seen in the analysis of
stock and derivative data, and is able to detect major events by filtering an
artificial portfolio of assets.
