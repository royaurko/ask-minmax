We analyze the clustering of large scale structure in the Universe in a model
independent method, accounting for anisotropic effects along and transverse to
the line of sight. The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopy Survey Data Release 11
provides a large sample of 690,000 galaxies, allowing determination of the
Hubble expansion H, angular distance D_A, and growth rate G_T at an effective
redshift of z=0.57. After careful bias and convergence studies of the effects
from small scale clustering, we find that cutting transverse separations below
40 Mpc/h delivers robust results while smaller scale data leads to a bias due
to unmodelled nonlinear and velocity effects. The converged results are in
agreement with concordance LCDM cosmology, general relativity, and minimal
neutrino mass, all within the 68% confidence level. We also present results
separately for the northern and southern hemisphere sky, finding a slight
tension in the growth rate -- potentially a signature of anisotropic stress, or
just covariance with small scale velocities -- but within 68% CL.
