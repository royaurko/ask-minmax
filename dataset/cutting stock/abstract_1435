A medium modified gluon propagator is used to evaluate the scattering cross
section for the process gg-->gg in the QCD medium by performing an explicit sum
over the polarizations of the gluons. We incorporate a magnetic sreening mass
from a non-perturbative study. It is shown that the medium modified cross
section is finite, divergence free, and is independent of any ad-hoc momentum
transfer cut-off parameters. The medium modified finite cross sections are
necessary for a realistic investigation of the production and equilibration of
the minijet plasma expected at RHIC and LHC.
