We analyze hadro-chemical freeze-out in central Pb+Pb collisions at CERN SPS
energies, employing the hybrid version of UrQMD which models hadronization by
the Cooper-Frye mechanism, and matches to a final hadron-resonance cascade. We
fit the results both before and after the cascade stage using the Statistical
Hadronization Model, to assess the effect of the cascade phase. We observe a
strong effect on antibaryon yields except anti-{\Omega}, resulting in a shift
in T and {\mu}_B. We discuss the implications for the freeze-out curve.
