In this lecture note, we discuss the global properties of nucleus-nucleus
collisions. After a brief introduction to heavy-ion collisions, we introduce
useful kinematics and then discuss the bulk hadron production in A+A
collisions. At the end we discuss the hadronization and hadronic freeze-out in
A+A collisions. We have tried to cover the topic from very fundamental
arguments especially for the beginners in the field. We also give very useful
formulae frequently used by experimentalists, from a first principle
derivation.
