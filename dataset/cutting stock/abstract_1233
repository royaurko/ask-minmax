We use high-resolution UV spectra of the radio-quiet QSO H1821+643 (z_em =
0.297), obtained with STIS and FUSE, to study the ionization and metallicity of
an intervening O VI absorption line system at z(abs) = 0.1212. This absorber
has the following notable properties: (1) Several galaxies are close to the
sight line at the absorber redshift, including an actively star-forming galaxy
at a projected distance of 144 kpc. (2) There is a complex cluster of H I lya
absorption lines near the O VI redshift, including at least five components
spread over a velocity range of ~700 km/s . (3) The strongest lya line in the
cluster appears to be composed of a mildly saturated component with a typical
b-value blended with a broad component with b = 85 km/s . (4) The O VI
absorption is not aligned with the strongest H I absorption, but instead is
well-aligned with the broad component. (5) The only detected species (>4sigma)
are O VI and H I despite coverage of strong transitions of other abundant
elements. Based on these constraints, we find that the absorption line
properties can be produced in collisionally ionized gas with roughly 5.3 < log
T < 5.6 and -1.8 < [O/H] < -0.6. However, we find that photoionization is also
viable if the pathlength l through the absorbing gas is long enough; simple
photoionization models require 85 < l < 1900 kpc and -1.1 < [O/H] < -0.3. We
briefly discuss how observations of X-ray absorption lines due to O VII and O
VIII could be used, in principle, to break the ionization mechanism degeneracy.
