The complete elastic tensor of YNi_2B_2C was determined by application of the
resonant ultrasound spectroscopy technique to a single-crystal sample. Elastic
constants were found to be in good agreement with partial results obtained from
`time-of-flight' measurements performed on samples cut from the same ingot.
  From the measured constants, the bulk modulus and Debye temperature are
calculated.
