We present a novel microscopic stock market model consisting of a large
number of random agents modeling traders in a market. Each agent is
characterized by a set of parameters that serve to make iterated predictions of
two successive returns. The future price is determined according to the offer
and the demand of all agents. The system evolves by redistributing the capital
among the agents in each trading cycle. Without noise the dynamics of this
system is nearly regular and thereby fails to reproduce the stochastic return
fluctuations observed in real markets. However, when in each cycle a small
amount of noise is introduced we find the typical features of real financial
time series like fat-tails of the return distribution and large temporal
correlations in the volatility without significant correlations in the price
returns. Introducing the noise by an evolutionary process leads to different
scalings of the return distributions that depend on the definition of fitness.
Because our realistic model has only very few parameters, and the results
appear to be robust with respect to the noise level and the number of agents we
expect that our framework may serve as new paradigm for modeling self generated
return fluctuations in markets.
