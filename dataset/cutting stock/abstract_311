We present two statistical causes for the distortion of correlations on
high-frequency financial data. We demonstrate that the asynchrony of trades as
well as the decimalization of stock prices has a large impact on the decline of
the correlation coefficients towards smaller return intervals (Epps effect).
These distortions depend on the properties of the time series and are of purely
statistical origin. We are able to present parameter-free compensation methods,
which we validate in a model setup. Furthermore, the compensation methods are
applied to high-frequency empirical data from the NYSE's TAQ database. A major
fraction of the Epps effect can be compensated. The contribution of the
presented causes is particularly high for stocks that are traded at low prices.
