Randomness and regularities in Finance are usually treated in probabilistic
terms. In this paper, we develop a completely different approach in using a
non-probabilistic framework based on the algorithmic information theory
initially developed by Kolmogorov (1965). We present some elements of this
theory and show why it is particularly relevant to Finance, and potentially to
other sub-fields of Economics as well. We develop a generic method to estimate
the Kolmogorov complexity of numeric series. This approach is based on an
iterative "regularity erasing procedure" implemented to use lossless
compression algorithms on financial data. Examples are provided with both
simulated and real-world financial time series. The contributions of this
article are twofold. The first one is methodological : we show that some
structural regularities, invisible with classical statistical tests, can be
detected by this algorithmic method. The second one consists in illustrations
on the daily Dow-Jones Index suggesting that beyond several well-known
regularities, hidden structure may in this index remain to be identified.
