Perturbative and non-perturbative results are presented on the
renormalization constants of the quark field and the vector, axial-vector,
pseudoscalar, scalar and tensor currents. The perturbative computation, carried
out at one-loop level and up to second order in the lattice spacing, is
performed for a fermion action, which includes the clover term and the twisted
mass parameter yielding results that are applicable for unimproved Wilson
fermions, as well as for improved clover and twisted mass fermions. We consider
ten variants of the Symanzik improved gauge action corresponding to ten
different values of the plaquette coefficients. Non-perturbative results are
obtained using the twisted mass Wilson fermion formulation employing two
degenerate dynamical quarks and the tree-level Symanzik improved gluon action.
The simulations are performed for pion masses in the range of 480 MeV to 260
MeV and at three values of the lattice spacing, a, corresponding to beta=3.9,
4.05, 4.20. For each renormalization factor computed non-perturbatively we
subtract its perturbative O(a^2) terms so that we eliminate part of the cut-off
artifacts. The renormalization constants are converted to MS-bar at a scale of
mu=2 GeV. The perturbative results depend on a large number of parameters and
are made easily accessible to the reader by including them in the distribution
package of this paper, as a Mathematica input file.
