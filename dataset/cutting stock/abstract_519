This paper aims at transferring the philosophy behind Heath-Jarrow-Morton to
the modelling of call options with all strikes and maturities. Contrary to the
approach by Carmona and Nadtochiy (2009) and related to the recent contribution
Carmona and Nadtochiy (2012) by the same contributors, the key parametrisation of
our approach involves time-inhomogeneous L\'evy processes instead of local
volatility models. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for absence
of arbitrage. Moreover we discuss the construction of arbitrage-free models.
Specifically, we prove their existence and uniqueness given basic building
blocks.
