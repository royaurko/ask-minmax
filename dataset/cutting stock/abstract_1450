We present a study of the $t$-channel mode of single top quark production at
the upgraded Tevatron $p\bar{p}$ collider, including the next-to-leading order
(NLO) QCD corrections to the production and the decay of a single top quark.
The narrow width approximation was adopted in order to preserve the spin of the
top quark in its production and decay. We discuss the effects of different
$O(\alpha_s)$ contributions on the inclusive cross section as well as various
kinematic distributions after imposing the relevant cuts to select $t$-channel
single top signal events.
