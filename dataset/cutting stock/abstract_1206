If a cellular automaton (CA) is started with a single ON cell, how many cells
will be ON after n generations? For certain "odd-rule" CAs, including Rule 150,
Rule 614, and Fredkin's Replicator, the answer can be found by using the
combination of a new transformation of sequences, the run length transform, and
some delicate scissor cuts. Several other CAs are also discussed, although the
analysis becomes more difficult as the patterns become more intricate.
