We present a calculation of the modulation in the Local Density Of electronic
States (LDOS) caused by an impurity in graphene in the presence of external
magnetic field. We focus on the spatial Fourier Transform (FT) of this
modulation around the impurity. The FT due to the low energy quasiparticles are
found to be nonzero over the reciprocal lattice corresponding to graphene. At
these lattice spots the FT exhibits well-defined features at wavevectors that
are multiples of the inverse cyclotron orbit diameter (see Figure 2) and is cut
off at the wavevector corresponding to the energy of observation. Scanning
Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) on graphene and the energy-resolved FT fingerprint
obtained therefrom may be used to observe the quasiparticle interference of
Dirac particles in graphene in the presence of magnetic field.
