In this article, we look at the effect of volatility clustering on the risk
indifference price of options described by Sircar and Sturm in their paper
(Sircar, R., & Sturm, S. (2012). From smile asymptotics to market risk
measures. Mathematical Finance. Advance online publication.
doi:10.1111/mafi.12015). The indifference price in their article is obtained by
using dynamic convex risk measures given by backward stochastic differential
equations. Volatility clustering is modelled by a fast mean-reverting
volatility in a stochastic volatility model for stock price. Asymptotics of the
indifference price of options and their corresponding implied volatility are
obtained in this article, as the mean-reversion time approaches zero.
Correction terms to the asymptotic option price and implied volatility are also
obtained.
