We identified three samples of ROSAT sources with Sloan Digital Sky Survey
spectra, one at redshift z = 0.1, a second one at z = 0.2 and a third one at z
= 0.3. 812 sources in total were examined. We determined the nature and
spectral sub-types of the sources by visual inspection. The fraction of each
sub-type at each of the three redshifts are then calculated. We consider
selection biases caused by the luminosity cut-off threshold to determine
whether any systematic trends in AGN type are evident with increasing redshift.
We hence probe if an evolution effect is detected in our sample.
