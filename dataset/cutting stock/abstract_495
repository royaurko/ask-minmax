We present a model of single species fishery which alternates closed seasons
with pulse captures. The novelty is that the length of a closed season is
determined by the stock size of the last capture. The process is described by a
new type of impulsive differential equations recently introduced. The main
result is a fishing effort threshold which determines either the sustainability
of the fishery or the extinction of the resource.
