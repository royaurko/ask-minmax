Minimally doubled fermions have been proposed as a strictly local
discretization of the QCD quark action, which also preserves chiral symmetry at
finite cut-off. We study the renormalization and mixing properties of two
particular realizations of minimally doubled fermions in lattice perturbation
theory at one loop, and we construct conserved axial currents which have a
simple form involving only nearest-neighbours sites. We also introduce a
notation which allows a unified description of the renormalization properties
of both actions.
