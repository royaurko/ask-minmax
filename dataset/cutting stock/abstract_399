We present a method that uses distances between nearest neighbors in Takens
space to evaluate a level of noise. The method is valid even for high noise
levels. The method has been verified by estimation of noise levels in several
chaotic systems. We have analyzed the noise level for Dow Jones and DAX indexes
and we have found that the noise level ranges from 25 to 80 percent of the
signal variance.
