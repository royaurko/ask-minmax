We present recent observations from the HST-Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aimed
at characterizing the auroral emission from the extrasolar planet HD209458b. We
obtained medium-resolution (R~18-20,000) far-ultraviolet (1150-1700A) spectra
at both the Phase 0.25 and Phase 0.75 quadrature positions as well as a stellar
baseline measurement at secondary eclipse. This analysis includes a catalog of
stellar emission lines and a star-subtracted spectrum of the planet. We present
an emission model for planetary H2 emission, and compare this model to the
planetary spectrum. No unambiguously identifiable atomic or molecular features
are detected, and upper limits are presented for auroral/dayglow line
strengths. An orbital velocity cross-correlation analysis finds a statistically
significant (3.8 sigma) feature at +15 (+/- 20) km/s in the rest frame of the
planet, at 1582 A. This feature is consistent with emission from H2 B-X (2-9)
P(4) (lambda_{rest} = 1581.11 A), however the physical mechanism required to
excite this transition is unclear. We compare limits on relative line strengths
seen in the exoplanet spectrum with models of ultraviolet fluorescence to
constrain the atmospheric column density of neutral hydrogen between the star
and the planetary surface. These results support models of short period
extrasolar giant planets with weak magnetic fields and extended atomic
atmospheres.
