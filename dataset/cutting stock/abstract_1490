At lowest order in perturbation theory, the production of a Higgs boson in
association with dijets displays a strong correlation in the azimuthal angle
between the dijets, induced by the CP-properties of the Higgs Boson coupling.
However, the phase space cuts necessary for a clean extraction of the
CP-properties in the gluon fusion channel simultaneously induce large
corrections from emissions of hard radiation and thus formation of additional
jets. This contribution discusses how the CP-properties of the Higgs boson
coupling can be cleanly extracted from events with more than two jets, based on
a technique developed from insight into the high energy limit of hard
scattering matrix elements.
