This paper is a contribution to the Proceedings of the Workshop
 Complexity, Metastability and Nonextensivity held in Erice 20-26 July 2004, to
be published by World Scientific. We propose a generalization to Merton's model
for evaluating credit spreads. In his original work, a company's assets were
assumed to follow a log-normal process. We introduce fat tails and skew into
this model, along the same lines as in the option pricing model of Borland and
Bouchaud (2004, Quantitative Finance 4) and illustrate the effects of each
component. Preliminary empirical results indicate that this model fits well to
empirically observed credit spreads with a parameterization that also matched
observed stock return distributions and option prices.
