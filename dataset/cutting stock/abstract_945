We present an analysis of hadronic multiplicities measured in Pb-Pb
collisions at \sqrt s_{NN} = 2.76 TeV as a function of the collision centrality
within the statistical hadronization model. Evidence is found of a dependence
of the chemical freeze-out temperature as a function of centrality, with a slow
rise from central to peripheral collisions, which we interpret as an effect of
post-hadronization inelastic scatterings. Using correction factors calculated
by means of a simulation based on the UrQMD model, we are able to obtain a
significant improvement in the statitical model fit quality and to reconstruct
the primordial chemical equilibrium configuration. This is characterized by a
nearly constant temperature of about 164 MeV which we interpret as the actual
hadronization temperature.
