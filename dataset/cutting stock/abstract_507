In financial time series there are periods in which the value increases or
decreases monotonically. We call those periods elemental trends and study the
probability distribution of their duration for the indices DJIA, NASDAQ and
IPC. It is found that the trend duration distribution often differs from the
one expected under no memory. The expected and observed distributions are
compared by means of the Anderson-Darling test.
