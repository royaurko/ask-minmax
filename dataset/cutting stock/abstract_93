It is usually assumed that stock prices reflect a balance between large
numbers of small individual sellers and buyers. However, over the past fifty
years mutual funds and other institutional shareholders have assumed an ever
increasing part of stock transactions: their assets, as a percentage of GDP,
have been multiplied by more than one hundred. The paper presents evidence
which shows that reactions to major shocks are often dominated by a small
number of institutional players. Most often the market gets a wrong perception
and inadequate understanding of such events because the relevant information
(e.g. the fact that one mutual fund has sold several million shares) only
becomes available weeks or months after the event, through reports to the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our observations suggest that there
is a radical difference between small ($ < 0.5% $) day-to-day price variations
which may be due to the interplay of many agents and large ($ >5% $) price
changes which, on the contrary, may be caused by massive sales (or purchases)
by a few players. This suggests that the mechanisms which account for large
returns are markedly different from those ruling small returns.
