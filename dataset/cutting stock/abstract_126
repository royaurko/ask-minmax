We employ a wavelet approach and conduct a time-frequency analysis of dynamic
correlations between pairs of key traded assets (gold, oil, and stocks)
covering the period from 1987 to 2012. The analysis is performed on both
intra-day and daily data. We show that heterogeneity in correlations across a
number of investment horizons between pairs of assets is a dominant feature
during times of economic downturn and financial turbulence for all three pairs
of the assets under research. Heterogeneity prevails in correlations between
gold and stocks. After the 2008 crisis, correlations among all three assets
increase and become homogenous: the timing differs for the three pairs but
coincides with the structural breaks that are identified in specific
correlation dynamics. A strong implication emerges: during the period under
research, and from a different-investment-horizons perspective, all three
assets could be used in a well-diversified portfolio only during relatively
short periods.
