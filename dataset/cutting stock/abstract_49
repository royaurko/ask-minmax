The value of stocks, indices and other assets, are examples of stochastic
processes with unpredictable dynamics. In this paper, we discuss asymmetries in
short term price movements that can not be associated with a long term positive
trend. These empirical asymmetries predict that stock index drops are more
common on a relatively short time scale than the corresponding raises. We
present several empirical examples of such asymmetries. Furthermore, a simple
model featuring occasional short periods of synchronized dropping prices for
all stocks constituting the index is introduced with the aim of explaining
these facts. The collective negative price movements are imagined triggered by
external factors in our society, as well as internal to the economy, that
create fear of the future among investors. This is parameterized by a ``fear
factor'' defining the frequency of synchronized events. It is demonstrated that
such a simple fear factor model can reproduce several empirical facts
concerning index asymmetries. It is also pointed out that in its simplest form,
the model has certain shortcomings.
