We present an experimental and simulated model of a multi-agent stock market
driven by a double auction order matching mechanism. Studying the effect of
cumulative information on the performance of traders, we find a non monotonic
relationship of net returns of traders as a function of information levels,
both in the experiments and in the simulations. Particularly, averagely
informed traders perform worse than the non informed and only traders with high
levels of information (insiders) are able to beat the market. The simulations
and the experiments reproduce many stylized facts of stock markets, such as
fast decay of autocorrelation of returns, volatility clustering and fat-tailed
distribution of returns. These results have an important message for everyday
life. They can give a possible explanation why, on average, professional fund
managers perform worse than the market index.
