We present the results of a photometric variability survey in the young open
cluster Stock 14 and the surrounding fields. In total, we detected 103 variable
stars of which 88 are new discoveries. We confirm short-period, low-amplitude
light variations in two eclipsing members of the cluster, HD 101838 and HD
101794. In addition, we find two new beta Cephei stars of which one, HD 101993,
is also a member. The sample of pulsating cluster members is supplemented by
one multimode slowly pulsating B-type star and several single-mode candidates
of this type. The other pulsating stars in our sample are mostly field stars.
In particular, we found fourteen delta Scuti stars including one gamma
Dor/delta Sct hybrid pulsator. From our UBV photometry we derived new
parameters of Stock 14: the mean reddening E(B-V) = 0.21 +/- 0.02 mag, the true
distance modulus, 11.90 +/- 0.05 mag, and the age, 20 +/- 10 Myr. Finally, we
use the new photometry to analyze changes of the 6.322-d orbital period of the
bright eclipsing binary and the member of the cluster, V346 Cen. In addition to
the known apsidal motion, we find that another effect, possibly light-time
effect in a hierarchical system of a very long orbital period, affects these
changes. The updated value of the period of apsidal motion for this system
amounts to 306 +/- 4 yr. The open cluster Stock 14 was found to be a fairly
good candidate for successful ensemble asteroseismology.
