It is demonstrated, by means of analogue electronic simulation and
theoretically, that external noise can markedly change the character of the
response of a nonlinear system to a low-frequency periodic field. In general,
noise of sufficient intensity {\it linearises} the response. For certain
parameter ranges in particular cases, however, an increase in the noise
intensity can sometime have the opposite effect and is shown to {\it
delinearise} the response. The physical origins of these contrary behaviours
are discussed.
