We present a detailed analysis of the chemical abundances, ionization state,
and origin of a partial Lyman limit system (N(HI) ~ 10^{16} cm^{-2}) at low
redshift (z=0.167 towards PKS0405-1219). We also present the first estimate of
the total baryons in extended gaseous envelopes around galaxies based on a
simple photoionization model for the Lya absorbers. We find that extended
gaseous envelopes can explain between 5--20% of the total baryons predicted by
the big bang nucleosynthesis model.
