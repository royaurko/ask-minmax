Nucleon electromagnetic form factor data (including recent data) is fitted
with models that respect the confinement and asymptotic freedom properties of
QCD. Gari-Krumpelmann (GK) type models, which include the major vector meson
pole contributions and at high momentum transfer conform to the predictions of
perturbative QCD, are combined with Hohler-Pietarinen (HP) models, which also
include the width of the rho meson and the addition of higher mass vector meson
exchanges, but do not evolve into the explicit form of PQCD at high momentum
transfer. Different parameterizations of the GK model's hadronic form factors,
the effect of including the width of the rho meson and the addition of the next
(in mass) isospin 1 vector meson are considered. The quality of fit and the
consistency of the parameters select three of the combined HP/GK type models.
Projections are made to the higher momentum transfers which are relevant to
electron-deuteron experiments. The projections vary little for the preferred
models, removing much of the ambiguity in electron-nucleus scattering
predictions.
