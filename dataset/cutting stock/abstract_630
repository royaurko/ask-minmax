Observations of absorption systems in close, multiple lines of sight to
gravitationally lensed QSOs can be used to infer the density fluctuations and
motions of the gas clouds giving rise to the Lyman alpha forest phenomenon and
to QSO metal absorption lines. We describe a survey of lensed QSOs with the
Keck HIRES instrument and argue that one can derive limits on the frequency and
importance of hydrodynamical disturbances inflicted by galaxies on the
surrounding gas from such data. We discuss differences between the kinematic
properties of low density unsaturated Lyman alpha forest absorption systems,
high ionization CIV absorption systems, and low ionization gas visible in SiII
and CII. The general intergalactic medium appears to show very little
turbulence, but the presumable denser CIV systems exhibit evidence of having
been stirred repeatedly (by winds ?) in the past on time scales similar to
those governing stellar feedback and possibly galaxy mergers. The quiescence of
the low density IGM can be used to put upper limits on the incidence and
energetics of galactic winds on a cosmological time scale.
