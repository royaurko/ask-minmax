We propose a general framework for measuring frequency dynamics of
connectedness in economic variables based on spectral representation of
variance decompositions. We argue that the frequency dynamics is insightful
when studying the connectedness of variables as shocks with heterogeneous
frequency responses will create frequency dependent connections of different
strength that remain hidden when time domain measures are used. Two
applications support the usefulness of the discussion, guide a user to apply
the methods in different situations, and contribute to the literature with
important findings about sources of connectedness. Giving up the assumption of
global stationarity of stock market data and approximating the dynamics
locally, we document rich time-frequency dynamics of connectedness in US market
risk in the first application. Controlling for common shocks due to common
stochastic trends which dominate the connections, we identify connections of
global economy at business cycle frequencies of 18 up to 96 months in the
second application. In addition, we study the effects of cross-sectional
dependence on the connectedness of variables.
