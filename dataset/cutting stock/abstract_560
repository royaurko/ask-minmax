Financial markets can be seen as complex systems in non-equilibrium steady
state, one of whose most important properties is the distribution of price
fluctuations. Recently, there have been assertions that this distribution is
qualitatively different in emerging markets as compared to developed markets.
Here we analyse both high-frequency tick-by-tick as well as daily closing price
data to show that the price fluctuations in the Indian stock market, one of the
largest emerging markets, have a distribution that is identical to that
observed for developed markets (e.g., NYSE). In particular, the cumulative
distribution has a long tail described by a power law with an exponent $\alpha
\approx 3$. Also, we study the historical evolution of this distribution over
the period of existence of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India, which
coincided with the rapid transformation of the Indian economy due to
liberalization, and show that this power law tail has been present almost
throughout. We conclude that the ``inverse cubic law'' is a truly universal
feature of a financial market, independent of its stage of development or the
condition of the underlying economy.
