In this paper we construct a methodology for separating the divergencies due
to different topological manifolds dual to Feynman graphs in colored group
field theory. After having introduced the amplitude bounds using propagator
cuts, we show how Graph-Encoded-Manifolds (GEM) techniques can be used in order
to factorize divergencies related to different parts of the dual topologies of
the Feynman graphs in the general case. We show the potential of the formalism
in the case of 3-dimensional solid torii in the colored Boulatov model.
