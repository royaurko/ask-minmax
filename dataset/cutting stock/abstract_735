A phenomenon of the financial log-periodicity is discussed and the
characteristics that amplify its predictive potential are elaborated. The
principal one is self-similarity that obeys across all the time scales.
Furthermore the same preferred scaling factor appears to provide the most
consistent description of the market dynamics on all these scales both in the
bull as well as in the bear market phases and is common to all the major
markets. These ingredients set very desirable and useful constraints for
understanding the past market behavior as well as in designing forecasting
scenarios. One novel speculative example of a more detailed S$&$P500
development until 2010 is presented.
