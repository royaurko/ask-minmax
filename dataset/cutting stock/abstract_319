This study examines Lo's (2004) adaptive market hypothesis (AMH) in Japanese
stock markets (TOPIX and TSE2). In particular, we measure the degree of market
efficiency by using the non-Bayesian time-varying model approach of Ito et al.
(2014, 2015), which provides a more accurate measurement of market efficiency
than conventional statistical inferences (i.e., statistical tests using the
moving window method). The empirical results show that (1) market efficiency
changes over time in the TOPIX and TSE2, (2) the market efficiency of the TSE2
is lower than that of the TOPIX in most periods, and (3) the market efficiency
of the TOPIX has evolved since the bursting of the bubble economy in the early
1990s, but that of the TSE2 has not. Therefore, we conclude that the empirical
results support Lo's (2004) AMH for data on the more qualified stock market in
Japan.
