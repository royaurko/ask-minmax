We review the perturbative approach to multiparticle production in hard
collision processes. It is investigated to what extent parton level analytical
calculations at low momentum cut-off can reproduce experimental data on the
hadronic final state. Systematic results are available for various observables
with the next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy (the so-called modified leading
logarithmic approximation - MLLA). We introduce the analytical formalism and
then discuss recent applications concerning multiplicities, inclusive spectra,
correlations and angular flows in multi-jet events. In various cases the
perturbative picture is surprisingly successful, even for very soft particle
production.
