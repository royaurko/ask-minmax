We present new multi-wavelength data for the NGC 4410 galaxy group. This
group contains the peculiar radio galaxy NGC 4410A, which has a distorted
double-lobed radio structure. NGC 4410A is strongly interacting with three
nearby galaxies, and has a peculiar ring-like optical morphology, a number of
luminous H II regions, as well as as tidal tails and bridges variously visible
in optical, HI, and X-ray light. The gravitational interaction has affected the
interstellar matter, the star formation rate, and the radio lobes in this
system.
