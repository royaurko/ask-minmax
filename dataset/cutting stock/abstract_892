Three years ago we found a statistically reliable link between
ConocoPhillips' (NYSE: COP) stock price and the difference between the core and
headline CPI in the United States. In this article, the original relationship
is revisited with new data available since 2009. The agreement between the
observed monthly closing price (adjusted for dividends and splits) and that
predicted from the CPI difference is confirmed. The original quantitative link
is validated. In order to improve the accuracy of the COP price prediction a
series of advanced models is developed. The original set of two major CPIs is
extended by smaller components of the headline CPIs (e.g. the CPIs of motor
fuel and housing energy) and several PPIs (e.g. the PPIs of crude oil and coal)
which may be inherently related to ConocoPhillips and other energy companies.
These advanced models have demonstrated much lower modeling errors with better
statistical properties. The earlier reported quasi-linear trend in the CPI
difference is also revisited. This trend allows for an accurate prediction of
the COP prices at a five to ten year horizon.
