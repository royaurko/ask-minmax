The stochastic volatility model is one of volatility models which infer
latent volatility of asset returns. The Bayesian inference of the stochastic
volatility (SV) model is performed by the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm
which is superior to other Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in sampling
volatility variables. We perform the HMC simulations of the SV model for two
liquid stock returns traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and measure the
volatilities of those stock returns. Then we calculate the accuracy of the
volatility measurement using the realized volatility as a proxy of the true
volatility and compare the SV model with the GARCH model which is one of other
volatility models. Using the accuracy calculated with the realized volatility
we find that empirically the SV model performs better than the GARCH model.
