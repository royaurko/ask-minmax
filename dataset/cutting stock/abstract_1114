When the full stock of a new product is quickly sold in a few days or weeks,
one has the impression that new technologies develop and conquer the market in
a very easy way. This may be true for some new technologies, for example the
cell phone, but not for others, like the blue-ray. Novelty, usefulness,
advertising, price, and fashion are the driving forces behind the adoption of a
new product. But, what are the key factors that lead to adopt a new technology?
In this paper we propose and investigate a simple model for the adoption of an
innovation which depends mainly on three elements: the appeal of the novelty,
the inertia or resistance to adopt it, and the interaction with other agents.
Social interactions are taken into account in two ways: by imitation and by
differentiation, i.e., some agents will be inclined to adopt an innovation if
many people do the same, but other will act in the opposite direction, trying
to differentiate from the "herd". We determine the conditions for a successful
implantation of the new technology, by considering the strength of advertising
and the effect of social interactions. We find a balance between the
advertising and the number of anti-herding agents that may block the adoption
of a new product. We also compare the effect of social interactions, when
agents take into account the behavior of the whole society or just a part of
it. In a nutshell, the present model reproduces qualitatively the available
data on adoption of innovation.
