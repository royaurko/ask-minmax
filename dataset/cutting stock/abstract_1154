The mesoscopic organization of complex systems, from financial markets to the
brain, is an intermediate between the microscopic dynamics of individual units
(stocks or neurons, in the mentioned cases), and the macroscopic dynamics of
the system as a whole. The organization is determined by "communities" of units
whose dynamics, represented by time series of activity, is more strongly
correlated internally than with the rest of the system. Recent studies have
shown that the binary projections of various financial and neural time series
exhibit nontrivial dynamical features that resemble those of the original data.
This implies that a significant piece of information is encoded into the binary
projection (i.e. the sign) of such increments. Here, we explore whether the
binary signatures of multiple time series can replicate the same complex
community organization of the financial market, as the original weighted time
series. We adopt a method that has been specifically designed to detect
communities from cross-correlation matrices of time series data. Our analysis
shows that the simpler binary representation leads to a community structure
that is almost identical with that obtained using the full weighted
representation. These results confirm that binary projections of financial time
series contain significant structural information.
