We empirically analyze the scaling properties of daily Foreign Exchange
rates, Stock Market indices and Bond futures across different financial
markets. We study the scaling behaviour of the time series by using a
generalized Hurst exponent approach. We verify the robustness of this approach
and we compare the results with the scaling properties in the frequency-domain.
We find evidence of deviations from the pure Brownian motion behavior. We show
that these deviations are associated with characteristics of the specific
markets and they can be, therefore, used to distinguish the different degrees
of development of the markets.
