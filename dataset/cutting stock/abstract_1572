A new technique for the fabrication of highly sensitive qPlus sensor for
atomic force microscopy (AFM) is described. Focused ion beam was used to cut
then weld onto a bare quartz tuning fork a sharp micro-tip from an
electrochemically etched tungsten wire. The resulting qPlus sensor exhibits
high resonance frequency and quality factor allowing increased force gradient
sensitivity. Its spring constant can be determined precisely which allows
accurate quantitative AFM measurements. The sensor is shown to be very stable
and could undergo usual UHV tip cleaning including e-beam and field evaporation
as well as in-situ STM tip treatment. Preliminary results with STM and AFM
atomic resolution imaging at $4.5\,K$ of the silicon $Si(111)-7\times 7$
surface are presented.
