The lighter superpartner of the top quark ($\tt_1$) may be considerably
lighter than squarks of the first two generations, and hence may be accessible
to Tevatron collider searches, even if the other squarks and the gluino are too
heavy. For the range of $m_{\tt_1}$ of interest at the Tevatron, the $\tt_1$
decays to a chargino via $\tt_1 \to b\tw_1$ if this is kinematically allowed;
otherwise, the flavor-changing loop decay $\tt_1 \to c\tz_1$ dominates. In the
latter case, $\tt_1$ production is signalled by jet(s) plus $\eslt$ events. If,
instead, the chargino decay is allowed, $1\ell + b$-$jets + \eslt$ and
$\ell^+\ell'^- + jet(s) + \eslt$ events from leptonic decays of $\tw_1$ provide
the most promising signals. We perform detailed simulations for each of these
signals using ISAJET 7.07 and devise cuts to enable the extraction of each of
these signals above standard model backgrounds from vector boson or top quark
production. With an integrated luminosity of 100 $pb^{-1}$, experiments should
be able to probe top squark masses up to $\sim 100$ GeV in each of these
channels; the detection of the signal in the single lepton channel, however,
requires reasonable capability to tag displaced $b$ decay vertices in the
central region.
