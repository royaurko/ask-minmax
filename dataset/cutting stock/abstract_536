We explore the possibility of exciting spin waves in insulating
antiferromagnetic films by injecting spin current at the surface. We analyze
both magnetically compensated and uncompensated interfaces. We find that the
spin current induced spin-transfer torque can excite spin waves in insulating
antiferromagnetic materials and that the chirality of the excited spin wave is
determined by the polarization of the injected spin current. Furthermore, the
presence of magnetic surface anisotropy can greatly increase the accessibility
of these excitations.
