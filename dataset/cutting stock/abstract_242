In our empirical study, we examine the price of liquid stocks after
experiencing a large intraday price change using data from the NYSE and the
NASDAQ. We find significant reversal for both intraday price decreases and
increases. The results are stable against varying parameters. While on the NYSE
the large widening of the bid-ask spread eliminates most of the profits that
can be achieved by a contrarian strategy, on the NASDAQ the bid-ask spread
stays almost constant yielding significant short-term abnormal profits.
Furthermore, volatility, volume, and in case of the NYSE the bid-ask spread,
which increase sharply at the event, decay according to a power-law and stay
significantly high over days afterwards.
