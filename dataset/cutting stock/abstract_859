We report inelastic neutron scattering study of a quasi-two-dimensional S=1/2
dimer system Piperazinium Hexachlorodicuprate under hydrostatic pressure. The
spin gap {\Delta} becomes softened with the increase of the hydrostatic
pressure up to P= 9.0 kbar. The observed threefold degenerate triplet
excitation at P= 6.0 kbar is consistent with the theoretical prediction and the
bandwidth of the dispersion relation is unaffected within the experimental
uncertainty. At P= 9.0 kbar the spin gap is reduced to 0.55 meV from 1.0 meV at
ambient pressure.
