Low dispersion spectra have been obtained of five planetary nebulae in the
elliptical galaxy NGC 5128 (Centaurus-A) from the catalogue of Hui et al.
(1993). The planetary nebulae (PN) cover a range of galactocentric radius from
7.9 to 17.7 arcmin (8 to 18Kpc). The spectra display typical emission lines of
H I, He I, He II, [O III], [N II] and [S II] and appear very similar to high
excitation planetary nebulae in the Galaxy. This implies that, from a stellar
evolution viewpoint, there should be no peculiar effects introduced by
considering the bright cut-off of the PN luminosity function for distance
estimation. In particular the brightest PN detected in NGC 5128 is not
spectroscopically unusual. One of the PN shows relatively strong He II and [N
II] lines and the derived N/O ratio indicates that it may be a Type I nebula,
considered to arise from a high mass progenitor star. Determinations of the
oxygen abundance of the five PN shows a mean value 0.5 dex below solar. Given
that NGC 5128 is an elliptical galaxy with a presumably metal rich stellar
content, the low metallicities of the PN are unexpected, although a similar
situation has been observed in the bulge of M 31.
