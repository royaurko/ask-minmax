We use a theoretical model of the $\gamma ~d \to ~K^+ K^- ~n ~p $ reaction
adapted to the experiment done at LEPS where a peak was observed and associated
to the $\Theta^{+}(1540)$ pentaquark. The study shows that the method used in
the experiment to associate momenta to the undetected proton and neutron,
together with the chosen cuts, necessarily creates an artificial broad peak in
the assumed $K^+ n$ invariant mass in the region of the claimed
$\Theta^{+}(1540)$, such that the remaining strength seen for the experimental
peak is compatible with a fluctuation of 2$\sigma$ significance.
