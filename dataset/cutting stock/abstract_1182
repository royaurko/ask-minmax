The structure of finite-area topological defects in graphene is described in
terms of both the direct honeycomb lattice and its dual triangular lattice.
Such defects are equivalent to cutting out a patch of graphene and replacing it
with a different patch with the same number of dangling bonds. An important
subset of these defects, bound by a closed loop of alternating 5- and
7-membered carbon rings, explains most finite-area topological defects that
have been experimentally observed. Previously unidentified defects seen in
scanning tunneling microscope (STM) images of graphene grown on SiC are
identified as isolated divacancies or divacancy clusters.
