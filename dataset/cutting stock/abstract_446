We analyze the data of the Italian and U.S. futures on the stock markets and
we test the validity of the Continuous Time Random Walk assumption for the
survival probability of the returns time series via a renewal aging experiment.
We also study the survival probability of returns sign and apply a coarse
graining procedure to reveal the renewal aspects of the process underlying its
dynamics.
