We propose an explanation of the Island and Banana states and the relation
between Atoll and Z-track sources, constituting a unified model for Low Mass
X-ray Binaries (LMXB). We find a dramatic transition at a luminosity of 1 -
2.10^{37} erg/s above which the high energy cut-off E_CO of the Comptonized
emission in all sources is low at a few keV. There is thermal equilibrium
between the neutron star at ~2 keV and the Comptonizing accretion disk corona
(ADC) causing the low E_CO in the Banana state of Atolls and all states of the
Z-track sources. Below this luminosity, E_CO increases towards 100 keV causing
the hardness of the island state. Thermal equilibrium is lost, the ADC becoming
much hotter than the neutron star via an additional coronal heating mechanism.
This suggests a unified model of LMXB: the Banana state is a basic state with
the mass accretion rate Mdot increasing, corresponding to the Normal Branch of
Z-track sources. The Island state has high ADC temperature, this state not
existing in the Z-track sources with luminosities much greater than the
critical value. The Z-track sources have an additional flaring branch
consistent with unstable nuclear burning on the neutron star at high Mdot. This
burning regime does not exist at low Mdot so this branch is not seen in Atolls
(except GX Atolls). The Horizontal Branch in Z-track sources has a strong
increase in radiation pressure disrupting the inner disk and launching
relativistic jets.
