We present results of a photometric study of the young southern open cluster
Stock 14. This cluster is known to contain two eclipsing systems with presumed
beta Cephei components, HD 101794 and HD 101838. We confirm variability due to
pulsations and eclipses in both targets and announce the discovery of other
variable stars in the observed field.
