In the high energy Regge limit, the six gluons scattering amplitude is
controlled by the adjoint BFKL eigenvalue and impact factor. In this paper we
determine these two building blocks at any value of the 't Hooft coupling in
planar $\cal{N}$=4 SYM theory. This is achieved by means of analytic
continuations from the collinear limit, where similar all loops expressions
were recently established. We check our predictions against all available data
at weak and strong coupling.
