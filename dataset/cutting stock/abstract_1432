In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the simultaneous
appearance of lepton and baryon number violation causes the proton to decay
much faster than the experimental bound allows. Customarily, a discrete
symmetry known as R-parity is imposed to forbid these dangerous interactions.
This work begins by arguing that there is no deep theoretical motivation for
preferring R-parity over other discrete symmetries and continues by adopting
the MSSM with baryon number conservation replacing R-parity conservation. For
the purpose of studying the influence of the consequent lepton number violating
interactions, 1278 new decay channels of supersymmetric particles into Standard
Model particles have been included in the PYTHIA event generator. The augmented
event generator is then used in combination with the atlfast detector
simulation to study the impact of lepton number violation on event topologies
in the ATLAS detector, and trigger menus designed for LV-SUSY are proposed
based on very general conclusions. The subsequent analysis uses a combination
of primitive cuts and neural networks to optimize the discriminating power
between signal and background events. In all scenarios studied, it is found
that a $5\sigma$ discovery is possible for cross sections down to $10^{-10}$ mb
with an integrated luminosity of 30 fb$^{-1}$.
