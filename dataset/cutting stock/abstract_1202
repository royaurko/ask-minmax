We present a probabilistic proof of the mean-field limit and propagation of
chaos for an $N$-particle Coulomb system in 3-dimensions with potentials
scaling like 1/N and $N$-dependent cut-off of order $N^{-1/3+\epsilon}$. In
particular, we show convergence of the empirical distribution to solutions of
the Vlasov-Poisson equation for typical initial conditions.
