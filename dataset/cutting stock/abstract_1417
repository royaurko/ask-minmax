Dual string models contain significant baryon transfers and seem essentially
consistent with the available data. We here turn to a careful consideration of
the relevant topological structures. The baryon transfer is associated with one
of two possible types of cuts in various baryonium exchanges. As the baryonium
with the highest intercept easily couples to two Pomerons such transfers should
occur abundantly in percolating dense Pomerons systems. From the color
structure this quark-less baryonium can be identified with an Odderon exchange.
As the Odderon is predicted to have an almost Pomeron -like trajectory it has
to involve small coupling constants so that steeper trajectories can initially
determine the data. As this suppression is not anticipated for diffractive
processes a tiny observable backward peak should occur in the initial baryon
distribution for massive diffractive systems.
