We have analyzed the prospect of detecting a higgs signal in mSUGRA/CMSSM
based Supersymmetric(SUSY) model via chargino-neutralino($\CH_1\N0_2$)
production at 8 TeV and 14 TeV LHC energy. The signal is studied in the channel
with $\ell + b \bar b + \PMET$ following the decays, $\CH_1 \to W^\pm \N0_1$,
$\N0_2 \to \N0_1 h$ and $h \to b \bar b$. In this analysis reconstruction of
the higgs mass out of two b-jets plays a very crucial role in determining the
signal to background ratio. We follow two techniques to reconstruct higgs mass:
(A) using two identified b-jets, (B) using jet substructure technique. In
addition, imposing a certain set of selection cuts we observe the significance
is better for the latter method. We find that a viable signal can be obtained
for the higgs mass $\sim$ 125 GeV with an integrated luminosity 100 $\lumi$ for
both 8 and 14 TeV LHC energy.
