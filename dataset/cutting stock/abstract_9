Neutron scattering in strong magnetic fields is used to show the
spin-resonance in superconducting CeCoIn5 (Tc=2.3 K) is a doublet. The
underdamped resonance (\hbar \Gamma=0.069 \pm 0.019 meV) Zeeman splits into two
modes at E_{\pm}=\hbar \Omega_{0}\pm g\mu_{B} \mu_{0}H with g=0.96 \pm 0.05. A
linear extrapolation of the lower peak reaches zero energy at 11.2 \pm 0.5 T,
near the critical field for the incommensurate "Q-phase" indicating that the
Q-phase is a bose condensate of spin excitons.
