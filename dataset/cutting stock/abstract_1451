The removal of unphysical singularities in the perturbatively calculable part
of the pion form factor--a classic example of a three-point function in QCD--is
discussed. Different ``analytization'' procedures in the sense of Shirkov and
Solovtsov re examined in comparison with standard QCD perturbation theory. We
show that demanding the analyticity of the partonic amplitude as a
\emph{whole}, as proposed before by Karanikas and Stefanis, one can make
infrared finite not only the strong running coupling and its powers, but also
cure potentially large logarithms (that first appear at next-to-leading order)
containing the factorization scale and modifying the discontinuity across the
cut along the negative real axis. The scheme used here generalizes the Analytic
Perturbation Theory of Shirkov and Solovtsov to non-integer powers of the
strong coupling and diminishes the dependence of QCD hadronic quantities on all
perturbative scheme and scale-setting parameters, including the factorization
scale.
