The extension of the first-principles generalized pseudopotential theory
(GPT) to transition-metal (TM) aluminides produces pair and many-body
interactions that allow efficient calculations of total energies. In
aluminum-rich systems treated at the pair-potential level, one practical
limitation is a transition-metal over-binding that creates an unrealistic TM-TM
attraction at short separations in the absence of balancing many-body
contributions. Even with this limitation, the GPT pair potentials have been
used effectively in total-energy calculations for Al-TM systems with TM atoms
at separations greater than 4 AA. An additional potential term may be added for
systems with shorter TM atom separations, formally folding repulsive
contributions of the three- and higher-body interactions into the pair
potentials, resulting in structure-dependent TM-TM potentials. Towards this
end, we have performed numerical ab-initio total-energy calculations using VASP
(Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package) for an Al-Co-Ni compound in a particular
quasicrystalline approximant structure. The results allow us to fit a
short-ranged, many-body correction of the form a(r_0/r)^{b} to the GPT pair
potentials for Co-Co, Co-Ni, and Ni-Ni interactions.
