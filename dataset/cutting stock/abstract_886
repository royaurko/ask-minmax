Regardless of a system's complexity or scale, its growth can be considered to
be a spontaneous thermodynamic response to a local convergence of down-gradient
material flows. Here it is shown how growth can be constrained to a few
distinct modes that depend on the availability of material and energetic
resources. These modes include a law of diminishing returns, logistic behavior
and, if resources are expanding very rapidly, super-exponential growth. For a
case where a system has a resolved sink as well as a source, growth and decay
can be characterized in terms of a slightly modified form of the predator-prey
equations commonly employed in ecology, where the perturbation formulation of
these equations is equivalent to a damped simple harmonic oscillator. Thus, the
framework presented here suggests a common theoretical under-pinning for
emergent behaviors in the physical and life sciences. Specific examples are
described for phenomena as seemingly dissimilar as the development of rain and
the evolution of fish stocks.
