We calculate the transition temperature of a uniform dilute Bose gas with
repulsive interactions, using a known virial expansion of the equation of
state. We find that the transition temperature is higher than that of an ideal
gas, with a fractional increase K_0(na^3)^{1/6}, where n is the density and a
is the S-wave scattering length, and K_0 is a constant given in the paper. This
disagrees with all existing results, analytical or numerical. It agrees exactly
in magnitude with a result due to Toyoda, but has the opposite sign.
