Be it for taking advantage of stock undervaluation or in order to distribute
part of their profits to shareholders, firms may buy back their own shares. One
of the way they proceed is by including Accelerated Share Repurchases (ASR) as
part of their repurchase programs. In this article, we study the pricing and
optimal execution strategy of an ASR contract with fixed notional. In such a
contract the firm pays a fixed notional $F$ to the bank and receives, in
exchange, a number of shares corresponding to the ratio between $F$ and the
average stock price over the purchase period, the duration of this period being
decided upon by the bank. From a mathematical point of view, the problem is
related to both optimal execution and exotic option pricing.
