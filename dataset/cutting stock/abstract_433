We discuss some properties of the intrinsically nonlinear Clebsch
decomposition of a vector field into three scalars in d=3. In particular, we
note and account for the incompleteness of this parameterization when
attempting to use it in variational principles involving Maxwell and
Chern-Simons actions. Similarities with string decomposition of metrics and
their actions are also pointed out.
