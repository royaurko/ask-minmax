In order to figure out and to forecast the emergence phenomena of social
systems, we propose several probabilistic models for the analysis of financial
markets, especially around a crisis. We first attempt to visualize the
collective behaviour of markets during a financial crisis through
cross-correlations between typical Japanese daily stocks by making use of
multi- dimensional scaling. We find that all the two-dimensional points
(stocks) shrink into a single small region when a economic crisis takes place.
By using the properties of cross-correlations in financial markets especially
during a crisis, we next propose a theoretical framework to predict several
time-series simultaneously. Our model system is basically described by a
variant of the multi-layered Ising model with random fields as non-stationary
time series. Hyper-parameters appearing in the probabilistic model are
estimated by means of minimizing the 'cumulative error' in the past market
history. The justification and validity of our approaches are numerically
examined for several empirical data sets.
