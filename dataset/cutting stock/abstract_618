Tantalizing evidence has been presented supporting the suggestion that a
large population of extragalactic gas clouds permeates the Local Group, a
population which has been associated with the Galactic High-Velocity Clouds
(HVCs). We comment on both the strengths and weaknesses of this suggestion,
informally referred to as the Blitz/Spergel picture. Theoretical predictions
for the spatial and kinematic distributions, metallicities, distances, and
emission properties of Blitz/Spergel HVCs will be confronted with extant
observational data.
