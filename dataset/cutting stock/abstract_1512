Since security is one of the most important issues, the evolve of
cryptography and cryptographic analysis are considered as the fields of
on-going research. The latest development on this field is DNA cryptography. It
has emerged after the disclosure of computational ability of Deoxyribo Nucleic
Acid (DNA). DNA cryptography uses DNA as the computational tool along with
several molecular techniques to manipulate it. Due to very high storage
capacity of DNA, this field is becoming very promising. Currently it is in the
development phase and it requires a lot of work and research to reach a mature
stage. By reviewing all the potential and cutting edge technology of current
research, this paper shows the directions that need to be addressed further in
the field of DNA cryptography.
