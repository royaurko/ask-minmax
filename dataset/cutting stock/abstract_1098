The detrending moving average (DMA) algorithm is a widely used technique to
quantify the long-term correlations of non-stationary time series and the
long-range correlations of fractal surfaces, which contains a parameter
$\theta$ determining the position of the detrending window. We develop
multifractal detrending moving average (MFDMA) algorithms for the analysis of
one-dimensional multifractal measures and higher-dimensional multifractals,
which is a generalization of the DMA method. The performance of the
one-dimensional and two-dimensional MFDMA methods is investigated using
synthetic multifractal measures with analytical solutions for backward
($\theta=0$), centered ($\theta=0.5$), and forward ($\theta=1$) detrending
windows. We find that the estimated multifractal scaling exponent $\tau(q)$ and
the singularity spectrum $f(\alpha)$ are in good agreement with the theoretical
values. In addition, the backward MFDMA method has the best performance, which
provides the most accurate estimates of the scaling exponents with lowest error
bars, while the centered MFDMA method has the worse performance. It is found
that the backward MFDMA algorithm also outperforms the multifractal detrended
fluctuation analysis (MFDFA). The one-dimensional backward MFDMA method is
applied to analyzing the time series of Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index
and its multifractal nature is confirmed.
