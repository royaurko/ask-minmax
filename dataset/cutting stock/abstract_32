The present paper analyses the formal parallelism existing between the laws
of thermodynamics and some economic principles. Based on previous works, we
shall show how the existence in Economics of principles analogous to those in
thermodynamics involves the occurrence of economic events that remind of
well-known phenomenological thermodynamic paradigms (i.e., the magnetocaloric
effect and population inversion). We shall also show how the phase transition
and renormalization theory provides a natural framework to understand and
predict trend changes in stock markets. Finally, current negotiation strategies
in financial markets are briefly reviewed.
