In order to empirically assess the effect of actual seed sampling strategy on
genetic diversity of holm oak (Quercus ilex) forestations in Sicily, we have
analysed the genetic composition of two seedling lots (nursery stock and
plantation) and their known natural seed origin stand by means of six nuclear
microsatellite loci. Significant reduction in genetic diversity and significant
difference in genetic composition of the seedling lots compared to the seed
origin stand were detected. The female and the total effective number of
parents were quantified by means of maternity assignment of seedlings and
temporal changes in allele frequencies. Extremely low effective maternity
numbers were estimated (Nfe $\approx$ 2-4) and estimates accounting for both
seed and pollen donors gave also low values (Ne $\approx$ 35-50). These values
can be explained by an inappropriate forestry seed harvest strategy limited to
a small number of spatially close trees.
