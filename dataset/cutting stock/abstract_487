This article analyzes the relationship between co-persistence and hedging
which indicates co-persistence ratio is just the long-term hedging ratio. The
new method of exhaustive search algorithm for deriving co-persistence ratio is
derived in the article. And we also develop a new hedging strategy of combining
co-persistence with dynamic hedging which can enhance the hedging effectiveness
and reduce the persistence of the hedged portfolio. Finally our strategy is
illustrated to study the hedge of JIASHI300 index and HS300 stock index future .
