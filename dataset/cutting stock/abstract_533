We consider an equity-linked contract whose payoff depends on the lifetime of
policy holder and the stock price. We assume the limited capital for hedging
and we provide with the best strategy for an insurance company in the meaning
of so called succes factor $\IE^\IP\left[{\mathbf 1}_{\{V_T \geq D)}+{\mathbf
1}_{\{V_T < D\}}\frac{V_T}{D}\right ]$, where $V_T$ denotes the end value of
strategy and $D$ is the payoff of the contract. The work is a genaralisation of
the work of F\"{o}llmer and Schied \cite{FS2004} and Klusik and Palmowski
\cite{KluPal}, but it considers much more general "incompletness" of the
market, among others midterm nonmarket information signals and infitite
nonmarket scenarios.
