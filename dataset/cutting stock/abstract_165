Researchers have used many different methods to detect the possibility of
long-term dependence (long memory) in stock market returns, but evidence is in
general mixed. In this paper, three different tests, (namely Rescaled Range
(R/S), its modified form, and the semi-parametric method (GPH)), in addition to
a new approach using the discrete wavelet transform, (DWT), have been applied
to the daily returns of five Irish Stock Exchange (ISEQ) indices. These methods
have also been applied to the volatility measures (namely absolute and squared
returns). The aim is to investigate the existence of long-term memory
properties. The indices are Overall, Financial, General, Small Cap and ITEQ and
the results of these approaches show that there is no evidence of long-range
dependence in the returns themselves, while there is strong evidence for such
dependence in the squared and absolute returns. Moreover, the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) provides additional insight on the series breakdown. In
particular, in comparison to other methods, the benefit of the wavelet
transform is that it provides a way to study the sensitivity of the series to
increases in amplitude of fluctuations as well as changes in frequency.
Finally, based on results for these methods, in particular, those for DWT of
raw (or original), squared and absolute returns, it can be concluded that there
is strong indication for persistence in the volatilities of the emerging stock
market returns for the Irish data.
