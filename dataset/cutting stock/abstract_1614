We study the most promising signals of Constrained Minimal Supersymmetry
detectable at a luminosity upgraded 2 TeV Fermilab Tevatron collider. Using a
full event-level Monte Carlo based on Pythia/Jetset, we simulate the trilepton
signal examining in detail the effect of constraints on the parameter space. We
also simulate the monolepton and dilepton signals, the missing E_T + jets
signal, and the signals of stop production in supersymmetry all with full
Standard Model backgrounds with realistic detector cuts. We find that large
fractions of parameter space can be probed (or eliminated if no signal is
found), but mass limits on charginos and neutralinos are not possible based
solely on the trilepton signal. Detection efficiencies depend strongly on
supersymmetry parameters beyond simply the neutralino and chargino masses;
analyses (experimental or theoretical) that do not include this will draw
misleading conclusions. Finally, we comment on how searches at LEP II will
complement searches at Fermilab.
