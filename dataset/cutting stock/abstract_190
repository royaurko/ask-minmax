A new experiment measuring the dynamical response of the Internet population
to a ``point-like'' perturbation has been performed. The nature of the
perturbation was that of an announcement, specifically a web-interview on stock
market crashes, which contained the URL to the contributor's articles on the
subject. It was established that the download rate obeys the relation ~ 1/t in
qualitative agreement with previously reported results.
