This paper investigates the dynamics of stocks in the S&P500 index for the
last 30 years. Using a stochastic geometry technique, we investigate the
evolution of the market space and define a new measure for that purpose, which
is a robust index of the dynamics of the market structure and provides
information on the intensity and the sectoral impact of the crises. With this
measure, we analyze the effects of some extreme phenomena on the geometry of
the market. Nine crashes between 1987 and 2001 are compared by looking at the
way they modify the shape of the manifold that describes the S&P500 market
space. These crises are identified as (a) structural, (b) general and (c)
local.
