The calculation of higher twist (or dimension) corrections to physical
quantities using operator product expansions is delicate. If dimensional
regularization is used to regulate the ultra-violet divergences then there are
ambiguities in the Wilson coefficient functions due to infra-red renormalon
singularities. With a hard ultra violet cut-off, such as the inverse lattice
spacing $a$, there are no renormalon ambiguities, as a result of cancellations
between terms which in finite orders of perturbation theory diverge as inverse
powers of $a$, and those which diverge at most logarithmically. In this lecture
I review these questions, explaining the steps necessary to obtain predictions
for physical quantities from lattice measurements of matrix elements of higher
dimensional operators. The ideas are illustrated by considering quantities
computed using the heavy quark effective theory beyond leading order in the
heavy quark mass.
