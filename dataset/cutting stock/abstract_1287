Measurements of charged pion and kaon production are presented in centrality
selected Pb+Pb collisions at 40A GeV and 158A GeV beam energy as well as in
semi-central C+C and Si+Si interactions at 40A GeV. Transverse mass spectra,
rapidity spectra and total yields are determined as a function of centrality.
The system-size and centrality dependence of relative strangeness production in
nucleus-nucleus collisions at 40A GeV and 158A GeV beam energy are derived from
the data presented here and published data for C+C and Si+Si collisions at 158A
GeV beam energy. At both energies a steep increase with centrality is observed
for small systems followed by a weak rise or even saturation for higher
centralities. This behavior is compared to calculations using transport models
(UrQMD and HSD), a percolation model and the core-corona approach.
