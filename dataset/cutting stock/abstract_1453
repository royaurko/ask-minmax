The asymmetries of both light-flavor antiquark $\bar{d}(x)-\bar{u}(x)$ and
strange-antistrange $s(x)-\bar{s}(x)$ distributions of the nucleon sea are
considered with more details in the effective chiral quark model. We find that
the asymmetric distribution of light-flavor antiquarks $\bar{d}(x)-\bar{u}(x)$
matches the experiment data well and that the asymmetry of strange and
antistrange distributions can bring about 60-100% correction to the NuTeV
anomaly of $\sin^{2}\theta_{w}$, which are three standard deviations from the
world average value measured in other electroweak processes. The results on the
correction to the NuTeV anomaly are insensitive to the inputs of the
constituent quark distributions and the cut-off parameters. The ratios of
$\bar{d}(x)/\bar{u}(x)$ and $s(x)/\bar{s}(x)$ are also discussed, and it is
found that the ratio $s(x)/\bar{s}(x)$ is compatible with the available
experiments with an additional symmetric sea contribution being considered
effectively.
