Scale independence is a ubiquitous feature of complex systems which implies a
highly skewed distribution of resources with no characteristic scale. Research
has long focused on why systems as varied as protein networks, evolution and
stock actions all feature scale independence. Assuming that they simply do, we
focus here on describing exactly how this behavior emerges. We show that
growing towards scale independence implies strict constraints: the first is the
well-known preferential attachment principle and the second is a new form of
temporal scaling. These constraints pave a precise evolution path, such that an
instantaneous snapshot of a distribution is enough to reconstruct its past and
to predict its future. We validate our approach on diverse spheres of human
activities ranging from scientific and artistic productivity, to sexual
relations and online traffic.
