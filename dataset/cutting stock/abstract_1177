Nonlinear evolution equation at small x with impact parameter dependence is
analyzed numerically. Saturation scales and the radius of expansion in impact
parameter are extracted as functions of rapidity. Running coupling is included
in this evolution, and it is found that the solution is sensitive to the
infrared regularization. Kinematical effects beyond leading logarithmic
approximation are taken partially into account by modifying the kernel which
includes the rapidity dependent cuts. While the local nonlinear evolution is
not very sensitive to these effects, the kinematical constraints cannot be
neglected in the evolution with impact parameter.
