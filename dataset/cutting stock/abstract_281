The S=2 anisotropic triangular lattice alpha-NaMnO2 is studied by neutron
inelastic scattering. Antiferromagnetic order occurs at T ~ 45 K with opening
of a spin gap. The spectral weight of the magnetic dynamics above the gap
(Delta ~ 7.5 meV) has been analysed by the single-mode approximation. Excellent
agreement with the experiment is achieved when a dominant exchange interaction
(|J|/k_B ~ 73 K), along the monoclinic b-axis and a sizeable easy-axis magnetic
anisotropy (|D|/k_B ~ 3 K) are considered. Despite earlier suggestions for
two-dimensional spin interactions, the dynamics illustrate strongly coupled
antiferromagnetic S=2 chains and cancellation of the interchain exchange due to
the lattice topology. alpha-NaMnO2 therefore represents a model system where
the geometric frustration is resolved through the lowering of the
dimensionality of the spin interactions.
