The role of antiferromagnetic spin correlations in high-temperature
superconductors remains a matter of debate. We present inelastic neutron
scattering evidence that gapless spin fluctuations coexist with
superconductivity in La$_{1.905}$Ba$_{0.095}$CuO$_4$. Furthermore, we observe
that both the low-energy magnetic spectral weight and the spin
incommensurability are enhanced by the onset of superconducting correlations.
We propose that the coexistence occurs through intertwining of spatial
modulations of the pair wave function and the antiferromagnetic correlations.
This proposal is also directly relevant to sufficiently underdoped
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$.
