In this paper, we study the dynamics of absolute return, trading volume and
bid-ask spread after the trading halts using high-frequency data from the
Shanghai Stock Exchange. We deal with all three types of trading halts, namely
intraday halts, one-day halts and inter-day halts, of 203 stocks in Shanghai
Stock Exchange from August 2009 to August 2011. We find that absolute return,
trading volume, and in case of bid-ask spread around intraday halts share the
same pattern with a sharp peak and a power law relaxation after that. While for
different types of trading halts, the peaks' height and the relaxation
exponents are different. From the perspective of halt reasons or halt duration,
the relaxation exponents of absolute return after inter-day halts are larger
than that after intraday halts and one-day halts, which implies that inter-day
halts are most effective. From the perspective of price trends, the relaxation
exponents of excess absolute return and excess volume for positive events are
larger than that for negative events in case of intraday halts and one-day
halts, implying that positive events are more effective than negative events
for intraday halts and one-day halts. In contrast, negative events are more
effective than positive events for inter-day halts.
