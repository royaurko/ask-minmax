The new camera system of the shuttle Discovery on STS-114 that blasted off at
10:39am, Tuesday, July 26, 2005, after 906 days of grounding since the Columbia
accident, has produced high resolution data of foam sheddings. The 0.9 lbs
piece from the Protuberance Air Load (PAL) ramp on the LH2 tank is believed to
be comparable in its potential adversities to the $\sim 1.67$ lbs BX-250 foam
from the $-Y$ bipod ramp that demised shuttle Columbia in 2003. The two known
incidences indicate that protuberant foams, possibly in conjunction with the
liquid hydrogen temperature, offer lame targets of the aerodynamic forces.
Seven other relatively large divots in the STS-114 external tank foam
insulation have been reported, and foam shedding remains to be a challenge to
be resolved before the next space shuttle launch. The relatively large divots
from the newly streamlined foam around the -Y bipod area suggests a potential
necessity for a new line of resolution.
  We suggest an option to wrap the insulated external fuel tank with a grid of
high temperature resistant ceramic fibers ({\it ceramic fiber fishnet
stockings}). Assuming fiducial acreage of $20000 ft^2 $, one inch square cell
single fiber grid will weigh only $60g$ with fiber cost \$66. Even with
1500-fiber-equivalent strength, one inch square cell grid will add only $200
lbs$ and "miniscule" \$100,000.
