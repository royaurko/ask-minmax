Background: Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) are important to both
commercial aquaculture and recreational fisheries. Little published data is
available on length-weight relationships of channel catfish in Michigan. Though
there is no record of public or private stocking, channel catfish appeared in
Lake Diane between 1984 and 1995 and it has developed into an excellent
fishery. Results: NLLS regression yields parameter estimates of b = 3.2293 and
a = 0.00522. The improved model yields the same estimate for the exponent, b,
and a length estimate (parameter L1) of 45.23 cm. Estimates of uncertainty and
covariance are smaller for the improved model, but the correlation coefficient
is r = 0.995 in both cases. LLS regression produced different parameter values,
a = 0.01356 and b = 2.9726, and a smaller correlation coefficient, r = 0.980.
On average, catfish in the sample weighed 106.0% of the standard weight, (Brown
et al.) and the linear regression (no slope) of fillet yield vs. total weight
suggests a typical fillet yield of 28.1% with r = 0.989. Conclusion: Most of
the fish in the sample were above the standard weight, heavier than the 75th
percentile for their length. Channel catfish are doing well in Lake Diane and
the population is well matched to the food supply. Management should attempt to
maintain current population levels. In this case, the improved length-weight
model, W(L) = (L/L1)^b, provided lower uncertainties in parameter estimates and
smaller covariance than the traditional model.
