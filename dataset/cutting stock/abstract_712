The order g^2 radiative corrections to all 2- and 3-point correlators of the
composite primary operators Tr X^k are computed in {\cal N} = 4 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(N). Corrections are found to vanish for
all N. For k=2 this is a consequence of known superconformal nonrenormalization
theorems, and for general k the result confirms an N-to-infinity, fixed large
g^2N supergravity calculation and further conjectures in hep-th/9806074. A
3-point correlator involving {\cal N} = 4 descendents of Tr X^2 is calculated,
and its order g^2 contribution also vanishes, giving evidence for the absence
of radiative corrections in correlators of descendent operators.
