We present the results of a VLA and WSRT search for HI emission from the
vicinity of seven nearby clouds, which were observed in Lya absorption with HST
toward Mrk335, Mrk501 and PKS2155-304. We searched a volume of 40' x 40' x 1000
km/s. The HI mass sensitivity (5 sigma) varies from 5x10^6 to 5x10^8 Msun. We
detected HI emission in the vicinity of four out of seven absorbers. The
closest galaxy is a small dwarf galaxy at a projected distance of 68/h kpc from
the sight line toward Mrk335. It has the same velocity (V=1970 km/s) as one of
the absorbers, and has an HI mass of only 4x10^7 Msun. We found a more luminous
galaxy at the velocity (V=5100 km/s) of one of the absorbers toward
PKS2155-304, 230/h kpc from the sight line. Two other, stronger absorbers
toward PKS2155-304 at V=17,000 km/s are associated with a loose group of three
bright spiral galaxies, at projected distances of 300 to 600/h kpc. These
results support the conclusion that most nearby Lya forest clouds trace the
large-scale structures outlined by optically luminous galaxies. We do not find
any evidence for a physical association between an absorber and its closest
galaxy.
