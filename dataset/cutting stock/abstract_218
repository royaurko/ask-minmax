We describe recent discoveries of low column density [N(HI) < 10^14.5 cm^-2]
H I Ly-alpha absorbers made with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), which have
allowed us a first look at gas in local intergalactic space between us and the
"Great Wall". Despite the mere 2.4m aperture of HST, these new observations
allow us to detect absorbers with column densities, N(HI) \approx 10^12.5
cm^-2, as low as those found using Keck/HIRES at high-z. Owing to the proximity
of these absorbers to the Earth, the 197 absorbers in our combined GHRS + STIS
sample (Penton, Stocke, & Shull 2001) provide our best view of the relationship
between these absorbers and galaxies, voids, and supercluster filaments. Unlike
previous results based on galaxy surveys near higher-N(HI) absorbers, we find
no evidence that these lower-N(HI) absorbers are extended galaxy halos. Rather,
the majority (78%) are associated with large-scale filamentary structures of
galaxies, while 22% are found in galaxy "voids". Since these Ly-alpha absorbers
are currently the only baryons detected in the voids, we use their properties
to estimate that the voids contain 4.5 (+/-1.5)% of the Universal baryon
density.
