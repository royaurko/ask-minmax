After September 2008, the advanced economies severe decline caused demand for
emerging economies' exports to drop and the crisis became truly global, much
deeper and broader than expected. In these times of global depression, most
countries and companies are affected, some more than others. The financial
crisis has turned out to be much deeper and broader than expected. Entering new
markets has always been a hazardous entrepreneurial attempt, but also a
rewarding one, in the case of success. The paper aims to asses the market entry
risk of a company trying to make a good acquisition, to buy shares of another
company, activating in a foreign country. For this purpose, the case of
Electroputere S.A., the old Romanian producer of railway equipment, has been
chosen. The data were collected from the records of Bucharest Stock Exchange.
After two years from the acquisition, one can draw a conclusion whether the
strategy of the investor was a good one or a waste of money.
