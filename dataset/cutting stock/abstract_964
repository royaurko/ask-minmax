We study super-replication of contingent claims in an illiquid market with
model uncertainty. Illiquidity is captured by nonlinear transaction costs in
discrete time and model uncertainty arises as our only assumption on stock
price returns is that they are in a range specified by fixed volatility bounds.
We provide a dual characterization of super-replication prices as a supremum of
penalized expectations for the contingent claim's payoff. We also describe the
scaling limit of this dual representation when the number of trading periods
increases to infinity. Hence, this paper complements the results in [11] and
[19] for the case of model uncertainty.
