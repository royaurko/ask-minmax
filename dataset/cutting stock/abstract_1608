We study direct production of charginos and neutralinos at the CERN Large
Hadron Collider. We simulate all channels of chargino and neutralino production
using ISAJET 7.07. The best mode for observing such processes appears to be
$pp\to\tw_1\tz_2\to 3\ell +\eslt$. We evaluate signal expectations and
background levels, and suggest cuts to optimize the signal. The trilepton mode
should be viable provided $m_{\tg}\alt 500-600$~GeV; above this mass, the decay
modes $\tz_2\to\tz_1 Z$ and $\tz_2\to H_{\ell}\tz_1$ become dominant, spoiling
the signal. In the first case, the leptonic branching fraction for $Z$ decay is
small and additional background from $WZ$ is present, while in the second case,
the trilepton signal is essentially absent. For smaller values of $m_{\tg}$,
the trilepton signal should be visible above background, especially if
$|\mu|\simeq m_{\tg}$ and $m_{\tell}\ll m_{\tq}$, in which case the leptonic
decays of $\tz_2$ are enhanced. Distributions in dilepton mass
$m(\ell\bar{\ell})$ can yield direct information on neutralino masses due to
the distribution cutoff at $m_{\tz_2}-m_{\tz_1}$. Other distributions that may
lead to an additional constraint amongst the chargino and neutralino masses are
also examined.
