We investigate the possibility of probing an anomalous CP-violating coupling
in the HWW vertex at the LHC. We consider the production of the Higgs in
association of a W and then decay via the $H \rightarrow WW$ channel taking
into account the limits on the Higgs production cross section from the
Tevatron. We select the same-sign dilepton final state arising from leptonic
decays of two of the three Ws and apply cuts required to suppress the standard
model background. Several kinematical distributions and asymmetries that can be
used to ascertain the presence of a non-zero anomalous coupling are presented.
We find that, for Higgs mass in the range 130-150 GeV and anomalous couplings
allowed by the Tevatron data, these distributions can be studied with an
integrated luminosity of 30-50 fb$^{-1}$ at the 14 TeV run. Attention is
specifically drawn to some asymmetries that enable one to probe the real and
imaginary parts (as well as their signs) of the anomalous coupling, in a
complementary manner. We also explicitly demonstrate that showering and
hadronisation do not affect the utility of these variables, thus affirming the
validity of parton level calculations.
