We present preliminary results of a RR Lyrae star search and stellar
populations study performed in the Canis Major overdensity, spanning an area of
8.35sq deg. The observations were made in R and V bands, with the QUEST camera
installed in the 1m Jurgen Stock Telescope, at the Venezuela National
Observatory. The resulting Hess diagram shows a possible, but weak, red giant
branch and no obvious horizontal branch, red clump or main sequence turnoff.
After a multi--epoch photometric search, 6 RR Lyrae stars were confirmed with
further observations obtained at the 1.0 and 1.3m telescopes of the SMARTS
consortium at CTIO. Of these confirmed RR Lyrae stars, 5 have heliocentric
distances between 5 and 7 kpc. Confirmation of their physsical association with
the Canis Major system awaits for a study of their radial velocities.
