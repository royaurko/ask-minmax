We present a simple dynamical model of stock index returns which is grounded
on the ability of the Cyclically Adjusted Price Earning (CAPE) valuation ratio
devised by Robert Shiller to predict long-horizon performances of the market.
More precisely, we discuss a discrete time dynamics in which the return growth
depends on three components: i) a momentum component, naturally justified in
terms of agents' belief that expected returns are higher in bullish markets
than in bearish ones, ii) a fundamental component proportional to the
logarithmic CAPE at time zero. The initial value of the ratio determines the
reference growth level, from which the actual stock price may deviate as an
effect of random external disturbances, and iii) a driving component which
ensures the diffusive behaviour of stock prices. Under these assumptions, we
prove that for a sufficiently large horizon the expected rate of return and the
expected gross return are linear in the initial logarithmic CAPE, and their
variance goes to zero with a rate of convergence consistent with the diffusive
behaviour. Eventually this means that the momentum component may generate
bubbles and crashes in the short and medium run, nevertheless the valuation
ratio remains a good reference point of future long-run returns.
