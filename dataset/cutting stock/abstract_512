Using a corpus of over 17,000 financial news reports (involving over 10M
words), we perform an analysis of the argument-distributions of the UP- and
DOWN-verbs used to describe movements of indices, stocks, and shares. Using
measures of the overlap in the argument distributions of these verbs and
k-means clustering of their distributions, we advance evidence for the proposal
that the metaphors referred to by these verbs are organised into hierarchical
structures of superordinate and subordinate groups.
