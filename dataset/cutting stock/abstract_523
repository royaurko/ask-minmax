We provide an alternative method for analysis of multifractal properties of
time series. The new approach takes into account the behaviour of the whole
multifractal profile of the generalized Hurst exponent $h(q)$ for all moment
orders $q$, not limited only to the edge values of $h(q)$ describing in MFDFA
scaling properties of smallest and largest fluctuations in signal. The meaning
of this new measure is clarified and its properties are investigated for
synthetic multifractal data and real signals taken from stock market. We show
that the proposed new measure is free of problems one can meet in real
nonstationary signals, while searching their multifractal signatures.
