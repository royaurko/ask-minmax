We consider the problem of valuation of American (call and put) options
written on a dividend paying stock governed by the geometric Brownian motion.
We show that the value function has two different but related representations:
by means of a solution of some nonlinear backward stochastic differential
equation and weak solution to some semilinear partial differential equation.
