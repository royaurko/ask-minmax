We investigate the emergence of a structure in the correlation matrix of
assets' returns as the time-horizon over which returns are computed increases
from the minutes to the daily scale. We analyze data from different stock
markets (New York, Paris, London, Milano) and with different methods. Result
crucially depends on whether the data is restricted to the ``internal''
dynamics of the market, where the ``center of mass'' motion (the market mode)
is removed or not. If the market mode is not removed, we find that the
structure emerges, as the time-horizon increases, from splitting a single large
cluster. In NYSE we find that when the market mode is removed, the structure of
correlation at the daily scale is already well defined at the 5 minutes
time-horizon, and this structure accounts for 80 % of the classification of
stocks in economic sectors. Similar results, though less sharp, are found for
the other markets. We also find that the structure of correlations in the
overnight returns is markedly different from that of intraday activity.
