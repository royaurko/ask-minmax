We present VLA and first-epoch VLBA observations that are part of a program
to study the parsec-scale radio structure of a sample of fifteen
high-energy-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs). The sample was chosen to span the range of
logarithmic X-ray to radio flux ratios observed in HBLs. As this is only the
first epoch of observations, proper motions of jet components are not yet
available; thus we consider only the structure and alignment of the parsec- and
kiloparsec-scale jets. Like most low-energy-peaked BL Lacs (LBLs), our HBL
sample shows parsec-scale, core-jet morphologies and compact, complex
kiloparsec-scale morphologies. Some objects also show evidence for bending of
the jet 10-20pc from the core, suggesting interaction of the jet with the
surrounding medium. Whereas LBLs show a wide distribution of parsec- to
kpc-scale jet misalignment angles, there is weak evidence that the jets in HBLs
are more well-aligned, suggesting that HBL jets are either intrinsically
straighter or are seen further off-axis than LBL jets.
