Relatively light sneutrinos, which are experimentally allowed, may
significantly affect the currently popular search strategies for supersymmetric
particles by decaying dominantly into an invisible channel. In certain cases
the second lightest neutralino may also decay invisibly leading to two extra
carriers of missing energy -- in addition to the lightest supersymmetric
particle (LSP) \zi\ -- the virtual LSPs (VLSPs). It is shown that these VLSPs
are allowed in supergravity models with common scalar and gaugino masses at the
unification scale for a sizable region of parameter space and are consistent
with all constraints derived so far from SUSY searches. The pair production of
right handed sleptons, which can very well be the lightest charged SUSY
particles in this scenario, at LEP 200 and their decay signatures are
discussed. The signal survives kinematical cuts required to remove the standard
model background. Charginos are also pair produced copiously if kinematically
accessible; they also decay dominantly into hadronically quiet di--lepton +
\etmiss\ modes leading to interesting unlike sign dilepton events which are
again easily separable from the Standard Model backgrounds at LEP 200 energies.
