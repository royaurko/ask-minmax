We estimate the cross-section and asymmetry relevant for the production of
forward jets in polarised deep inelastic scattering in the region of small
values of $x$ which can be probed at possible polarised HERA measurements. The
kinematical cuts implemented in our analysis are the same as those which were
used in the unpolarised deep inelastic scattering at HERA. The calculations are
based on the double ln^2(1/x) resummation which controls the polarised deep
inelastic scattering for small values of the Bjorken parameter x. We show that
this resummation substantially enhances the corresponding cross-section and
asymmetry. The predicted value of the asymmetry is found to vary between -0.01
and -0.04 within the small x region which can possibly be probed at polarised
HERA measurements.
