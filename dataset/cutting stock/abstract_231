We compare the probability distribution of returns for the three major
stock-market indexes (Nasdaq, S&P500, and Dow-Jones) with an analytical formula
recently derived by Dragulescu and Yakovenko for the Heston model with
stochastic variance. For the period of 1982-1999, we find a very good agreement
between the theory and the data for a wide range of time lags from 1 to 250
days. On the other hand, deviations start to appear when the data for 2000-2002
are included. We interpret this as a statistical evidence of the major change
in the market from a positive growth rate in 1980s and 1990s to a negative rate
in 2000s.
