We describe our monitoring strategy which best exploits the sensitivity and
flexibility of Swift to study the long-term behaviour of Supergiant Fast X-ray
Transients (SFXTs). We present observations of the recent outbursts from two
objects of this class. IGR J16479-4514, underwent an outburst on 2008 March 19,
reaching a peak luminosity of about 6E37 erg/s (0.5-100keV; at a distance of
4.9 kpc). We obtained a simultaneous broad-band spectrum (0.3-100 keV), the
first for the SFXT class, which is fit with a heavily absorbed (column density
5E22 cm^-2) hard power-law with a high energy cut-off at about 7keV. This
spectrum shows properties similar to the ones of accreting pulsars, although no
X-ray pulsations were found. IGR J11215-5952, one of the only two periodic SFXT
known to date, was observed with Swift several times, first with an intense
23-day long monitoring campaign around the 2007 February 9 outburst; then with
a 26-day long monitoring around the unexpected July 24 outburst; finally with a
deep exposure during the 2008 June 16 outburst. We present the whole dataset,
which also includes observations which allowed us to firmly establish the
outburst period at P~165 days. Thanks to our combined observations common
characteristics to this class of objects are emerging, i.e., outburst lengths
well in excess of hours, often with a multiple peaked structure, dynamic range
~3 orders of magnitude, and periodicities are starting to be found.
