We show that the single top quarks produced in the Wg-fusion channel at a
proton-proton collider at a center-of-mass energy sqrt{s}=14 TeV posses a high
degree of polarization in terms of a spin basis which decomposes the top quark
spin in its rest frame along the direction of the spectator jet. A second
useful spin basis is the eta-beamline basis, which decomposes the top quark
spin along one of the two beam directions, depending on which hemisphere
contains the spectator jet. We elucidate the interplay between the two- and
three-body final states contributing to this production cross section in the
context of determining the spin decomposition of the top quarks, and argue that
the zero momentum frame helicity is undefined. We show that the usefulness of
the spectator and eta-beamline spin bases is not adversely affected by the cuts
required to separate the Wg-fusion signal from the background.
