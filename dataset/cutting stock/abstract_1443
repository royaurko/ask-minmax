We apply QCD Finite Energy Sum Rules to the scalar-isoscalar current to
determine the lightest $u \bar{u} + d \bar{d}$ meson in this channel. We use
`pinch-weights' to improve the reliability of the QCD predictions and reduce
the sensitivity to the cut-off $s_0$. A decaying exponential is included in the
weight function to allow us to focus on the contribution from low mass states
to the phenomenological integral. On the theoretical side we include OPE
contributions up to dimension six and a contribution due to instantons taken
from the Instanton Liquid Model. Phenomenologically, we incorporate
experimental data by using a coupling scheme for the scalar current which links
the vacuum polarisation to the $\pi \pi$ scattering amplitude via the scalar
form factor. We find that the sum rules are well saturated for certain
instanton parameters. We conclude that the $f_0(400-1200)$ definitely contains
a large $u \bar{u} + d \bar{d}$ component, whereas the $f_0(980)$ most likely
does not. We are able to estimate the average light quark mass and find
$m_q(1 \GeV) = 5.2 \pm 0.6$ MeV.
