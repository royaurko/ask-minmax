We present the magnetic structure of the itinerant monoarsenide, FeAs, with
the B31 structure. Powder neutron diffraction confirms incommensurate modulated
magnetism with wavevector $\mathbf{q} = (0.395\pm0.001)\mathbf{c}^*$ at 4 K,
but cannot distinguish between a simple spiral and a collinear spin-density
wave structure. Polarized single crystal diffraction confirms that the
structure is best described as a non-collinear spin-density wave arising from a
combination of itinerant and localized behavior with spin amplitude along the
b-axis direction being (15 $\pm$ 5)% larger than in the a-direction.
Furthermore, the propagation vector is temperature dependence, and the
magnetization near the critical point indicates a two-dimensional Heisenberg
system. The nature of the magnetism in the simplest iron arsenide is of
fundamental importance in understanding the interplay between localized and
itinerant magnetism and superconductivity.
