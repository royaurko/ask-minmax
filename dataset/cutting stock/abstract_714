We consider the dynamics of a relativistic Dirac particle constrained to move
in the interior of a twisted tube by confining boundary conditions, in the
approximation that the curvature of the tube is small and slowly varying. In
contrast with the nonrelativistic theory, which predicts that a particle's spin
does not change as the particle propagates along the tube, we find that the
angular momentum eigenstates of a relativistic spin-1/2 particle may behave
nontrivially. For example, a particle with its angular momentum initially
polarized in the direction of propagation may acquire a nonzero component of
angular momentum in the opposite direction on turning through 2 \pi radians.
Also, the usual nonrelativistic effective potential acquires an additional
factor in the relativistic theory.
