The construction of a Monte Carlo generator for high energy hadronic and
nuclear collisions is discussed in detail. Interactions are treated in the
framework of the Reggeon Field Theory, taking into consideration enhanced
Pomeron diagrams which are resummed to all orders in the triple-Pomeron
coupling. Soft and "semihard" contributions to the underlying parton dynamics
are accounted for within the "semihard Pomeron" approach. The structure of cut
enhanced diagrams is analyzed; they are regrouped into a number of subclasses
characterized by positively defined contributions which define partial weights
for various "macro-configurations" of hadronic final states. An iterative
procedure for a Monte Carlo generation of the structure of final states is
described. The model results for hadronic cross sections and for particle
production are compared to experimental data.
