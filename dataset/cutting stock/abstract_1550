We study how the significance of top quark induced charge asymmetries at the
LHC may be enhanced exploiting the $t\bar t$ total transverse momentum to
enrich the fraction of quark fusion events in the sample. We combine this
variable with previous variables related to the boost and the invariant mass of
the $t\bar t$ pair to find an optimum cut which maximizes the significance of
the asymmetry when systematic and statistic errors are taken into account. We
find that including the $t\bar t$ transverse momentum in the analysis of the
expected 2012 LHC data provides a considerable enhancement in the significance
of the asymmetry.
