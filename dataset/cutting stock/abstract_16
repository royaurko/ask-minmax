We provided an analytical representation of the price of a barrier option
with one type of special moving barrier. We consider the case that risk free
rate, dividend rate and stock volatility are time dependent. We get a pricing
formula and put call parity for barrier option when the moving barrier has a
special relation with risk free rate, dividend rate and stock volatility.
