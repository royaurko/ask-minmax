2MASS JHKs data are used to infer the reddening and distance of open clusters
for which limited optical data are available. Intrinsic ZAMS color-color and
color-magnitude relations are derived with reference to existing calibrations,
standard stars, three uniformly-reddened clusters: Stock 16, NGC 2362, and NGC
2281, and unreddened Hyades dwarfs. The method of inferring interstellar
reddening and distance for sparsely-populated open clusters is applied to
Berkeley 44, Turner 1, and Collinder 419, for which existing results conflict
with those inferred from JHKs data. The last two clusters are of special
interest: Turner 1 because it hosts the Galaxy's longest-period classical
Cepheid, and Collinder 419 because it lies in the Cygnus X complex.
