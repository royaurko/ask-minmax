We reconstruct the radial profile of the projected gravitational potential of
the galaxy cluster MACS-J1206 from 592 spectroscopic measurements of velocities
of cluster members. For doing so, we use a method we have developed recently
based on the Richardson-Lucy deprojection algorithm and an inversion of the
spherically-symmetric Jeans equation. We find that, within the uncertainties,
our reconstruction agrees very well with a potential reconstruction from weak
and strong gravitational lensing as well as with a potential obtained from
X-ray measurements. In addition, our reconstruction is in good agreement with
several common analytic profiles of the lensing potential. Varying the
anisotropy parameter in the Jeans equation, we find that isotropy parameters
which are either small, $\beta\lesssim0.2$, or decrease with radius yield
potential profiles which strongly disagree with that obtained from
gravitational lensing. We achieve the best agreement between our potential
profile and the profile from gravitational lensing if the anisotropy parameter
rises quite steeply to $\beta\approx0. 6$ within $\approx0.5\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and
stays constant further out.
