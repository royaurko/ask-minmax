This paper discusses the exact simulation of the stock price process
underlying the 3/2 model. Using a result derived by Craddock and Lennox using
Lie Symmetry Analysis, we adapt the Broadie-Kaya algorithm for the simulation
of affine processes to the 3/2 model. We also discuss variance reduction
techniques and find that conditional Monte Carlo techniques combined with
quasi-Monte Carlo point sets result in significant variance reductions.
