We propose a stochastic process for stock movements that, with just one
source of Brownian noise, has an instantaneous volatility that rises from a
type of statistical feedback across many time scales. This results in a
stationary non-Gaussian process which captures many features observed in time
series of real stock returns. These include volatility clustering, a kurtosis
which decreases slowly over time together with a close to log-normal
distribution of instantaneous volatility. We calculate the rate of decay of
volatility-volatility correlations, which depends on the strength of the memory
in the system and fits well to empirical observations.
