A deterministic trading strategy by a representative investor on a single
market asset, which generates complex and realistic returns with its first four
moments similar to the empirical values of European stock indices, is used to
simulate the effects of financial regulation that either pricks bubbles, props
up crashes, or both. The results suggest that regulation makes the market
process appear more Gaussian and less complex, with the difference more
pronounced for more frequent intervention, though particular periods can be
worse than the non-regulated version, and that pricking bubbles and propping up
crashes are not symmetrical.
