This paper elucidates the connection between the KS entropy-rate kappa and
the time evolution of the physical or statistical entropy S. For a large family
of chaotic conservative dynamical systems including the simplest ones, the
evolution of S(t) for far-from-equilibrium processes includes a stage during
which S is a simple linear function of time whose slope is kappa. The paper
presents numerical confirmation of this connection for a number of chaotic
symplectic maps, ranging from the simplest 2-dimensional ones to a
4-dimensional and strongly nonlinear map.
