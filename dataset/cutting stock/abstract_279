We study in details the skew of stock option smiles, which is induced by the
so-called leverage effect on the underlying -- i.e. the correlation between
past returns and future square returns. This naturally explains the anomalous
dependence of the skew as a function of maturity of the option. The market cap
dependence of the leverage effect is analyzed using a one-factor model. We show
how this leverage correlation gives rise to a non-trivial smile dynamics, which
turns out to be intermediate between the "sticky strike" and the "sticky delta"
rules. Finally, we compare our result with stock option data, and find that
option markets overestimate the leverage effect by a large factor, in
particular for long dated options.
