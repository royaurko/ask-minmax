We studied the fields of nine nearby open star clusters based on the Tycho-2
catalogue. The clusters are: Blanco 1, Stock 2, the alpha Per cluster, the
Pleiades, NGC 2451, IC 2391, Praesepe, IC 2602, and NGC 7092. We determined
membership probabilities for the stars in the cluster fields from the stellar
proper motions and used the Tycho-2 photometry to compute the initial mass
function (IMF) of the clusters from the main sequence turn-off point down to
approx. 1 M_sun. We found IMF slopes ranging from Gamma=-0.69 down to
Gamma=-2.27 (when the Salpeter (1955) value would be Gamma=-1.35). We also
studied the membership of individual stars of special astrophysical interest.
In some cases previous results had to be revised. As a by-product, we
investigated some general properties of the Tycho-2 catalogue; we confirmed
that the Tycho-2 proper motions show only marginal deviations from the
Hipparcos catalogue. On the other hand, in some regions the completeness of the
catalogue seems to decrease at magnitudes brighter than claimed by Hog et al.
(2000).
