We analyze hadrochemical freeze-out in central Pb+Pb collisions at CERN SPS
and LHC energies. We determine the effects of baryon and antibaryon
annihilation and/or regeneration occurring during the final cascade expansion
stage of the collisions by deriving "survival factors" for each hadronic
species and all energies considered by employing the UrQMD hybrid model. These
survival factors are shown to resemble the pattern of data deviation from the
statistical equilibrium calculations with the statistical model. We apply them
in the SM data analysis, obtaining new points in the $T-\mu_B$ plane which
follow closely the parton-hadron phase boundary predicted by lattice QCD.
