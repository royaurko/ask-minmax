In electroweak theory without elementary Higgs scalars existence of a
solution, which breaks initial symmetry is shown. A composite scalar doublet
serves as a substitute for usual Higgs. The mass of the surviving Higgs scalar
is predicted to be $M_H = 117 \pm 7 GeV$. The resulting theory contains
realistic $W, Z, t$ masses and composite massive Higgs. Parameters used are
$g$, $\theta_W$, cut-off $\Lambda \simeq 3500 GeV$ and triple gauge constant
$\lambda_V \simeq -0.034$. Stable nontrivial solution for extra interactions of
the Higgs particle gives contribution to muon $g-2$: $\Delta a = 49.4\cdot
10^{-10}$ that agrees with the recently reported anomaly. The extra interaction
leads to a number of experimental consequences for B.R. of Higgs decay and its
production cross-sections in $e^+e^- $ and $\bar p p$ collisions including
recommendation for looking for Higgs via decay $H \to 2 \gamma$.
