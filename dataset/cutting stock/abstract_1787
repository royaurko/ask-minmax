The lepton pair production in collisions of antiproton beam (E_beam = 14 GeV)
with proton target is studied on the basis of event samples simulated with
PYTHIA6 generator. Two types of quark level subprocesses are considered. The
first one goes through the production of virtual photon which converts into
lepton pair (q qbar --> gamma* --> l+l-) having a continuous energy spectrum of
the final lepton pair invariant mass. The other subprocess proceeds through the
J/Psi resonance production (p pbar --> J/Psi + X --> l+l- + X) with the
following decay of J/Psi into a pair of leptons. The distributions of different
kinematical variables which may be useful for the design of the muon system and
the electromagnetic calorimeter of the detector of PANDA experiment at FAIR are
presented. The analysis of these distribution shows the possibility to measure
the proton structure function in a new kinematical region defined by the
time-like values of the square of the momentum transferred 1 < Q^2 < 6.25 GeV^2
and withing a rather wide interval 0.05 < x < 0.7 of Bjorken x-variable. The
problems due to the presence of fake leptons that appear from meson decays, as
well as due to the background caused by minimum bias events and other QCD
processes, are also discussed. The set of cuts which allows one to separate the
signal events with lepton pairs from this kind of background events is
proposed.
