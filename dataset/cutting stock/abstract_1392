We study the potential of hadron colliders in the search for the pair
production of neutral Higgs bosons in the framework of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model. Using analytical expressions for the relevant
amplitudes, we perform a detailed signal and background analysis, working out
efficient kinematical cuts for the extraction of the signal. The important role
of squark loop contributions to the signal is emphasised. If the signal is
sufficiently enhanced by these contributions, it could even be observable at
the next run of the upgraded Tevatron collider in the near future. At the LHC
the pair production of light and heavy Higgs bosons might be detectable
simultaneously.
