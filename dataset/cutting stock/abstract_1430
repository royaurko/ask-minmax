Production cross sections for t\bar{t} and t\bar{t}j events at hadron
colliders are calculated, including finite width effects and off resonance
contributions for the entire decay chain, t --> bW --> b\ell\nu, for both top
quarks. Resulting background rates to Higgs search at the CERN LHC are updated
for inclusive H --> WW studies and for H --> \tau\tau and H --> WW decays in
weak boson fusion events. Finite width effects are large, increasing
t\bar{t}(j) rates by 20% or more, after typical cuts which are employed for
top-background rejection.
