This paper performs the numerical analysis and the computation of a Spread
option in a market with imperfect liquidity. The number of shares traded in the
stock market has a direct impact on the stock's price. Thus, we consider a
full-feedback model in which price impact is fully incorporated into the model.
The price of a Spread option is characterize by a nonlinear partial di?erential
equation. This is reduced to linear equations by asymptotic expansions. The
Peaceman-Rachford scheme as an alternating direction implicit method is
employed to solve the linear equations numerically. We discuss the stability
and the convergence of the numerical scheme. Illustrative examples are included
to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the presented method. Finally
we provide a numerical analysis of the illiquidity e?ect in replicating an
European Spread option; compared to the Black-Scholes case, a trader generally
buys more stock to replicate this option.
