A hypothesis that the financial log-periodicity, cascading self-similarity
through various time scales, carries signatures of a law is pursued. It is
shown that the most significant historical financial events can be classified
amazingly well using a single and unique value of the preferred scaling factor
lambda=2, which indicates that its real value should be close to this number.
This applies even to a declining decelerating log-periodic phase. Crucial in
this connection is identification of a "super-bubble" (bubble on bubble)
phenomenon. Identifying a potential "universal" preferred scaling factor, as
undertaken here, may significantly improve the predictive power of the
corresponding methodology. Several more specific related results include
evidence that: (i) the real end of the high technology bubble on the stock
market started (with a decelerating log-periodic draw down) in the begining of
September 2000; (ii) a parallel 2000-2002 decline seen in the Standard & Poor's
500 from the log-periodic perspective is already of the same significance as
the one of the early 1930s and of the late 1970s; (iii) all this points to a
much more serious global crash in around 2025, of course from a level much
higher (at least one order of magnitude) than in 2000.
