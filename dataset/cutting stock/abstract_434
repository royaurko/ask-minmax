The effects of Coherent excitation of a two level system with a linearly
chirped pulse are studied theoretically and experimentally (in Rb (5s - 5p)) in
the low field regime. The Coherent Transients are measured directly on the
excited state population on an ultrashort time scale. A sharp step corresponds
to the passage through resonance. It is followed by oscillations resulting from
interferences between off-resonant and resonant contributions. We finally show
the equivalence between this experiment and Fresnel diffraction by a sharp
edge.
