Various fluid mechanical systems, governed by nonlinear differential
equations, enjoy a hidden, higher-dimensional dynamical Poincar\'e symmetry,
which arises owing to their descent from a Nambu-Goto action. Also, for the
same reason, there are equivalence transformations between different models.
These interconnections are discussed in this lecture, and are summarized in
Fig. 3.
