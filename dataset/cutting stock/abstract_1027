We present HST STIS/G140M spectra of 15 extragalactic targets, which we
combine with GHRS/G160M data to examine the statistical properties of the low-z
Ly-alpha forest. We evaluate the physical properties of these Ly-alpha
absorbers and compare them to their high-z counterparts. We determine that the
warm, photoionized IGM contains 29+/-4% of the total baryon inventory at z = 0.
We derive the distribution in column density, N_HI^(1.65+/-0.07) for 12.5 < log
[N_HI] < 14.5, breaking to a flatter slope above log [N_HI] > 14.5. The slowing
of the number density evolution of high-W Ly-alpha clouds is not as great as
previously measured, and the break to slower evolution may occur later than
previously suggested (z~1.0 rather than 1.6). We find a 7.2sigma excess in the
two-point correlation function (TPCF) of Ly-alpha absorbers for velocity
separations less than 260 km/s, which is exclusively due to the higher column
density clouds. From our previous result that higher column density Ly-alpha
clouds cluster more strongly with galaxies, this TPCF suggests a physical
difference between the higher and lower column density clouds in our sample.
