Mobile learning (mLearning) is the cutting-edge learning platform to really
gain traction, driven mostly by the huge uptake in smartphones and their ever
increasing uses within the educational society. Education has long benefitted
from the proliferation of technology; however, mLearning adoption has not
proceeded at the pace one might expect. There is a disconnect between the rate
of adoption of the underlying platform (smartphones) and the use of that
technology within learning. The reasons behind this have been the subject of
several research studies. However, previous studies have mostly focused on
investigating the critical success factors (CSFs) from the student
perspectives. In this research, we have carried out an extensive study of the
six factors that impact the success of mLearning from instructors perspectives.
The results of the research showed that three factors: technical competence of
instructors, Instructors autonomy, and blended learning are the most important
elements that contribute to mLearning adoption from instructors perspectives.
