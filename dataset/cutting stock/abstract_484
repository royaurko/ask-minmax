Our study shows that many firms would accumulate at zero output level
(namely, Bankruptcy status) if a perfectly competitive market reaches full
employment (namely, those people who should obtain employment have obtained
employment). As a result, appearance of economic crisis is determined by two
points; that is, (a). Stock market approaches perfect competition; (b). Society
reaches full employment. The empirical research of these two points would lead
to early warning of economic crisis. Moreover, it is a surprise that the state
of economic crisis would be a feasible equilibrium within the framework of the
Arrow-Debreu model. That means that we can not understand the origin of
economic crisis within the framework of modern economics, for example, the
general equilibrium theory.
