We report the discovery of a dwarf (M_B = -13.9) post-starburst galaxy
coincident in recession velocity (within uncertainties) with the highest column
density absorber (N_HI = 10^15.85 cm^{-2} at cz = 1586 km/s) in the 3C~273
sightline. This galaxy is by far the closest galaxy to this absorber, projected
just 71 kpc on the sky from the sightline. The mean properties of the stellar
populations in this galaxy are consistent with a massive starburst ~3.5 Gyrs
ago, whose attendant supernovae, we argue, could have driven sufficient gas
from this galaxy to explain the nearby absorber. Beyond the proximity on the
sky and in recession velocity, the further evidence in favor of this conclusion
includes both a match in the metallicities of absorber and galaxy, and the fact
that the absorber has an overabundance of Si/C, suggesting recent type II
supernova enrichment. Thus, this galaxy and its ejecta are the expected
intermediate stage in the fading dwarf evolutionary sequence envisioned by
Babul & Rees to explain the abundance of faint blue galaxies at intermediate
redshifts.
