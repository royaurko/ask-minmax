This paper investigates the rank distribution, cumulative probability, and
probability density of price returns for the stocks traded in the KSE and the
KOSDAQ market. This research demonstrates that the rank distribution is
consistent approximately with the Zipf's law with exponent $\alpha = -1.00$
(KSE) and -1.31 (KOSDAQ), similar that of stock prices traded on the TSE. In
addition, the cumulative probability distribution follows a power law with
scaling exponent $\beta = -1.23$ (KSE) and -1.45 (KOSDAQ). In particular, the
evidence displays that the probability density of normalized price returns for
two kinds of assets almost has the form of an exponential function, similar to
the result in the TSE and the NYSE.
