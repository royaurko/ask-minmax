We describe a new model to simulate the dynamic interactions between market
price and the decisions of two different kind of traders. They possess spatial
mobility allowing to group together to form coalitions. Each coalition follows
a strategy chosen from a proportional voting ``dominated'' by a leader's
decision. The interplay of both kind of agents gives rise to complex price
dynamics that is consistent with the main stylized facts of financial time
series.
