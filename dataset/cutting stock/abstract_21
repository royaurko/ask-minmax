Every production-recycling iteration accumulates an inevitable proportion of
its matter-energy in the environment, lest the production process itself would
be a system in perpetual motion, violating the second law of Thermodynamics.
Such high-entropy matter depletes finite stocks of ecosystem services provided
by the ecosphere, hence are incompatible with the long-term growth in the
material scale of the economic process. Moreover, the complex natural systems
governing such stocks respond to depletion by possibly sudden environmental
transitions, thus hindering markets' very ability to adapt to the new
equilibrium conditions. Consequently, uncertainty of critical resilience
thresholds constrains material economic growth.
