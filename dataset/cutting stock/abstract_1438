The possibility to simulate lepton number violating supersymmetric models has
been introduced into the recently updated PYTHIA event generator, now
containing 1278 decay channels of SUSY particles into SM particles via lepton
number violating interactions. This generator has been used in combination with
the ATLFAST detector simulation to study the impact of lepton number violation
(LV) on event topologies in the ATLAS detector, and trigger menus designed for
LV-SUSY are proposed based on very general considerations. In addition, a
rather preliminary analysis is presented on the possibility for ATLAS to
observe a signal above the background in several mSUGRA scenarios, using a
combination of primitive cuts and neural networks to optimize the
discriminating power between signal and background events over regions of
parameter space rather than at individual points. It is found that a 5 sigma
discovery is possible roughly for m_{1/2} < 1TeV and m_0 < 2TeV with an
integrated luminosity of 30fb^{-1}, corresponding to one year of data taking
with the LHC running at ``mid-luminosity'', L = 3*10^{33}s^{-1}cm^{-2}.
