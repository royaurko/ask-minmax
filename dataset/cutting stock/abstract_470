We will introduce the biological motivation of the $\gamma$- food-limited
model with variable parameters. New criteria are established for the existence
and global stability of positive periodic solutions. To prove the existence of
steady-state solutions, we used the upper-lower solution method where the
existence of at least one positive periodic solution is obtained by
constructing a pair of upper and lower solutions and application of the
Friedreichs Theorem. Numerical simulations illustrate effects of periodic
variation in the values of the basic biological and environmental parameters
and how the adaptive harvesting strategies affect fishing stocks.
