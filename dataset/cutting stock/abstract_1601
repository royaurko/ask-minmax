We summarise recent developments on synthesis models for massive star
populations with a particular emphasis on Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Quantitative
analysis of the stellar content of WR galaxies are reviewed. Comparing
observations of WR galaxies from various samples with synthesis models we
derive constraints on their burst properties. The observations indicate very
short burst periods and are generally compatible with a Salpeter IMF and a
large upper mass cut-off. The use of the Hbeta equivalent width as an age
indicator works well for WR galaxies. We briefly summarise comparisons of
stellar populations in super star clusters which also provide useful contraints
on evolutionary models for massive stars e.g. at very low metallicities
inaccessible in the Local Group. In particular the observed WN and WC
populations favour the high mass loss models of Meynet et al. (1994). Finally
we review recent work on the origin of nebular HeII emission. From the new
catalogue of WR galaxies and high excitation HII regions of Schaerer et al.
(1998) we find a close relation between the presence of nebular HeII and WR
stars. The analysis of individual WR galaxies including I Zw 18 supports the
suggestion of Schaerer (1996) that hot WR stars are responsible for the hard
ionizing flux.
