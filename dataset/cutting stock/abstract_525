The three-state agent-based 2D model of financial markets as proposed by
Giulia Iori has been extended by introducing increasing trust in the correctly
predicting agents, a more realistic consultation procedure as well as a formal
validation mechanism. This paper shows that such a model correctly reproduces
the three fundamental stylised facts: fat-tail log returns, power-law
volatility autocorrelation decay in time and volatility clustering.
