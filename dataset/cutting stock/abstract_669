We recently showed that the S&P500 stock market index is well described by
Tsallis non-extensive statistics and nonlinear Fokker-Planck time evolution. We
argued that these results should be applicable to a broad range of markets and
exchanges where anomalous diffusion and `heavy' tails of the distribution are
present. In the present work we examine how the Black-Scholes derivative
pricing formula is modified when the underlying security obeys non-extensive
statistics and Fokker-Planck time evolution. We answer this by recourse to the
underlying microscopic Ito-Langevin stochastic differential equation of the
non-extensive process.
