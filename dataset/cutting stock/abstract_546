We develop a theory which applies to any market dynamics that satisfy a fair
market assumption on the nullity of the average profit of simple market making
strategies. We show that for any such fair market, there exists a martingale
fair price which corresponds to the average liquidation value (at the ask or
the bid) of an infinitesimal quantity of stock. We show that this fair price is
a natural reference price to compute the ex post gain of limit orders. Using
only the fair market assumption, we link the spread to the impact of market
orders on the fair price. We use our definition of the fair price to build
empirical tests of the relevance of this notion whose results are consistent
with our theoretical predictions.
