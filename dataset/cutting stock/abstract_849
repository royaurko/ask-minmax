Financial markets are a typical example of complex systems where interactions
between constituents lead to many remarkable features. Here, we show that a
pairwise maximum entropy model (or auto-logistic model) is able to describe
switches between ordered (strongly correlated) and disordered market states. In
this framework, the influence matrix may be thought as a dissimilarity measure
and we explain how it can be used to study market structure. We make the link
with the graph-theoretic description of stock markets reproducing the
non-random and scale-free topology, shrinking length during crashes and
meaningful clustering features as expected. The pairwise model provides an
alternative method to study financial networks which may be useful for
characterization of abnormal market states (crises and bubbles), in capital
allocation or for the design of regulation rules.
