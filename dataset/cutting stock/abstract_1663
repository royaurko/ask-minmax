There is a continued debate as to the form of the outer disc of the Milky Way
galaxy, which has important implications for its formation. Stars are known to
exist at a galacto-centric distance of at least 20 kpc. However, there is much
debate as to whether these stars can be explained as being part of the disc or
whether another extra galactic structure, the so called Monoceros ring/stream,
is required. To examine the outer disc of the Galaxy toward the anti-centre to
determine whether the star counts can be explained by the thin and thick discs
alone. Using Sloan star counts and extracting the late F and early G dwarfs it
is possible to directly determine the density of stars out to a galacto-centric
distance of about 25 kpc. These are then compared with a simple flared disc
model. A flared disc model is shown to reproduce the counts along the line of
sights examined, if the thick disc does not have a sharp cut off. The flare
starts at a Galacto-centric radius of 16 kpc and has a scale length of
4.5+/-1.5 kpc. Whilst the interpretation of the counts in terms of a
ring/stream cannot be definitely discounted, it does not appear to be
necessary, at least along the lines of sight examined towards the anti centre.
