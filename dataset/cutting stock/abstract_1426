The discovery potential of charged Higgs from pp->tH+- in the H+- -> tau nu
decay channel is investigated in CMS and ATLAS. For m_H>m_t, the most relevant
channels are H+- -> tb and H+- -> tau nu. Whereas the former has the largest
branching ratio it suffers of large irreducible backgrounds, while the latter
offers a very clean enviroment when appropriate cuts are used. Making use of
the tau polarization effects, in the purely hadronic final states an almost
background-free signal is selected. The expected discovery range is evaluated
for CMS and ATLAS with 30 fb^-1 each in the low luminosity running conditions
and the combined results are presented.
