We have obtained the average 1--500 keV spectrum of radio-quiet Seyfert 1s
using data from EXOSAT, Ginga, HEAO, and GRO/OSSE. The spectral fit to the
combined average EXOSAT and OSSE data is fully consistent with that for Ginga
and OSSE, confirming results from an earlier Ginga/OSSE sample. The average
spectrum is well-fitted by a power-law X-ray continuum with an energy spectral
index of $\alpha \simeq 0.9$ moderately absorbed by an ionized medium and with
a Compton reflection component. A high-energy cutoff (or a break) in the the
power-law component at a few hundred keV or more is required by the data. We
also show that the corresponding average spectrum from HEAO A1 and A4 is fully
compatible with that obtained from EXOSAT, Ginga and OSSE. These results
confirm that the apparent discrepancy between the results of Ginga (with
$\alpha \simeq 0.9$) and the previous results of EXOSAT and HEAO (with $\alpha
\simeq 0.7$) is indeed due to ionized absorption and Compton reflection first
taken into account for Ginga but not for the previous missions. Also, our
results confirm that the Seyfert-1 spectra are on average cut off in gamma-rays
at energies of at least a few hundred keV, not at $\sim 40$ keV (as suggested
earlier by OSSE data alone). The average spectrum is compatible with emission
from either an optically-thin relativistic thermal plasma in a disk corona, or
with a nonthermal plasma with a power-law injection of relativistic electrons.
