We present a significant improvement over our previous calculations of the
cosmic string contribution to cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra,
with particular focus on sub-WMAP angular scales. These smaller scales are
relevant for the now-operational Planck satellite and additional sub-orbital
CMB projects that have even finer resolutions. We employ larger Abelian Higgs
string simulations than before and we additionally model and extrapolate the
statistical measures from our simulations to smaller length scales. We then use
an efficient means of including the extrapolations into our Einstein-Boltzmann
calculations in order to yield accurate results over the multipole range 2 < l
< 4000. Our results suggest that power-law behaviour cuts in for l > 3000 in
the case of the temperature power spectrum, which then allows cautious
extrapolation to even smaller scales. We find that a string contribution to the
temperature power spectrum making up 10% of power at l=10 would be larger than
the Silk-damped primary adiabatic contribution for l > 3500. Astrophysical
contributions such as the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect also become important at
these scales and will reduce the sensitivity to strings, but these are
potentially distinguishable by their frequency-dependence.
