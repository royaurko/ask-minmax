Several models for the hard X-ray Background (XRB) suggest that it is due to
the emission from heavily obscured AGN. Recent studies have revealed the
presence of a new population of hard X-ray sources which must contribute
significantly to the XRB. However, whether the majority of these sources are
obscured AGN or some other type of object at present remains unclear. Here, we
further examine the possibility that a significant fraction of the XRB comes
from a population of galaxies undergoing advection-dominated accretion in the
high-\mdot regime and thus produce intrinsically hard spectra. When the
accretion rate is close to its critical value, above which an
advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) no longer exists, the major
contribution to X-ray emission is due to inverse Compton scattering of the soft
seed photons produced by cyclo-synchrotron radiation. In this regime, the
resulting ADAF spectra are relatively hard with a fairly constant X-ray
spectral index \alpha \sim 0.2-0.4 and a spectral cut-off at \sim 200 keV. We
show that the integrated emission from such sources can provide a good fit to
the hard (> 2 keV) X-ray background, provided that the spectrum is dominated by
the contribution from objects located at redshifts z \sim 2-3. The model
requires most of the contribution to the XRB to be due to objects accreting at
the critical rate.
