We study the problem of what causes prices to change. We define the
mechanical impact of a trading order as the change in future prices in the
absence of any future changes in decision making, and its it informational
impact as the remainder of the total impact once mechanical impact is removed.
We introduce a method of measuring mechanical impact and apply it to order book
data from the London Stock Exchange. The average mechanical impact of a market
order decays to zero as a function of time, at an asymptotic rate that is
consistent with a power law with an exponent of roughly 1.7. In contrast the
average informational impact builds to approach a constant value. Initially the
impact is entirely mechanical, and is about half as big as the asymptotic
informational impact. The size of the informational impact is positively
correlated to mechanical impact. For cases where the mechanical impact is zero
for all times, we find that the informational impact is negative, i.e. buy
market orders that have no mechanical impact at all generate strong negative
price responses.
