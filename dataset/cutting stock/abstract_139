In this paper we have analyzed scaling properties of time series of stock
market indices (SMIs) of developing economies of Western Balkans, and have
compared the results we have obtained with the results from more developed
economies. We have used three different techniques of data analysis to obtain
and verify our findings: Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) method, Detrended
Moving Average (DMA) method, and Wavelet Transformation (WT) analysis. We have
found scaling behavior in all SMI data sets that we have analyzed. The scaling
of our SMI series changes from long-range correlated to slightly
anti-correlated behavior with the change in growth or maturity of the economy
the stock market is embedded in. We also report the presence of effects of
potential periodic-like influences on the SMI data that we have analyzed. One
such influence is visible in all our SMI series, and appears at a period
$T_{p}\approx 90$ days. We propose that the existence of various periodic-like
influences on SMI data may partially explain the observed difference in types
of correlated behavior of corresponding scaling functions.
