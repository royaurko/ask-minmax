While there is substantial need for dependence models in higher dimensions,
most existing models quickly become rather restrictive and barely balance
parsimony and flexibility. Hierarchical constructions may improve on that by
grouping variables in different levels. In this paper, the new class of
hierarchical Kendall copulas is proposed and discussed. Hierarchical Kendall
copulas are built up by flexible copulas specified for groups of variables,
where aggregation is facilitated by the Kendall distribution function, the
multivariate analog to the probability integral transform for univariate random
variables. After deriving properties of the general model formulation,
particular focus is given to inference techniques of hierarchical Kendall
copulas with Archimedean components, for which closed-form analytical
expressions can be derived. A substantive application to German stock returns
finally shows that hierarchical Kendall copulas perform very well for real
data, out-of- as well as in-sample.
