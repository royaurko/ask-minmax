In this paper, we develop a complete methodology for semiparametric inference
in the time-varying ARCH model (tv-ARCH) introduced by Dahlhaus and Rao (2006)
and studied by Fryzlewicz et al. (2008). Our first motivation is to detect and
estimate non time-varying coefficients in a tv-ARCH process. Using kernel
estimation, we construct $\sqrt{T}-$consistent estimates for non time-varying
coefficients and, with a two-step procedure, asymptotically efficient estimates
in the semiparametric sense when the noise is Gaussian. Then a statistical test
for detecting a parametric component is considered, following the approach used
by Zhang and Wu (2012) for time-varying regression models. Our methodology is
also shown to be useful in practice for testing two well-known ARCH type models
introduced in the econometric literature: the multiplicative component model of
Engle and Rangel (2008) and the simple time-varying unconditional variance
model of Granger and Starica (2005). An application to currency exchange rates
and stock market indices illustrates the usefulness of our approach. While we
find nonstationnarity in all the data sets considered, our methodology suggests
three possible behaviors for the lag coefficients of the tv-ARCH model:
time-varying, non time-varying or non significant.
