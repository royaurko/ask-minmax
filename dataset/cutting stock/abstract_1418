Minijet production and transverse energy are important not only to understand
hadronic collisions, but also for the interpretation of nucleus collisions at
RHIC and LHC, where it determines the ``initial conditions'' for the flow in a
hadronic soup or a plasma. For high collision energies and small qT (minijets)
we enter the BFKL region. This implies that we must take into account off-shell
parton cross sections and non-integrated structure functions
(kT-factorization). It is also essential to avoid double counting, as one
emitted parton is a participant in two different subcollisions. The LDC model,
developed in Lund to describe DIS, provides a very convenient formalism to
handle these problems. The result is a dynamical suppression of minijets for
small qT. The resulting transverse energy flow is similar to the result from a
''naive'' calculation based on integrated structure functions with a qT cut-off
around 2 GeV.
