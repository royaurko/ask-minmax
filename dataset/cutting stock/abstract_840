We consider evaluation methods for payoffs with an inherent financial risk as
encountered for instance for portfolios held by pension funds and insurance
companies. Pricing such payoffs in a way consistent to market prices typically
involves combining actuarial techniques with methods from mathematical finance.
We propose to extend standard actuarial principles by a new market-consistent
evaluation procedure which we call `two step market evaluation.' This procedure
preserves the structure of standard evaluation techniques and has many other
appealing properties. We give a complete axiomatic characterization for two
step market evaluations. We show further that in a dynamic setting with a
continuous stock prices process every evaluation which is time-consistent and
market-consistent is a two step market evaluation. We also give
characterization results and examples in terms of g-expectations in a
Brownian-Poisson setting.
