New data on the production of protons, anti-protons and neutrons in p+p
interactions are presented. The data come from a sample of 4.8 million
inelastic events obtained with the NA49 detector at the CERN SPS at 158 GeV/c
beam momentum. The charged baryons are identified by energy loss measurement in
a large TPC tracking system. Neutrons are detected in a forward hadronic
calorimeter. Inclusive invariant cross sections are obtained in intervals from
0 to 1.9 GeV/c (0 to 1.5 GeV/c) in transverse momentum and from -0.05 to 0.95
(-0.05 to 0.4) in Feynman x for protons (anti-protons), respectively. pT
integrated neutron cross sections are given in the interval from 0.1 to 0.9 in
Feynman x. The data are compared to a wide sample of existing results in the
SPS and ISR energy ranges as well as to proton and neutron measurements from
HERA and RHIC.
