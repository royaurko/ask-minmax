In finance, one usually deals not with prices but with growth rates $R$,
defined as the difference in logarithm between two consecutive prices. Here we
consider not the trading volume, but rather the volume growth rate $\tilde R$,
the difference in logarithm between two consecutive values of trading volume.
To this end, we use several methods to analyze the properties of volume changes
$|\tilde R|$, and their relationship to price changes $|R|$. We analyze
$14,981$ daily recordings of the S\&P 500 index over the 59-year period
1950--2009, and find power-law {\it cross-correlations\/} between $|R|$ and
$|\tilde R|$ using detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA). We introduce a
joint stochastic process that models these cross-correlations. Motivated by the
relationship between $| R|$ and $|\tilde R|$, we estimate the tail exponent
${\tilde\alpha}$ of the probability density function $P(|\tilde R|) \sim
|\tilde R|^{-1 -\tilde\alpha}$ for both the S\&P 500 index as well as the
collection of 1819 constituents of the New York Stock Exchange Composite index
on 17 July 2009. As a new method to estimate $\tilde\alpha$, we calculate the
time intervals $\tau_q$ between events where $\tilde R>q$. We demonstrate that
$\bar\tau_q$, the average of $\tau_q$, obeys $\bar \tau_q \sim
q^{\tilde\alpha}$. We find $\tilde \alpha \approx 3$. Furthermore, by
aggregating all $\tau_q$ values of 28 global financial indices, we also observe
an approximate inverse cubic law.
