We present an analysis of selection biases in the M-sigma relation using
Monte- Carlo simulations including the sphere of influence resolution selection
bias and a selection bias in the velocity dispersion distribution. We find that
the sphere of influence selection bias has a significant effect on the measured
slope of the M-sigma relation, modeled as \beta_intrinsic = -4.69 +
2.22\beta_measured, where the measured slope is shallower than the model slope
in the parameter range of \beta > 4, with larger corrections for steeper model
slopes. Therefore, when the sphere of influence is used as a criterion to
exclude unreliable measurements, it also in- troduces a selection bias that
needs to be modeled to restore the intrinsic slope of the relation. We find
that the selection effect due to the velocity dispersion distribution of the
sample, which might not follow the overall distribution of the population, is
not important for slopes of \beta ~ 4-6 of a logarithmically linear M-sigma
relation, which could impact some studies that measure low (e.g., \beta < 4)
slopes. Combining the selection biases in velocity dispersions and the sphere
of influence cut, we find the uncertainty of the slope is larger than the value
without modeling these effects, and estimate an intrinsic slope of \beta =
5.28^{+0.84}_{-0.55}.
