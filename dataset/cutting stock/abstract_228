We study the Heston model, where the stock price dynamics is governed by a
geometrical (multiplicative) Brownian motion with stochastic variance. We solve
the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation exactly and, after integrating out the
variance, find an analytic formula for the time-dependent probability
distribution of stock price changes (returns). The formula is in excellent
agreement with the Dow-Jones index for the time lags from 1 to 250 trading
days. For large returns, the distribution is exponential in log-returns with a
time-dependent exponent, whereas for small returns it is Gaussian. For time
lags longer than the relaxation time of variance, the probability distribution
can be expressed in a scaling form using a Bessel function. The Dow-Jones data
for 1982-2001 follow the scaling function for seven orders of magnitude.
