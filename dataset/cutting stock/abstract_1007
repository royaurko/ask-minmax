The total and differential cross sections of the process e+e- -> n gamma with
n >= 2 are measured using data collected by the L3 experiment at centre-of-mass
energies of \sqrt{s}=183 and 189 GeV. The results are in agreement with the
Standard Model expectations. Limits are set on deviations from QED, contact
interaction cut-off parameters and masses of excited electrons.
