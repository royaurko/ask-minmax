The complete details of our calculation of the NLO QCD corrections to heavy
flavor photo- and hadroproduction with longitudinally polarized initial states
are presented. The main motivation for investigating these processes is the
determination of the polarized gluon density at the COMPASS and RHIC
experiments, respectively, in the near future. All methods used in the
computation are extensively documented, providing a self-contained introduction
to this type of calculations. Some employed tools also may be of general
interest, e.g., the series expansion of hypergeometric functions. The relevant
parton level results are collected and plotted in the form of scaling
functions. However, the simplification of the obtained gluon-gluon virtual
contributions has not been completed yet. Thus NLO phenomenological predictions
are only given in the case of photoproduction. The theoretical uncertainties of
these predictions, in particular with respect to the heavy quark mass, are
carefully considered. Also it is shown that transverse momentum cuts can
considerably enhance the measured production asymmetries. Finally unpolarized
heavy quark production is reviewed in order to derive conditions for a
successful interpretation of future spin-dependent experimental data.
