Exotic hadrons of a few GeV/c^2 mass, exhibiting a spectrum determined by the
perturbative interaction of a non-minimal number of valence quarks, have long
been predicted as signals of the underlying QCD structure. Models that include
the confinement region, in addition to the region of asymptotic freedom,
predict exotic masses 0.2--0.8 GeV higher than the others. The R-matrix hybrid
model has made the most detailed predictions, some of which have been
experimentally observed. Here we will give an introduction to the model and
review the status of its predictions and new applications.
