The distribution of price returns for a class of uncorrelated diffusive
dynamics is considered. The basic assumptions are (1) that there is a
"consensus" value associated with a stock, and (2) that the rate of diffusion
depends on the deviation of the stock price from the consensus value. We find
an analytical expression for the distribution of returns in terms of the
diffusion rate, when the consensus value is assumed to be fixed in time. The
analytical solution is shown to match computed histograms in two simple cases.
Differences that result when the consensus value is allowed to change with time
are presented qualitative explanations.
