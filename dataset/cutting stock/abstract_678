Using Trades and Quotes data from the Paris stock market, we show that the
random walk nature of traded prices results from a very delicate interplay
between two opposite tendencies: long-range correlated market orders that lead
to super-diffusion (or persistence), and mean reverting limit orders that lead
to sub-diffusion (or anti-persistence). We define and study a model where the
price, at any instant, is the result of the impact of all past trades, mediated
by a non constant `propagator' in time that describes the response of the
market to a single trade. Within this model, the market is shown to be, in a
precise sense, at a critical point, where the price is purely diffusive and the
average response function almost constant. We find empirically, and discuss
theoretically, a fluctuation-response relation. We also discuss the fraction of
truly informed market orders, that correctly anticipate short term moves, and
find that it is quite small.
