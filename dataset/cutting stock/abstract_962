We introduce a simple dynamical model of two interacting communities whose
elements are subject to stochastic discrete-time updates governed by only
bilinear interactions. When the intra- and inter-couplings are cooperative, the
two communities reach asymptotically an equilibrium state. However, when the
intra- or inter-couplings are anti-cooperative, the system may remain in
perpetual oscillations and, when the coupling values belong to certain
intervals, two possible scenarios arise, characterized either by erratic
aperiodic trajectories and high sensitiveness to small changes of the
couplings, or by chaotic trajectories and bifurcation cascades. Quite
interestingly, we find out that even a moderate consensus in one single
community can remove the chaos. Connections of the model with interacting stock
markets are discussed.
