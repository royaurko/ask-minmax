We consider nucleon-decay like signatures of the hylogenesis, a variant of
antibaryonic dark matter model. For the interaction between visible and dark
matter sectors through the neutron portal, we calculate rates of dark matter
scatterings off neutron which mimic neutron-decay processes $n\to \nu\gamma$
and $n\to \nu e^+ e^-$ with richer kinematics. We obtain bounds on the model
parameters from nonobservation of the neutron decays by applying the adopted in
experimental analyses kinematical cuts. The bounds are generally (much) weaker
than those following from recently performed study of events with a single jet
of high transverse momentum and missing energy observed at LHC. Then we suggest
several new nucleon-decay like processes with two mesons in the final state and
estimate (accounting for the LHC constraints) the lower limits on the nucleon
lifetime with respect to these channels. Obtained values appear to be promising
for probing the antibaryonic dark matter at future underground experiments like
HyperK and DUNE.
