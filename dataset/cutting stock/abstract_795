We analyze the relationship between tripartite entanglement and genuine
tripartite nonlocality for 3-qubit pure states in the GHZ class. We consider a
family of states known as the generalized GHZ states and derive an analytical
expression relating the 3-tangle, which quantifies tripartite entanglement, to
the Svetlichny inequality, which is a Bell-type inequality that is violated
only when all three qubits are nonlocally correlated. We show that states with
3-tangle less than 1/2 do not violate the Svetlichny inequality. On the other
hand, a set of states known as the maximal slice states do violate the
Svetlichny inequality, and exactly analogous to the two-qubit case, the amount
of violation is directly related to the degree of tripartite entanglement. We
discuss further interesting properties of the generalized GHZ and maximal slice
states.
