We study e^+e^- pair production in proton-proton and central Pb+Pb collisions
at sqrt(s_NN)=2.76 TeV within two models: an extended statistical hadronization
model (SHM) and the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach. We
find that the PHSD calculations roughly agree with the dilepton spectrum from
hadronic sources with the 'cocktail' estimates from the statistical
hadronization model matched to available data at LHC energies. The dynamical
simulations within the PHSD show a moderate increase of the low mass dilepton
yield essentially due to the in-medium modification of the rho-meson.
Furthermore, pronounced traces of the partonic degrees of freedom are found in
the PHSD results in the intermediate mass regime. The dilepton production from
the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) exceeds that from the
semi-leptonic decays of open charm and bottom mesons. Additionally, we observe
that a transverse momentum cut of 1 GeV/c further suppresses the relative
contribution of the heavy meson decays to the dilepton yield, such that the
sQGP radiation strongly dominates the spectrum for masses from 1 to 3 GeV,
allowing a closer look at the electromagnetic emissivity of the partonic plasma
in the early phase of Pb+Pb collisions.
