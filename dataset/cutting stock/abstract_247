A review is presented of the static and dynamic magnetic properties of
hole-doped cuprate superconductors measured with neutron scattering. A wide
variety of experiments are described with emphasis on the monolayer
La_{2-x}(Sr,Ba)_{x}CuO_{4} and bilayer YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} cuprates. At zero
hole doping, both classes of materials are antiferromagnetic insulators with
large superexchange constants of J > 100 meV. For increasing hole doping, the
cuprates become superconducting at a critical hole concentration of
x_{c}=0.055. The development of new instrumentation at neutron beam sources
coupled with the improvement in materials has lead to a better understanding of
these materials and the underlying spin dynamics over a broad range of hole
dopings. We will describe how the spin dispersion changes across the insulating
to superconducting boundary as well as the static magnetic properties which are
directly coupled with the superconductivity. Experiments directly probing the
competing magnetic and superconducting order parameters involving magnetic
fields, impurity doping, and structural order will be examined. Correlations
between superconductivity and magnetism will also be discussed.
