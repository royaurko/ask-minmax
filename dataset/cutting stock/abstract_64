The case of fisheries management illustrates how the inherent structural
instability of ecosystems can have deep-running policy implications. We
contrast eleven types of management plans to achieve maximum sustainable yields
(MSY) from multiple stocks and compare their effectiveness based on the results
of management strategy evaluations (MSE) that use complex food webs in their
operating models. Plans that primarily target specific stock sizes (B_MSY)
consistently led to higher yields than plans targeting specific fishing
pressures (F_MSY). A new type of self-optimising control rule, introduced here
to conquer uncertainty due to structural instability, led to intermediate
yields. Plans to "maximise the yield from each stock separately" in the sense
of a Nash equilibrium produced total yields comparable to yields from plans to
maximise total harvested biomass, but tended to be more robust to structural
instability. Most types of plans outperformed single-species management plans
that set pressure targets without explicitly considering ecological
interactions. Our analyses highlight trade-offs between yields, amiability to
fair negotiations, and continuity with current approaches in the European
context. Based on these results, we recommend directions for future
developments of EU fisheries policy.
