This paper presents a financial analysis over Twitter sentiment analytics
extracted from listed retail brands. We investigate whether there is
statistically-significant information between the Twitter sentiment and volume,
and stock returns and volatility. Traditional newswires are also considered as
a proxy for the market sentiment for comparative purpose. The results suggest
that social media is indeed a valuable source in the analysis of the financial
dynamics in the retail sector even when compared to mainstream news such as the
Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires.
