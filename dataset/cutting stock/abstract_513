Multivariate stochastic volatility models with skew distributions are
proposed. Exploiting Cholesky stochastic volatility modeling, univariate
stochastic volatility processes with leverage effect and generalized hyperbolic
skew t-distributions are embedded to multivariate analysis with time-varying
correlations. Bayesian prior works allow this approach to provide parsimonious
skew structure and to easily scale up for high-dimensional problem. Analyses of
daily stock returns are illustrated. Empirical results show that the
time-varying correlations and the sparse skew structure contribute to improved
prediction performance and VaR forecasts.
