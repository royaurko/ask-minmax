Applicability of the concept of financial log-periodicity is discussed and
encouragingly verified for various phases of the world stock markets
development in the period 2000-2010. In particular, a speculative forecasting
scenario designed in the end of 2004, that properly predicted the world stock
market increases in 2007, is updated by setting some more precise constraints
on the time of duration of the present long-term equity market bullish phase. A
termination of this phase is evaluated to occur in around November 2009. In
particular, on the way towards this dead-line, a Spring-Summer 2008 increase is
expected. On the precious metals market a forthcoming critical time signal is
detected at the turn of March/April 2008 which marks a tendency for at least a
serious correction to begin.
  In the present extended version some predictions for the future oil price are
incorporated. In particular a serious correction on this market is expected to
start in the coming days.
