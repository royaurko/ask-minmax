In this paper we introduce a new approach to model-free path-dependent option
pricing. We first introduce a general duality result for linear optimisation
problems over signed measures introduced in [3] and show how the the problem of
model-free option pricing can be formulated in the new framework. We then
introduce a model to solve the problem numerically when the only information
provided is the market data of vanilla call or put option prices. Compared to
the common approaches in the literature, e.g. [4], the model does not require
the marginal distributions of the stock price for different maturities. Though
the experiments are carried out for simple path-dependent options on a single
stock, the model is easy to generalise for multi-asset framework.
