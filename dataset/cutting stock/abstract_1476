We perform the next-to-next-leading-order (NNLO) QCD global fit of PDFs using
inclusive charged-lepton and neutrino DIS data down to Q = 1 GeV. We also
consider the data on neutrino-nucleon dimuon production, that allows us to
disentangle the strange sea distribution. The fit results in \chi^2/NDP =
5150/4338 = 1.2 that demonstrates a good consistency of the data sets used in
analysis. The resulting value of \alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.1136+- 0.0007(exp.) is in a
good agreement with the previous version of the fit with a more stringent cut
on Q. This analysis allows us to improve the accuracy of PDFs. The HT terms of
the neutrino-nucleon structure functions F_2 and xF_3 are determined, the
former is found to be consistent with one for the charged-leptons if the charge
factor is taken into account.
