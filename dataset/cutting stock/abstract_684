In this study, we analyze the aerospace stocks prices in order to
characterize the sector behavior. The data analyzed cover the period from
January 1987 to April 1999. We present a new index for the aerospace sector and
we investigate the statistical characteristics of this index. Our results show
that this index is well described by Tsallis distribution. We explore this
result and modify the standard Value-at-Risk (VaR), financial risk assessment
methodology in order to reflect an asset which obeys Tsallis non-extensive
statistics.
