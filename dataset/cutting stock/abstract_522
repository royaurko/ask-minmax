Using a two-point correlation technique, we study emergence of market
efficiency in the emergent Russian futures market by focusing on lagged
correlations. The correlation strength of leader-follower effects in the lagged
inter-market correlations on the hourly time frame is seen to be significant
initially (2009-2011) but gradually goes down, as the erstwhile leader
instruments -- crude oil, the USD/RUB exchange rate, and the Russian stock
market index -- seem to lose the leader status. An inefficiency index, based on
two-point correlations, is proposed and its history is established.
