We present a method which uses colour-colour cuts on SDSS photometry to
select white dwarfs with hydrogen rich (DA) atmospheres without the recourse to
spectroscopy. This method results in a sample of DA white dwarfs that is 95%
complete at an efficiency of returning a true DA white dwarf of 62%. The
approach was applied to SDSS Data Release 7 for objects with and without SDSS
spectroscopy. This lead to 4636 spectroscopically confirmed DA white dwarfs
with g<=19; a ~70% increase compared to Eisenstein et al.'s 2006 sample.
Including the photometric-only objects, we estimate a factor of 3 increase in
DA white dwarfs. We find that the SDSS spectroscopic follow-up is 44% complete
for DA white dwarfs with effective temperature >~ 8000K. We further
cross-correlated the SDSS sample with Data Release 8 of the UKIDSS Large Area
Survey. The spectral energy distributions of both subsets, with and without
SDSS spectroscopy, were fitted with white dwarf models to determine the
fraction of DA white dwarfs with low-mass stellar companions or dusty debris
discs via the detection of excess near-infrared emission. From the
spectroscopic sample we find that 2.0% of white dwarfs have an excess
consistent with a brown dwarf type companion, with a firm lower limit of 0.8%.
From the white dwarfs with photometry only, we find that 1.8% are candidates
for having brown dwarf companions. Similarly, both samples show that ~1% of
white dwarfs are candidates for having a dusty debris disc.
