We analyze the daily stock data of the Nasdaq Composite index in the 22-year
period 1992-2013 and identify market states as clusters of correlation matrices
with similar correlation structures. We investigate the stability of the
correlation structure of each state by estimating the statistical fluctuations
of correlations due to their non-stationarity. Our study is based on a random
matrix approach recently introduced to model the non-stationarity of
correlations by an ensemble of random matrices. This approach reduces the
complexity of the correlated market to a single parameter which characterizes
the fluctuations of the correlations and can be determined directly from the
empirical return distributions. This parameter provides an insight into the
stability of the correlation structure of each market state as well as into the
correlation structure dynamics in the whole observation period. The analysis
reveals an intriguing relationship between average correlation and correlation
fluctuations. The strongest fluctuations occur during periods of high average
correlation which is the case particularly in times of crisis.
