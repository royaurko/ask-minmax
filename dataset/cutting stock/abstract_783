This paper extends the work of El Karoui [Ann. Probab. 35 (2007) 663--714]
which finds the Tracy--Widom limit for the largest eigenvalue of a nonsingular
$p$-dimensional complex Wishart matrix $W_{\mathbb{C}}(\Omega_p,n)$ to the case
of several of the largest eigenvalues of the possibly singular $(n<p)$ matrix
$W_{\mathbb{C}}(\Omega_p,n).$ As a byproduct, we extend all results of Baik,
Ben Arous and Peche [Ann. Probab. 33 (2005) 1643--1697] to the singular Wishart
matrix case. We apply our findings to obtain a 95% confidence set for the
number of common risk factors in excess stock returns.
