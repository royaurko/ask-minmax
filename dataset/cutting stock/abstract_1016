Many properties of BL Lacs have become explicable in terms of the
"relativistic beaming" hypothesis whereby BL Lacs are FR-1 radio galaxies
viewed nearly along the jet axis. However, a possible problem with this model
is that a transition population between beamed BL Lacs and unbeamed FR-1s has
not been detected. A transition population of "low-luminosity BL Lacs" was
predicted to exist in abundance in X-ray-selected samples such as the Einstein
Extended Medium Sensitivity Survey (EMSS) by Browne & Marcha. However, these BL
Lacs may have been misidentified as clusters of galaxies. We have conducted a
search for such objects in the EMSS with the ROSAT HRI; and here we present
ROSAT HRI images, optical spectra and VLA radio maps for a small number of BL
Lacs which were previously misidentified in the EMSS catalog as clusters of
galaxies. While these objects are slightly lower in luminosity than other EMSS
BL Lacs, their properties are too similar to the other BL Lacs in the EMSS
sample to "bridge the gap" between BL Lacs and FR-1 radio galaxies. Also, the
number of new BL Lacs found are too few to alter significantly the X-ray
luminosity function or <v/vmax> value for the X-ray-selected EMSS BL Lac
sample. Thus, these observations do not explain fully the <v/vmax> discrepancy
between the X-ray and radio-selected BL Lac samples.
