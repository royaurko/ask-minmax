A detailed analysis of correlation between stock returns at high frequency is
compared with simple models of random walks. We focus in particular on the
dependence of correlations on time scales - the so-called Epps effect. This
provides a characterization of stochastic models of stock price returns which
is appropriate at very high frequency.
