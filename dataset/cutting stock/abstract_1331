In this letter we present analysis of BeppoSAX data from a long look at the
Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 7469. The presence of a soft excess below 0.8 keV is
confirmed by our analysis and no warm absorber component is required to fit the
spectrum. A complex iron emission line and the Compton reflection hump are
clearly detected. The profile of the line is too broad to associate this
feature with distant matter. In addition, the observed soft excess and the
energy of the iron line E_{Fe}=6.8 keV strongly support a scenario in which the
hard X-rays are reprocessed by a photoionized accretion disc. This hypothesis
was tested fitting the BeppoSAX spectrum with the ionized disc reflection model
of Ross & Fabian. A second narrow line component, in addition to that produced
in the disc, is also required to fit the observed iron line profile. A high
energy cut-off around 150 keV is clearly detected in the spectrum.
