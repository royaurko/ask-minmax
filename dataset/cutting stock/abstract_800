We consider the problem of option pricing under stochastic volatility models,
focusing on the linear approximation of the two processes known as exponential
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and Stein-Stein. Indeed, we show they admit the same limit
dynamics in the regime of low fluctuations of the volatility process, under
which we derive the exact expression of the characteristic function associated
to the risk neutral probability density. This expression allows us to compute
option prices exploiting a formula derived by Lewis and Lipton. We analyze in
detail the case of Plain Vanilla calls, being liquid instruments for which
reliable implied volatility surfaces are available. We also compute the
analytical expressions of the first four cumulants, that are crucial to
implement a simple two steps calibration procedure. It has been tested against
a data set of options traded on the Milan Stock Exchange. The data analysis
that we present reveals a good fit with the market implied surfaces and
corroborates the accuracy of the linear approximation.
