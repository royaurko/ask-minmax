We present a statistical strategy for the efficient determination of the
cluster luminosity function from the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects survey. To
determine the cluster luminosity function from the noise contaminated SZ map,
we first define the zeroth-order cluster luminosity function as a discrepancy
between the measured peak number density of the SZ map and the mean number
density of noise. Then we demonstrate that the noise contamination effects can
be removed by the stabilized deconvolution of the zeroth-order cluster
luminosity function with the one-dimensional Gaussian distribution. We test
this analysis technique against Monte-Carlo simulations, and find that it works
quite well especially in the medium amplitude range where the conventional
cluster identification method based on the threshold cut-off usually fails.
