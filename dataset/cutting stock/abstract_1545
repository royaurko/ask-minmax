The reaction K- d -> pi Sigma N is investigated taking into account single
scattering and the two-step process due to Kbar N -> pi Sigma rescattering. The
influence of some common approximations are examined. It is found that the
treatment of the kinematics in the Green's function that appears in the loop
integral of the rescattering process has a rather strong impact on the
resulting lineshape of the pi Sigma invariant mass spectrum. Specifically, a
calculation with correct kinematics where the three-body unitarity cut due to
the nK- p threshold occurs at the physical value yields a pronounced peak in
the invariant mass spectrum at this threshold and, at the same time, suppresses
the signal in the region of the Lambda(1405) resonance. On the other hand, an
approximation applied in past calculations shifts that threshold down and,
consequently, leads to an accidental and therefore erroneous enhancement of the
signal of the Lambda(1405) in the pi Sigma invariant mass spectrum.
