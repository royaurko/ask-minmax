We investigate the degree to which the scaling functions $F(\psi')$ derived
from cross sections for inclusive electron-nucleus quasi-elastic scattering
define the same function for different nuclei. In the region where the scaling
variable $\psi'< 0$, we find that this superscaling is experimentally realized
to a high degree.
