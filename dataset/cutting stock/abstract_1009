The present status of lattice calculations of $f_D$, $f_B$ and some mass
splittings are discussed. When one includes the uncertainties due to
discretization errors, the results do not yet have a sufficient precision to be
relevant to phenomenological applications. There are, however, good prospects
of cutting down the uncertainties by a factor of 2 or more soon.
