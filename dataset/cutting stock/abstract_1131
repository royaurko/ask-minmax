This paper poses some basic questions about instances (hard to find) of a
special problem in 3-manifold topology. "Important though the general concepts
and propositions may be with the modern industrious passion for axiomatizing
and generalizing has presented us ... nevertheless I am convinced that the
special problems in all their complexity constitute the stock and the core of
mathematics; and to master their difficulty requires on the whole the harder
labor." Hermann Weyl 1885-1955, cited in the preface of the first edition
(1939) of A. N. Whitehead's book {\em The classical groups: their invariants
and representations} \cite{whitehead1997}.
  In this paper I focus on new uncertainties left unanswered in L. Lins thesis
\cite{lins2007blink} on the homemorphism problem of eleven concrete pairs of
closed orientable 3-manifolds induced by 3-connected monochromatic {\em blinks}
(\cite{kauffman1994tlr}). The eleven HG8QI-classes are the only doubts left in
the thesis, but the first two of them were solved few days ago and in this work
I report on their solutions. We also include an appendix which can be used to
import all the links of this paper into SnapPy. The appendix was obtained by
drawing the links in SnapPy, work performed by C. Nascimento.
