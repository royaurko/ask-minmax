We address the production of black holes at LHC in space times with
compactified space-like large extra dimensions (LXD). Final state black hole
production leads to suppression of high-P_T jets, i.e. a sharp cut-off in the
cross section for pp->jet+X. This signal is compared to the jet plus missing
energy signature due to graviton production in the final state as proposed by
the ATLAS collaboration. Time evolution and lifetimes of the newly created
black holes are calculated based on the microcanonical formalism. It is
demonstrated that previous lifetime estimates of micro black holes have been
dramatically underestimated. The creation of a large number of quasi-stable
black holes is predicted with life times beyond hundred fm/c at LHC. Medium
modifications of the black holes evaporation rate due to the quark gluon plasma
in relativistic heavy ion collisions as well as provided by the cosmic fluid in
the early universe are studied.
