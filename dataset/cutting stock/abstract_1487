It is anticipated that hard double parton scattering (DPS) will occur
frequently in the collisions of the LHC, producing interesting signals and
significant backgrounds to certain single scattering processes. In order to
make theoretical predictions of double scattering rates and properties, the
double parton distributions (dPDFs) D_p^{j_1j_2}(x_1,x_2;Q_A,Q_B) are required.
We discuss the first publicly available set of equal-scale (Q_A=Q_B) leading
order dPDFs -- the GS09 dPDFs. A brief account is given describing how pQCD
evolution effects and sum rule constraints (the latter derived by us) have been
incorporated into this set of dPDFs. We then present a summary of a
phenomenological investigation into same-sign W pair production conducted using
GS09. In this, the DPS signal produced using GS09 is compared with that
obtained using simple products of single PDFs multiplied by (1-x_1-x_2)^n, and
the single scattering backgrounds (W+-W+-jj, di-boson and heavy flavour) are
carefully calculated. It is found that the correlations in GS09 manifest
themselves in non-trivial kinematic correlations between the W bosons. However,
it is unlikely that these correlations will be measurable at the LHC in the
near future owing to the fact that the background is significant even after
cuts.
