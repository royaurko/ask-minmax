We study models of gauge mediated SUSY breaking with more than one hidden
sector. In these models the neutralino sector of the MSSM is supplemented with
additional light neutral fermions, the nearly massless gravitino and the
massive pseudo-goldstini. For the case where the Bino is the lightest ordinary
SUSY particle, its preferred decay is to a photon and the heaviest
pseudo-goldstino, which generically cascades down to lighter pseudo-goldstini,
or to the gravitino, in association with photons. This gives rise to
multiphoton plus missing energy signatures at the LHC. We investigate in detail
simplified models where the SUSY spectrum consists of the right-handed
sleptons, a Bino-like neutralino, the pseudo-goldstini and the gravitino. We
compare against existing LHC searches and show that the sensitivity to our
models could be significantly improved by relaxing the kinematic cuts and
requiring additional final state particles. We propose inclusive searches in
the final state with at least three photons plus missing energy and in the
final state with at least two photons plus two leptons plus missing energy, the
former being sensitive to any production mode and the latter being optimized
for slepton pair production. We show that they could lead to an observation (or
strong constraints) already with the data set from LHC Run I, and present
prospects for LHC Run II.
