Financial time series typically exhibit strong fluctuations that cannot be
described by a Gaussian distribution. In recent empirical studies of stock
market indices it was examined whether the distribution P(r) of returns r(tau)
after some time tau can be described by a (truncated) Levy-stable distribution
L_{alpha}(r) with some index 0 < alpha <= 2. While the Levy distribution cannot
be expressed in a closed form, one can identify its parameters by testing the
dependence of the central peak height on tau as well as the power-law decay of
the tails. In an earlier study [Mantegna and Stanley, Nature 376, 46 (1995)] it
was found that the behavior of the central peak of P(r) for the Standard & Poor
500 index is consistent with the Levy distribution with alpha=1.4. In a more
recent study [Gopikrishnan et al., Phys. Rev. E 60, 5305 (1999)] it was found
that the tails of P(r) exhibit a power-law decay with an exponent alpha ~= 3,
thus deviating from the Levy distribution. In this paper we study the
distribution of returns in a generic model that describes the dynamics of stock
market indices. For the distributions P(r) generated by this model, we observe
that the scaling of the central peak is consistent with a Levy distribution
while the tails exhibit a power-law distribution with an exponent alpha > 2,
namely beyond the range of Levy-stable distributions. Our results are in
agreement with both empirical studies and reconcile the apparent disagreement
between their results.
