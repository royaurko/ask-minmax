When an unbiased estimator of the likelihood is used within a
Metropolis--Hastings chain, it is necessary to trade off the number of Monte
Carlo samples used to construct this estimator against the asymptotic variances
of averages computed under this chain. Many Monte Carlo samples will typically
result in Metropolis--Hastings averages with lower asymptotic variances than
the corresponding Metropolis--Hastings averages using fewer samples. However,
the computing time required to construct the likelihood estimator increases
with the number of Monte Carlo samples. Under the assumption that the
distribution of the additive noise introduced by the log-likelihood estimator
is Gaussian with variance inversely proportional to the number of Monte Carlo
samples and independent of the parameter value at which it is evaluated, we
provide guidelines on the number of samples to select. We demonstrate our
results by considering a stochastic volatility model applied to stock index
returns.
