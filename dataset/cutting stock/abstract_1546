We present the spectra of 60 asteroids, including 47 V-types observed during
the first phase of the Adler V-Type Asteroid (AVAST) Survey. SDSS photometry
was used to select candidate V-type asteroids for follow up by nature of their
very blue $i-z$ color. 47 of the 61 observed candidates were positively
classified as V-type asteroids, while an additional six show indications of a
0.9 $\mu$m feature consistent with V-type spectra, but not sufficient for
formal classification. Four asteroids were found to be S-type, all of which had
$i-z$ values very near the adopted AVAST selection criteria of $i-z \le -0.2$,
including one candidate observed well outside the cut (at a mean $i-z$ of
-0.11). Three A-type asteroids were also identified. Six V-type asteroids were
observed beyond the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter, including the
identification of two new V-type asteroids (63085 and 105041) at this distance.
Six V-type asteroids were observed with low ($<5\deg$) orbital inclination,
outside of the normal dynamical range of classic Vestoids, and are suggestive
of a non-Vesta origin for at least some of the population.
