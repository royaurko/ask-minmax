A new method, based on the original theory of conservation of sum of kinetic
and potential energy defined for prices is proposed and applied on Dow Jones
Industrials Average (DJIA). The general trends averaged over months or years
gave a roughly conserved total energy, with three different potential energies,
i.e. positive definite quadratic, negative definite quadratic and linear
potential energy for exponential rises (and falls), sinusoidal oscillations and
parabolic trajectories, respectively. Corresponding expressions for force
(impact) are also given. Keywords:
