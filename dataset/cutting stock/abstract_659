We consider the problem of option pricing and hedging when stock returns are
correlated in time. Within a quadratic-risk minimisation scheme, we obtain a
general formula, valid for weakly correlated non-Gaussian processes. We show
that for Gaussian price increments, the correlations are irrelevant, and the
Black-Scholes formula holds with the volatility of the price increments on the
scale of the re-hedging. For non-Gaussian processes, further non trivial
corrections to the `smile' are brought about by the correlations, even when the
hedge is the Black-Scholes Delta-hedge. We introduce a compact notation which
eases the computations and could be of use to deal with more complicated
models.
