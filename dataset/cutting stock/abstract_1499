We present results on the nucleon electromagnetic form factors within lattice
QCD using two flavors of degenerate twisted mass fermions. Volume effects are
examined using simulations at two volumes of spatial length L=2.1 fm and L=2.8
fm. Cut-off effects are investigated using three different values of the
lattice spacings, namely a=0.089 fm, a=0.070 and a=0.056 fm. The nucleon
magnetic moment, Dirac and Pauli radii are obtained in the continuum limit and
chirally extrapolated to the physical pion mass allowing for a comparison with
experiment.
