Fourier analysis on a cut sky of the two-year COBE DMR 53 and 90 GHz sky maps
(in galactic coordinates) is used to determine the normalisation of an open
inflation model based on the cold dark matter scenario. The normalised model is
compared to measures of large-scale structure in the universe. Although the DMR
data alone does not provide sufficient discriminative power to prefer a
particular value of the mass density parameter, the open model appears to be
reasonably consistent with observations when Omega_0 ~ 0.3 - 0.4 and merits
further study.
