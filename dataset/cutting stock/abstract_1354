We carry out Monte Carlo simulations of the uniformly frustrated 3d XY model
as a model for vortex line fluctuations in a high Tc superconductor. A density
of vortex lines of f=1/25 is considered. We find two sharp phase transitions.
The low T phase is an ordered vortex line lattice. The high T normal phase is a
vortex line liquid with much entangling, cutting, and loop excitations. An
intermediate phase is found which is characterized as a vortex line liquid of
disentangled lines. In this phase, the system displays superconducting
properties in the direction parallel to the magnetic field, but normal behavior
in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field.
