We investigate the phase transition in the three-dimensional abelian Higgs
model for N complex scalar fields, using the gauge-invariant average action
\Gamma_{k}. The dependence of \Gamma_{k} on the effective infra-red cut-off k
is described by a non-perturbative flow equation. The transition turns out to
be first- or second-order, depending on the ratio between scalar and gauge
coupling. We look at the fixed points of the theory for various N and compute
the critical exponents of the model. Comparison with results from the
\epsilon-expansion shows a rather poor convergence for \epsilon=1 even for
large N. This is in contrast to the surprisingly good results of the
\epsilon-expansion for pure scalar theories. Our results suggest the existence
of a parameter range with a second-order transition for all N, including the
case of the superconductor phase transition for N=1.
