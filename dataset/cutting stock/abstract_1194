We introduce the two substructural propositional logics KL, KL+, which use
disjunction, fusion and a unary, (quasi-)exponential connective. For both we
prove strong completeness with respect to the interpretation in Kleene algebras
and a variant thereof. We also prove strong completeness for language models,
where each logic comes with a different interpretation. We show that for both
logics the cut rule is admissible and both have a decidable consequence
relation.
