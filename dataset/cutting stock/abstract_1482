We examine the prospect to measure the Higgs boson mass using the recently
introduced kinematic variable, the M_T2-Assisted On-Shell (MAOS) momentum, that
provides a systematic approximation to the invisible neutrino momenta in
dileptonic decays of W-boson pair. For this purpose, we introduce a modified
version of the MAOS momentum, that is applicable even when one or both of the
W-bosons from the Higgs decay are in off-shell. It is demonstrated that the
MAOS Higgs mass distribution, constructed with the MAOS neutrino momenta, shows
a clear peak at the true Higgs boson mass when an event cut selecting higher
value of M_T2 is employed. We perform the likelihood analysis for this MAOS
mass distribution to determine the Higgs boson mass, and find it can improve
the accuracy of the Higgs mass measurement. Our results indicate that the MAOS
Higgs mass can be useful also for the discovery or exclusion of the Higgs boson
in certain mass range.
