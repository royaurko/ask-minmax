We derive the probability for rapidity gaps in a parton cascade and
investigate the dual connection with hadronic final states. A good description
of observations in e+e- annihilations is obtained by perturbative QCD
calculations in MLLA using previously determined parameters (QCD scale \Lambda
and k_T-cut-off Q_0) and applying the parton hadron duality picture. Further
predictions are derived; especially, for gaps between jets at variable
resolution we predict a strong variation of gap probabilities for small
parameters y_{cut} -> 0 in the transition from jets to hadrons. Large gaps
between partons correspond to large spatial separations of colour charges: a
colour blanching mechanism by soft processes is suggested.
