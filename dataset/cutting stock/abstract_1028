The high-frequency-peaked BL Lac, MS0205.7+3509 was observed twice with
XMM-Newton. Both X-ray spectra are synchrotron-dominated, with mean 0.2--10keV
fluxes of 2.80+/-0.01 and 3.34+/-0.02 E-12 erg/cm^2/s. The X-ray spectra are
well fit by a power-law with absorption above the Galactic value, however no
absorption edges are detected, implying a low metallicity absorber (Z_\sun =
0.04(+0.03)(-0.01)) or an absorber with redshift above one (best-fit z=2.1 for
an absorber with solar abundances). In either case the absorbing column density
must be ~9E21 cm^-2. A new optical spectrum is presented, with a MgII
absorption doublet detected at z=0.351, but no other significant features. The
optical spectrum shows little reddening, implying a low dust to gas ratio in
the absorber. MS0205.7+3509 must therefore be viewed through a high column
density, low-metallicity gas cloud, probably at z=0.351 and associated with the
galaxy that has been shown to be within ~2" of the BL Lac.
