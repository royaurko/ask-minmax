We present a dynamical model for the price evolution of financial assets. The
model is based in a two level structure. In the first stage one finds an
agent-based model that describes the present state of the investors' beliefs,
perspectives or strategies. The dynamics is inspired by a model for describing
predator-prey population evolution: agents change their mind through self- or
mutual interaction, and the decision is adopted on a random basis, with no
direct influence of the price itself. One of the most appealing properties of
such a system is the presence of large oscillations in the number of agents
sharing the same perspective, what may be linked with the existence of bullish
and bearish periods in financial markets. In the second stage one has the
pricing mechanism, which will be driven by the relative population in the
different investors' groups. The price equation will depend on the specific
nature of the species, and thus it may change from one market to the other: we
will firstly present a simple model of excess demand, and subsequently consider
a more elaborate liquidity model. The outcomes of both models are analysed and
compared.
