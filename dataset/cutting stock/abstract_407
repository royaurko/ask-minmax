I discuss two topics of current interest in the study of the spin structure
of the nucleon. First, I discuss whether there is a sum rule for the components
of the nucleon's angular moments. Second, I discuss the measurement of the
nucleon's transversity distribution in light of recent results reported by the
HERMES collaboration at DESY.
