We study the dynamic interactions and structural changes in global financial
indices in the years 1998-2012. We apply a principal component analysis (PCA)
to cross-correlation coefficients of the stock indices. We calculate the
correlations between principal components (PCs) and each asset, known as PC
coefficients. A change in market state is identified as a change in the first
PC coefficients. Some indices do not show significant change of PCs in market
state during crises. The indices exposed to the invested capitals in the stock
markets are at the minimum level of risk. Using the first two PC coefficients,
we identify indices that are similar and more strongly correlated than the
others. We observe that the European indices form a robust group over the
observation period. The dynamics of the individual indices within the group
increase in similarity with time, and the dynamics of indices are more similar
during the crises. Furthermore, the group formation of indices changes position
in two-dimensional spaces due to crises. Finally, after a financial crisis, the
difference of PCs between the European and American indices narrows.
