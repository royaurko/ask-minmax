The Stock Market is a complex self-interacting system, characterized by an
intermittent behaviour. Periods of high activity alternate with periods of
relative calm. In the present work we investigate empirically about the
possibility that the market is in a self-organized critical state (SOC). A
wavelet transform method is used in order to separate high activity periods,
related to the avalanches of sandpile models, from quiescent.
 A statistical analysis of the filtered data show a power law behaviour in the
avalanche size, duration and laminar times. The memory process, implied by the
power law distribution, of the laminar times is not consistent with classical
conservative models for self-organized criticality. We argue that a
``near-SOC'' state or a time dependence in the driver, which may be chaotic,
can explain this behaviour.
