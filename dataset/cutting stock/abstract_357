We have conducted a systematic search for supersoft X-ray sources using the
ROSAT all-sky survey data. With the optical identification of the selected
sources being almost complete, we discuss the statistics of the various source
classes and their observability. Besides supersoft close binary sources this
search also can be used to estimate the number of isolated neutron stars in the
Galaxy, such as those described by Stocke et al. 1995 and Walter et al. 1996.
