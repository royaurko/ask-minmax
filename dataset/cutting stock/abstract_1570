We present a broadband X-ray analysis of a new homogeneous sample of 95
active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the 22-month Swift/BAT all-sky survey. For
this sample we treated jointly the X-ray spectra observed by XMM-Newton and
INTEGRAL missions for the total spectral range of 0.5-250 keV. Photon index
\Gamma, relative reflection R, equivalent width of Fe $K_{\alpha}$ line (EW Fe
$K_{\alpha}$), hydrogen column density $N_{H}$, exponential cut-off energy
$E_{c}$ and intrinsic luminosity $L_{corr}$ are determined for all objects of
the sample. We investigated correlations \Gamma - R, EW Fe $K_{\alpha}$ -
$L_{corr}$, \Gamma - $E_{c}$, EW Fe $K_{\alpha}$ - $N_{H}$. Dependence \Gamma -
R for Seyfert 1 and 2 type of galaxies has been investigated separately. We
found that the relative reflection parameter at low power-law indexes for
Seyfert 2 galaxies is systematically higher than for Seyfert 1 ones. This can
be related to an increasing contribution of the reflected radiation from the
gas-dust torus. Our data show that there exists some anticorrelation between EW
Fe $K_{\alpha}$ and $L_{corr}$, but it is not strong. We have not found
statistically significant deviations from the AGN Unified Model.
