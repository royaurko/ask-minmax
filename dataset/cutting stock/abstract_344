We consider a stochastic volatility stock price model in which the volatility
is a non-centered continuous Gaussian process with arbitrary prescribed mean
and covariance. By exhibiting a Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve expansion for the integrated
variance, and using sharp estimates of the density of a general second-chaos
variable, we derive asymptotics for the stock price density and implied
volatility in these models in the limit of large or small strikes. Our main
result provides explicit expressions for the first three terms in the expansion
of the implied volatility, based on three basic spectral-type statistics of the
Gaussian process: the top eigenvalue of its covariance operator, the
multiplicity of this eigenvalue, and the $L^{2}$ norm of the projection of the
mean function on the top eigenspace. Strategies for using this expansion for
calibration purposes are discussed.
