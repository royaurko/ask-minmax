The coupled nonlinear volatility and option pricing model presented recently
by Ivancevic is investigated, which generates a leverage effect, i.e., stock
volatility is (negatively) correlated to stock returns, and can be regarded as
a coupled nonlinear wave alternative of the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
In this short report, we analytically propose the two-component financial rogue
waves of the coupled nonlinear volatility and option pricing model without an
embedded w-learning. Moreover, we exhibit their dynamical behaviors for chosen
different parameters. The two-component financial rogue wave solutions may be
used to describe the possible physical mechanisms for the rogue wave phenomena
and to further excite the possibility of relative researches and potential
applications of rogue waves in the financial markets and other related fields.
