We present the results of a study of Higgs triplet boson production arising
in the Littlest Higgs, Left-Right Symmetric, and Georgi-Machacek models in the
W^\pm W^\pm, W^\pm Z, W^+ W^-, and Z Z channels at the LHC. We focus on the
"gold-plated" purely leptonic decay modes and consider the irreducible
electroweak, QCD, and t-quark backgrounds, applying a combination of
forward-jet-tagging, central-jet-vetoing, and stringent leptonic cuts to
suppress the backgrounds. We find that, given the constraints on the triplet
vacuum expectation value (vev), considerable luminosity is required to observe
Higgs triplet bosons in vector boson scattering. Observing a Higgs triplet at
the LHC is most promising in the Georgi-Machacek model due to a weaker
constraint on the triplet vev. In this model, we find that a Higgs triplet
boson with a mass of 1.0 (1.5) TeV can be observed at the LHC with an
integrated luminosity as low as 41 (119) fb^{-1} in the W^\pm W^\pm channel and
as low as 171 (474) fb^{-1} in the W^\pm Z channel. Observation of Higgs
triplet bosons in these channels would help identify the underlying theory.
