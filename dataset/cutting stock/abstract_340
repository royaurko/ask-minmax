Neutron spectroscopy is used to investigate the magnetic fluctuations in
Fe_{1+x}Te - a parent compound of chalcogenide superconductors. Incommensurate
"stripe-like" excitations soften with increased interstitial iron
concentration. The energy crossover from incommensurate to stripy fluctuations
defines an apparent hour-glass dispersion. Application of sum rules of neutron
scattering find that the integrated intensity is inconsistent with an S=1
Fe^{2+} ground state and significantly less than S=2 predicted from weak
crystal field arguments pointing towards the Fe^{2+} being in a superposition
of orbital states. The results suggest that a highly anisotropic order competes
with superconductivity in chalcogenide systems.
