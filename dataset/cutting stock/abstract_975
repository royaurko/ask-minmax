This paper introduces constrained mixtures for continuous distributions,
characterized by a mixture of distributions where each distribution has a shape
similar to the base distribution and disjoint domains. This new concept is used
to create generalized asymmetric versions of the Laplace and normal
distributions, which are shown to define exponential families, with known
conjugate priors, and to have maximum likelihood estimates for the original
parameters, with known closed-form expressions. The asymmetric and symmetric
normal distributions are compared in a linear regression example, showing that
the asymmetric version performs at least as well as the symmetric one, and in a
real world time-series problem, where a hidden Markov model is used to fit a
stock index, indicating that the asymmetric version provides higher likelihood
and may learn distribution models over states and transition distributions with
considerably less entropy.
