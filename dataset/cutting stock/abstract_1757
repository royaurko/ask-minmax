This paper investigates the uplink achievable rates of massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) antenna systems in Ricean fading channels, using
maximal-ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers, assuming perfect
and imperfect channel state information (CSI). In contrast to previous relevant
works, the fast fading MIMO channel matrix is assumed to have an arbitrary-rank
deterministic component as well as a Rayleigh-distributed random component. We
derive tractable expressions for the achievable uplink rate in the
large-antenna limit, along with approximating results that hold for any finite
number of antennas. Based on these analytical results, we obtain the scaling
law that the users' transmit power should satisfy, while maintaining a
desirable quality of service. In particular, it is found that regardless of the
Ricean $K$-factor, in the case of perfect CSI, the approximations converge to
the same constant value as the exact results, as the number of base station
antennas, $M$, grows large, while the transmit power of each user can be scaled
down proportionally to $1/M$. If CSI is estimated with uncertainty, the same
result holds true but only when the Ricean $K$-factor is non-zero. Otherwise,
if the channel experiences Rayleigh fading, we can only cut the transmit power
of each user proportionally to $1/\sqrt M$. In addition, we show that with an
increasing Ricean $K$-factor, the uplink rates will converge to fixed values
for both MRC and ZF receivers.
