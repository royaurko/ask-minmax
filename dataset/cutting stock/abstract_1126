There is unique and groundbreaking science to be done with a new generation
of UV spectrographs that cover wavelengths in the "Lyman Ultraviolet" (LUV; 912
- 1216 Ang). There is no astrophysical basis for truncating spectroscopic
wavelength coverage anywhere between the atmospheric cutoff (3100 Ang) and the
Lyman limit (912 Ang); the usual reasons this happens are all technical. The
unique science available in the LUV includes critical problems in astrophysics
ranging from the habitability of exoplanets to the reionization of the IGM.
Crucially, the local Universe (z <= 0.1) is entirely closed to many key
physical diagnostics without access to the LUV. These compelling scientific
problems require overcoming these technical barriers so that future UV
spectrographs can extend coverage to the Lyman limit at 912 Ang.
