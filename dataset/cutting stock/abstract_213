The present article presents a molecular dynamics study of several anomalies
of core-softened systems. It is well known that many core-softened liquids
demonstrate diffusion anomaly. Usual intuition relates the diffusion
coefficient to shear viscosity via Stockes-Einstein relation. However, it can
break down at low temperature. In this respect it is important to see if
viscosity also demonstrates anomalous behavior.
