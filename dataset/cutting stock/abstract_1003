A multidomain two-dimensional periodically poled ferroelectric plate vibrator
is reported for the first time. The theoretical calculations, computer
simulations by the Finite Element Method and experimental data from the lithium
tantalite samples reveal a domain acousto-electric resonance. A polarization
inversion in a y-rotated cut of a ferroelectric chip is firstly done. The
acousto-electric characteristics of the vibrator are calculated and measured.
