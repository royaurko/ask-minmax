We analyze $S^1$ equivariant cohomology from the supergeometrical point of
view. For this purpose we equip the external algebra of given manifold with
equivariant even super(pre)symplectic structure, and show, that its
Poincare-Cartan invariant defines equivariant Euler classes of surfaces. This
allows to derive localization formulae by use of superanalog of Stockes
theorem.
