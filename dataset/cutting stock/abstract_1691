Non-forking is one of the most important notions in modern model theory
capturing the idea of a generic extension of a type (which is a far-reaching
generalization of the concept of a generic point of a variety). To a countable
first-order theory we associate its non-forking spectrum - a function of two
cardinals kappa and lambda giving the supremum of the possible number of types
over a model of size lambda that do not fork over a sub-model of size kappa.
This is a natural generalization of the stability function of a theory. We make
progress towards classifying the non-forking spectra. On the one hand, we show
that the possible values a non-forking spectrum may take are quite limited. On
the other hand, we develop a general technique for constructing theories with a
prescribed non-forking spectrum, thus giving a number of examples. In
particular, we answer negatively a question of Adler whether NIP is equivalent
to bounded non-forking. In addition, we answer a question of Keisler regarding
the number of cuts a linear order may have. Namely, we show that it is possible
that ded(kappa) < ded(kappa)^omega.
