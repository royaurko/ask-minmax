Lead/lag relationships are an important stylized fact at high frequency. Some
assets follow the path of others with a small time lag. We provide indicators
to measure this phenomenon using tick-by-tick data. Strongly asymmetric
cross-correlation functions are empirically observed, especially in the
future/stock case. We confirm the intuition that the most liquid assets (short
intertrade duration, narrow bid/ask spread, small volatility, high turnover)
tend to lead smaller stocks. However, the most correlated stocks are those with
similar levels of liquidity. This lead/lag phenomenon is not constant
throughout the day, it shows an intraday seasonality with changes of behaviour
at very specific times such as the announcement of macroeconomic figures and
the US market opening. These lead/lag relationships become more and more
pronounced as we zoom on significant events. We reach 60% of accuracy when
forecasting the next midquote variation of the lagger using only the past
information of the leader, which is significantly better than using the
information of the lagger only. However, a naive strategy based on market
orders cannot make any profit of this effect because of the bid/ask spread.
