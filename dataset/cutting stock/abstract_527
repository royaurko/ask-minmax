We describe the sample paths of the stochastic field $F = F_t(v,x,q)$ of
aggregate utilities parameterized by Pareto weights $v$ and total cash amounts
$x$ and stocks' quantities $q$ in an economy. We also describe the sample paths
of the stochastic field $G = G_t(u,y,q)$, which is conjugate to $F$ with
respect to the saddle arguments $(v,x)$, and obtain various conjugacy relations
between these stochastic fields. The results of this paper play a key role in
our study of a continuous-time price impact model.
