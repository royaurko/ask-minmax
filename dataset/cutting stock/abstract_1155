Neutron scattering from high-quality YBa2Cu3O6.33 (YBCO6.33) single crystals
with a Tc of 8.4 K shows no evidence of a coexistence of superconductivity with
long-range antiferromagnetic order at this very low, near-critical doping of
p~0.055. However, we find short-range three dimensional spin correlations that
develop at temperatures much higher than Tc. Their intensity increases smoothly
on cooling and shows no anomaly that might signify a Neel transition. The
system remains subcritical with spins correlated over only one and a half unit
cells normal to the planes. At low energies the short-range spin response is
static on the microvolt scale. The excitations out of this ground state give
rise to an overdamped spectrum with a relaxation rate of 3 meV. The transition
to the superconducting state below Tc has no effect on the spin correlations.
The elastic interplanar spin response extends over a length that grows weakly
but fails to diverge as doping is moved towards the superconducting critical
point. Any antiferromagnetic critical point likely lies outside the
superconducting dome. The observations suggest that conversion from Neel
long-range order to a spin glass texture is a prerequisite to formation of
paired superconducting charges. We show that while pc =0.052 is a critical
doping for superconducting pairing, it is not for spin order.
