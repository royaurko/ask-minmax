The predictions of the S&P 500 returns made in 2007 have been tested and the
underlying models amended. The period between 2003 and 2008 should be described
by the dependence of the S&P 500 stock market index on real GDP because the
population pyramid was highly inaccurate. The 2008 trough and 2009 rally are
well predicted by the original model, however. The rally will end in
March/April 2010 and the S&P 500 level will be decreasing into 2011. This
prediction should validate the model.
