We propose an infrared cut-off for the holographic density which incorporates
among others a constant term, that produces the effect of the cosmological
constant, improving the results of previously considered holographic models
based on local quantities. The inclusion of constant term is interpreted as a
natural first approximation for the infrared cutoff which is associated with
the vacuum energy, and the additional terms guarantee an appropriate
evolutionary scenario that fits the astrophysical observations. Cosmological
constraints on the model have been studied using the observational data.
