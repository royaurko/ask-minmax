The main aim of this work is to incorporate selected findings from
behavioural finance into a Heterogeneous Agent Model using the Brock and Hommes
(1998) framework. Behavioural patterns are injected into an asset pricing
framework through the so-called `Break Point Date', which allows us to examine
their direct impact. In particular, we analyse the dynamics of the model around
the behavioural break. Price behaviour of 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average
constituents covering five particularly turbulent U.S. stock market periods
reveals interesting pattern in this aspect. To replicate it, we apply numerical
analysis using the Heterogeneous Agent Model extended with the selected
findings from behavioural finance: herding, overconfidence, and market
sentiment. We show that these behavioural breaks can be well modelled via the
Heterogeneous Agent Model framework and they extend the original model
considerably. Various modifications lead to significantly different results and
model with behavioural breaks is also able to partially replicate price
behaviour found in the data during turbulent stock market periods.
