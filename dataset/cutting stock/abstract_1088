Data mining is the task of discovering interesting patterns from large
amounts of data. There are many data mining tasks, such as classification,
clustering, association rule mining, and sequential pattern mining. Sequential
pattern mining finds sets of data items that occur together frequently in some
sequences. Sequential pattern mining, which extracts frequent subsequences from
a sequence database, has attracted a great deal of interest during the recent
data mining research because it is the basis of many applications, such as: web
user analysis, stock trend prediction, DNA sequence analysis, finding language
or linguistic patterns from natural language texts, and using the history of
symptoms to predict certain kind of disease. The diversity of the applications
may not be possible to apply a single sequential pattern model to all these
problems. Each application may require a unique model and solution. A number of
research projects were established in recent years to develop meaningful
sequential pattern models and efficient algorithms for mining these patterns.
In this paper, we theoretically provided a brief overview three types of
sequential patterns model.
