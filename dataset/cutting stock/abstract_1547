A recent study on structural properties of regular and context-free languages
has greatly promoted our basic understandings of the complex behaviors of those
languages. We continue the study to examine how regular languages behave when
they need to cut numerous infinite languages. A particular interest rests on a
situation in which a regular language needs to "dissect" a given infinite
language into two subsets of infinite size. Every context-free language is
dissected by carefully chosen regular languages (or it is REG-dissectible). In
a larger picture, we show that constantly-growing languages and semi-linear
languages are REG-dissectible. Under certain natural conditions, complements
and finite intersections of semi-linear languages also become REG-dissectible.
Restricted to bounded languages, the intersections of finitely many
context-free languages and, more surprisingly, the entire Boolean hierarchy
over bounded context-free languages are REG-dissectible. As an immediate
application of the REG-dissectibility, we show another structural property, in
which an appropriate bounded context-free language can "separate with infinite
margins" two given nested infinite bounded context-free languages.
