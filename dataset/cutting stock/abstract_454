We give a new proof of the Dalang-Morton-Willinger theorem, relating the
no-arbitrage condition in stochastic securities market models to the existence
of an equivalent martingale measure with bounded density for a $d$-dimensional
stochastic sequence $(S_n)_{n=0}^N$ of stock prices. Roughly speaking, the
proof is reduced to the assertion that under the no-arbitrage condition for N=1
and $S\in L^1$ there exists a strictly positive linear fucntional on $L^1$,
which is bounded from above on a special subset of the subspace $K\subset L^1$
of investor's gains.
