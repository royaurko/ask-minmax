Active Galactic Nuclei are considered as possible sites of cosmic ray
acceleration and some of them have been observed as high energy gamma ray
emitters (Blazars). There naturally comes an appealing idea that the
acceleration of the highest energy cosmic rays in the AGNs has a signature in
the form of gamma ray emission and high energy neutrino emission through the
collisions of very high energy protons with soft photons. Moreover it is often
said that electrons cannot reach enough energy through Fermi acceleration to
account for the highest energy photons observed with ground Cerenkov
telescopes. In this paper, we discussed these points and show that the fast
variability of the flares recently observed rules out the assumption of a Fermi
acceleration of protons. We show that Fermi acceleration of electrons is enough
to account for the gamma spectra, their shape, cut-off and their variability.
Moreover the spectral break is nicely explained by invoking an gamma-ray
photosphere. Nevertheless we give estimates of the high energy cosmic ray
generation in AGNs and of the resultant neutrino flux, that turns out to be
very sensitive to the spectral index of the proton distribution.
