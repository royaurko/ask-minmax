A limit order book provides information on available limit order prices and
their volumes. Based on these quantities, we give an empirical result on the
relationship between the bid-ask liquidity balance and trade sign and we show
that liquidity balance on best bid/best ask is quite informative for predicting
the future market order's direction. Moreover, we define price jump as a sell
(buy) market order arrival which is executed at a price which is smaller
(larger) than the best bid (best ask) price at the moment just after the
precedent market order arrival. Features are then extracted related to limit
order volumes, limit order price gaps, market order information and limit order
event information. Logistic regression is applied to predict the price jump
from the limit order book's feature. LASSO logistic regression is introduced to
help us make variable selection from which we are capable to highlight the
importance of different features in predicting the future price jump. In order
to get rid of the intraday data seasonality, the analysis is based on two
separated datasets: morning dataset and afternoon dataset. Based on an analysis
on forty largest French stocks of CAC40, we find that trade sign and market
order size as well as the liquidity on the best bid (best ask) are consistently
informative for predicting the incoming price jump.
