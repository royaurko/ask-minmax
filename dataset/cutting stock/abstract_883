In this paper, we use the generalized Hurst exponent approach to study the
multi- scaling behavior of different financial time series. We show that this
approach is robust and powerful in detecting different types of multiscaling.
We observe a puzzling phenomenon where an apparent increase in multifractality
is measured in time series generated from shuffled returns, where all
time-correlations are destroyed, while the return distributions are conserved.
This effect is robust and it is reproduced in several real financial data
including stock market indices, exchange rates and interest rates. In order to
understand the origin of this effect we investigate different simulated time
series by means of the Markov switching multifractal (MSM) model,
autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) processes with
stable innovations, fractional Brownian motion and Levy flights. Overall we
conclude that the multifractality observed in financial time series is mainly a
consequence of the characteristic fat-tailed distribution of the returns and
time-correlations have the effect to decrease the measured multifractality.
