To generate small neutrino masses radiatively, the Zee-model introduces two
Higgs doublets and one weak-singlet charged Higgs boson to its Higgs sector.
  From analyzing the renormalization group equations, we determine the
possibile range of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson ($h$) mass and the Higgs
boson self-couplings as a function of the cut-off scale beyond which either
some of the coupling constants are strong enough to invalidate the perturbative
analysis or the stability of the electroweak vacuum is no longer guaranteed.
Using the results obtained from the above analysis, we find that the singlet
charged Higgs boson can significantly modify the partial decay width of $h \to
\gamma \gamma$ via radiative corrections, and its collider phenomenology can
also be drastically different from that of the charged Higgs bosons in the
usual two-Higgs-doublet models.
