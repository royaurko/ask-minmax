This paper proposes a new fBm (fractional Brownian motion)
interpolation/reconstruction method from partially known samples based on CS
(Compressive Sampling). Since 1/f property implies power law decay of the fBm
spectrum, the fBm signals should be sparse in frequency domain. This property
motivates the adoption of CS in the development of the reconstruction method.
Hurst parameter H that occurs in the power law determines the sparsity level,
therefore the CS reconstruction quality of an fBm signal for a given number of
known subsamples will depend on H. However, the proposed method does not
require the information of H to reconstruct the fBm signal from its partial
samples. The method employs DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) as the sparsity
basis and a random matrix derived from known samples positions as the
projection basis. Simulated fBm signals with various values of H are used to
show the relationship between the Hurst parameter and the reconstruction
quality. Additionally, US-DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average) stock index
monthly values time-series are also used to show the applicability of the
proposed method to reconstruct a real-world data.
