In a given market, financial covariances capture the intra-stock correlations
and can be used to address statistically the bulk nature of the market as a
complex system. We provide a statistical analysis of three SP500 covariances
with evidence for raw tail distributions. We study the stability of these tails
against reshuffling for the SP500 data and show that the covariance with the
strongest tails is robust, with a spectral density in remarkable agreement with
random Levy matrix theory. We study the inverse participation ratio for the
three covariances. The strong localization observed at both ends of the
spectral density is analogous to the localization exhibited in the random Levy
matrix ensemble. We discuss two competitive mechanisms responsible for the
occurrence of an extensive and delocalized eigenvalue at the edge of the
spectrum: (a) the Levy character of the entries of the correlation matrix and
(b) a sort of off-diagonal order induced by underlying inter-stock
correlations. (b) can be destroyed by reshuffling, while (a) cannot. We show
that the stocks with the largest scattering are the least susceptible to
correlations, and likely candidates for the localized states. We introduce a
simple model for price fluctuations which captures behavior of the SP500
covariances. It may be of importance for assets diversification.
