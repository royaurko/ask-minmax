We derive a mesoscopic description of the behavior of a simple financial
market where the agents can create their own portfolio between two investment
alternatives: a stock and a bond. The model is derived starting from the
Levy-Levy-Solomon microscopic model (Econ. Lett., 45, (1994), 103--111) using
the methods of kinetic theory and consists of a linear Boltzmann equation for
the wealth distribution of the agents coupled with an equation for the price of
the stock. From this model, under a suitable scaling, we derive a Fokker-Planck
equation and show that the equation admits a self-similar lognormal behavior.
Several numerical examples are also reported to validate our analysis.
