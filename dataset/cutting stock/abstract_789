A computational approach to describe the energy relaxation of a
high-frequency vibrational mode in a fluctuating heterogeneous environment is
outlined. Extending previous work [H. Fujisaki, Y. Zhang, and J.E. Straub, J.
Chem. Phys. {\bf 124}, 144910 (2006)], second-order time-dependent perturbation
theory is employed which includes the fluctuations of the parameters in the
Hamiltonian within the vibrational adiabatic approximation. This means that the
time-dependent vibrational frequencies along an MD trajectory are obtained via
a partial geometry optimization of the solute with fixed solvent and a
subsequent normal mode calculation. Adopting the amide I mode of
N-methylacetamide in heavy water as a test problem, it is shown that the
inclusion of dynamic fluctuations may significantly change the vibrational
energy relaxation. In particular, it is found that relaxation occurs in two
phases, because for short times ($\lesssim$ 200 fs) the spectral density
appears continuous due to the frequency-time uncertainty relation, while at
longer times the discrete nature of the bath becomes apparent. Considering the
excellent agreement between theory and experiment, it is speculated if this
behavior can explain the experimentally obtained biphasic relaxation the amide
I mode of N-methylacetamide.
