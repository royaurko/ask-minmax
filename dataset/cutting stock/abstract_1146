A mathematical model of coastal forest growth is proposed to describe and
test the effects of salinity and inundation in the long-term growth performance
and carbon sequestration of monospecific mangrove ($Rhizophora\; mucronata$)
plantation in the Philippines. We used allometry in expressing the mangrove
growth equation, and stochasticity in scheduling population-level events that
drive the development of the mangrove forest. Analysis of the model unveils an
index, $\xi$, that could be used in assessing a strategy which could promote
optimum carbon-stock accumulation in the long run. If initial plot is
configured such that $\xi > 1$, the $R.\; mucronata$ plantations could achieve
an above-ground biomass per hectare (AGB) of $1000\mbox{ t/ha}$, or about
$500\mbox{ tC/ha}$, in approximately $200$ to $250$ years post planting. In
contrast, the current restoration strategy implemented in the Philippines
corresponds to the case that $\xi <1$. Consequently, the restored mangroves
could not achieve stable growth without the support of costly human assistance
such as frequent replanting. Rather, through that typical strategy and in the
absence of assistance, the AGB decreases with time until all trees die.
Mangrove restoration could therefore be planned strategically to mitigate
costly and wasteful implementation. The proposed index $\xi$ thus serves as an
early indicator for the progress or demise of restored mangroves.
