We describe the discovery circumstances and photometric properties of 2000
EB173, now one of the brightest trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with opposition
magnitude m_R=18.9 and also one of the largest Plutinos, found with the
drift-scanning camera of the QUEST Collaboration, attached to the 1-m Schmidt
telescope of the National Observatory of Venezuela. We measure B-V = 0.99 +/-
0.14 and V-R = 0.57 +/- 0.05, a red color observed for many fainter TNOs. At
our magnitude limit m_R = 20.1 +/- 0.20, our single detection reveals a sky
density of 0.015 (+0.034, -0.012) TNOs per deg^2 (the error bars are 68%
confidence limits), consistent with fainter surveys showing a cumulative number
proportional to 10^0.5m_R. Assuming an inclination distribution of TNOs with
FWHM exceeding 30 deg, it is likely that one hundred to several hundred objects
brighter than m_R=20.1 remain to be discovered.
