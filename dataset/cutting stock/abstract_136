This paper investigates the effects of the "uptick rule" (a short selling
regulation formally known as rule 10a-1) by means of a simple stock market
model, based on the ARED (adaptive rational equilibrium dynamics) modeling
framework, where heterogeneous and adaptive beliefs on the future prices of a
risky asset were first shown to be responsible for endogenous price
fluctuations.
  The dynamics of stock prices generated by the model, with and without the
uptick-rule restriction, are analyzed by pairing the classical fundamental
prediction with beliefs based on both linear and nonlinear technical analyses.
The comparison shows a reduction of downward price movements of undervalued
shares when the short selling restriction is imposed. This gives evidence that
the uptick rule meets its intended objective. However, the effects of the short
selling regulation fade when the intensity of choice to switch trading
strategies is high. The analysis suggests possible side effects of the
regulation on price dynamics.
