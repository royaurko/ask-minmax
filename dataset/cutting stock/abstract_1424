The possibility of detecting the signature of a nearly invisible charged wino
($\CH$) decaying into a soft pion and the LSP($\LSP$), predicted by the Anomaly
Mediated Symmetry Breaking model, via the process
$e^+e^-\r\gamma{\tilde\chi}^{+}{\tilde\chi}^{-}$ at the Next Linear Collider
has been explored. Using the recently, proposed bounds on slepton and wino
masses derived from the condition of stability of the electroweak symmetry
breaking vacuum and employing some standared kinematical cuts to supress the
background, we find that almost the whole of the allowed parameter space with
the slepton mass less than 1 TeV, can be probed at $\sqrt{s}$ 500 GeV.
Determination of the slepton and the chargino masses from this signal is a
distinct possiblity. Any violation of the above mass bound will suggest that
the standard vacuum is unstable and we are living in a false vacuum.
