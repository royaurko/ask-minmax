We present updated and complete radio, optical and X-ray data for BL Lacs in
the Einstein Medium Sensitivity Survey (EMSS). The complete "M91" sample first
presented in Morris et al. is updated to include 26 BL Lacs in total and we
define a new, virtually complete sample consisting of 41 EMSS BL Lacs (the
"D40" sample). New high signal-to-noise, arcsecond-resolution VLA observations
are also presented for eleven EMSS BL Lacs, completing VLA observations of the
M91 sample. The addition of four new objects, as well as updated X-ray flux and
redshift information, has increased the v/v_max value for the M91 sample to
0.399\pm0.057; and v/v_max = 0.427\pm0.045 for the newly defined D40 sample. In
conjunction with other studies of X-ray-selected BL Lac (XBL) samples, these
results solidify negative evolution for XBLs, especially for more extreme
high-energy-peaked BL Lacs. The observed v/v_max, spectral and radio properties
of XBLs are completely consistent with being the beamed population of
low-luminosity, FR-1 radio galaxies. However, our VLA observations do confirm
that XBLs are too core-dominated to be consistent with a beamed population of
FR-1s seen at intermediate angles, as suggested by the unified model, if XBLs
have moderate outflow velocities (gamma approx 5).
