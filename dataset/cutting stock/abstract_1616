We report isovector form factors and low moments of isovector structure
functions of nucleon from the coarse RIKEN-BNL-Columbia (RBC) and UKQCD joint
dynamical (2+1)-flavor domain-wall fermions (DWF) ensembles. The lattice cut
off is estimated at (a^{-1}=1.7) GeV. The lattice volume is as large as 2.7 fm
across. We carefully optimize the nucleon source/sink separation in time to
about 1.4 fm. Unexpectedly large finite-size effect in the axial charge is
found. The effect scales with a single variable, the product (m_\pi L) of the
pion mass (m_\pi) and lattice spatial linear extent (L), and sets in at around
(m_\pi L = 5). We also discuss momentum-transfer dependence of the vector,
induced tensor, axial-vector and induced pesudo-scalar form factors.
  From structure functions, fully non-perturbatively renormalized iso-vector
quark momentum fraction, (< x >_{u-d}), helicity fraction, (< x >_{\Delta u -
\Delta d}), and transversity, (< 1 >_{\delta u - \delta d}), are reported, as
well as an unrenormalized twist-3 coefficient, (d_1). The ratio of the momentum
to helicity fractions, (< x >_{u-d}/< x >_{\Delta u - \Delta d}), does not
depend on light quark mass and agree well with the experiment. Their respective
absolute values, fully renormalized, shows interesting trending toward the
respective experimental values at the lightest light quark mass.
