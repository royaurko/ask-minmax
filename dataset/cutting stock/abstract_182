Stock markets are efficient in the weak form in the sense that no significant
autocorrelations can be identified in the returns. However, the microscopic
mechanisms are unclear. We aim at understanding the impacts of order flows on
the weak-form efficiency through computational experiments based on an
empirical order-driven model. Three possible determinants embedded in the model
are investigated, including the tail heaviness of relative prices of the placed
orders characterized by the tail index $\alpha_x$, the degree of long memory in
relative prices quantified by its Hurst index $H_x$, and the strength of long
memory in order direction depicted by $H_x$. It is found that the degree of
autocorrelations in returns (quantified by its Hurst index $H_r$) is negatively
correlated with $\alpha_x$ and $H_x$ and positively correlated with $H_s$. In
addition, the values of $\alpha_x$ and $H_x$ have negligible impacts on $H_r$,
whereas $H_s$ exhibits a dominating impact on $H_r$. Our results suggest that
stock markets are complex adaptive systems and self-organize to a critical
state in which the returns are not correlated.
