In this paper, we pay our attention to geometric parameters and their
applications in economics and finance. We discuss the multiplicative models in
which a geometric mean and a geometric standard deviation are more natural than
arithmetic ones. We give two examples from Warsaw Stock Exchange in 1995--2009
and from a bid of 52-week treasury bills in 1992--2009 in Poland as an
illustrative example. For distributions having applications in finance and
insurance we give their multiplicative parameters as well as their estimations.
We consider, among others, heavy-tailed distributions such as lognormal and
Pareto distribution, applied to modelling of large losses.
