We analyze the memory in volatility by studying volatility return intervals,
defined as the time between two consecutive fluctuations larger than a given
threshold, in time periods following stock market crashes. Such an aftercrash
period is characterized by the Omori law, which describes the decay in the rate
of aftershocks of a given size with time t by a power law with exponent close
to 1. A shock followed by such a power law decay in the rate is here called
Omori process. Studying several aftercrash time series, we show that the Omori
law holds not only after significant market crashes, but also after
``intermediate shocks''. Moreover, we find self-similar features in the
volatility. Specifically, within the aftercrash period there are smaller shocks
that themselves constitute Omori processes on smaller scales, similar to the
Omori process after the large crash. We call these smaller shocks subcrashes,
which are followed by their own aftershocks. We also find similar Omori
processes after intermediate crashes in time regimes without a large market
crash. By appropriate detrending we remove the influence of the crashes and
subcrashes from the data, and find that this procedure significantly reduces
the memory in the records. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that
the memory in volatility is related to Omori processes present on different
time scales.
