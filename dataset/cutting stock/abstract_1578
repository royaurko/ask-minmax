We define a stack $G$-ZipFlag$^{\mu}$ above the Pink-Wedhorn-Ziegler stack of
$G$-zips, fibered in flag varieties, which is a group-theoretical
generalization of the flag space introduced in [EvdG09] for Siegel-type Shimura
varieties. For each Ekedahl-Oort stratum of a general Hodge-type Shimura
variety, we construct a Hecke-equivariant section of the Hodge line bundle
which cuts out the smaller strata in its closure. We call these sections
"group-theoretical Hasse invariants." Using them as our main tool, we are able
to: (1) Attach Galois representations to many automorphic representations with
non-degenerate limit of discrete series archimedean component, generalizing
([DS74], [Tay91], [Jar97], [Gol14], [GN14]) (2) Attach pseudo-representations
to torsion classes in the coherent cohomology of many Hodge-type Shimura
varieties, generalizing [ERX] (3) Prove that all Ekedahl-Oort strata are
affine, both for a general compact Shimura variety of Hodge-type and for the
minimal compactification of a Siegel-type Shimura variety, thereby proving a
conjecture of Oort. (4) Generalize (part of) Serre's letter to Tate on mod $p$
forms [Ser96] to general Hodge-type Shimura varieties, refining (parts of)
previous results in some PEL cases ([Ghi04], [Red03]).
