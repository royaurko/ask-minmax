Market liquidity plays a vital role in the field of market micro-structure,
because it is the vigor of the financial market. This paper uses a variable
called convexity to measure the potential liquidity provided by order-book.
Based on the high-frequency data of each stock included in the SSE (Shanghai
Stock Exchange) 50 Index for the year 2011, we report several statistical
properties of convexity and analyze the association between convexity and some
other important variables (bid/ask-depth, spread, volatility, return.)
