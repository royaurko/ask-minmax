This paper studies the electroweak production of all possible four fermion
states in e+ e- collisions. Since the methods employed to evaluate the complete
matrix elements and phase space are very general, all four fermion final states
in which the charged particles are detected can be considered. Also all kinds
of experimental cuts can be imposed. With the help of the constructed event
generator a large number of illustrative results is obtained, which show the
relevance of backgrounds to a number of signals. For LEP 200 the W-pair signal
and its background are discussed, for higher energies also Z-pair and single W
and Z signals and backgrounds are presented.
