We report a general technique to study a given experimental time series with
superstatistics. Crucial for the applicability of the superstatistics concept
is the existence of a parameter $\beta$ that fluctuates on a large time scale
as compared to the other time scales of the complex system under consideration.
The proposed method extracts the main superstatistical parameters out of a
given data set and examines the validity of the superstatistical model
assumptions. We test the method thoroughly with surrogate data sets. Then the
applicability of the superstatistical approach is illustrated using real
experimental data. We study two examples, velocity time series measured in
turbulent Taylor-Couette flows and time series of log returns of the closing
prices of some stock market indices.
