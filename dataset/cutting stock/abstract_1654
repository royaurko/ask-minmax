We embed Safe Recursion on Notation (SRN) into Light Affine Logic by Levels
(LALL), derived from the logic L4. LALL is an intuitionistic deductive system,
with a polynomial time cut elimination strategy.
  The embedding allows to represent every term t of SRN as a family of proof
nets |t|^l in LALL. Every proof net |t|^l in the family simulates t on
arguments whose bit length is bounded by the integer l. The embedding is based
on two crucial features. One is the recursive type in LALL that encodes Scott
binary numerals, i.e. Scott words, as proof nets. Scott words represent the
arguments of t in place of the more standard Church binary numerals. Also, the
embedding exploits the "fuzzy" borders of paragraph boxes that LALL inherits
from L4 to "freely" duplicate the arguments, especially the safe ones, of t.
Finally, the type of |t|^l depends on the number of composition and recursion
schemes used to define t, namely the structural complexity of t. Moreover, the
size of |t|^l is a polynomial in l, whose degree depends on the structural
complexity of t.
  So, this work makes closer both the predicative recursive theoretic
principles SRN relies on, and the proof theoretic one, called /stratification/,
at the base of Light Linear Logic.
