We study a variant of the Cont-Bouchaud model which utilizes the perco lation
approach of multi-agent simulations of the stock market fluctuations. Here,
instead of considering the relative price change as the difference of the total
demand and total supply, we consider the relative price change to be
proportiona l to the ``relative'' difference of demand and supply (the ratio of
the difference in total demand and total supply to the sum of the total demand
and total supply). We then study the probability distribution of the price
changes.
