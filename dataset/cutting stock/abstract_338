Information services are an inherent part of our everyday life. Especially
since ubiquitous cities are being developed all over the world their number is
increasing even faster. They aim at facilitating the production of information
and the access to the needed information and are supposed to make life easier.
Until today many different evaluation models (among others, TAM, TAM 2, TAM 3,
UTAUT and MATH) have been developed to measure the quality and acceptance of
these services. Still, they only consider subareas of the whole concept that
represents an information service. As a holistic and comprehensive approach,
the ISE Model studies five dimensions that influence adoption, use, impact and
diffusion of the information service: information service quality, information
user, information acceptance, information environment and time. All these
aspects have a great impact on the final grading and of the success (or
failure) of the service. Our model combines approaches, which study subjective
impressions of users (e.g., the perceived service quality), and
user-independent, more objective approaches (e.g., the degree of gamification
of a system). Furthermore, we adopt results of network economics, especially
the Success breeds success-principle.
