We address the question of how stock prices respond to changes in demand. We
quantify the relations between price change $G$ over a time interval $\Delta t$
and two different measures of demand fluctuations: (a) $\Phi$, defined as the
difference between the number of buyer-initiated and seller-initiated trades,
and (b) $\Omega$, defined as the difference in number of shares traded in buyer
and seller initiated trades. We find that the conditional expectations $<G
>_{\Omega}$ and $<G >_{\Phi}$ of price change for a given $\Omega$ or $\Phi$
are both concave. We find that large price fluctuations occur when demand is
very small --- a fact which is reminiscent of large fluctuations that occur at
critical points in spin systems, where the divergent nature of the response
function leads to large fluctuations.
