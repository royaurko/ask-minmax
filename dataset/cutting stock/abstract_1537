We discuss the relation between correlation functions of twist-two large spin
operators and expectation values of Wilson loops along light-like trajectories.
After presenting some heuristic field theoretical arguments suggesting this
relation, we compute the divergent part of the correlator in the limit of large
't Hooft coupling and large spins, using a semi-classical worldsheet which
asymptotically looks like a GKP rotating string. We show this diverges as
expected from the expectation value of a null Wilson loop, namely, as
$(\ln{\mu^{-2}})^ 2$, $\mu$ being a cut-off of the theory.
