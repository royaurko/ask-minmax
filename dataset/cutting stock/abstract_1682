The discovery that the number of physically consistent string vacua is on the
order of 10^500 has prompted several statistical studies of string
phenomenology. Contained here is one such study that focuses on the Weakly
Coupled Free Fermionic Heterotic String (WCFFHS) formalism. Presented are
systematic extensions of the well-known NAHE (Nanopoulos, Antoniadis, Hagelin,
Ellis) set of basis vectors, which have been shown to produce
phenomenologically realistic models. Statistics related to the number of
U(1)'s, gauge group factors, non-Abelian singlets, ST SUSYs, as well as the
gauge groups themselve are discussed for the full range of models produced as
well as models containing GUT groups only. Prior results of other large-scale
investigations are compared with these regarding the aforementioned quantities.
Statistical coupling between the gauge groups and the number of ST SUSYs is
also discussed, and it was found that for order-3 extensions there are more
models with enhanced ST SUSY when there is an exceptional group present. Also
discussed are some three-generation GUT models found in the data sets. These
models are unique because they come from basis vectors which still have a
geometric interpretation -- there are no "rank-cuts" in these models.
