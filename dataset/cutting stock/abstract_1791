Gauge fields have a natural metric interpretation in terms of horizontal
distance. The latest, also called Carnot-Caratheodory or subriemannian
distance, is by definition the length of the shortest horizontal path between
points, that is to say the shortest path whose tangent vector is everywhere
horizontal with respect to the gauge connection. In noncommutative geometry all
the metric information is encoded within the Dirac operator D. In the classical
case, i.e. commutative, Connes's distance formula allows to extract from D the
geodesic distance on a riemannian spin manifold. In the case of a gauge theory
with a gauge field A, the geometry of the associated U(n)-vector bundle is
described by the covariant Dirac operator D+A. What is the distance encoded
within this operator ? It was expected that the noncommutative geometry
distance d defined by a covariant Dirac operator was intimately linked to the
Carnot-Caratheodory distance dh defined by A. In this paper we precise this
link, showing that the equality of d and dh strongly depends on the holonomy of
the connection. Quite interestingly we exhibit an elementary example, based on
a 2 torus, in which the noncommutative distance has a very simple expression
and simultaneously avoids the main drawbacks of the riemannian metric (no
discontinuity of the derivative of the distance function at the cut-locus) and
of the subriemannian one (memory of the structure of the fiber).
