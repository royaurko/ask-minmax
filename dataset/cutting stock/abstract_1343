We suggest a method for statistical tests which does not suffer from a
posteriori manipulations with tested samples (e.g. cuts optimization) and does
not require a somewhat obscure procedure of the penalty estimate. The idea of
the method is to hide the real sample (before it has been studied) among a
large number of artificial samples, drawn from a random distribution expressing
the null hypothesis, and then to search for it as the one demonstrating the
strongest hypothesized effect. The statistical significance of the effect in
this approach is the inverse of the maximal number of random samples at which
the search was successful. We have applied the method to revisit the problem of
correlation between the arrival directions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays and
BL Lac objects. No significant correlation was found.
