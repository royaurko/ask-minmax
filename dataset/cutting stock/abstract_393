We present a theoretical and experimental analysis of the transverse monopole
mode of a fast rotating Bose-Einstein condensate. The condensate's rotation
frequency is similar to the trapping frequency and the effective confinement is
only ensured by a weak quartic potential. We show that the non-harmonic
character of the potential has a clear influence on the mode frequency, thus
making the monopole mode a precise tool for the investigation of the fast
rotation regime.
