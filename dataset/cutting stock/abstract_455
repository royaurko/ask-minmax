We report neutron diffuse scattering measurements on a single crystal of
68%Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-32%PbTiO3. Strong diffuse scattering is observed at low
temperatures. An external field applied along the [001] direction affects the
diffuse scattering in the (HK0) plane significantly, suggesting a
redistribution occurs between polar nanoregions of different polarizations
perpendicular to the field. By contrast, the [001] field has no effect on the
diffuse scattering in the (HOL) and (0KL) zones.
