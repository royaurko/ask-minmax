In this paper, we proposed a new form of type-2 fuzzy data points(T2FDPs)
that is normal type-2 data points(NT2FDPs). These brand-new forms of data were
defined by using the definition of normal type-2 triangular fuzzy
number(NT2TFN). Then, we applied fuzzification(alpha-cut) and type-reduction
processes towards NT2FDPs after they had been redefined based on the situation
of NT2FDPs. Furthermore, we redefine the defuzzification definition along with
the new definitions of fuzzification process and type-reduction method to
obtain crisp type-2 fuzzy solution data points. For all these processes from
the defining the NT2FDPs to defuzzification of NT2FDPs, we demonstrate through
curve representation by using the rational B-spline curve function as the
example form modeling these NT2FDPs.
