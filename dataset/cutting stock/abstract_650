We introduce and study a simple model of a limit order-driven market. Traders
in this model can either trade at the market price or place a limit order, i.e.
an instruction to buy (sell) a certain amount of the stock if its price falls
below (raises above) a predefined level. The choice between these two options
is purely random (there are no strategies involved), and the execution price of
a limit order is determined simply by offsetting the most recent market price
by a random amount. Numerical simulations of this model revealed that despite
such minimalistic rules the price pattern generated by the model has such
realistic features as ``fat'' tails of the price fluctuations distribution,
characterized by a crossover between two power law exponents, long range
correlations of the volatility, and a non-trivial Hurst exponent of the price
signal.
