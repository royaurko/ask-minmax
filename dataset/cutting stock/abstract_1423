We show that the usual vector meson dominance method does not apply directly
to the mixing of a color-octet vector boson (color-octet technirho) with the
gluon because of gauge invariance. We propose a gauge invariant method where
one works in a physical basis with mass eigenstate fields. As a result, we show
that the physical technirho does not couple to two gluons, contrary to the
general belief. Consequences for the production of a pair of color-octet,
isosinglet technipions (technietas) at Fermilab is analysed by means of a
simulation of the signal and background, including kinematical cuts. We find
that the signal is too small to be observed.
