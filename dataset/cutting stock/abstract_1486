SAMURAI is a tool for the automated numerical evaluation of one-loop
corrections to any scattering amplitudes within the dimensional-regularization
scheme. It is based on the decomposition of the integrand according to the
OPP-approach, extended to accommodate an implementation of the generalized
d-dimensional unitarity-cuts technique, and uses a polynomial interpolation
exploiting the Discrete Fourier Transform. SAMURAI can process integrands
written either as numerator of Feynman diagrams or as product of tree-level
amplitudes. We discuss some applications, among which the 6- and 8-photon
scattering in QED, and the 6-quark scattering in QCD. SAMURAI has been
implemented as a Fortran90 library, publicly available, and it could be a
useful module for the systematic evaluation of the virtual corrections oriented
towards automating next-to-leading order calculations relevant for the LHC
phenomenology.
