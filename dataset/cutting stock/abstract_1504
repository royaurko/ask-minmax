Recently, it was suggested that a large class of non-renormalizable theories
may need no UV completion. By analogy with gravity where classical black holes
are expected to be created in high-energy scatterings, it is conjectured that
similar classical solutions, so-called classicalons, should occur. In this way
the theory protects itself against non-unitarity, for instead of probing small
distances at high energies one enters a classical regime. An effective theory
of Goldstone bosons provides and example in which the size of classicalons
grows with energy, and the high energy scattering is cut-off by small momenta,
inversely proportional to the classicalon size. In this note we offer an
alternative, path integral discussion of this important result.
