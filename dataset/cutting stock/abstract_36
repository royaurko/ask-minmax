We conduct an empirical study using the quantile-based correlation function
to uncover the temporal dependencies in financial time series. The study uses
intraday data for the S\&P 500 stocks from the New York Stock Exchange. After
establishing an empirical overview we compare the quantile-based correlation
function to stochastic processes from the GARCH family and find striking
differences. This motivates us to propose the quantile-based correlation
function as a powerful tool to assess the agreements between stochastic
processes and empirical data.
