The detection of ultra high energetic cosmic neutrinos provides a unique
means to search for extragalactic sources that accelerate particles to extreme
energies. It allows to study the neutrino component of the GZK cut-off in the
cosmic ray energy spectrum and the search for neutrinos beyond this limit. Due
to low expected flux and small interaction cross-section of neutrinos with
matter large experimental set-ups are needed to conduct this type of research.
Acoustic detection of cosmic rays may provide a means for the detection of
ultra-high energetic neutrinos. Using relative low absorption of sound in
water, large experimental set-ups in the deep sea are possible that are able to
detect these most rare events, but it requires highly sensitive hydrophones as
the thermo-acoustic pulse originating from a particle shower in water has a
typical amplitude as low as a mPa. It has been shown in characterisation
measurements that the fibre optic hydrophone technology as designed and
realised at TNO provides the required sensitivity. Noise measurements and pulse
reconstruction have been conducted that show that the hydrophone is suited as a
particle detector.
