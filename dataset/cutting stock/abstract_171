We study the statistical regularities of opening call auction using the
ultra-high-frequency data of 22 liquid stocks traded on the Shenzhen Stock
Exchange in 2003. The distribution of the relative price, defined as the
relative difference between the order price in opening call auction and the
closing price of last trading day, is asymmetric and that the distribution
displays a sharp peak at zero relative price and a relatively wide peak at
negative relative price. The detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) method is
adopted to investigate the long-term memory of relative order prices. We
further study the statistical regularities of order sizes in opening call
auction, and observe a phenomenon of number preference, known as order size
clustering. The probability density function (PDF) of order sizes could be well
fitted by a $q$-Gamma function, and the long-term memory also exists in order
sizes. In addition, both the average volume and the average number of orders
decrease exponentially with the price level away from the best bid or ask price
level in the limit-order book (LOB) established immediately after the opening
call auction, and a price clustering phenomenon is observed.
