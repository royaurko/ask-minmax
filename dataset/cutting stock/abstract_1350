It is proposed a new approach for estimating the composition of cosmic rays.
It is found that the zenith angle distributions and muon components of EAS for
energies E>10^19 eV and E>4.10^19 eV differ from each other. It is shown that
the cosmic rays above E>4.10^19 eV is heavier than the cosmic rays at energy E~
10^19 eV. According to our estimation the SUGAR array detected 8 showers above
10^20 eV. It is concluded that no sign of Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cut off
in the spectrum of cosmic rays and all cosmic rays are galactic.
