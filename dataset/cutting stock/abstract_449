The understanding of complex social or economic systems is an important
scientific challenge. Here we present a comprehensive study of the Spanish
Stock Exchange showing that most financial firms trading in that market are
characterized by a resulting strategy and can be classified in groups of firms
with different specialization. Few large firms overally act as trending firms
whereas many heterogeneous firm act as reversing firms. The herding properties
of these two groups are markedly different and consistently observed over a
four-year period of trading.
