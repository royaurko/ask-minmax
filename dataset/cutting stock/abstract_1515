The production of prompt photons at high transverse momentum in proton-proton
collisions (p-p) is a useful tool to study perturbative Quantum-Chromo-Dynamics
(pQCD). In particular, they yield valuable information about parton
distribution functions in the proton. The experimental measurement of prompt
photons is a difficult task due to the large background of decay photons from
neutral mesons, mainly pi0. We present a full simulation and reconstruction
study of prompt photons identification in p-p at sqrt(s) = 14 TeV in the ALICE
electromagnetic calorimeter EMCal, giving details on the methods developed to
separate them from decay photons with the help of shower-shape and isolation
cuts. We present Monte Carlo predictions for signal and background. The method
used to extract the final isolated corrected cross-section is presented and the
calculation of various experimental corrections is outlined.
