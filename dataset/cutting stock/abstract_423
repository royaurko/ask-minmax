In this article we develop an explicit formula for pricing European options
when the underlying stock price follows a non-linear stochastic differential
delay equation (sdde). We believe that the proposed model is sufficiently
flexible to fit real market data, and is yet simple enough to allow for a
closed-form representation of the option price. Furthermore, the model
maintains the no-arbitrage property and the completeness of the market. The
derivation of the option-pricing formula is based on an equivalent martingale
measure.
