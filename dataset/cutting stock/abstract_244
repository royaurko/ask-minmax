We present elastic neutron scattering results at high magnetic fields for
Mg-doped CuGeO$_{3}$. For low magnesium concentrations, where a spin-Peierls
phase is present, we find an enhancement of the long range antiferromagnetic
order in the structural incommensurate phase induced by a high magnetic field.
In the incommensurate phase, the N\'eel temperature increases with field
leading to a gain in the magnetic Bragg peak intensity at low temperatures. We
also find that the magnetic Bragg peaks remain commensurate even though the
structure is incommensurate at high magnetic fields due to the formation of
solitons. We interpret these results in terms of the solitons formed at
high-magnetic fields effectively acting as doped impurities. Our results point
to a strongly disordered ground state with the the antiferromagnetic order
localized around impurity sites.
