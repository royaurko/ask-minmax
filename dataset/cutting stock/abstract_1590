We use a series of statistical techniques to compare the clustering of
samples of IRAS galaxies selected on the basis of their far-infrared emission
temperature, to see whether a temperature-dependent effect, such as might be
produced by interaction-induced star formation, could be responsible for the
increase in clustering strength with redshift in the QDOT redshift survey that
has been reported by several contributors. The temperature-luminosity relation for
IRAS galaxies means that warm and cool samples drawn from a flux-limited sample
like QDOT will sample quite different volumes of space. To overcome this
problem, and to distinguish truly temperature-dependent results from those
depending directly on the volume of space sampled, we consider a pair of
samples of warmer and cooler galaxies with matched redshift distributions, as
well as pairs of samples selected using a simple temperature cut. ...(abstract
shortened).... We conclude that that there may be a temperature-dependent
component to the observed increase in the clustering strength of QDOT galaxies
with redshift, but that it is less important than a sampling effect, which
reflects the local cosmography, rather than the physical properties of the
galaxies and their environment. We discuss the implications of this work for
the use of IRAS galaxies as probes of large-scale structure and for models
accounting for their far-infrared emission by interaction-induced star
formation.
