In this paper we will try to assess the multifractality displayed by the
high-frequency returns of Madrid's Stock Exchange IBEX35 index. A Multifractal
Detrended Fluctuation Analysis shows that this index has a wide singularity
spectrum which is most likely caused by its long memory. Our findings also show
that this long-memory can be considered as the superposition of a
high-frequency component (related to the daily cycles of arrival of information
to the market), over a slowly-varying component that reverberates for long
periods of time and which shows no apparent relation with human economic
cycles. This later component is therefore postulated to be endogenous to
market's dynamics and to be also the most probable source of some of the
stylized facts commonly associated with financial time series.
