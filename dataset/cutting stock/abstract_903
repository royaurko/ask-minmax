We perform an extensive empirical analysis of scaling properties of equity
returns, suggesting that financial data show time varying multifractal
properties. This is obtained by comparing empirical observations of the
weighted generalised Hurst exponent (wGHE) with time series simulated via
Multifractal Random Walk (MRW) by Bacry \textit{et al.} [\textit{E.Bacry,
J.Delour and J.Muzy, Phys.Rev.E \,{\bf 64} 026103, 2001}]. While dynamical wGHE
computed on synthetic MRW series is consistent with a scenario where
multifractality is constant over time, fluctuations in the dynamical wGHE
observed in empirical data are not in agreement with a MRW with constant
intermittency parameter. We test these hypotheses of constant multifractality
considering different specifications of MRW model with fatter tails: in all
cases considered, although the thickness of the tails accounts for most of
anomalous fluctuations of multifractality, still cannot fully explain the
observed fluctuations.
