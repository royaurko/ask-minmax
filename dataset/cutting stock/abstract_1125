The idea of embedding and transmitting information within the fluctuations of
the magnetic moments of spins (spin waves) has been recently proposed and
experimentally tested. The coherence of spin waves, which describes how well
defined these excitations are, is of course vital to this process, and themost
significant factor that affects the spin-wave coherence is temperature. Here we
present neutron inelastic scattering measurements of the full threedimensional
spin-wave dispersion in BiFeO3, which is one of the most promising functional
multiferroic material, for temperatures from 5K to 700K. Despite the presence
of strong electromagnetic coupling, the magnetic excitations behave like
conventional magnons over all parts of the Brillouin zone. At low temperature
the spin-waves are well-defined coherent modes, described by a classical model
for a G-type antiferromagnet. A spin-wave velocity softening is already present
at room temperature, and more pronounced damping occurs as the magnetic
ordering temperature TN \sim 640K is approached. In addition, a strong
hybridization of the Fe 3d and O 2p states is found to modify the distribution
of the spin-wave spectral weight significantly, which implies that the spins
are not restricted to the Fe atomic sites as previously believed.
