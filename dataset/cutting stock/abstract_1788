Exotic dark matter and dark energy together seem to dominate in the Universe.
Supersymmetry naturally provides a candidate for the dark matter constituents
via the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The most important process for
directly detecting dark matter is the LSP-nucleus elastic scattering by
measuring the energy of the recoiling nucleus. In the present work we explore a
novel process, which has definite experimental advantages, that is the
detection of the dark matter constituents by observing the low energy
ionization electrons. These electrons, which are produced during the
LSP-nucleus collision, may be observed separately or in coincidence with the
recoiling nuclei.
  We develop the formalism and apply it in calculating the ratio of the
ionization rate to the nuclear recoil rate in a variety of atoms including
Ne-20, Ar-40, Ge-76, Kr-78 and Xe-132 employing realistic Hartree-Fock electron
wave functions.
  The obtained ratios are essentially independent of all parameters of
supersymmetry except the neutralino mass, but they crucially depend on the
electron energy cut off. These ratios per electron tend to increase with the
atomic number and can be as high as 10 per cent. Based on our results it is
both interesting and realistic to detect the LSP by measuring the ionization
electrons following the-LSP nuclear collisions.
