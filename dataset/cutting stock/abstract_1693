The prompt emission of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) is usually well described by
the Band function: two power-laws joined smoothly at a given break energy. In
addition to the Band component, a few bursts (GRB941017, GRB090510, GRB090902B
and GRB090926A) show clear evidence for a distinct high-energy spectral
component, which in some cases evolves independently from the prompt keV
component and is well described by a power-law (PL), sometimes with a cut-off
energy; this component is found to have long duration, even longer than the
burst itself for all the four bursts. Here we report the observation of an
anomalous short duration high energy component in GRB980923. GRB980923 is one
of the brightest Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) observed by BATSE. Its light curve is
characterized by a rapid variability phase lasting ~ 40 s, followed by a smooth
emission tail lasting ~ 400 s. A detailed joint analysis of BATSE (LAD and SD)
and EGRET TASC data of GRB980923 reveles the presence of an anomalous keV to
MeV component in the spectrum that evolves independently from the prompt keV
one. This component is well described by a PL with a spectral index of -1.44
and lasts only ~ 2 s; it represents one of the three clearly separated spectral
components identified in GRB980923, the other two being the keV prompt
emission, well described by the Band function and the tail, well fit by a
Smoothly Broken Power Law (SBPL).
