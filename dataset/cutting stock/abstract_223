The LLS stock market model is a model of heterogeneous quasi-rational
investors operating in a complex environment about which they have incomplete
information. We review the main features of this model and several of its
extensions. We study the effects of investor heterogeneity and show that
predation, competition, or symbiosis may occur between different investor
populations. The dynamics of the LLS model lead to the empirically observed
Pareto wealth distribution. Many properties observed in actual markets appear
as natural consequences of the LLS dynamics: truncated Levy distribution of
short-term returns, excess volatility, a return autocorrelation "U-shape"
pattern, and a positive correlation between volume and absolute returns.
