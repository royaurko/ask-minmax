Starting from the Kubo formula we calculate the shear viscosity in hot phi**4
theory nonperturbatively by resumming ladders with a real-time version of the
Bethe-Salpeter equation at finite temperature. In the weak coupling limit, the
generalized Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem is shown to decouple the
Bethe-Salpeter equations for the different real-time components of the 4-point
function. The resulting scalar integral equation is identical with the one
obtained by Jeon using diagrammatic ``cutting rules'' in the Imaginary Time
Formalism.
