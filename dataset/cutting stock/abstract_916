We analyze hadrochemical freeze-out in central Pb+Pb collisions at CERN SPS
and LHC energies. Employing the UrQMD hybrid transport model we study the
effects of the final hadron/resonance expansion phase on the hadron
multiplicities established at hadronization. The bulk meson yields freeze out
directly at hadronization whereas the baryon-antibaryon sector is subject to
significant alterations, due to annihilation and regeneration processes. We
quantify the latter changes by survival factors for each species which are
applied to modify the statistical model predictions for the data. The modified
SM analysis recovers the hadronization points, which coincide with the recent
lattice QCD predictions of the parton-hadron transition line at finite
baryochemical potential.
