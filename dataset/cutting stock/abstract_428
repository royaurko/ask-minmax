The self-organizing methods were used for the investigation of financial
market. As an example we consider data time-series of Dow Jones index for the
years 2002-2003 (R. Mantegna, cond-mat/9802256). In order to reveal new
structures in stock market behavior of the companies drawing up Dow Jones index
we apply SOM (Self-Organizing Maps) and GMDH (Group Method of Data Handling)
algorithms. Using SOM techniques we obtain SOM-maps that establish a new
relationship in market structure. Analysis of the obtained clusters was made by
GMDH.
