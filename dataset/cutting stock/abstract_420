We present a new and shorter proof of Stocking's result that any strongly
irreducible Heegaard surface of a closed orientable triangulated 3-manifold is
isotopic to an almost normal surface. We also re-prove a result of Jaco and
Rubinstein on normal spheres. Both proofs are based on the "reduction"
technique introduced by the contributor.
