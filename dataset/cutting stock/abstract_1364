We discuss the effective metric produced in superfluid 3He-A by such
topological objects as radial disgyration and monopole. In relativistic
theories these metrics are similar to that of the local string and global
monopole correspondingly. But in 3He-A they have the negative angle deficit,
which corresponds to the negative mass of the topological objects. The
effective gravitational constant G in superfluid 3He-A, derived from the
comparison with relativistic theories, is inversely proportional to the square
of the gap amplitude Delta, which plays the part of the Planck energy cut-off.
G depends on temperature and increases with T, which corresponds to the vacuum
screening of the Newton's constant.
