The time evolution of evanescent modes in Pendry's perfect lens proposal for
ideally lossless and homogeneous, left-handed materials is analyzed. We show
that time development of sub-wavelength resolution exhibits universal features,
independent of model details. This is due to the unavoidable near-degeneracy of
surface electromagnetic modes in the deep sub-wavelength region. By means of a
mechanical analog, it is shown that an intrinsic time scale (missed in
stationary studies) has to be associated with any desired lateral resolution. A
time-dependent cut-off length emerges, removing the problem of divergences
claimed to invalidate Pendry's proposal.
