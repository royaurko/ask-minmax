Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) are characterized by a high
productivity of plankton associated with large commercial fisheries, thus
playing key biological and socio-economical roles. The aim of this work is to
make a comparative study of these four upwelling systems focussing on their
surface stirring, using the Finite Size Lyapunov Exponents (FSLEs), and their
biological activity, based on satellite data. First, the spatial distribution
of horizontal mixing is analysed from time averages and from probability
density functions of FSLEs. Then we studied the temporal variability of surface
stirring focussing on the annual and seasonal cycle. There is a global negative
correlation between surface horizontal mixing and chlorophyll standing stocks
over the four areas. To try to better understand this inverse relationship, we
consider the vertical dimension by looking at the Ekman-transport and vertical
velocities. We suggest the possibility of a changing response of the
phytoplankton to sub/mesoscale turbulence, from a negative effect in the very
productive coastal areas to a positive one in the open ocean.
