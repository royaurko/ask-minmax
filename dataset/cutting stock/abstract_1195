We investigate the class of locally compact lacunary hyperbolic groups. We
prove that if a locally compact compactly generated group G admits one
asymptotic cone that is a real tree and whose natural transitive isometric
action is focal, then G must be a focal hyperbolic group. As an application, we
characterize connected Lie groups and linear algebraic groups over an
ultrametric local field of characteristic zero having cut-points in one
asymptotic cone.
  We prove several results for locally compact lacunary hyperbolic groups, and
extend the characterization of finitely generated lacunary hyperbolic groups to
the setting of locally compact groups. We moreover answer a question of
Olshanskii, Osin and Sapir about subgroups of lacunary hyperbolic groups.
