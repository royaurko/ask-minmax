We study tick-by-tick financial returns belonging to the FTSE MIB index of
the Italian Stock Exchange (Borsa Italiana). We find that non-stationarities
detected in other markets in the past are still there. Moreover, scaling
properties reported in the previous literature for other high-frequency
financial data are approximately valid as well. Finally, we propose a simple
method for describing non-stationary returns, based on a non-homogeneous normal
compound Poisson process and we test this model against the empirical findings.
It turns out that the model can reproduce several stylized facts of
high-frequency financial time series.
