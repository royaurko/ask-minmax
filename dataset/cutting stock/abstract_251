In this paper, we present a simple stock market model (the market game) which
incorporates, as ab initio dynamics delayed majority dynamics, according to
which agents (with heterogeneous strategies and price expectations) are
rewarded if their actions at time t are the actions of the majority of agents
at time t+1. We observe that for a range of parameter settings, minority
dynamics are dynamically induced in this game, despite the fact that they are
not introduced ab initio. Central to the emergence of minority dynamics is the
introduction of the notion of price expectations for the agents. This leads to
the possibility of an agent not participating in the market for some time
steps. One consequence of the induced minority dynamics is an effective
reduction in market volatility. We also discuss the phase structure and
qualitative behavior of the market game for the entire parameter space.
