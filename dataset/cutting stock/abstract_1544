The renormalized energy-momentum tensor of vacuum has been deeply explored
many years ago. The main result of these studies was that such a tensor should
satisfy the conservation laws which reflects the covariance of the theory in
the presence of loop corrections. In view of this general result we address two
important questions, namely how to implement the momentum cut-off in a
covariant way and whether this general result holds in the theory with
Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking. In the last case some new interesting details
arise and although the calculations are more involved we show that the final
result satisfies the conservation laws.
