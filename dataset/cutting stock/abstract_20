We consider the robust utility maximization using a static holding in
derivatives and a dynamic holding in the stock. There is no fixed model for the
price of the stock but we consider a set of probability measures (models) which
are not necessarily dominated by a fixed probability measure. By assuming that
the set of physical probability measures is convex and weakly compact, we
obtain the duality result and the existence of an optimizer.
