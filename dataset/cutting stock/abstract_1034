We describe the application of the
locally-self-consistent-multiple-scattering (LSMS)[1] method to amorphous
alloys. The LSMS algorithm is optimized for the Intel XP/S-150, a
multiple-instruction-multiple-data parallel computer with 1024 nodes and 2
compute processors per node. The electron density at each site is determined by
solving the multiple scattering equation for atoms within a specified distance
of the atom under consideration. Because this method is carried out in real
space it is ideal for treating amorphous alloys. We have adapted the code to
the calculation of the electronic properties of amorphous alloys. In these
calculations we determine the potentials in the atomic sphere approximation
self consistently at each site, unlike previous calculations[2] where we
determined the potentials self consistently at an average site. With these
self-consistent potentials, we then calculate electronic properties of various
amorphous alloy systems. We present calculated total electronic densities of
states for amorphous Ni$_{80}$P$_{20}$ and Ni$_{40}$Pd$_{40}$P$_{20}$ with 300
atoms in a supercell.
