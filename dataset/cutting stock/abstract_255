We study theoretical and empirical aspects of the mean exit time of financial
time series. The theoretical modeling is done within the framework of
continuous time random walk. We empirically verify that the mean exit time
follows a quadratic scaling law and it has associated a pre-factor which is
specific to the analyzed stock. We perform a series of statistical tests to
determine which kind of correlation are responsible for this specificity. The
main contribution is associated with the autocorrelation property of stock
returns. We introduce and solve analytically both a two-state and a three-state
Markov chain models. The analytical results obtained with the two-state Markov
chain model allows us to obtain a data collapse of the 20 measured MET profiles
in a single master curve.
