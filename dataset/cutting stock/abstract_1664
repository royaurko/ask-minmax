This paper studies the way in which confinement leads to chiral symmetry
breaking (CSB) through a gap equation. We argue that entropic effects cut off
infrared singularities in the standard confining effective propagator $1/p^4$,
which should be replaced by $1/(p^2+m^2)^2$ for a finite mass $m\sim K_F/M(0)$
[$M(0)$ is the zero-momentum value of the running quark mass]. Extension of an
old calculation of the contributor yields a specific estimate for $m$. This cutoff
propagator shows semi-quantitatively two critical properties of confinement: 1)
a negative contribution to the confining potential coming from entropic forces;
2) an infrared cutoff required by gauge invariance and CSB itself. Entropic
effects lead to a proliferation of pion branches and a $\bar{q}q$ condensate,
and contribute a negative term $\sim -K_F/M(0)$ to the effective pion
Hamiltonian allowing for a massless pion in the presence of positive kinetic
energy and string energy. The resulting gap equation leads to a well-behaved
running constituent quark mass $M(p^2)$ with $M^2(0)\approx K_F/\pi$. We
include one-gluon terms to get the correct renormalization-group ultraviolet
behavior, with the improvement that the prefactor (related to $<\bar{q}q>$) can
be calculated from the confining solution. We discuss an integrability
condition that guarantees the absence of IR singularities at $m=0$ in Minkowski
space through use of a principal-part propagator.
