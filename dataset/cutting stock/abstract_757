A method based on wavelet transform and genetic programming is proposed for
characterizing and modeling variations at multiple scales in non-stationary
time series. The cyclic variations, extracted by wavelets and smoothened by
cubic splines, are well captured by genetic programming in the form of
dynamical equations. For the purpose of illustration, we analyze two different
non-stationary financial time series, S&P CNX Nifty closing index of the
National Stock Exchange (India) and Dow Jones industrial average closing values
through Haar, Daubechies-4 and continuous Morlet wavelets for studying the
character of fluctuations at different scales, before modeling the cyclic
behavior through GP. Cyclic variations emerge at intermediate time scales and
the corresponding dynamical equations reveal characteristic behavior at
different scales.
