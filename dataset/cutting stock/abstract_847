Our society has been computerised and globalised due to emergence and spread
of information and communication technology (ICT). This enables us to
investigate our own socio-economic systems based on large amounts of data on
human activities. In this article, methods of treating complexity arising from
a vast amount of data, and linking data from different sources, are discussed.
Furthermore, several examples are given of studies into the applications of
econoinformatics for the Japanese stock exchange, foreign exchange markets,
domestic hotel booking data and international flight booking data are shown. It
is the main message that spatio-temporal information is a key element to
synthesise data from different data sources.
