In this paper, we employ cut and paste scheme to construct thin-shell
wormhole of a charged black string with $f(R)$ terms. We consider $f(R)$ model
as an exotic matter source at wormhole throat. The stability of the respective
solutions are analyzed under radial perturbations in the context of
$R+{\delta}R^2$ model. It is concluded that both stable as well as unstable
solutions do exist for different values of $\delta$. In the limit
$\delta{\rightarrow}0$, all our results reduce to general relativity.
