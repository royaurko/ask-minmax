We discuss the rationale for the energy cuts used in the previous study of
directional correlation of the five highest energy cosmic ray events with
compact, radio quasars. We check the consistency of the next three most
energetic events which just missed those cuts, with the correlation hypothesis.
Agreement between expected and observed properties of these events is good.
