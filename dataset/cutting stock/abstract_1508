We investigate the relevance of the metric and of the geometry in
five-dimensional models of hadrons. Generically, the metric does not affect
strongly the results and even flat space agrees reasonably well with the data.
Nevertheless, we observe a preference for a decreasing warp factor, for example
AdS space. The Sakai-Sugimoto model reduces to one of these models and the
level of agreement is similar to the one of flat space. We also consider the
discrete version of the five-dimensional models, obtained by dimensional
deconstruction. We find that essentially all the relevant features of
"holographic" models of QCD can be reproduced with a simple 3-site model
describing only the states below the cut-off of the theory.
